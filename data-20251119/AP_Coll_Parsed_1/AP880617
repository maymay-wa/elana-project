abbie hoffman who gained fame 20 
years ago at protests at the democratic national convention in 
chicago plans to be host of a nostalgic ball sunday to raise money 
for antinuclear advertising 
the 60s revival ball at the pearl street nightclub here 
will feature such entertainment as a musician playing the sound of 
a nuclear disaster on his harmonica and free copies of hoffmans 
steal this book for the first 10 partygoers who come with their 
fathers admission is 10 
hoffman said he has become fond of northampton since a local 
jury cleared him in april 1987 of disorderly conduct and 
trespassing charges stemming from his arrest at a demonstration 
against cia recruiting at the nearby university of massachusetts 
hoffman and 14 other protesters including amy carter daughter 
of former president jimmy carter had argued that they broke minor 
trespassing laws to prevent the graver harm of spy agency 
recruiting 
im not really big on nostalgia but i do about 20 benefits a 
year because raising money on our side of the fence isnt that 
easy hoffman said were not like the ptl where they can turn 
around and raise 12 million by auctioning off costa rica 
the northampton benefit was organized by al giordano the moving 
force behind a november ballot referendum aimed at closing 
massachusetts two nuclear power plants by outlawing nuclear waste 
the money raised by the ball will go to the antinuclear media 
fund to buy ad time on behalf of antinuclear initiatives 
nationwide 
filmmaker douglas trumball whose specialeffects credits 
include 2001 a space odyssey close encounters of the third 
kind and et will help design the antinuclear ads

women who had suffered up to 11 consecutive 
miscarriages because of an immune system abnormality were able to 
give birth after being injected with blood cells from their 
husbands a scientist says 
the injections made the immune system ignore fetal cells rather 
than attacking them and terminating the pregnancy said 
immunologist james mowbray of st marys hospital in london 
the experimental treatment produces a birth on the next try at 
pregnancy in 85 percent to 90 percent of cases said mowbray whose 
clinic has treated 1700 women including 400 last year 
in the united states the treatment might help some 50000 
women he said 
several centers in the united states and sweden have also found 
success in treating the immune system abnormality other experts 
said 
mowbray was interviewed by telephone this week before speaking 
thursday at a symposium near portland maine of the american 
society for the immunology of reproduction 
about 1 percent of women who try to have a baby experience 
recurring pregnancy loss which means three or more consecutive 
miscarriages said symposium cochairman neal rote director of the 
graduate immunology program at the university of southern maine in 
portland 
he estimated that 40 percent to 50 percent of the women with 
recurring pregnancy losses have some kind of immune system problem 
of this group maybe 75 percent have the problem that can be 
treated by the blood cell injections he said 
the normal job of the immune system is to attack foreign 
invaders such as bacteria that can cause disease in response to 
pregnancy the immune system normally produces proteins that make 
it ignore fetal cells called trophoblasts which form tissue that 
links the fetus to the mother 
but in some women the immune system fails to produce those 
proteins it attacks the trophoblasts ending the pregnancy 
mowbray said 
injections of the husbands white blood cells stimulate the 
immune system to create the protective proteins mowbray said 
in one test of the treatment women who got such injections gave 
birth about 80 percent of the time on their next try at pregnancy 
while women who got injections of their own cells for comparison 
purposes showed less than half that rate mowbray said 
the treatment normally requires only one injection but some 
women require a booster he said 
no evidence of side effects has appeared in the babies he said 
mowbray said his success rate depends in part on carefully 
excluding women with genetic or other problems that cannot be 
helped by the treatment 
the success rate probably cannot exceed 90 percent for the age 
group his clinic treats he said with an average age of 37 about 
10 percent of pregnancies will abort spontaneously anyway he said 
carolyn coulam medical director of the center for reproduction 
and transplantation immunology in indianapolis said mowbrays 
success rate is plausible 
other groups have reported rates of about 70 percent with a 
variety of treatments such as injecting blood cells from somebody 
other than the husband or using vaginal suppositories with a 
donors seminal fluid from which sperm have been removed she said 
her group uses the latter method with about 70 percent success 
she said 
the immune system problem also is treated at the university of 
utah and at jefferson medical college in philadelphia she said 
she and rote also said a national registry of children born 
after immunesystem therapy should be established to gather 
information on the safety of the procedure 
with an experimental treatment being offered to basically 
healthy people youve got to be very secure youre not causing 
any harm rote said

hungarys new communist party chief hopes 
president reagans new appreciation of soviet glasnost will extend 
to other east bloc countries as well one of the hungarian leaders 
top aides says 
karoly grosz a reformist picked to his job at a dramatic party 
conference last month arrives here july 20 for the first us 
visit by a hungarian leader in 42 years 
miklos nemeth of the 11member ruling politburo said in an 
interview thursday that his boss hopes to outline to reagan and to 
the two presidential hopefuls his countrys experiment in political 
openness and marketoriented socialism 
nemeth said the new party leader is primarily seeking to tell 
americans that his country has undertaken political as well as 
economic reforms 
hungary burdened with the highest per capita indebtedness in 
eastern europe undertook the reforms one year ago to reduce its 
18 billion debt and 18 percent annual inflation 
nemeth said the political changes adopted at the party 
conference are still relatively unknown these include increased 
democracy and openness which will be manifested in much broader 
parliamentary activity he said 
his visit provides a good opportunity to make this known here 
if were able to succeed in this respect then the visit will be a 
success said nemeth who was attending a conference of the us 
information agency here 
nemeth is the first eastern european delegate to attend the 
annual usia forum of international opinion leaders 
grosz served as prime minister the no 2 job in his country 
until the conference which brought outspoken reformers such as 
nemeth into the ruling elite and ousted aging party leader janos 
kadar 76 eight members of the politburo were dropped in the 
reshuffle 
nemeth said grosz hopes to strengthen economic ties with the 
united states the hungarian parliament is considering laws that 
would liberalize foreign investment and permit more joint ventures 
in hungary enabling more business with the united states he said 
were beginning to build a marketoriented socialism he 
said this has never happened in a socialist country it is a new 
experiment 
asked whether hungary wants other eastern european countries to 
adopt this system nemeth said each government is responsible 
for its own model although we would be very glad if other 
countries learn from our experience as we study other countries 
experiences 
he said soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs more flexible economic 
policies are a very promising development 
nemeth has meetings scheduled with michel camdessus director of 
the international monetary fund and barber conable the head of 
the world bank 
hungary owes some money to the imf but 40 percent of its debt 
is to japanese banks last year hungary also received about 580 
million from the west german federal bank 
nemeth said he had met for a roundtable discussion wednesday 
with state department experts on eastern europe and described to 
them his countrys reforms 
nemeth an economist attended harvard university for one year 
on a visitors program he speaks english although he preferred to 
use an interpreter during the interview saying he was tired and 
didnt want to make mistakes

city officials reached an agreement thursday with 
federal housing officials to desegregate about 17000 public 
housing units in 69 developments operated by the boston housing 
authority 
this agreement is designed to ensure fair and equal access for 
public housing throughout boston said mayor raymond flynn it 
is intended to keep decisionmaking at the local level and away 
from a federal court 
the agreement between flynn the bha and the federal department 
of housing and urban development follows an october 1987 hud report 
that found a pattern of keeping white housing projects white and 
isolating blacks and other minorities in projects where their own 
race predominated 
the lawyers committee for civil rights which is handling the 
suit for the naacp contends some of the victims of discrimination 
deserve monetary damages as well as immediate housing said 
attorney alan rom 
however much may have been remedied by that plan theres 
still plenty left over rom said 
the flynn administration has been pressured by a lawsuit by the 
national association for the advancement of colored people to stop 
discriminatory housing practices 
a key feature of the agreement is for the housing authority to 
identify people who have been victims of discriminatory public 
housing practices and put them near the top of the priority housing 
list behind only emergency cases involving families on the verge of 
homelessness 
anyone passed over because of race or national origin since oct 
1 1983 would be considered such a victim 
flynn emphasized that no current resident of public housing will 
be forced to move as a result of the agreement 
bostons is the largest housing authority in the country to 
enter into an agreement to voluntarily comply with fair public 
housing practices according to robert laplante huds regional 
director for fair housing 
this is a document that is as fair as it gets said doris 
bunte administrator of the boston housing authority 
once discrimination victims have been identified and placed in 
housing the city will invoke a new tenant placement system 
subject to later approval by hud 
under the new system the bha would ask the roughly 13500 
applicants on the city waiting list to choose between a citywide 
list of available apartments or a sitespecific development list 
citywide applicants would receive faster placement under the 
new system if hud rejects that system the bha would have to use a 
huddeveloped plan in which there an applicant could not specify a 
housing development

the us army hired highranking nazi secret 
police officers stormtroopers propagandists and collaborators 
after world war ii and protected them behind an official cloak of 
secrecy according to a harshly critical justice department report 
the report says us military intelligence employed the nazis to 
provide information and monitor soviet activity in occupied nations 
after the war protecting them from prosecution for war crimes 
including torturing and murdering civilians 
the report focuses at length on the us armys 
counterintelligence corps hiring of convicted nazi war criminal 
robert jan verbelen and its continued employment of him even after 
he admitted having been a member of a nazi security unit that was 
declared a criminal organization 
the justice department listed 13 individuals in addition to 
verbelen but did not identify any of the others by name the 
information was based on official documents and interviews with 
former cic agents but the department said the information remains 
classified under us policies to protect the identity of 
intelligence operatives 
prepared by the criminal divisions office of special 
investigations the 92page report said verbelen was paid by cic 
for 10 years from 1946 to 1957 for intelligence work in austria 
even though he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to death for 
the murders of 101 people in his native belgium 
the report said verbelen now 77 and living in austria 
manipulated the cic into protecting him from being brought to 
justice for his crimes 
he was able to accomplish this as a direct result of the 
cics reliance upon former nazi and nazi collaborators in its 
immediate postwar european operations the report said 
it said the cic initially relied on the information verbelen 
gave about himself including the name he gave peter mayer but in 
1950 he informed the agency his name was really herbert schwab 
describing himself as a devoted nazi party member since the 
mid1930s and a member of a nazi security unit that had been 
declared a criminal organization the report said 
despite this change in identity and life history the cic 
made no attempt to verify the information verbelen supplied about 
himself and it continued to employ him the report said 
neal sher special investigations director who conducted the 
study at the request of the antidefamation league of bnai brith 
said the report already has been given to the belgian and austrian 
governments 
the report said the army intelligence group discovered 
verbelens true identity when the cia asked for information about 
him in 1956 
sher at a news conference declined to say how long the cia had 
known verbelens true identity or to give any other information 
about cia involvement with verbelen 
sher said justice department investigators interviewed verbelen 
himself in the summer of 1985 and found him unrepentant he 
thinks he has nothing to be ashamed of sher said 
he said the investigation was not related to any modern 
intelligencegathering efforts and was not meant to be judgmental 
but he said some conclusions cry out 
the report said the cic followed a policy that the end 
justifies the means 
it is difficult to understand why the cic did not make a 
greater effort to check those persons backgrounds particularly as 
it had ready access to nazi party ss and german military files 
the report said 
the cics logic must also be questioned in its apparent 
assumption that a fascist would be more loyal to a democratic 
government than to a communist one the report said 
it said in verbelens case it would have been impossible for 
the agency to determine his value as an informant since it made no 
effort to find out who he really was 
among the agents and informants hired by cic in austria 
according to the report were 
a former gestapo official sentenced to two years in prison for 
high treason 
a prewar fascist leader whom cic protected from arrest even 
though he had been accused of being deputy commander of a unit that 
burned villages and murdered civilians 
the chief of security of an unidentified nazi puppet state who 
headed an arms plant that used slave labor 
a man accused of torturing several people including two 
priests 
two former ss officers who are now believed to have 
manufactured information so they could work as informants 
an austrian police official who used his job to protect nazis 
from arrest 
a former ss and gestapo officer who it was later found was 
selling the same information to the british and french while all 
the time being primarily loyal to the soviets 
edward dennis head of the departments criminal division said 
the investigation was done as thoroughly as possible regardless 
of who that will embarrass or make uncomfortable

the agriculture department has opened up land 
set aside under a massive federal conservation program so that 
farmers may harvest hay in areas were livestock feed has been 
shriveled by drought and hot weather 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng said thursday that all of 
north dakota and parts of a dozen other droughtstricken states are 
eligible for haying on land held by farmers in the conservation 
reserve program or crp 
haying will be allowed for a 30day period in counties found 
to be suffering from a severe drought that has adversely affected 
forage crops lyng said livestock grazing of this acreage is 
not authorized 
in addition to the counties approved for haying lyng said that 
additional designations will be made countybycounty by the 
departments agricultural stabilization and conservation service 
once counties are approved interested producers who are 
enrolled in crp will be notified and may apply at county offices 
within 10 days for permission to cut hay from their land he said 
jerry newcomb head of the agencys emergency operations and 
livestock programs said farmers in the counties announced on 
thursday can begin applying for the haying program as soon as 
county offices receive operating procedures in the next day or so 
newcomb said he had no estimates of how many acres are eligible 
for haying in the designated counties 
the crp was authorized in the 1985 farm law to take up to 45 
million acres of highly erodible land from crop production for 10 
years the land must be planted to protective grass or trees in 
return farmers get annual rental payments from the government 
currently averaging 45 to 50 per acre a year 
farmers in feedshort drought areas have been seeking permission 
to harvest hay from the crp land and also to graze livestock on it 
lyng however said grazing was not approved 
participants in the program who opt to cut hay from crp land 
will have their next annual payments reduced 25 percent on the 
acreage harvested 
emergency haying and grazing had already been approved in more 
than 1000 counties in 20 states for land taken from crop 
production under annual commodity programs that land involves 
socalled acreage conservation reserve and conservation use 
land and is not included in the longterm crp operation 
according to usdas announcement further county eligibility for 
haying priviliges on crp land will be made based on the fact that 
the country has been approved for the emergency haying and 
grazing of land in the acreage conservation reserve and the 
conservation use categories 
further the agency said a drought severity index reported 
weekly by usda and the commerce departments national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration will be use to determine a countys 
haying eligibility 
in addition to all of north dakotas 53 counties the following 
counties were designated for crp haying privileges

free cars and lavish office furnishings for 
executives of the failed federal land bank in jackson miss are 
drawing sharp criticism from farm belt senators 
if even a fraction of what weve heard about today is true 
some type of punitive action will have to be taken against those 
who are responsible said sen david boren dokla after a 
report from regulators thursday 
they said 133 automobiles were found at the jackson institution 
one of 12 land banks in the 50 billion farm credit system a 
network of borrowerowned cooperatives that together make up the 
nations largest farm lender 
forty other new cars were on order may 20 when the bank ran out 
of operating capital closed its doors and went into receivership 
they said they said even newly hired lending officers were 
authorized to use the autos for personal driving of up to 1000 
miles a month 
a 60000 bill arising from credit cards issued to bank 
executives also was pending according to the systems chief 
regulator frank naylor chairman of the farm credit administration 
naylor stessed that no basis had been established to suggest 
wrongdoing by anyone he said his agencys investigators were 
continuing their efforts to sort out the situation 
he acknowledged that one former bank officical had been 
permitted to take home some of his office furnishings but he said 
this was not uncommon in private industry in settlements between 
companies and departing executives 
senators however were more critical 
at a time when farmers are living on the edge of bankruptcy i 
find it appalling that the funds of farmerborrowers were being 
used to decorate the walls with persian rugs and highpriced 
paintings boren said 
boren himself said that oriental rugs and opulent art works and 
furnishings had adorned a number of offices and that there are 
some nails on the wall with nothing hanging on them now 
the report prompted sen kent conrad dnd to call for an fbi 
investigation 
what weve heard here is utterly outrageous conrad said 
what weve heard is going to shake confidence in the farm credit 
system 
boren stopped short of calling for an fbi probe but urged naylor 
to make initial contact with the fbi while continuing his own 
investigation 
authorities say one reason several farm credit system banks got 
into trouble is that they became locked into highpriced borrowing 
themselves early in the 1980s before the farm economy went into the 
doldrums 
competing institutions lowered interest rates but farm credit 
system banks could not follow suit because they were locked into 
high credit costs 
for that reason their most creditworthy customers were lured 
away while other loans increasingly became delinquent

the house appropriations committee is trying 
to ride to the rescue of movie directors and others who resent what 
ted turner has done to their blackandwhite masterpieces by 
colorizing them 
the committees cavalry may be headed off at the pass though 
by the powerful rules committee 
the movie provision is contained in the 97 billion 
appropriations bill for the interior department and related 
agencies passed by the committee on thursday the committee on a 
2520 show of hands rejected an amendment that would have deleted 
it 
the bill would create a ninemember commission to decide what 
movies are artistically significant 
a blackandwhite movie so chosen could not be shown or 
distributed under its original title if it had been colored like 
the maltese falcon and others recently on television from 
turners vast film library 
in a provision that could affect the television practice of 
chopping movies to fit arbitrary time intervals with breaks for 
commercials the bill would require that any chosen movie 
blackandwhite or color would have to carry notice if it had been 
significantly changed over the objections of the director or 
principal writer if those figures were dead the commission could 
require a notice that it had been changed if it believed the 
director or writer would object if alive 
the rules committee can deflect the action by denying a waiver 
of the house rule that bills appropriating money should not contain 
substantive legislation if the waiver is denied any member on the 
floor can raise a point of order to delete the offending section 
the rules chairman rep claude pepper dfla wrote the 
appropriations committee to object to its consideration of the 
issue instead of the judiciary committee where a similar bill has 
been languishing 
great art is being desecrated argued the principal backer of 
the provision rep robert l mrazek dny referring to the 1946 
classic about returning war veterans the best years of our 
lives mrazek said i would rather watch the scene where 
frederic march returns to his family than a roomful of renoirs 
he read a telegram from director frank capra that complained the 
current owners of his 1940s film starring jimmy stewart its a 
wonderful life had splashed it all over with easter egg colors 
and ruined it 
obviously this is not going to survive the rules committee 
said mrazek but if it survives this appropriations committee it 
will send a signal 
stewart was present for the debate and rep mickey edwards 
rokla used stewarts noted performances as a reforming senator 
in mr smith goes to washington to argue against considering 
the measure mr smith would have stood up in this committee 
against the bypassing of committee procedures 
the leader of the opponents in the appropriations committee 
rep vic fazio dcalif argued this is a serious intrusion on 
copyright law we ought to leave to mr robert kastenmeier and his 
subcommittee kastenmeier dwis is chairman of judiciarys 
copyrights subcommittee and plans hearings soon fazio said 
even so he continued the provision is deeply flawed since 
performers photographers studio owners are all left out and 
the issue belongs in labormanagement negotiations between 
directors and producers 
i find it offensive for a government body to designate what is 
art fazio said 
stewart said the coversion of blackandwhite movies to color 
is really a terrible practice and something that should be 
outlawed 
congress he said by legislation and so on is going to 
recognize the motion picture as an art form more than it has done 
before this is the thing that we won in this first tryout 
which i think is very important 
jack valenti president of the motion picture association of 
america said he was pleased that the vote was so close and 
claimed there was a big swing in my direction as members 
studied the issue he said he believed the opposition of the 
appropriations committee chairman rep jamie whitten dmiss

the reagan administration is preparing to 
sound out members of congress on renewing us aid to the contra 
rebels as a result of the collapsed peace talks in nicaragua 
according to a us official and an insurgent leader 
alfredo cesar a member of the contra directorate said thursday 
the administration will begin consultations with the congress 
very soon on a new assistance package 
no decision has been made on requesting military aid as part of 
a package because it is not clear whether congress would go along 
cesar said on feb 3 the house defeated by eight votes an aid 
request that included 35 million for military equipment 
an administration official insisting on anonymity confirmed 
cesars account saying a decision has been made to seek renewed 
funding for the contras but the details are completely up in the 
air 
cesar said what that package will contain the amount its 
still open to discussions up here in washington 
there is no fixed date for a vote but its going to be soon 
very soon and active discussions of that will start next week 
he said he wants any aid package to last until next february or 
march to insulate the contra issue from the emotions of the fall 
presidential election campaign 
cesar made it clear the rebels want a renewal of military aid 
because the sandinista government he said has been receiving an 
average of 40 million a month worth of lethal equipment from the 
soviet union since jan 1 
this has put the rebels at a severe disadvantage in peace 
negotiations with the sandinistas he said at the same time he 
added the rebels do not want to restart the war and plan to 
ask central american governments to bring diplomatic pressure to 
bear on the sandinistas to support a peaceful settlement 
cesar spoke to reporters after he and his colleagues met with 
vice president george bush national security advisor colin powell 
and assistant secretary of state elliott abrams the rebel 
delegation met with members of congress on wednesday 
the decision on whether to include military aid as part of a 
package apparently will hinge on the administrations ability to 
persuade congress that the sandinistas are to blame for the failure 
last week of peace talks in managua 
secretary of state george p shultz said tuesday the talks made 
plain the sandinistas unwillingness to fulfill their stated 
commitment to create democracy in nicaragua 
but sandinista officials have said that the contras sabotaged 
the talks by introducing demands which were both new and absurd 
during the final hours of the negotiations last thursday 
as part of an interim ceasefire agreement signed by the contras 
and the sandinistas last march 23 the rebels are entitled to 
receive food clothing shelter and medical supplies from outside 
sources 
congress approved 17 million in such aid a week later 
desginating that the money be obligated by sept 30 outside 
military aid to the rebels was barred under the agreement 
when the humanitarian aid measure was approved by the house 
speaker jim wright dtexas promised not to stand in the way of 
any subsequent military aid proposal if the sandinistacontra peace 
talks collapse 
but wright has indicated that he no longer feels bound by that 
pledge because of a republican proposal on may 26 to allow the cia 
to use contingency funds in support of the contras that bid was 
rejected 214190 
on tuesday wright said he would oppose any new military aid 
request but cesar said he has the impression that congressional 
sentiment has been shifting in support of the rebels since the 
breakdown of the peace talks

president reagan will veto any bill requiring 
him to notify congress within 48 hours of the start of a covert 
operation defense secretary frank c carlucci told a house 
committee considering such legislation 
carlucci told the house foreign affairs committee on thursday he 
believes that if reagan is compelled to reject such a measure the 
resulting constitutional confrontation between the white house and 
congress would cause a harmful and longlasting lack of trust 
between the two branches 
but several house members said they believe presidents must be 
held to a some standard of notification to prevent abuses of the 
kind exposed by the irancontra affair 
sen william s cohen rmaine cochairman of the senate 
intelligence committee testified that he and his colleagues have 
concluded that either you establish a time certain 48 hours or 
whatever or it ends up being a matter of presidential 
discretion 
there really is no middle ground cohen said 
chairman dante fascell dfla said that while he views 
requiring a notice of covert operations within 48 hours as a 
rather modest proposal there are those in the administration 
who think its deadly 
carlucci said he has no doubt reagan will veto the bill if 
it reaches his desk in its present form 
i respectfully urge the members to reflect on the wisdom of 
the presidents position and beyond this to consider the effect 
of provoking a presidential veto on legislation governing the 
entire realm of intelligence activities carlucci said 
if trust candor and accountability are the remedy to the 
problems that brought about the irancontra affair he said 
the congress risks undermining all of these goals and 
reintroducing again an unhealthy adversarial basis to the oversight 
process for years to come 
i can think of no step by the congress which would do more 
harm to the process of rebuilding an atmosphere of trust and candor 
between the branches 
the defense secretary said reagan believes holding him to a 
strict notification timetable would undermine his constitutional 
authority as commander in chief and deprive him of essential 
flexibility 
he noted that the canadian government offered its help in 1980 
to spirit six american diplomats out of iran only on condition that 
congress not be told 
had a 48hour notification law been in effect he said the 
white house would have had no choice but to reject the canadian 
offer to free americans in peril

when melvyn r paisley resigned from his navy 
job in april 1987 and set up shop in downtown washington as a 
consultant he didnt have to wait long before some of the nations 
largest defense contractors were lining up to hire him 
paisley was selling information a commodity much in demand 
among the various companies seeking any edge they could get in the 
highstakes world of selling multimilliondollar weapons to the 
pentagon 
paisley has become a major target in the nationwide 
investigation of possible corruption involving contractors and 
defense officials 
paisley 63 has also been a key player in president reagans 
naval buildup which was at the heart of the record defense splurge 
during the presidents first term in office 
when reagan took office in january 1981 he moved to keep his 
campaign pledge to rearm america and his new navy secretary 
john lehman was a major figure lehman led the fight for large 
increases in the navy budget seeking the goal of a 600ship navy 
lehman also hired paisley away from the boeing co to become 
assistant navy secretary for research engineering and systems 
paisley a native of portland ore had worked at boeing for 28 
years and held a number of toplevel management positions before 
taking the navy job he retired as manager of international 
operations for boeings space and information division 
paisleys appointment was controversial his final payment from 
boeing was 183000 and critics said there was an inherent conflict 
of interest because boeing is a navy supplier 
in july 1986 the justice department sued paisley and four other 
top boeing officials arguing that their severance payments created 
a conflict of interest 
on feb 17 1987 two months before paisley left office us 
district court judge claude hilton of alexandria va ruled for 
paisley and the other four defendants paisleys comment was its 
a relief after five years of this problem to get rid of it 
but the case isnt over hiltons decision was overturned by the 
4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond va which declared 
that the boeing payments created the appearance of conflict of 
interest paisley and the other defendants are seeking to have 
the decision reconsidered 
while he was at the pentagon paisley joined forces with his 
boss lehman and everett pyatt assistant navy secretary for 
shipbuilding the trio fought hard both inside and outside the 
navy to preserve reagans buildup of ships 
paisley was known outside the pentagon as a raconteur but was a 
stern taskmaster inside the building he didnt like to be 
opposed and when he was he and lehman didnt let many people get 
in their way said one official thursday speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
paisleys departure from the pentagon also raised questions 
according to former navy secretary james h webb jr webb said 
thursday that when he became navy secretary in april 1987 he 
learned that paisley had just persuaded navy officials to give him 
an unusual consulting contract with the research office he was 
leaving 
the contract also allowed paisley to maintain his security 
clearance for information on the militarys most secret black 
programs webb told the washington post 
webb said he canceled the contract before any money on it was 
paid to paisley 
paisley was also involved in the march 1986 decision by raytheon 
corp to fire former pentagon official lawrence korb from his 
washington job with the company after korb suggested in a speech 
that defense spending could be reduced 
korb had been assistant defense secretary for manpower issues 
until leaving to join raytheon in 1985 
after the speech lehman pyatt and paisley all complained about 
korbs statements and raytheon officials admitted that paisley had 
asked the company to tell korb not to speak out against the 
pentagon budget 
the action was criticized in congress and a review by the 
pentagon inspector generals office concluded that although the 
trio had acted improperly there was no evidence to suggest they 
had asked that korb be dismissed

patrons early friday police said 
on thursday the british government proposed barring englands 
national team from the world cup the olympics and other 
international events in a fivepart crackdown on soccer hooliganism 
several people were slightly injured in the violence in 
frankfurts apple wine district and near the citys main train 
station police said 
seven britons were arrested out of about 60 troublemakers they 
said 
more than 100 english soccer fans have been arrested in clashes 
during the european soccer championships which west germany is 
hosting 
british home secretary douglas hurd unveiled the proposals after 
a 75minute soccer summit at prime minister margaret thatchers 
10 downing street home 
we were all appalled by what has happened in germany hurd 
said we were clear that present arrangements are not enough and 
have got to be strengthened 
hurd also proposed travel restrictions on fans involved in 
violence tighter controls over who gets into matches tougher 
licensing laws outside soccer stadiums to cut down on fans getting 
drunk before and after matches and steppedup police surveillance 
englands football association reacting to the wave of

stressing the prosecutions good faith in 
safeguarding the rights of oliver l north and three codefendants 
a federal judge says its time for the irancontra cases to go to 
trial 
us district judge gerhard a gesell on thursday cleared the 
way for the four separate trials he has ordered by rejecting 
defendants claims that prosecutors violated their constitutional 
rights 
gesell still must rule on defense motions that unprecedented 
volumes of classified material will make trials impossible but his 
ruling left virtually no doubt that he plans to proceed 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh has chosen north the 
fired national security council staffer who directed the 
irancontra affair to be tried first gesell is expected to set a 
trial date in the next few weeks 
we are of course pleased with judge gesells ruling walsh 
said we are prepared to go forward as directed by the court 
thursdays ruling centered on defense contentions that walsh 
built his case on testimony given to congress by three of the 
defendants under grants of limited immunity from prosecution 
congress grants the immunity in order to compel testimony of 
reluctant witnesses in this case north former national security 
adviser john m poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim the fourth 
defendant businessman richard v secord testified without 
immunity 
as a tradeoff for the immunity the prosecution in a criminal 
case is barred from using the compelled testimony except to show 
perjury the defense claimed that walsh violated the immunity law 
by building his case from the immunized testimony 
gesell rejected the claim and praised walsh for taking 
extraordinary measures to make sure the prosecution staff grand 
jury witnesses and grand jurors were not exposed to the immunized 
testimony 
nothing has developed in the courts preliminary inquiry 
which suggests the defendants who received use immunity have had 
their fifth amendment rights impaired in a manner that 
significantly affects their right to a fair trial gesell ruled 
the good faith of independent counsel cannot be questioned on 
this record gesell said adding he was left with no doubt 
that walsh followed a vigorous program aimed at minimizing the 
exposure of himself and his prosecutorial staffs to immunized 
testimony 
given these factual circumstances it is not difficult to 
reach a preliminary decision that the case should proceed to 
trial 
the defendants sought to have the case dismissed or 
alternatively a fullblown pretrial hearing on the issue gesell 
said the tainted testimony question could be pursued after the 
irancontra trials are over 
gesell had ordered separate trials for the four defendants 
several weeks ago to preserve a defendants usual trial privilege 
of crossexamining other defendants this would allow the 
defendants to use each others immunized testimony 
the defendants are charged with a broad conspiracy to carry out 
a secret operation of aiding the nicaraguan contra rebels when such 
assistance was banned by law to do so the grand jury charged 
they illegally used profits from arms sales to iran authorized by 
president reagan some of those profits also went for personal 
gain the indictment said 
according to gesell there was ample probable cause for each 
count of the indictment 
he said the great bulk of the evidence was clearly known to 
walsh before any defendant received immunity ironically he said 
much of walshs independent evidence came from secord who went 
into extraordinarily comprehensive detail about the case and 
provided prosecutors with valuable leads and other background 
information for its case 
gesell said the grand jurors were so keenly aware of the tainted 
evidence problem that the foreman had told prosecutors jurors would 
walk out of the room if immunized testimony were presented 
walsh has admitted in pretrial hearings that at times he and 
his staff became inadvertently exposed to media coverage of the 
testimony all such incidents were reported to one of his staffers 
whose only role was to keep a log of the 75 incidents only two or 
three had any semblance of meaningful significance the judge 
found 
gesell said defendants in their zeal believed even the 
tiniest exposure to a witness or grand juror constituted exposure 
to an incurable disease such is clearly not the case exposure to 
a fleeting snippet means nothing

after a storm of protests from private pilots 
and some members of congress the government has scaled back its 
proposed requirement for small planes to be equipped with 
altitudetracking equipment 
the federal aviation administration said thursday it would 
require small private planes to have altitudeencoding transponders 
if they fly near 138 airports and in some cases as far as 30 miles 
from the runway the devices provide air traffic controllers with 
altitude information about a specific plane on their radar screen 
only four months ago the faa said it was considering 
regulations that would ban small planes from all airspace within 40 
miles of 254 airports and above 6000 feet when not flying near an 
airport 
the regulation announced thursday requires the devices on small 
planes within 30 miles of 27 of the nations busiest airports after 
july 1989 and within currently restricted airspace less than 10 
miles in some many cases surrounding 109 other airports after 
1990 
under the rule small planes would be allowed to fly up to 
10000 feet without the equipment instead of the 6000 feet 
suggested earlier currently the altitudeencoding transponders are 
required above 12500 feet 
the final rule falls short of what the airlines and commercial 
pilots had wanted but was seen as a significant victory for private 
pilots and their powerful lobbying group the aircraft owners and 
pilots association 
the february proposal had unleashed a firestorm among the 
nations private pilots who flooded the faa and congressional 
offices with more than 80000 complaint letters several 
congressmen had threatened legislation forcing the faa to back off 
the aircraft owners and pilots association called the 
restrictions an overzealous reaction to concern about aerial 
collisions and urged private plane owners across the country to 
join in opposing the great airspace grab 
only last year congress directed the faa to expand the use of 
the altitudeencoding equipment known as modec transponders in 
small planes because of an increasing number of nearcollision 
reports and the 1986 collision of a small plane and a mexican 
airliner over cerritos calif 
the airlines and commercial pilots have call for stricter rules 
for the use of the altitudeencoding equipment on small planes and 
favor such equipment on any plane flying in airspace used by 
commercial jetliners 
while the final rule is far less than what the agency suggested 
last february faa administrator allan mcartor said thursday 
evening he expects the new requirements to signficantly reduce the 
danger from aerial collisions 
under the new requirements small planes must be equip with 
transponders that tell controllers the planes altitude by july 1 
1989 or be banned from airspace within 30 miles of the 27 airports 
that are surrounded by socalled terminal control areas or tcas 
any aircraft flying within the tcas already must have the devices 
by the end of 1990 aircraft flying in restricted airspace known 
as airport radar service areas or arsas must have the equipment 
the arsas vary in size but generally are much smaller than the 
airspace envisioned by the february proposal 
the faa also said certain designated airports that have 
commecial air traffic but no currently restricted airspace would 
not be opened for small planes without modec transponders after 
1990 so far only two such airports have been designated 
billings mont and fargo nd but agency spokesman fred farrar 
said others may be added 
the airlines have argued that any aircraft that flies in the 
vicinity of commercial air traffic should be equipped with the 
altitude encoding transponder so a controller more easily can 
determine if two planes are on a collision course 
the private pilots led buy aopa maintained that the sweeping 
restrictions proposed by the faa in february amounted to an 
unnecessary infringment on many pilots the small plane pilots also 
complained about the estimated 600 to 2000 cost for the 
altitudeencoding equipment

jesse jackson says its fine that the 
democrats shower him with praise for his contributions to the 
party but he expects something more than accolades in return 
he met with a roomful of democratic senators on thursday in 
search of what he considers his fair share of socalled super 
delegates for the partys convention this summer 
but only sen ernest hollings from jacksons home state of 
south carolina stood by him with a pledge to support his 
presidential candidacy at the convention 
hollings said he would do so even though michael dukakis is now 
the obvious winner of the partys nomination because of his 
delegate majority 
jackson contends party leaders should support him because he has 
helped them by working on voter registration and believes he is 
due a substantial share of super delegates because he came in 
second in the primary contests the super delegates are democrats 
who become delegates because of their elected or party leadership 
positions 
but jackson emerged from the meeting with some 30 senators to 
tell reporters that only sen hollings among the senators has 
endorsed me no democratic state chair has except washington dc 
jackson was making campaign appearances today in texas 
he indicated thursday he is weary of getting only verbal strokes 
from the party but no delegate support 
the basic party leadership while accepting my investment in 
the party to make it strong has not been as reciprocal as it ought 
to be jackson said 
if in fact i have invested nothing in the party i should 
expect no return if i invest i should reasonably expect return 
so i appreciate the accolades that i am the voter registration 
champion for the party that i have led the drive to return the 
senate back to the democrats that i have won states that no one 
said i could win 
if i have done all of that then i simply say lets be fair 
jackson said 
hollings said he was urging other super delegates whose 
districts or states jackson won to follow the senators lead for 
the good of the party 
coming from my home state he won my home state he certainly 
has earned my vote at the convention hollings said 
one senator who attended the meeting sen bob graham of 
florida later said he did not intend his endorsement of dukakis to 
be a negative reflection on rev jackson but he saw no reason 
to change any rules so that jackson could get more delegates 
jackson contends his share of the super delegate total should 
more closely reflect his 29 percent of the popular vote 
as of thursday he had 52 of the 643 super delegates while 
dukakis had 350 according to the associated press tally 
hollings said jackson has run a winning campaign this year 
in contrast to his 1984 race when he frightened the bejesus out 
of people 
this time jackson has not frightened anyone hollings said 
hes charmed them in all of those different debates and in his 
own right has leveled off said the senator who also sought the 
presidency in 1984 
jackson was praised earlier thursday by members of the senate 
labor and human resources committee committee chairman edward 
kennedy dmass and other senators thanked jackson for his years 
as an outspoken leader against drugs and for his work with young 
people 
jackson told the committee that us military forces should not 
be used as the primary drug interdiction force but rather should 
be used for backing up other agencies and providing intelligence 
we must be careful however to avoid involving the military 
in any police actions against citizens or arrests he said we 
should not lead with our military forces in drugs or any other 
aspect of foreign policy 
later kennedy joined jackson at a rally outside the capitol 
denouncing south africa as a terrorist state jackson urged support 
for antiapartheid legislation

portauprince haiti ap president leslie manigat 
congratulated the army for pledging allegiance to his government 
after he apparently defused his first major power struggle with 
military leaders 
we are in a period of democratic apprenticeship and 
adjustment to a framework of civilian supremacy and 
constitutional principle manigat said thursday in a regularly 
scheduled press conference 
the president said he met for four hours wednesday with members 
of the army general staff before they issued a statement 
recognizing his authority and pledging loyalty to the government 
the civil power and military institution have given together 
a lesson in patriotism and democracy which permits us to be 
optimistic he said i pay homage to the military for having 
done their duty 
manigat overruled his top army commander wednesday by rescinding 
an order transferring and retiring highranking officers including 
col jeanclaude paul indicted on drug trafficking charges this 
year by a grand jury in miami 
it is not a question of individuals it is a question of 
principle the eminently democratic principle of supremacy of 
the civilian authority over the military manigat said when asked 
if his decision amounted to a personal defense of paul 
manigat widely alleged to be the armys candidate in juntarun 
elections last january maintains that he rules independently from 
the army 
his decision wednesday to rescind an order from army 
commanderinchief lt gen henri namphy resulted in the first 
crisis between haitis new civilian government and the military 
which has traditionally held power in this impoverished caribbean 
nation 
namphy had ordered paul transferred from commander of the 
700man dessalines barracks the most feared army unit in haiti to 
assistant chief of staff a largely administrative post paul 
reportedly refused to accept the transfer 
it was unclear why namphy ordered the transfer whether the 
order signified a power struggle within the army or whether the 
transfer was linked to charges of drugrunning against paul who 
has denied the charges 
there is absolutely no split in the armed forces none at 
all col gary leon general secretary of the army general staff 
said in a telephone interview 
soldiers under pauls command have been blamed for widespread 
violence against voters that forced the cancellation of last 
novembers independently adminstrated general elections and left 
more than 30 people dead 
army chiefofstaff gen carl nicolas denied earlier this year 
that paul was involved in drug trafficking and accused the foreign 
press of singling out the 49yearold colonel for attack 
by rescinding namphys order manigat the nominal 
commanderinchief of the armed forces appeared to have sided with 
paul 
the president simply said that government authority is 
essentially civilian and passed instructions to the army to 
rectify certain decisions said louis noisin president of the 
senate from a parliamentary point of view the problem is 
resolved now its up to the army to do its internal house 
cleaning 
namphy was president of the junta that ruled haiti from the time 
jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile in 1986 until manigat took 
office in february 
namphy and his general staff backed down wednesday by issuing 
what appeared to be a facesaving statement tentatively 
accepting manigats decision and pledging loyalty to the government 
but it remained unclear how long the military will continue to 
tolerate manigats interventions in military decisions 
everyone fears a standoff between the dessalines batallion and 
other sectors of the army gregoire eugene leader of the haitian 
social christian party said in an interview 
it is true that if paul had been promoted to assistant chief 
of staff as is reported he would have lost control over his 
troops the dessalines barracks is traditionally a key factor in 
power plays said eugene once a presidential candidate 
when asked if the army accepts manigats authority as the the 
nominal head of the armed forces leon said yes its written in 
the constitution

a broadcasters trade group says a senate 
proposal to beam american television programs to cuba has become a 
political deal that is ignoring the concerns of american radio 
and tv stations 
the national association of broadcasters charges that tv marti 
advocates are trying to squelch their concerns that the proposed 
government tv version of radio marti could interfere with us 
broadcasts 
nab officials said they were denied copies of engineering 
studies on the proposed tv marti before the senate appropriations 
committee voted thursday on a spending bill that earmarks 75 
million for the service in the 198990 budget of the us 
information agency 
its a political deal nab lobbyist james may said of the 
committees action on the proposal to transmit american news and 
entertainment programs to cuba from a blimp over the florida keys 
the budget bill goes next to the full senate 
may said the nab was rebuffed by the staff of the senate 
appropriations subcommittee that approved the tv marti 
appropriation last week and by stewart sweet who is lobbying on 
behalf of tv marti advocates 
sweets washington firm of black manafort stone amp kelly has 
links to the republican presidential campaign of vice president 
george bush charles black a principal of the firm is an adviser 
to the campaign 
bush has been a vocal supporter of tv marti and has backed the 
proposal in speeches aimed at gaining votes from the cubanamerican 
community of southern florida 
but tv marti is also being pushed by democratic sen ernest 
hollings of south carolina the appropriations subcommittee 
chairman 
may said sweet refused to give copies of the feasibility studies 
to nab officials because of national security concerns 
sweet declined to comment and when asked about his interest in 
the matter said i just happen to think that tv marti is a good 
idea lets just leave it at that 
warren kane a hollings staffer on the appropriations 
subcommittee said none of the reports is classified he said he 
gave nab on wednesday two of six feasibility studies on the 
proposal and told an nab lobbyist he could read the other four 
including the engineering analyses in the subcommittees office 
may acknowledged the offer was made but said kane refused to 
allow the nab representative to copy the report so he could show it 
to nab engineers 
this is a cover for a very disturbing process may said 
the feasibility studies were done by the radio marti advisory 
board headed by jorge mas canosa who also chairs the cuban 
american national foundation a secretary in mas miami office said 
he was not in thursday afternoon and he did not return the call 
seeking comment 
may said the nab is concerned about interference to american tv 
stations in south florida from the tv marti signal as well as to 
american am radio stations from cuban retaliatory jamming cuban 
transmitters can blast a signal that would interfere with stations 
in 30 states may said 
in addition the tv marti signal could be jammed easily by the 
cubans preventing the signal from being viewed where it is 
intended he said 
the senate proposal includes no money to compensate us 
stations that are harmed by cuban retaliation as did the 
legislation that created radio marti which began broadcasting in 
may 1985

all of the experimental aids vaccines 
tested so far have failed to protect chimpanzees from the lethal 
virus and these rare animals should no longer be used for vaccine 
studies a researcher says 
dr reinhard kurth of the paul ehrlich institute in frankfurt 
west germany said that 120 chimps around the world have been 
innoculated with potential vaccines and then given the aids virus 
in no case did the various approaches protect the animals from 
infection 
kurth said the research worlds supply of chimps is rapidly 
being used up they and gibbon apes are the only animals that can 
be infected with hiv the virus responsible for acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome and both are endangered species 
we should forget about chimps for now and save them for a 
stage when we know a lot more about vaccines he said 
kurths conclusion thursday was one of several generally 
pessimistic reports about vaccine development at the fourth 
international conference on aids 
although most researchers said they believe a vaccine will 
ultimately be made it could take several years to design one that 
outsmarts the crafty defenses of hiv 
yes its possible but its going to take a long time there 
are no easy answers said dr linda gritz 
gritz is a molecular biologist at applied biotechnology in 
cambridge mass one of about a dozen us companies that are 
attempting to create an aids vaccine such a project she said 
could take 10 years 
i think we are some way yet from making a vaccine that will 
protect against hiv agreed dr gordon ada of the world health 
organization 
he said its clear that vaccine development will be far more 
difficult for aids than for other diseases that have been tamed 
with vaccines 
the aids virus attacks the immune system the blood cells that 
ordinarily protect the body from microbes 
ordinarily the body defeats germs in two main ways blood cells 
called b cells make antibodies that latch onto the germs marking 
them for destruction another variety called cytotoxic t cells 
directly attack the virus and the cells that the microbe has 
infected 
ada said that among the defense strategies that make hiv such a 
powerful foe 
the virus mutates quickly constantly changing its outer coat 
antibodies that recognize one version of the virus fail to spot 
another another 
the virus may ride into the body inside infected blood cells 
these cells are not recognized by antibodies as enemies 
once established the virus may hide in cells in the brain and 
other parts of the body where they are shielded from attack by 
cytotoxic t cells 
ada said that attempts to get around these difficulties have 
failed and more basic research into the intricacies of infection 
will be necessary before scientists can logically plan a vaccine 
i am certainly optimistic we can do something but we have to 
establish what happens in the first two or three weeks after 
infection he said where does the virus go the more types of 
cells that are infect the more difficult it is going to be 
but some researchers are already experimenting with vaccines in 
people even though there is no clear evidence that they will 
ultimately work 
dr jonas salk pioneer of the polio vaccine announced at the 
meeting that he is giving a vaccine made from killed aids virus to 
men who are infected but still healthy the aim is to try to beef 
up their immune defenses so they dont get sick 
using an elaborate system of vaccine and booster shots dr 
daniel zagury of the university of paris says he has produced 
powerful aids antibodies in experiments on himself however no one 
knows if this would be enough to protect him from infection 
at the critical care medicine department of the national 
institutes of health in bethesda md dr joseph kovacs and others 
are giving an aids virus protein to healthy people 
so far this approach has produced signs of a weak response from 
their immune systems and the researchers hope that higher doses 
will trigger more powerful levels of aids defenses 
nobody can say for sure whether this or some other approach will 
work said kovacks but if we dont try to develop a vaccine we 
will never get one 
in other reports at the meeting 
dr king holmes of harborview medical center in seattle said 
that the risk of getting aids through heterosexual contact 
increases in people with genital herpes syphilis chancroid and 
other diseases that produce genital sores 
dr francis plummer of the university of manitoba found that 
prostitutes in africa who use birth control pills were two to three 
times as likely as other prostitutes to become infected with aids

a securities and exchange commission lawyer 
claimed victory following settlement of her 4yearold claim that 
she was threatened with dismissal for complaining of sexual 
harassment in the office 
under terms of the settlement approved thursday by us 
district judge john h pratt attorney catherine broderick will 
receive a promotion back pay and compensation for psychological 
counseling 
also as part of the settlement the sec agreed to hire an equal 
employment opportunity expert to review current commission policies 
on sexual harassment and make recommendations for any needed 
changes 
the sec also said it would hire an impartial third party to 
investigate what if any disciplinary action should be taken 
against ms brodericks former supervisors the commission said it 
would evaluate the results of the investigation and take 
appropriate disciplinary action then report its actions to the 
court and to ms brodericks lawyers 
in a statement the sec said that it intends to send a strong 
message that it will not tolerate employment discrimination or 
harassment of any kind 
ms broderick was smiling broadly thursday after pratts action 
she said that she was pleased with the settlement its 
definitely a victory 
pratt ruled last month that ms broderick who worked for five 
years in the secs washington regional office had suffered sexual 
harassment by being forced to work in a hostile environment 
following pratts ruling ms broderick told reporters that her 
former supervisors had used the office as a sexual playground 
the affairs were carried on at the office and flaunted in 
front of other employees ms broderick said at the time they 
went out for threehour lunches and used the office for rendezvous 
after work and on weekends 
pratt found that female employees who had sexual or other social 
relationships with managers of the regional offices enforcement 
division received promotions positive evaluations and cash bonuses 
but the judge said ms broderick received negative 
evaluations threats of dismissal and eventually a transfer when 
she complained 
under the settlement worked out by attorneys for the sec and ms 
broderick and approved by pratt ms broderick will be moved up two 
steps in the federal governments salary listing and will receive 
back pay based on salary increases she would have been entitled to 
had she received regular promotions the amount of back pay still 
has to be calculated 
in addition the sec agreed to remove any remaining negative 
evaluations from her personnel files and to offer her positions in 
the division of enforcement and the office of the general counsel 
the sec also agreed to help pay for psychological counseling 
sessions 
the commission said it also had agreed to help ms broderick 
obtain outside employment and pay reasonable costs of outplacement 
services if she should decide to look for a job outside the sec 
in a statement sec chairman david ruder noted that the 
commission for many years has been a leader in the promotion of 
women in the corporate and securities field

two california scientists believe that among 
animals the gene that causes siblings to help and protect each 
other may be related to the gene that causes their mother to 
practice monogamy 
a mathematical model created by marc w feldman and joel r peck 
of stanford university and published today in science magazine 
shows a correlation between the altruism that animal brothers and 
sisters show for each other and the tendency of their mothers to 
mate with only one male 
the math model suggests that altruism and monogamy are a good 
combination that produces a situation where the individuals who 
carry this combination have more offspring said feldman in a 
telephone interview 
he said the theory does not apply to humans because altruism 
among humans is a learned tendency but it does apply to animals 
where the behavior is instinctive or genetically directed 
altruism among animals is an instinct that causes an individual 
to support others in the family or group or even sacrifice life 
for the benefit of the others 
examples said feldman are bees and wasps that will work to 
feed larvae or will attack when the nest is threatened other 
examples include elephants that will work together to protect the 
young of the herd and mountain gorillas that will defend the 
family group 
monogamy the tendency of a female to stay with one mate is 
common in the animal kingdom said feldman and scientists have 
long been puzzled how it developed 
mating for life occurs among some mammals such as elephants 
among birds such as geese and bald eagles and even among some 
fish 
there isnt a very good basis in evolutionary theory for the 
development of monogamy said feldman it is a really poorly 
understood phenomenon 
in the math model feldman said he and peck demonstrate that 
there is a correlation between the genes that cause altruism and 
those that affect mating behavior 
he said the two behaviorial genes are linked in such a way that 
if there is a situation for genetic altruism then that is 
sufficient to cause an increase in the frequency of genes that 
promote monogamy 
in effect said feldman if you see altruism among siblings 
it helps you to promote monogamy 
this he said produces the darwinian advantage a reference 
to the evolutionary theory put forth by charles darwin in the 19th 
century that the genetic charactistics that promote the most 
reproductive success will tend to become the dominant 
characteristics of a species 
feldman said his theory has never been tested in the field by 
scientists who observe animal behavior but he hopes they will now 
look for evidence that may relate altruism to monogamy 
he said monogamous birds rodents and even primates would be 
good subjects for observational scientists to test the correlation 
feldman is a professor of biology and director of the institute 
for population and resources studies at stanford peck is a 
researcher in biology at the same institution

president reagans aids commission came down 
to its final meeting today still undecided on what to recommend in 
the way of administrative changes to cope with the epidemic 
after hearing from about 500 witnesses and concluding that a 
cornerstone of the final report should be a call for national 
antidiscrimination protection for the more than 1 million 
americans estimated to be infected with the deadly virus the 
13member panel was split on what if any changes it should 
recommend in the federal health hierarchy the report is due june 
24 
retired navy adm james d watkins the commissions chairman 
is on record as favoring the vestment of sweeping new powers in the 
office of the surgeon general now dr c everett koop to cope 
with present and future health emergencies such as aids 
however several commissioners have expressed reservations at 
that approach some suggested an alternative would be to call for 
legislation that would allow the appointment of a special assistant 
designated by the president to coordinate battles against 
particular health emergencies 
in an effort to deal with one aspect of what the commission 
viewed as a need to take extraordinary procedures in dealing with 
health threats like aids the panel agreed tentatively on thursday 
to recommend that the national institutes of health have more 
independence 
although adoption of the specific language was delayed until 
today the commission agreed unanimously with the concept outlined 
by dr burton james lee iii of the memorial sloankettering cancer 
center in new york city 
as a clinical researcher in cancer medicine i have worked 
with the nih all of my professional life and it is my strong view 
that nih has been unable to function as effectively as it could 
simply because the mechanisms are buried under so much 
bureaucracy lee told his fellow commissioners 
he won backing for a recommendation that the president direct 
that the nih director report directly to the health and human 
services secretary rather than to subordinates in the department 
for a twoyear trial period and that the nih chief have broad 
discretionary budget and personnel authority during that period 
lee said if that change in procedure did not result in greater 
flexibility for nih to achieve its scientific mandate congress 
should consider setting the nih up as a separate agency answerable 
directly to the white house and congress 
watkins a strong supporter of lees proposal emphasized that 
the change would not alter the requirement for nih to win its 
allocation from congress in competition with other government needs 
nor he said would it give the nih director power to shift 
funds from one institute to another from the national institute 
on aging for example to the national cancer institute 
watkins said the main idea was to insulate the nih director 
now dr james b wyngaarden from having to clear internal 
personnel and spending priorities with several layers of 
bureaucrats at hhs and especially at the office of management and 
budget

supreme court chief justice kim 
yongchul resigned today after hundreds of judges demanded he step 
down to pave the way for democratic reforms and an independent 
judicial system 
i did my best to develop the judiciary but i failed because 
of incompetence and lack of virtue on my part kim 63 told a 
news conference he said was responsible for loss of public 
confidence in the nations courts 
the government which earlier planned to retain kim decided to 
accept his offer to resign and was seeking a successor said kbs 
the staterun radiotelevision network 
on wednesday judges in seoul called for drastic judicial 
reforms and an overhaul of the nations highest court more than 
280 judges nationwide endorsed the statement 
the judges said the judiciary has been subservient to the 
executive branch of the government and out of step with the 
democratic reforms transforming most aspects of south korean 
society in the past south korean courts played a key role in 
helping enforce authoritarian rule 
many authoritarian controls on politics and other aspects of 
south korean life have been dismantled during the past year after 
nationwide riots last summer against the government of former 
president chun doohwan 
the government of president roh taewoo which took power feb 
25 has pledged to introduce full democracy 
judges calling for kims resignation said they issued the 
statement because the supreme court soon would be reorganized under 
a new constitution 
kim said he was shocked when he first heard the report of 
the collective action by the judges but that he decided to accept 
their call to resign 
he said the last three days were the most agonizing period of 
time in my life 
the departing chief justice said he told his top aides that the 
judges action should not be construed as mutiny or insubordination 
under the constitution the supreme court chief justice is 
appointed by the president with the consent of the national 
assembly 
law groups and opposition political parties also have expressed 
their support of the judgess call for judicial reforms

vice president george bush an opponent of gun 
control says he empathizes with carl rowan the syndicated 
columnist who shot and wounded a back yard intruder even though he 
doesnt agree with his views 
its all easy to secondguess now this was some skinnydipper 
in the jacuzzi and all let others debate that one out there 
bush told reporters thursday 
rowan who has written columns favoring stricter gun control 
shot the trespassing teenager who had been swimming with a group 
of friends in rowans back yard pool with a pistol police said 
was unregistered 
i kind of empathize with what he was going through when 
somebody was coming at him bush said rowan has said he fired 
the shot after the teenager lunged at him and that the incident 
did nothing to soften his support for strict gun control laws 
bush spoke with reporters on air force two as he returned to 
washington from richmond va where he had given a speech on drug 
abuse 
asked if he had any advice for rowan the vice president said 
no i dont think i have any advice for him im not having much 
fun out of it i think its a matter where i cant make much of a 
contribution by saying anything 
let him think it out sort it out he doesnt need my 
editorial help just like sometimes i dont need his bush said 
bush also challenged democrat michael dukakis whom he is nearly 
certain to face in the november election to come up with a price 
tag for his proposal for a buildup in conventional forces bush 
said the massachusetts governors proposals could jeopardize 
efforts to reach a strategic arms treaty with the soviets 
where do you go when you get into the most expensive side of 
this of all which is conventional forces the vice president 
asked 
jim steinberg deputy issues director for the dukakis campaign 
said halting the administrations strategic defense initiative 
would free up funds to pay for strengthening conventional defense 
dukakis called for the scrapping of sdi in a foreign policy and 
defense speech in washington earlier this week 
on other matters bush 
said he sees no conflict at all in the fact that the 
lobbying firm headed by his newly named communications adviser 
james h lake represents japanese autoparts and electronics 
companies noting that lake was an unsalaried volunteer bush said 
are we going to go now and look at every client for every law 
firm for every volunteer 
contended he had no recollection of ever having met former 
wedtech corp president anthony guariglia who testified at the 
wedtech corruption trial this week in new york that he sought 
bushs help as part of an effort to obtain a navy pontoon contract 
in exchange for raising 200000 for president reagans 1984 
reelection campaign 
was the guy ever at a fund raiser or something maybe but i 
dont remember anything the name or anything about him bush 
said 
said he didnt favor relocating the us embassy from tel aviv 
to jerusalem which the israelis claim as their capital 
jerusalem should never be divided again but it should be a 
matter that should be part of the negotiations to bring peace to 
the middle east bush said 
dukakis has said he favors relocating the embassy but later 
denied saying he accepted israels claim to sovereignty over all of 
jerusalem 
said he favors action by congress in including a repeal of the 
windfall profits tax on oil in a new strippeddown trade bill 
designed to avoid another presidential veto but still has problems 
with parts of the bill that erode presidential power 
bush was to spend today in washington on saturday he was to 
visit a family farm near springfield ill and attend republican 
rallies in springfield and in chicago

car thieves like sporty special models and in 
some cases theyre interested in only the radio says an insurance 
industry study the cars safest from theft are small and midsized 
domestics especially station wagons 
a report by the highway loss data institute said thursday that 
the likelihood of theft ranges widely among cars and that the most 
frequent targets are volkswagens where the radio is easy to steal 
and is a powerful lure 
a study of 198587 model cars found seven volkswagens among the 
11 car models with the highest rate of theft claims all 11 cars 
were imports and in many cases thieves were only interested in the 
radios said the report 
the radios are easily accessible said rick elder vice 
president of the insurance group in an interview you can snap 
them out of one car and easily put them into another its a very 
attractive theft target 
but when thieves are out to steal an entire car they are likely 
to pick expensive sporty models including a number of us cars 
the study concluded high on the list is the porsche 911 coupe 
followed by the chevrolet corvette and the chevrolet camaro the 
report said 
it said sports and speciality cars continued to account for an 
overwhelming share of total theft losses while these cars 
account for about 15 percent of the total number of cars insured 
they represent 40 percent of the dollars paid on insurance claims 
because of theft 
the least likely cars to be stolen or broken into are small and 
midsized domestic models led by the mercury lynx said the 
insurance group 
according to the report the volkwagen gti which had the 
highest theft rate was nearly 70 times as likely to be the target 
of a thief as the lynx 
other cars with little interest from thieves according to the 
study were the mercury grand marquis station wagon and mercury 
topaz the plymouth colt vista wagon and pontiac sunbird wagon 
the study covered 198587 models 
among vans pickup trucks and utility vehicles the 1985 jeep 
cj7 and the 1986 and 1987 suzuki samurai had the highest 
likelihood for theft small pickup trucks generally had the lowest 
theft rate 
some cars lost the interest of thieves after their design 
changed or in some cases security devices were installed the 
report said for example the theft rate for the chevrolet corvette 
declined somewhat after new security system was put in the 1986 
model 
but it said design changes in the mazda rx7 and toyota celica 
resulted in sharply lower theft losses in 1986 and 1987 elder 
attributed the decline to thieves not having a market for the newly 
designed parts 
the demand for the stolen parts hasnt built up he 
suggested 
meanwhile theft losses for the buick regal and chevrolet monte 
carlo both of which adopted a more sporty look in 1987 increased 
sharply that year the report said 
the report tracked theft losses during the first year of 
availability for the 1987 models cars the first two years of 
availability for 1986 models and the first three years of 
availability for 1985 models 
the highway loss data institute which is part of the insurance 
institute for highway safety gathers and processes a broad range 
of insurance statistical data

fears of a japanese terrorist attack have led 
police and intelligence forces to put a 49 million security net 
around the coming economic summit in canadas largest city 
on thursday police helicopters swirled overhead checking the 
tops of skyscrapers in downtown toronto while about 3000 officers 
and security agents prepared to protect the leaders of the united 
states japan britain france west germany italy canada and the 
european commission 
a japanese diplomat in manila said a suspected japanese red army 
terrorist arrested in the philippines last week had planned to 
establish a base for attacks on the toronto summit and the olympics 
in seoul south korea 
metropolitan toronto police supt bernard nadeau said the report 
was being investigated 
he said canadian immigration officers had stepped up scrutiny of 
everyone entering the country and that demonstrators of any kind 
will not be allowed anywhere near the threeday meeting which 
starts sunday 
the first leaders will reach toronto today president reagan 
will be among the last to arrive on sunday morning 
the biggest threat is terrorism nadeau said in an 
interview historically theyve always been active at summit 
conferences they have a way of getting into a country illegally 
the reported arrest in the philippines follows the detention of 
a suspected japanese red army terrorist yu kikumura 35 on the 
new jersey turnpike in april police found homemade pipe bombs and 
false papers in his car 
on june 12 an 18yearold japanese college student yoshio 
kosugi was arrested in philadelphia when police found a rifle and 
grenades in his luggage 
japans radical middle core faction fired five homemade rockets 
during the tokyo summit in 1986 but the projectiles fell short of 
their target 
in a message directed at any terrorist groups contemplating an 
attack in toronto security officials this month put on a 
demonstration by a rapid deployment assault squad trained for the 
summit borne by helicopters and equipped with highpowered m16 
rifles the commandos will not be seen again unless something 
happens nadeau said 
police said japanese prime minister noboru takeshita british 
prime minister margaret thatcher and reagan are considered the most 
likely targets in reagans case possibly from middle east 
extremists or a lone attacker such as john hinckley jr who shot 
and wounded the president in 1981 
mrs thatcher narrowly escaped injury at a party conference in 
brighton england on oct 12 1984 when the irish republican army 
planted a bomb in her hotel 
the ira claimed responsibility for a boobytrap bomb that killed 
six british soldiers in lisburn northern ireland on wednesday 
were uncomfortable any time british royalty visits or anyone 
connected with the british government nadeau said were 
always concerned that the ira could be active 
us secretary of state george shultz wants terrorism on the 
summit agenda including a proposal for all countries to deny 
refueling to airplane hijackers he said the fight against 
terrorism must be renewed because it appears to be on the rise 
again 
security around the leaders will be so tight that torontos 34 
million residents are unlikely to get a glimpse of them except on 
television police said highways will be closed as motorcades come 
and go and up to 15 city blocks will be sealed off at given times 
the leaders are not here to be seen by the people said 
nadeau this is a business meeting and thats the way it will be 
treated 
local businessmen have criticized prime minister brian mulroney 
for staging the summit in the heart of canadas biggest city the 
original idea starting with the first economic summit at 
rambouillet france in 1975 was to allow world leaders to thrash 
out problems at a quiet retreat well out of public view 
previous north american gatherings have been at the puerto rican 
resort of dorado montebello quebec and williamsburg va the 
1987 summit was on an island in venice 
mulroney reportedly chose toronto to help boost the citys bid 
for the 1996 olympic games and to quell resentment after the 
federal government granted taxfree international banking center 
status to montreal and vancouver but left out toronto

britains chief financial official predicted the 
leading industrialized nations will agree to grant major debt 
relief to the poorest countries at an economic summit next week 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson also said britain will 
press at the sevennation meeting for a freeze on the huge 
subsidies rich countries pay their farmers 
the official of prime minister margaret thatchers conservative 
government said britain has a threepoint plan for debt concessions 
to help the poorest countries mainly africas subsaharan nations 
for the first time i feel we are close to an agreement 
lawson said this week 
he said resistance to major concessions to the africans at 
previous summits was based partly on fears of touching off demands 
by the biggest debtors the latin american nations for similar 
concessions 
that resistance is now crumbling said lawson people do 
now accept it is necessary to address the problems of these nations 
the africans separately 
lawsons plan is one of several proposals on how to tackle the 
overwhelming debts of the poorest countries the plans will be put 
forward at the june 1921 summit of the united states canada 
japan britain west germany france and italy 
the british plan envisages writing off longstanding government 
aid loans to the poorest countries rescheduling other debts and 
granting concessionary interest rates 
in a separate initiative french president francois mitterrand 
a socialist announced last week he will propose the seven nations 
wipe out onethird of the debts owed to them by the poorest 
countries or slash interest rates or extend repayment periods 
mrs thatcher has led attempts in the european economic 
community a 12nation trading bloc to curb a runaway farm budget 
in toronto britain was likely to fall in its views midway 
between the united states which has proposed eliminating farm 
subsidies by the year 2000 and the other europeans who envisage 
controls on continuing subsidies 
lawson said statistics showed japan subsidized its agricultural 
production by 75 percent in 1986 up from 54 percent in 1980 
he said the european community subsidy was 49 percent in 1986 
the latest year available up from 36 percent in 1980 and the 
united states 35 percent up from 15 percent 
in a television interview in washington us secretary of state 
george shultz said farm subsidies were costing the united states 
western europe and japan 150 billion a year 
speaking on the us information agency tv program worldnet 
he described the situation as crazy and said let the market

according to one publisher we spoke to 1 percent of all books 
sold in japan deal with the theme of the jewish conspiracy in the 
world economy said rabbi abraham cooper associate dean of the 
simon wiesenthal center the secondlargest jewish organization in 
the united states 
uno is scheduled to leave next wednesday for a tour of the 
middle east that will take him to israel syria jordan and egypt 
his visit will be the first ever by a cabinet official since japan 
opened diplomatic ties with israel in 1952 according to the 
foreign ministry 
books blaming everything from the chernobyl nuclear accident to 
the rapid appreciation of the yen on the jewish conspiracy 
brought cooper and alfred balitzer professor of political science 
at californias claremont mckenna college to japan last week 
cooper pointed to scores of books laid out on a table in his 
tokyo hotel room the cover of one showed a blue star of david 
transposed over a sign post saying wall street 
over 80000 copies of understand the jews and the epoch comes 
into view by masami uno the most popular writer in the genre 
have been printed since the book was released less than one month 
ago said a spokesman for the nihon bungei publishing house 
in all sales of unos three main books go into the hundreds of 
thousands of copies 
foreign minister uno is not related to the author 
titles of books by other writers include how to make money 
with stocks the jews aim at and the jewish plan for conquest of 
the world 
there is 100 times as much printed in the united states but 
none sell like this here they sell like hotcakes and no one speaks 
out against them balitzer said 
the people of israel are not japan watchers but they read the 
newspapers and they see articles about these books 
cooper said this may be a bum rap for uno when he goes to 
israel but if japanese leaders decide to avoid answering this 
issue their silence will be taken by arabs as a deep reservoir of 
antijewish feelings 
he said the japanese government has remained quiet on the issue 
to avoid conflict with arab nations which supply japan with 70 
percent of its oil 
in 1987 then foreign minister tadashi kuranari denounced 
antisemitic writings in the diet japans parliament but it was 
largely ignored by the japanese media 
an israeli official in tokyo said he doubted whether the issue 
will be raised during unos visit but he said the israeli 
government has expressed informal concern 
the matter doesnt directly affect us he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity the real target of the books is american 
jews in israel it is just seen as strange that japanese would 
write such things 
cooper and balitzer believe the books represent more than 
anything else ignorance and curiousity about the jews who number 
400 households in japan only six of those families reside here 
permanently 
its antisemitism without antisemites we see no problem of 
violence directed against the jewish community here cooper 
explained most japanese dont really know what a jew is 
balitzer said when the authors say the jews control the 
world they see to be admiring this their attitude is how can we 
do that 
a foreign ministry official also speaking privately said he 
did not know whether the issue would be discussed publication of 
such books is legal and cant be stopped but it is unwanted by 
us 
when asked why it has taken 36 years for japan to send a cabinet 
minister to israel the official said there are many nations yet 
to be officially visited there is no special reason 
the israeli official said israelijapanese trade volume was up 
84 percent in the first three months of this year israel maintains 
a trade surplus with japan and the israeli government estimates 
trade between the two countries this year will total 12 billion

eyeing the modern landscape southern 
baptists see a host of evils abortion drug abuse homosexuality 
materialism secular humanism sexual promiscuity rebellion 
against authority and the new age movement 
these and other presentday manifestations were declared blights 
on human life as 32727 messengers from the nations largest 
protestant denomination concluded their annual convention thursday 
the new age movement a relatively recent arrival among the 
churchs list of repudiated trends was likened to an underlying 
disorder behind them all 
the philosophy is as old as the garden of eden where 
satan perpetrated three of the false beliefs of the new age 
movement promising you will be wise you will be as gods and you 
will not die a convention resolution said 
it said the movement has become a powerful political 
philosophical and economic force in our contemporary culture and is 
exerting its influence into every facet of american life 
while its aim is to become a oneworld religion it is 
diametrically contrary to both new testament christianity and our 
american heritage the resolution said 
it said the movement gives people false hope by its beliefs in 
reincarnation and in endeavoring to reveal a persons future 
through astrology fortune telling and palm reading 
other purported beliefs of the new age movement listed by the 
resolution are that there are many ways to eternal life and that 
all will be saved by secular humanism which testifies by its own 
manifesto that no deity will save us we must save ourselves 
the media and entertainment industry gives the new age 
movement widespread acceptance and crediblity helping it finds its 
way into every facet of american life the resolution said 
it was among a score of resolutions deploring an erosion of 
moral sanity adopted by the annual convention of the 
147millionmember denomination 
the fiveday meeting including two preliminary days of 
virtually nonstop preaching and auxiliary conferences featured a 
running conflict between fundamentalist and moderate factions of 
the divided denomination 
it was the 10th year in which fundamentalists predominated in 
the conventions presidential election which was won by the rev 
jerry vines of jacksonville fla and in approving measures pushed 
by their camp 
a resolution that was exceptionally disturbing to moderates puts 
limitations on a classic protestant concept the priesthood of 
the believer which asserts equal rights and authority of laity 
and clergy 
the convention declared that misunderstanding and abuse of 
the doctrine had undermined the authority of pastors over their 
congregations 
this prompted sharp protests from moderates who charged it 
betrayed a principle of the 16th century protestant reformation 
about 200 dissenters marched to the alamo where they tore up 
copies of the resolution 
the convention approved a 198889 national budget of 1456 
million up 56 million from this years which includes increases 
for all church agencies except the baptist joint committee on 
public affairs 
that agency representing eight baptist bodies on churchstate 
and religious liberty issues has been under fire by 
fundamentalists and allocations to it were cut by 48400 
its executive director the rev james dunn of washington 
received enthusiastic applause thursday when he gave the agencys 
report particularly when he praised the priesthood of the 
believer concept as enshrining members liberty against clerical 
encroachment 
trustees of the denominations socialethics agency the 
christian life commission said a search was on for a doctrinally 
sound director who favors the death penalty and opposes abortion 
the agencys previous director the rev larry baker quit under 
fundamentalist pressure over his positions on those issues

the strongest advocates of closing the 
revolving door connecting pentagon procurement officials with 
defense contractors used to blame the system not the integrity of 
individuals for problems in military purchasing 
but a growing bribery investigation indicates the problem is 
even worse than imagined by the critics who have long sought ways 
to curb the departure of top pentagon officials for jobs with 
companies doing business with the defense department 
a search warrant revealed thursday that the government is 
investigating the bribery of public officials as part of a 
scheme in which defense contractors got inside information from 
former government officials whom they had hired as consultants 
now the integrity of individuals is under attack as well as the 
system in which the defense department relies on a small number of 
large contractors whose main business is selling to the pentagon 
this lack of competition blurred the healthy distinction 
between buyer and seller and this is vividly illustrated when we 
look at the problem of the revolving door rep barbara boxer 
dcalif said in congressional testimony back in 1985 
she said that as the numbers of highranking government 
officials moving to defense contractors increased the interests of 
the pentagon and the corporate suppliers merged 
the real problem with an environment that stresses cooperation 
between contractor and government is that no one is watching out 
for the taxpayer she said the result is a procurement system 
in which price is the least important factor 
but she added then one thing is clear the integrity of 
individual procurement officials is not the issue what is 
important is an existing employment pattern that does not protect 
the public against the misuse of its tax dollars 
thursday as new information on the latest scandal became 
public boxer recognized the change 
now it is bad enough that such a situation undermines public 
confidence in the procurement system she said in a floor speech 
it is far worse to learn that former and current public officials 
may have broken the law in a rush to cash in on the contracts that 
they gained at taxpayers expense nothing could be lower than 
that 
and in a letter she asked the defense department inspector 
generals office to determine whether there is cause to believe 
that any former pentagon official who walked through the revolving 
door violated a 1987 law 
the law prohibits former top pentagon employees or military 
officers from accepting pay from contractors for a twoyear period 
in jobs involving defense procurement 
the law includes civil fines of up to 250000 for exgovernment 
officers who violate the provision and up to 500000 for anyone 
who offers or actually pays compensation to the exofficial while 
knowing such compensation violates the law 
the law does not apply to companies with contracts of less than 
10 million 
the senate tightened the noose last april by voice vote it 
passed ethics legislation that said top executive branch officials 
including generals and admirals could not lobby the executive 
branch or members of congress for a year 
a house judiciary subcommittee headed by rep barney frank 
dmass is working on its version of the legislation 
a 10yearold law makes it a crime for an executive branch 
official to lobby his or her former agency within a year of leaving 
the agency 
an illustration of the revolving door is the case of melvyn r 
paisley a major target in the current probe 
he left his navy job in april 1987 to become a washington 
consultant and some of the largest defense contractors lined up to 
hire him 
paisley 63 had played a key role in president reagans naval 
buildup as a private businessman he was selling information a 
commodity much in demand among the various companies seeking any 
edge they could get in the chance to sell weapons to the government 
in the past there have been news stories about men like former 
gen alton d slay who retired from the air force feb 1 1981 
with the military he was involved in decisionmaking on numerous 
major weapons systems 
after retirement he formed a consulting firm slay enterprises 
inc with clients that included top contractors with whom he had a 
long association 
one was lockheed in 1969 as commander of the air force flight 
test center slay had declared tests on lockheeds c5a cargo plane 
successful even though the planes engines clogged and had to be 
shut down while idling 
how bad has the problem been 
a general accounting office study in 1986 said more than 20 
percent of the people who left jobs at the pentagon in 1983 and 
1984 to join defense contractors were spending at least some time 
working on the same projects they had previously overseen 
the study added that 45 percent of the former pentagon employees 
said their new jobs in industry required them to communicate with 
former colleagues at the pentagon and 26 percent acknowledged they 
were in positions to affect the work of their future employer 
during their last two years at the pentagon 
the study was entitled the dod revolving door

more than 650 leading publishers from 50 countries 
have spent this week finding ways to conquer book hunger in the 
developing world which experts say is nearing crisis proportions 
in many countries 
the international publishers association chose the dilemma of 
book hunger as the theme of its 23rd congress and said feeding 
this hunger was a key to development in the third world and to 
expansion of worldwide publishing 
guest speakers including foreign minister natwar singh of india 
culture minister wang meng of china unesco directorgeneral dr 
federico mayor and wole soyinka winner of the 1986 nobel prize for 
literature all agreed that cashstarved developing countries face 
great difficulty in obtaining and producing the books they need 
although the number of titles published has nearly tripled in 
the last 30 years the gulf between the haves and the havenots 
persists said mayor 
tony read director of the book development council the 
overseas division of the british publishers association said a 
survey of a small unspecified englishspeaking african country in 
1980 found the average availability of textbooks in primary schools 
was 11 textbooks per 1000 students and the situation had gotten 
worse 
in some countries he said books are virtually not available 
anywhere in the educational system at all and in others only at 
secondary or university levels 
dozens of examples could be produced from a wide range of 
countries in africa the caribbean latin american and east and 
south asia to demonstrate the fact of book hunger which in many 
cases becomes actual book starvation he said in a report to the 
congress 
j alexis koutchoumow the associations secretarygeneral said 
one of the main causes is that governments do not really grant 
the needful priority to the book and yet the book is vital to 
training at every level 
read said books could be made available more cheaply to 
developing countries in three ways by government aid by licensing 
reproduction rights at the lowest possible cost and by having 
publishers in advanced nations produce special lowcost editions 
for developing nations 
but soyinka said no amount of foreign aid will solve the problem 
of book hunger unless developing countries themselves make a 
political commitment to conquer it 
suzanne mubarak wife of egyptian president hosni mubarak and an 
expert on reading skills said only 5 percent of books produced in 
arab countries deal with basic sciences and only 10 percent with 
applied sciences 
she said there was an urgent need for collaboration between 
international and national publishers to make serious educational 
and cultural publications accessible to developing nations 
countries like japan and korea who have made spectacular 
progress in the postwar era have concentrated their efforts on the 
promotion of the physical sciences and mathematics both within the 
school and beyond she said 
this is definitely the example to be followed by other third 
world nations if they are to narrow the existing scientific and 
technological gap between them and the industrialized nations 
mayor noted that 1990 has been designated international literacy 
year by the united nations and urged the publishers to join in the 
campaign to teach every child and adult to read by the turn of the 
century 
he also called on the publishers to join unesco in studying 
cheaper ways to produce and distribute books in developing nations 
singh urged advanced publishing nations not to use developing 
countries as dumping grounds for intellectually inferior crumbs 
in glossy jackets and not to perpetuate their own intellectual 
dominance and versions of history

a 441 billion blueprint for next years farm 
spending has won house approval and now is headed for the senate 
where a slightly more expensive version is in the works 
urban grumbling about farm program costs preceded 34354 house 
approval of the measure which is 25 billion below the 
administrations request and 12 billion below this years level 
complaints were less strident though than last years outcry 
following disclosures of milliondollar payments to huge 
agribusiness concerns as part of programs supposedly designed to 
rescue family farmers 
criticism was muted somewhat by fresh curbs imposed by congress 
on the size of individual farm payments 
meanwhile expanded us exports plus a revival in the farm 
economy have reduced program outlays from a peak of 26 billion in 
1986 to a current level estimated at about 17 billion 
the house measure calls for outlays of 441 billion for the 
fiscal year that starts oct 1 a rival measure still being 
fashioned by the senate would produce an additional 3 billion in 
spending 
contained in the house measure are 163 billion for food and 
nutrition programs 124 billion for rural development and 68 
billion to replace losses of the governmentowned commodity credit 
corp which operates usdas price and income support programs 
the level for covering commodity credit corp losses was 143 
billion below the amount approved last year and represented the 
major savings in the bill some critics said the plan appeared 
overly optimistic and that a supplemental appropriation might be 
needed later 
it appears to me that there are lots of mirrors on the ceiling 
and lots of smoke coming from the cloakroom said rep robert 
walker rpa 
declines in program costs did not completely mute urban critics 
of the farm program 
rep charles schumer dny complained about the targeted 
export assistance program which subsidizes advertising and 
promotion of us farm exports he said a report from the general 
accounting office showed mismanagement 
he lauded the appropriations committee for rejecting a proposed 
increase in the program and rep leon panetta dcalif said 
there would be agriculture committee hearings on the issue later in 
the summer 
the house spent two hours debating a proposal by rep joseph 
dioguardi rny to bar new farmers home administration loans to 
borrowers already in default in a brief parliamentary skirmish 
farm lawmakers then prevented dioguardi from bringing the measure 
to a vote 
they received lopsided support from most of their urban 
colleagues

chicagos central library burned down in the 
great fire of 1871 and housed over the next 100 years in an old 
water tank and a warehouse will get a new 140 million home 
designed in a yearlong contest 
an 11member committee is expected to announce monday its choice 
of one of five teams competing to design and build the harold 
washington library center honoring the citys first black mayor 
who died in november 
the jury includes vincent scully of yale universitys history of 
art department and architect henry cobb of the architectural firm 
im pei amp partners of new york 
proposals for the design of the 700000squarefoot library 
range from a bold futuristic look to a more traditional 11story 
office building 
inside the library will offer international television programs 
picked up by satellite a 400seat theater and a 23millionvolume 
book collection 
the chicago public library board of directors plans to vote june 
28 to accept or reject the jurys recommendation 
crowds have pored over the proposed models and sketches on 
display in the former central library now a cultural center 
about 15000 people filled out comment cards in the exhibits 
first 10 days forcing the city to print 70000 additional cards 
said elizabeth hollander chicagos commissioner of planning 
she refused to reveal any of the comments which were forwarded 
to the jury but each design has attracted passionate opinions 
both for and against she said 
in addition to the architectural goals the city has a practical 
one with its scheduled completion in 1991 chicagos central 
library will be adequately housed for the first time in decades 
after the fire of 1871 destroyed the library along with most of 
the city the library was housed in an old water tank a central 
library was constructed in 1897 but it was deemed inadequate 
within two decades 
to make way for the cultural center the city moved the central 
library collection into a warehouse in 1974 though the materials 
are accessible to the public the city doesnt consider the 
facility a central library 
a number of sites were proposed for the library including an 
abandoned state street department store and in 1986 the city 
finally decided on a site in the south loop 
the design competition has been compared to the famed 1922 
tribune tower contest which drew hundreds of entries from 
architects worldwide to design the home of the chicago tribune but 
only five teams submitted designs for the library 
the chicago chapter of the american institute of architects 
blames the dirth of competitors on the contests strict rules 
which require an architect and contractor to team up to submit 
plans that include designing and building the process is intended 
to avoid cost overruns and establishes a strict timetable for 
completion 
we endorse designbuild competition as a process said john 
syvertsen vice president of the chicago aia board but a 
designbuild competition is inappropriate for a building of this 
complexity 
toronto architect arthur erickson of the john buck company 
developed a design that employs bold geometric shapes and a huge 
outdoor plaza 
adrian smith of the chicago firm of skidmore owings amp merrill 
designed a cubelike building that blends traditional library looks 
with contemporary architecture for the library 88 partnership 
entry 
chicago architect dirk lohan of the metropolitanlohan team also 
employed a cubic style that has the look of an office building 
architect helmut jahn of chicago designed for the 
paschentishmanjahn team a building that is elevated 80 feet with 
several structures underneath 
chicagoan thomas beeby dean of the yale school of architecture 
designed a cube that is faced with brick on three sides and glass 
on the fourth 
despite the differing designs the jury will be concerned about 
more than looks 
its like a beautiful woman said norman ross a former vice 
president of the first national bank of chicago and jury chairman 
its nice to be attracted to whats on the outside but if 
youre not more concerned about whats on the inside then youre 
in trouble

president daniel ortega told domestic 
critics they were playing with fire by opposing new economic 
measures to heal the warravaged economy and warned of a crackdown 
if the criticism continued 
ortega said thursday that opponents of his program which 
includes a drastic devaluation of the national currency and a big 
increase in the price of gasoline could disappear if they dont 
respond with the patriotism our country demands 
ortegas leftist sandinista government announced wednesday a 
major devaluation of the cordoba nicaraguas currency one us 
dollar is now worth 80 cordobas at the official rate before the 
devaluation it was worth 13 cordobas 
the president announced an end to government control of wages 
and prices in a speech on tuesday he said the nicaraguan economy 
was a free market in a revolutionary state oriented toward 
socialism 
the government also nearly doubled the price of gasoline on 
wednesday 
ortega told factory workers on thursday that the superior 
council of private enterprise the conservative newspaper la prensa 
and opposition political parties were playing with fire in 
opposing the changes 
the government was prepared to strike and barricade the 
political space to those who arent in agreement with the economic 
measures ortega said 
we saw ourselves obligated to take measures that we did not 
want to take he said in explaining the reforms to the workers 
but he added the program was not a concession in political 
ideology nor is it a return to capitalism 
on tuesday the president said the changes were needed to spur 
production and enable the economy to survive the damage inflicted 
by the more than 6yearold war with the usbacked contra rebels 
the united states has accompanied its assistance to the rebels 
with severe economic sanctions against nicaragua the sandinistas 
say the war has caused 3 billion in damages to the economy 
the government last enacted economic reforms in february when 
it set monthly wages at between 50 and 70 and official prices for 
nearly all basic products

panama is suffering from a virus of 
corruption and the political crisis can only worsen as long as 
gen manuel antonio noriega remains in power ousted vice president 
roderick esquivel said 
panama is like a home with termites from a distance one sees 
a beautifully painted house and from the inside everything is 
falling down esquivel said in an interview thursday with the 
associated press 
the whole building is wormeaten he added we have to 
shun the virus of corruption and the authoritarianism that is 
consuming us

president eric arturo delvalle in february after delvalle tried to 
fire noriega commander of panamas 15000member defense forces

the lower house of congress accused 
cocaine kingpins of trying to take over the government and called 
for a united front to preserve democracy 
the declaration was approved unanimously thursday in response to 
allegations that top government and military officials are being 
paid by the drug lords 
on wednesday the government closed a radio station and a 
television station that broadcast a talk show with convicted 
cocaine trafficker roberto suarez gomez the government accused the 
stations of violating the law and of slandering the government and 
the president 
the congressional statement said the international drug mafia 
is not hesitating to use all its resources to dirty the honor of 
government institutions 
it said cocaine traffickers are trying to undermine the 
democratic system for the purpose of assuming political power 
bolivia a country of 67 million in the heart of south america 
produces a third of the cocaine that reaches us and european 
markets 
in recent weeks congress has been investigating a series of 
videotaped meetings in 1985 between suarez gomez and a top 
congressmen a retired general and other political figures 
a special session of congress has been deliberating a stringent 
antidrug bill that would declare most of the countrys coca 
plantations illegal but the investigation has delayed a vote on 
the proposed law 
in the first three months of this year bolivian police and us 
drug agents confiscated four tons of cocaine paste the same amount 
confiscated during all of last year

president reagan may visit the parched 
midwest although no such trip is yet on his public schedule 
reagans spokesman said after announcing an interagency panel 
appointed by the president to deal with the widespread drought 
spokesman marlin fitzwater also said he expected the drought to 
be on the agenda for the sevennation economic summit june 1921 in 
toronto at least for discussion with canada and probably with 
other countries as well 
fitzwater said the task force will study current federal 
programs that address the situation to determine their adequacy and 
effectiveness 
he said the task force will include agriculture secretary 
richard lyng interior secretary donald hodel and representatives 
of the vice presidents office the army corps of engineers the 
energy department the tennessee valley authority the office of 
management and budget and the federal emergency management agency 
when asked if emergency assistance to droughtstricken farmers 
would be expedited fitzwater said no decisions had been made but 
the emergency management agency was included because of its role in 
providing such relief 
the group will be known as the interagency drought policy 
committee 
after making an initial report in two weeks on the immediate 
situation the group is to make an additional report in 30 days on 
more longrange problems 
the president is very concerned about the current drought and 
wants to make certain that everything that the federal government 
can do to assist will be done said fitzwater who grew up on a 
farm in kansas 
a spokesman for vice president george bush said bush is visiting 
chicago and springfield ill on saturday and might visit drought 
areas 
when asked if he could put the drought in a personal context 
based on his own experience fitzwater said 
there is no more hopeless or helpless feeling than seeing your 
crops dry up because there is no alleviating that disaster if you 
are a farmer and youve secured big loans for your crops youve 
borrowed money to put that seed in the ground and you know its 
not going to yield you anything 
fitzwater also spoke of a visit to kansas at the end of may and 
said you could already see the wheat and corn had been stunted 
in many fields normal wheat would be up about three feet high and 
the wheat was thin sparse and about six inches

a british judge sentenced an arab man to 11 years 
in prison for keeping a cache of explosives for the palestine 
liberation organization in his home 
judge christopher french of old baileys central criminal court 
told ismael sowan on thursday that the sentence was the very least 
he could give for his extremely grave offences 
sowan 28 was convicted wednesday of storing explosives rifles 
and grenades in his home in the eastern port of hull 
in announcing the sentence thursday the judge said we were 
reminded only yesterday of the appalling use to which these 
materials can be put the reference was to a bombing in northern 
ireland that killed six soldiers and wounded 10 civilians wednesday 
sowan was arrested last august when police were investigating 
the shooting death of an arab cartoonist ali naji awad aladhami 
although he was arrested in hull sowans trial was held in 
london at the old bailey court because cases involving security and 
terrorism usually are tried there and because scotland yard had 
participated in the investigation 
sowan testified that the weapons found in locked suitcases in 
his bathroom belonged to abder mustapha a known plo guerrilla 
suspected of organizing aladhamis murder 
police said that mustapha fled to the middle east after 
aladhami was shot in the head sowan a university research 
assistant is not a suspect in that crime although he was a friend 
and associate of mustapha 
after his arrest sowan claimed to be funneling information 
about mustapha to the israeli secret service mossad officials at 
the israeli embassy in london confirmed that sowan was in contact 
with them and that he had told them that he had mustaphas weapons 
british police and intelligence agencies said they did not know 
about the spying operation and did not receive information from 
mossad about the weapons cache during the investigation 
david cocks sowans defense attorney said the israeli factor 
made his client innocent

even if the united states were not the most 
powerful of the wests big 7 nations ronald reagans easy 
masterofceremonies manner would make him the natural center of 
attraction at the economic summit that opens sunday 
thats the way it has been since reagans first session with the 
leaders of canada britain france italy japan and west germany 
in montebello back in 1981 
the new president fought hard at his first summit for 
reaganomics although his tough monetary policy was a bitter 
pill for some of his partners reagan prevailed 
in 1983 on his home turf at williamsburg va reagan ran into 
a momentary challenge from canadas pierre trudeau who grumbled 
about the muscular us foreign policy and said the participants 
should be working as hard as they can for peace 
but the summiteers wound up endorsing reagans plan to deploy 
new nuclear missiles in europe trudeau backed off and he wont be 
at the table to needle the president this time 
in 1985 in tokyo reagan steered the big 7 into a strong 
statement against terrorism two years later it is no longer a 
controversial issue 
one of the few hard decisions expected here is a declaration 
that governments should not allow airplane hijackers to refuel the 
idea is to carry the us noplacetohide policy a step further 
the allies with the exception of britains margaret thatcher 
usually are not that eager to take a militant stand against 
terrorism reagans biggest accomplishment in his seven economic 
summits may be lining them up in tokyo 
but this time it may be a little different it is reagans last 
round with mrs thatcher and the other summiteers and he is 
beginning to take on the mantle of an amiable lame duck 
he will not try to rally his democratic partners to an economic 
or foreign policy crusade the agenda is carefully scripted to 
avoid controversy and while it cannot be guaranteed to come out 
that way the 14th summit of the industrialized democracies will be 
strong on conviviality and short on decisions 
in a sense this is a tribute to reagans ability to promote his 
freeenterprise views as well as to americas strength 
japan and west germany bowing to us pressure are now buying 
more american goods and help to third world debtor nations may 
take the form of grants or debt forgiving and not 
governmentsubsidized interest rate reductions that the reagan 
administration opposes 
for next weeks summit there is an implicit agreement to push 
the host canadian prime minister brian mulroney to center stage 
mulroney facing federal elections in less than 15 months hopes to 
profit politically from the summit and discord would not be the 
way to demonstrate his skills as a western leader 
he has pushed divisive foreign policy issues into the 
background and will try to lead the summit into a quiet discussion 
of technical economic problems 
at least one could be explosive the united states would like to 
bring down agricultural subsidies and there could be a wrangle 
with france and west germany which are determined to protect their 
farmers 
but this issue might be sidestepped as requiring further study 
and the threeday meeting is apt to be a pleasant closing act on 
the world stage for reagan the biggest concern as the seven 
leaders head here has nothing to do with economics or foreign 
policy it is the plague of our age terrorism 
the canadian hosts are taking security precautions without the 
proper credentials it will be impossible to get within three city 
blocks of the downtown convention center where the leaders will 
meet 
and they will hold their discussions in a windowless underground 
room presumably out of harms way

south korea has ordered metals and 
crude oil from china in what would be the first officially 
acknowledged direct trade between the two countries trade 
officials said today 
south koreas office of supply said its officials ordered 15000 
tons of pig iron from inner mongolia during a recent visit to 
boutou in the northern region of china 
the officials also negotiated for importing 3000 tons of ingot 
aluminum by august and 10000 tons next year from inner mongolia 
and an order was expected to be placed soon 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said that 
saving in shipping cost was one reason for buying from inner 
mongolia in addition to the governments new policy of promoting 
direct trade and other economic relations with china 
south korea has conducted trade with china through third 
parties such as hong kong because of the lack of formal ties 
between the two countries 
china backed north korea when it invaded south korea in 1950 
hundreds of thousands of chinese troops fought in the war against 
the united nations forces since the war china has been close to 
north korea and has had cool relations with south korea 
but recently as china has opened up to the capitalist world 
relations have improved with the south 
last year for example indirect trade between the two countries 
was close to 2 billion last year according to some estimates 
up to now south korea has bought aluminum from the united 
states and unspecified eastern europen areas the officials said 
in a related development honam oil refinery co said it has 
ordered 380000 barrels of heavy crude oil from china to be 
delivered beginning late this month 
the price was said to be 80 cents lower than the current 
international level per barrel 
honam is a joint venture between korean business interests and 
caltex of the united states

the reagan administrations plan to conduct 
random drug testing of all 13000 federal prison workers was 
blocked by a federal judge who says it treats innocent employees 
as suspects 
us district judge stanley weigel whose earlier order had 
blocked the program from starting as scheduled may 23 issued a 
preliminary injunction thursday rejecting the governments claims 
that drug testing was justified by concerns about safety and 
corruption 
the administration will appeal the ruling immediately and ask 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals to let testing begin while 
the appeal is pending said assistant us attorney george stoll 
the bureau of prisons was to have been one of the first agencies 
to begin drug testing under president reagans september 1986 
executive order for testing of federal employees in sensitive 
jobs the bureau has declared that all of its workers hold 
sensitive jobs 
the program would force lawabiding employees of the bureau 
of prisons on two hours telephone notice to submit to 
urinalysis testing even though not suspected of any drug use nor of 
any wrongdoing negligence or dereliction of duty weigel said in 
response to a suit by the american federation of government 
employees the largest federal workers union 
there are cases in which compulsory drug testing may be 
justified in the interest of public safety or security or the like 
this is not one rights guaranteed by the constitution of the 
united states must not bend to public clamor 
he said the administrations stated justifications of safety 
prevention of corruption and preservation of public confidence were 
unsupported by any evidence that problems in those areas had been 
caused by employee drug use or would be reduced by random testing 
while drug use in society is a serious problem the judge said 
random testing of innocent employees without a showing of 
individual suspicion or some compelling interest of the government 
as employer is not a constitutional response 
otherwise mass testing of the entire population of the nation 
would be justified weigel said and that would be the 
beginning of a police state 
he also said urine testing was inherently intrusive both in 
the way it is conducted and in the information it can reveal and 
that it does not measure impairment in job performance 
unless a higher court lifts the injunction it is binding until 
the suit goes to trial 
a lawyer for the union said the outcome is likely to be decided 
by us supreme court rulings in pending cases involving 
postaccident testing of railroad workers and testing of us 
customs employees seeking transfers the court is scheduled to hear 
those cases next term which begins this fall 
the war against drugs is going to have to be fought against 
the people who are using drugs and innocent americans have the 
right to be left alone said the lawyer cliff palefsky 
the lawsuit contends drug testing without individual suspicion 
of drug use violates the constitutional ban on unreasonable 
searches and seizures it also contends the program violates 
federal laws that ban discrimination against the handicapped and 
require discipline to be based on job performance

an adviser to president reagan 
thanked honduras for its support of us policy in central america 
especially in neighboring nicaragua 
max kampelman who also is the chief us arms control 
negotiator said nicaraguas leftist sandinista government did not 
appear serious about negotiating a permanent ceasefire with 
ussupported contra rebels 
let me say that the people and government of honduras have 
been extremely cooperative of this struggle for freedom and 
democracy in nicaragua he said at a brief news conference after 
a twohour meeting with president jose azcona hoyo 
and i know that this has caused some difficulties and has been 
a burden and all of us who support democracy are appreciative of 
the fine way in which honduras has assumed that burden kampelman 
said 
the honduran government has provided tacit support to the 
contras since they began their war to topple the sandinista 
government in 1981 including allowing the rebels to maintain base 
camps in honduran territory 
but antius sentiment flared after the forced extradition of 
juan ramon matta an alleged drug trafficker from his tegucigalpa 
home to the united states in april the honduran constitution 
forbids the extradition of honduran nationals

the cabinet today approved a science pact with the 
united states to open up japanese laboratories to american 
researchers and limit the publication of joint research on 
technology with possible military uses 
the agreement on cooperation in science and technology will be 
endorsed when president reagan and japanese prime minister noboru 
takeshita meet privately at the sevennation economic summit june 
20 in toronto said foreign ministry spokesman yoshifumi matsuda 
us and japanese officials finished 10 months of negotiations 
with a new fiveyear agreement to replace a pact that was 
temporarily renewed five times since it expired in 1985 
under the new agreement japan will open up its public and 
private laboratories to american researchers and increase funding 
for scientists and engineers coming to japan 
private industry accounts for 80 percent of the funds japan 
invests in research and development compared to 50 percent in the 
united states as a result the us government has been pushing 
for more access to private laboratories where the bulk of japanese 
research takes place 
us negotiators also won a major concession in talks to renew 
the pact when japan agreed to restrict publication of sensitive 
material on jointly developed technology 
the japanese government has come under attack for what critics 
say are lax controls on exports of sensitive technology to 
communist nations in violation of a western accord 
last year us officials disclosed that toshiba machine co a 
subsidiary of the major japanese electronics maker toshiba corp 
had been exporting submarinesilencing equipment to the soviet 
union 
under the new pact due to take effect when the current 
threemonth extension ends this month both countries also agree to 
protect intellectual rights and determine rights to patents arising 
from joint research before the start of laboratory work

five costa rican fishermen whose boat ran out of 
gas and drifted 3600 miles across the pacific ocean survived for 
five months on rainwater and a diet of fish turtles and sharks 
the coast guard said 
the men aboard the 30foot cadiro iii flagged down a japanese 
tuna boat 700 miles southeast of here wednesday they were in good

the cadiro iii set out jan 19 from puntarenas costa rica for 
an eightday fishing trip but was driven from land by a storm and 
ran out of gas before it could reach port 
a storm came upon us so we started heading for shore but the 
winds were too strong and they pulled us out to sea joel omar 
gonzales one of the fishermen told the coast guard by radio we 
ran out of diesel and have been adrift ever since then 
the men collected rainwater and caught enough sealife to stay 
healthy crawley said 
we ate anything that came near our boat such as fish turtles 
and sharks gonzalez said we got water because it rained a few 
days and we managed to fill a lot of empty cans we had on board our 
boat

tamil rebels have realized the 
government has offered the best deal they can get and may soon sign 
a peace accord a cabinet minister said today 
the statement by lands minister gamini dissanayake added to 
speculation that india and ethnic tamil rebel leaders have agreed 
in principle on a way to end the tamils fiveyear insurgency in 
sri lanka 
on thursday five people including three policemen were killed 
in southern sri lanka in attacks blamed on the peoples liberation 
front 
the group of extremists from the majority sinhalese contends 
that an agreement last year makes too many concessions to the 
tamils and has pledged to killed anyone who supports it 
dissanayake said today that talks between the indian government 
and tamil separatists have reached a very hopeful stage and 
could soon produce an agreement 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi and sri lankan president 
junius r jayewardene signed a peace accord july 29 aimed at ending 
the tamils guerrilla war for an independent homeland the 
agreement called for increased autonomy under regional governing 
bodies 
but the rebels rejected the pact and continued their 
independence struggle india has sent more than 50000 troops to 
the island off its southern coast to enforce the accord 
dissanayake believed to be one of the authors of last years 
accord told the associated press today that the rebels have now 
realized the peace package offered to the tamils under the 
provincial council system of government is the best deal the 
tamils ever hoped to get 
but sources in madras india who insisted on anonymity 
cautioned that several major hurdles remained 
one indian official said the tamils were asking for 770000 in 
payments to help their fighters make the transition from military 
to civilian life 
the official and a tamil rebel source who also spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the plan has not yet been approved by 
velupillai prabhakaran leader of the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam 
prabhakaran who heads the islands strongest militia has been 
in hiding since indian peacekeeping troops drove his men out of 
their northern jaffna peninsula strongholds in october 
officials in india and sri lanka have said that gandhi may fuel 
progress toward a final settlement this weekend during a visit to 
the southern indian state of tamil nadu whose state capital is 
madras 
the officials say gandhi may announce a temporary ceasefire to 
allow talks on the pact to reach conclusion 
government officials in new delhi have said that contacts are 
under way but have declined further comment 
tamils who are mostly hindus and make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people claim they are discriminated against by 
majority sinhalese buddhists who control the government and 
military 
more than 8500 people have died since the tamil insurgency 
began in 1983 
india is involved because many of its own 60 million ethnic 
tamils are sympathetic to the rebel cause

the three children of a wealthy lebanese 
jeweler were released today three days after they were kidnapped 
in syriancontrolled moslem west beirut by gunmen seeking ransom 
money police said 
it was not known whether zuheir ariss owner of a plush jewelry 
shop and a money exchange company paid the 3 million that was 
demanded to secure the release of his 14yearold daughter dana 
and two sons samer 9 and ramzi 5 
a separate police report said automatic weapon clashes between 
rival palestinian guerrillas wounded seven people today but the 
exchanges in the two embattled refugee camps were markedly less 
intense than those of the previous day 
the new casualties brought the overall toll to 31 killed and 137 
wounded since fighting for mastery of chatilla and bourj 
elbarajneh erupted last week 
the battles pitted guerrillas loyal to palestine liberation 
orgnization chairman yasser arafat and syrianbacked mutineers 
a police spokesman said two libyan observers entered chatilla 
today to join a guerrilla force drawn from factions that were not 
involved in the fighting in an effort to enforce a ceasefire two 
other libyans were to enter bourj elbarajneh later in the day 
libya is an ally of both arafat and syrian president hafez 
assad its leader col moammar gadhafi had played a key role in 
bringing assad and arafat together in a reconciliation effort in 
april 
arafat and assad had been bitter enemies for five years since 
syria backed a mutiny in fatah the plos mainstream faction in 
may 1983 
last week arafats loyalists dislodged the mutineers of col 
saeed mousa from the two shantytowns fighters of mousa also known 
as abu mousa regrouped in a syriancontrolled area on the fringes 
of the camps and mounted a counterattack this week 
a police spokesman said brig gen ali hammoud the syrian 
armys intelligence chief for the beirut area brought ariss three 
children to their home at 530 am 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with police 
regulations said mediators from the iranianbacked hezbollah 
or party of god found the three children in south beirut and 
handed them over to the syrian forces he did not elaborate 
interior minister abdullah rassi told the associated press that 
the kidnappers have not been arrested 
the case is not closed i insist that the kidnappers be 
arrested brought to justice and punished rassi said 
ariss in a statement broadcast by the moslem voice of nation 
radio expressed gratitude to all those who helped secure the 
release of my children 
we thank god because this ordeal was brought to an end we 
thank god for the safe return of our three children he said 
police chief col issam abu ziki refused to say whether ransom 
was paid 
six gunmen armed with silencerequipped pistols grabbed ariss 
children from the family car as they were being driven to school 
tuesday morning 
police said the kidnappers later telephoned ariss and demanded a 
3 million ransom

a hackers success in penetrating a 
nonclassified pentagon computer network and searching nasa and 
navy data banks shows security measures are failing to keep pace 
with sophisticated computer systems scientists say 
its a subject that makes computer people turn pale and 
sweat said hal masursky a member of a national academy of 
sciences subcommittee on computer security 
nasas jet propulsion laboratory said thursday that one or more 
hackers or computer buffs successfully penetrated a defense 
department computer network the night of may 16 then examined 
files at the lab the patuxent naval air station in maryland and at 
least one other facility into the early hours of may 17 
no damage was done no data was stolen and the incident is under 
investigation by the fbi and security officers from national 
aeronautics and space administration headquarters in washington 
said haskell g obrien jpls manager of communications and 
computing network services 
the breakin shows that fewer people are monitoring computer 
access than should be more people need to keep their eyes open 
said cliff stoll a computer scientist at californias lawrence 
berkeley laboratory its unfortunately easy for people to 
randomly break in 
the network that was breached named arpanet is a 
nonclassified network for sharing scientific information and is 
operated by the pentagons defense advanced research projects 
agency obrien said 
thousands of computers are connected to the network at hundreds 
of us and foreign universities and research centers including 
some military research facilities and other nasa offices he added 
networking has spread like wildfire but the security 
precautions are a new art said masursky a flagstaff 
arizbased us geological survey geologist who worked on several 
nasa space missions with a hacker who is very clever trying to 
guarantee he cant access things computers is very difficult 
obrien said authorities dont know if the hacker operated from 
the united states or abroad although nasa suspects involvement by 
the chaos computer club in hamburg west germany which has been 
linked to past computer security breaches 
the signature looked a little like things they do but also 
looked a little different he said 
a spokesman for the club told the associated press in bonn west 
germany that he was unaware of the breakin 
obrien called the incident serious because programs used to 
design microcircuits could have been damaged 
pentagon spokeswoman susan hansen said from washington that 
there is no indication that any classified information has been 
obtained by such hacker activity 
the breakin was the third known violation of computer security 
at jpl in two years obrien said citing a previously publicized 
august 1986 breakin by a west german hacker and another last 
summer in which the perpetrator was caught but not prosecuted 
the hacker in last months incident first gained access to the 
pentagon network through another computer at an undisclosed 
location obrien said once inside the hacker guessed a password 
the name of a jpl employee to gain access to the labs computer 
the hacker then used jpls digital equipment corp computer as a 
conduit to enter another arpanet computer at patuxent where 
authorities noticed something was amiss and notified jpl obrien 
said adding he didnt know how many other computers also were 
penetrated 
nasa security people are working with the fbi investigating 
the details of this he said 
jpl spokesman george alexander said that as soon as the breakin 
was discovered we pulled jpl out of the network 
our procedures are being tightened considerably to make sure 
this wont happen again alexander said 
in april a west german prosecutor revealed that a 24yearold 
west german hacker linked his home computer to about 50 us 
military computers by telephone the electronic breakins were 
detected in august 1986 by lawrence berkeley officials 
targets included computers at jpl the berkeley lab and air 
force systems command in el segundo calif

a prominent political commentator has called the 
soviet intervention in afghanistan a mistaken use of excessive 
military force that damaged the kremlins international prestige 
alexander bovins article in the government newspaper izvestia 
was published this week and appeared to indicate a debate within 
the kremlins highest circles about the intelligence of the soviet 
move into afghanistan 
the new york times reported in todays editions that the partys 
leadership issued a secret circular admitting errors and 
misjudgments leading to the soviet military move into afghanistan 
citing party members whom it did not identify the newspaper 
said the document implied without stating explicitly that the 
original decision in 1979 to send soviet troops to afghanistan was 
wrong 
the report said the document which was intended to provide 
guidelines for publications on the subject was read aloud to party 
members at closed meetings in the past two weeks 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told the 
associated press that the party had put out a report on the afghan 
intervention long ago but he refused to discuss its contents he 
said in a telephone interview that it was a closed document 
nikolai v shishlin a spokesman for the partys policymaking 
central committee said he knew nothing about any party analysis of 
the afghan intervention 
bovin in wednesdays editions of izvestia compared the afghan 
move to the soviet deployment of ss20 missiles in eastern europe 
which was a response to nato deployment of mediumrange missiles in 
western europe 
these in my view are typical examples of decisions of a 
subjective character oriented toward the use of militaryforceful 
methods in foreign policy bovin wrote 
he said that in both cases the soviet union overestimated its 
means and failed to consider the resistance of the environment 
in both cases we drove ourselves into a corner created 
deadend situations from which in the framework of the old model 
of thinking old stereotypes there was no exit the commentator 
said 
the intervention hurt the soviet unions international authority 
and brought on moral and material damage he said 
and in afghanistan we paid the most expensive price the 
price of blood 
the soviet unions more than 100000 troops in afghanistan began 
pulling out may 15 under an international agreement signed the 
month before in geneva 
while in afghanistan they faced fierce resistance from a moslem 
guerrilla united against the sovietbacked regime in kabul 
bovins criticism was not the first of the soviet intervention 
in afghanistan oleg t bogomolov a prominent economist said in a 
letter published march 16 in the weekly literary gazette that he 
had warned the kremlin about the dangers of sending troops into 
afghanistan 
in a situation report delivered to the appropriate levels on 
jan 20 1980 the hopeless and detrimental aspects of that action 
were stated wrote bogomolov head of the institute of economics 
of the world socialist system 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has called the soviet 
involvement in afghanistan a bleeding wound human rights 
activist and nobel peace laureate andrei d sakharov has also 
denounced it 
bovin praised the new thinking in soviet foreign policy for 
ordering the withdrawal and for agreeing to scrap medium and 
shorterrange nuclear missiles under a treaty gorbachev signed in 
december with president reagan 
most media reports however have defended the intervention as a 
necessary response to the plight of a friendly government 
soviet soldiers and hardware rolled into afghanistan on dec 27 
1979 to replace one promoscow leadership with another and fight a 
widespread anticommunist insurgency 
the communist party newspaper pravda reported today that no 
soviet soldiers remain along the afghanpakistani border in eastern 
afghanistan

the head of a veterans coalition 
protesting actress jane fondas plans to film a movie here says 
hes not satisfied by her apology to veterans and their families 
for her visit to hanoi during the vietnam war 
gaetano russo said thursday that fonda must do a series of 
positive acts beyond the television interview in which she 
apologized for her 1972 visit 
i was trying to help end the killing fonda said in the 
interview with barbara walters scheduled to be broadcast tonight on 
abcs 2020 news program but there were times i was 
thoughtless and careless about it and im very sorry that i 
hurt them 
the 15minute interview was taped may 31 at fondas home in 
santa monica calif fondas spokesman stephen rivers said 
thursday 
some veterans here and in holyoke mass referring to the 
actress as hanoi jane have vocally opposed her planned 
appearances in those cities in august for the filming of the movie 
union street 
the veterans staged large protests in waterbury while the 
boards of aldermen in holyoke and nearby chicopee mass passed 
resolutions in recent months declaring fonda unwelcome in the area 
the rev edmund nadolny pastor of st vincent ferrer church in 
nearby naugatuck predicted fondas apology will satisfy all but 
those who have gained personal publicity from the antifonda 
protests 
most of the people i talked with wanted an apology said 
nadolny who joined several other area clergymen last month in 
calling for an end to the protests they didnt want vengeance as 
much as an apology 
but russo called the interview typical fonda hogwash 
the retired connecticut army national guard major general said 
the actress was worried about her image 
fonda must back up her words with action to win his forgiveness 
russo said he suggested she return to vietnam to help in the 
return of prisoners of war still unaccounted for 
shes got to do a series of positive acts to make me believe 
she is sincere in the apology he said 
2020 which released a transcript of the interview 
thursday said the segment includes a recording of fondas radio 
broadcast from hanoi that was uncovered in government archives 
marking the first time the broadcast will be played in the united 
states 
in it fonda addresses servicemen stationed on aircraft carriers 
in the gulf of tonkin and tells them the bombs they are loading 
into planes are illegal and that using the bombs makes one a war 
criminal 
the program also includes shots of fonda visiting a north 
vietnamese antiaircraft installation where she posed in the 
gunners seat wearing a helmet 
fonda became involved with the antiwar movement while living in 
paris she visited hanoi at a time when the war was supposedly 
winding down but us bombing of the north was being stepped up 
civilian areas were being hit walters said during her 
introduction 
fonda said she wanted to expose this and help end the war 
walters said many americans shared her feelings but fonda got 
most of the attention 
asked about the continued bitterness over something that 
happened 16 years ago fonda said there are still festering 
wounds and lot of pain and for some ive become a lightning rod 
fonda said she didnt realize at the time the effect posing with 
the antiaircraft gun would have 
i know the power of images she said to have put myself 
in a situation like that was a thoughtless and cruel thing to have 
done i take full responsibility for it i was not a kid you 
know the responsibilty is mine 
fonda said she didnt feel she had been duped by the north 
vietnamese 
i dont remember being led to this gun you know im a strong 
woman she said im naive and i make mistakes but it was 
my fault that i sat there you know

a judge has sentenced john zaccaro jr to 
four months in prison for selling cocaine to an undercover police 
officer rejecting geraldine ferraros plea that my son has been 
punished enough 
vermont district court judge francis mccaffrey also ordered 
zaccaro to pay 1500 and perform 300 hours of community service 
during his sentencing thursday zaccaro 24 could have faced up to 
five years and a 10000 fine for selling onequarter gram of 
cocaine in 1986 
zaccaro is free during the 30 days he has to appeal the 
sentence his mother the 1984 democratic vice presidential 
nominee said after the hearing that her son had been treated 
differently than the average defendant 
we are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the 
sentence ferraro said noting that other defendants in vermont 
drug cases have received lighter penalties zaccaros attorney 
charles tetzlaff had requested a suspended sentence with probation 
and community service 
addison county states attorney john quinn who had requested a 
jail term denied that he had treated the case differently 
this was a case where we caught a person redhanded and i 
mean redhanded quinn said i felt that it was important for 
this court to say it doesnt matter who you are youre not going 
to escape the consequences of selling cocaine in this state 
mccaffrey said he was at a loss to understand why zaccaro sold 
drugs saying the only explanation he could think of was greed and 
a desire for acceptance by his peers 
i cant in good conscience sentence you without any time to 
serve the judge said mccaffrey said that zaccaro had grown up 
with every advantage including a good education and family support 
mccaffrey suggested that the jail time be spent in special 
vermont corrections program that allows convicts to be kept under 
house arrest with supervision by a probation officer but quinn 
said later that zaccaro must still be accepted into the program 
zaccaros parents sat quietly and leaned forward as mccaffrey 
passed sentence 
in a hearing before mccaffreys decision ferraro broke down in 
tears on the stand as she described her reaction to her sons 
february 1986 arrest she was in hawaii giving a lecture that day 
and had to watch the event on television 
when i got home from hawaii i went home and my son put his 
arms around me and he cried and he said he was sorry ferraro 
recalled he was sorry for what he had done to us 
zaccaro held his head in his hands as his mother described the 
impact the case had on the family 
ferraro a former new york prosecutor criticized quinn for 
failing to allow a plea bargain 
i have never had a case where people werent interested in 
discussing any sort of disposition ferraro said adding that the 
defense had begged and pleaded for an agreement 
if it had been anyone else we would not be sitting here 
she said my son has been punished enough i want him back i 
want him back so that we can start our lives all over again

the house ethics committees silence for the 
past week over the case of speaker jim wright resembles the eye of 
a hurricane with political winds building around it 
both democrats and republicans have been stepping up their 
rhetoric with the gop pushing for an independent counsel in the 
case and the speakers supporters painting that effort as pure 
politics 
wright dtexas on thursday declined to swipe directly at 
president reagans call for an independent counsel saying im 
going to be kinder to the president than he was to me 
wright continued to proclaim his innocence and said he had no 
objection to the ethics panel hiring outside help for the probe 
if the committee feels its work can be expedited by the hiring 
of an outside counsel then by all means said wright who has 
repeatedly said he is innocent 
the ethics committee announced last week it was looking into six 
allegations of possible misconduct but it has been silent since 
then apparently contemplating in private whether to hiring an 
outside counsel in the case 
on thursday the republican study committee a group of 
conservative members and a group of rightwing leaders outside of 
congress each called on the ethics committee to choose an 
independent counsel 
democrats led by house majority leader thomas s foley 
dwash came to wrights defense 
foley said the presidents statements showed that the charges 
against the speaker were part of a gop campaign to distract 
attention from the republicans own ethics woes including the 
investigations of attorney general edwin meese iii 
he pointed out that independent counsels typically are appointed 
to investigate criminal cases but there are no criminal 
allegations against wright 
two of the ethics accusations against wright surround a book 
publishing deal in which wright received 55 percent of the 
royalties from a paperback published by a friend who did work on 
wrights campaigns 
rep david obey dwis said republicans have been wrong to 
claim that right authored an exemption on members book royalty 
earnings obey was chairman of the panel which drafted the current 
ethics regulations 
the book has earned the speaker about 55000 with several 
thousand of the 20000 copies bought in bulk by supporters 
one bulk buyer gordon mackay a senior vice president of the 
new england life insurance company said this week he purchased 
2000 worth of the 595 paperback three years ago after wright 
declined an honorarium for speaking to a management group in boston 
if wright had accepted the 2000 as an honorarium he would 
have been required to donate the money to charity or he would have 
exceeded the limit on outside income in the house rules however 
since book royalties have no limit in the house rules he could 
keep those earnings 
marshall lynam a top aide to the speaker said he didnt know 
if wright refused the honorarium because he was at the limit or 
because he made the speech as a favor to an old friend who 
represented the insurance company he said the speaker had no 
knowledge of the book purchase at the time 
beside the book deal wright is being investigated in two cases 
for possibly lobbying on behalf of oil companies in which he may 
have had an interest for pressuring federal officials on behalf of 
texas bankers and for using a condominium as his fort worth home 
while paying only a per diem and expenses but no monthly rent 
the fort worth startelegram reported in todays editions that 
edwin j gray the former chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board said in an interview from miami that he felt highly 
unusual and heavyhanded pressure in late 1986 from wright who 
was thenhouse majority leader over grays handling of several 
texas thrift institutions 
gray appointed to the bank board by president reagan in may 
1983 disagreed with wrights recent assertions that wright acted 
merely a gobetween for private texas citizens primarily at 
grays request 
this was clearly not a gobetween messenger function that he 
was carrying out gray said nor was it an 
informationgathering function 
there was no doubt in my mind at the time these telephone 
conversations took place that what he said was intended to bring 
about actions on my part as a regulator he said

georgia rep pat swindall plans to comment 
tonight on a published report he continued to pursue an 850000 
loan after being told it might be financed with drug money that he 
would be helping launder an aide says 
swindall a twoterm republican whose district includes parts of 
suburban atlanta dropped out of sight thursday after the report in 
that days editions of the atlanta journal and the atlanta 
constitution 
swindall did not appear on the house floor thursday for two 
recorded votes on an agriculture appropriations bill aides in his 
washington office refused to disclose his whereabouts 
hes just not available said jan fujiwara swindalls staff 
director thats what ive been instructed to say 
she said swindall planned to make his first public comment at a 
town meeting tonight in clarkston ga 
meanwhile rep newt gingrich who has led the attack on house 
speaker jim wright recently forcing an ethics committee probe of 
the powerful texas democrat said he would look into swindalls 
reported role in the alleged moneylaundering scheme to determine 
whether he will ask the panel to investigate his fellow georgia 
republican 
gingrich the only other republican in georgias 12member 
congressional delegation said thursday i will ask the same 
lawyers who worked on the jim wright case to review the news 
stories and the transcript and after i receive their 
recommendation ill decide what action to take 
the atlanta newspapers reported that tapes of secretly recorded 
conversations from a federal money laundering investigation show 
swindall was warned several times that the loan he was seeking 
might be financed with drug money or with money skimmed from las 
vegas nev gambling casinos 
despite those warnings the newspapers said swindall indicated 
on the tapes that he intended to pursue the loan as long as he 
could deal only with a gobetween charles lechasney who 
subsequently was indicted on money laundering charges 
swindall who has not been charged with any crime has said in 
previous interviews that tape recordings made during the 
investigation would vindicate him 
the newspapers said the tapes indicate swindall ended the loan 
negotiations on sept 26 1987 after michael mullaney an 
undercover federal agent who was posing as a money broker for drug 
dealers and other underworld figures told swindall he would have 
to accept the cash loan proceeds in person and sign a receipt 
in other words if charles wants to launder yalls money 
fine but i cant do that and to sign a receipt of cash would be 
to do that swindall said on tape according to the newspapers 
swindalls name first surfaced publicly in connection with the 
federal money laundering investigation earlier this year when it 
was disclosed that an aug 28 1987 meeting he had with mullaney 
at an atlanta hotel had been videotaped by investigators 
he was subpoeaned and testified before a federal grand jury in 
february and later said in interviews that he was attempting to 
convert a construction loan on his 12 million home in stone 
mountain ga to permanent financing 
he said lechasney an atlanta businessman told him his mortgage 
company gulf coast mortgage could finance the loan at favorable 
rates and then sell the note to investors 
lechasney then introduced swindall to mullaney and told him 
according to swindall that mullaney represented a family that had 
fled central america with money to invest 
swindall said in the earlier interviews that lechasney had 
assured him the money he was to borrow would not be drug money he 
said he accepted a 150000 check from lechasney on sept 25 1987 
but returned it uncashed two days later after he said he became 
concerned that lechasney and mullaney were trying to use him to 
launder money 
the 12 tape recordings obtained by the atlanta newspapers were 
made between sept 13 1987 and sept 26 1987 and involve a 
meeting between swindall lechasney and mullaney in the west 
virginia resort town of white sulphur springs and telephone calls 
between mullaney and swindall and between mullaney and lechasney 
during the sept 13 1987 meeting according to the tapes 
mullaney told swindall that the loan money probably was drug money 
or money skimmed from las vegas casinos that mullaney was to hide 
and invest for various principals 
i borrowed it for my house of which this money is his 
lechasneys business his problem and frankly i dont think its 
incumbent on me to go out and find out where xyz corp gets their 
money swindall said

five dissidents were arrested after 
they chanted democracy and the name of a leader of the 1956 
antisoviet revolt at a rally marking his execution 
witnesses said police arrested the five thursday after a 
peaceful morning vigil at the unmarked graves where imre nagy a 
leader of the october 1956 revolt and three associates are 
believed buried 
the ceremonies marked 30 years since the official media 
published a ministry of justice decree on june 17 1958 announcing 
they were sentenced to death 
calls for nagys rehabilitation and that of some of his 
associates have become increasingly frequent 
the 1956 revolt began oct 23 with mass demonstrations for a new 
government and demands that soviet troops leave hungary but 
200000 soviet troops and 2500 tanks struck budapest nov 4 to 
quell the uprising 
the official mti news agency said in a terse report that a 
group of persons who had been active in the 1956 events gathered 
in budapest despite a police warning 
the report said the men then tried to bring under their 
influence a crowd of about 350 to 400 persons whom they had 
mobilized 
police took the necessary steps to ensure public order in the 
course of this sandor racz gabor demszky roza hodosan jenoe 
nagy and peter egetoe were taken to the police station the 
report said 
about 20 or 30 people laid flowers at the eternal flame to a 
hungarian premier executed in the abortive 1848 revolution against 
austria and stepped back into a crowd of about 400 people 
witnesses said 
about 150 police guarded the square and conducted frequent 
identity checks the witnesses said one witness said police 
charged onlookers who tried to approach the flame 
after a halfhour the crowd moved towards the danube river and 
then on to the nearby hungarian television station the witnesses 
said there dissident janos kiss addressed the crowd but a witness 
said the speech was drowned out by crowd chants of avo to the 
waiting police 
the avo was the dreaded secret police in the 1950s 
the witness said riot police then moved in to break up the 
crowd it was not immediately clear if anybody was injured

gloria quinan claims a typographical error 
in a telephone directory scared off most of her elderly clientele 
when the word erotic appeared instead of exotic to describe her 
travel agency 
we offer exotic travel like tours up the amazon but nothing 
erotic she said ive worked a long time to build my 
professional reputation and now im getting a lot of crank calls 
and heavy breathers said quinan owner of banner travel agency 
since the listing has appeared this reserved not 
exceptionally outgoing person has gotten obscene calls and requests 
like someone with four naked ladies wanting to know where to go 
on vacation said attorney george altenberg 
although california law generally restricts damage judgments in 
such cases to the cost of the original advertisement which in this 
case pacific bell has refunded to quinan altenberg filed a 10 
million suit against the utility on tuesday 
altenberg believes he can win the case in sonoma county superior 
court if he proves gross negligence on the part of the telephone 
company 
a spokeswoman for pacific bell said the companys yellow 
pages have a 98 percent accuracy rate 
but obviously were going to have errors from time to time 
added consumer affairs manager marilyn evans 
the suit claims quinan has suffered mental anguish and physical 
distress and has suffered the loss of her reputation over the word 
which appeared in red ink emblazoned across her ad 
altenberg said the telephone company refused to issue stickers 
with the correct exotic travel description on them to the 
holders of the county directories which were distributed in april 
her older clients which was most of her business want to 
avoid her now said altenberg who claimed quinan has lost 80 
percent of her business as a result of the mistake 
the only calls shes getting are from people wanting erotic 
travel services which she just doesnt offer altenberg said

injured when communist guerrillas attacked two villages in the 
northeastern indian state of bihar the united news of india 
reported today

late thursday night the villages are about 30 miles south of the

a civil rights group says it will pursue a lawsuit 
against the city despite the unveiling of a new plan to desegregate 
about 17000 public housing units in 69 developments operated by 
the boston housing authority 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
filed the suit seeking to stop the administration of mayor raymond 
l flynn from engaging in discriminatory housing practices 
on thursday flynn announced an agreement with the federal 
department of housing and urban development to integrate the citys 
public housing and find apartments for anyone who was the victim of 
discrimination in the past five years 
despite the announcement the lawyers committee for civil 
rights which is handling the suit for the naacp plans to pursue 
the case said attorney alan rom because some victims of 
discrimination deserve monetary damages as well as immediate 
housing 
however much may have been remedied by that plan theres 
still plenty left over rom said this agreement is not 
sufficient to make whole the people who were injured by the acts of 
discrimination 
the agreement between flynn the boston housing authority and 
hud follows an october 1987 hud report that found a clear pattern 
of steering whites to white housing projects and isolating blacks 
and other minorities in projects where their own race predominated 
the proposal has drawn sharp responses from white neighborhoods 
and civil rights groups but the furor comes nowhere near the 
tension that gripped the city in the mid1970s when boston began 
busing students under a courtordered school desegregation plan 
flynn touched on the federal school desegregation case at a news 
conference thursday 
this agreement is designed to ensure fair and equal access for 
public housing throughout boston flynn said it is intended to 
keep decisionmaking at the local level and away from a federal 
court 
flynn lives in the south boston section of the city a 
predominantly white neighborhood that was the scene of racial 
violence during the school desegregation years his neighbors have 
criticized him severely for his support of desegregated public 
housing 
i am asking the people of boston for their personal support 
flynn said 
under the agreement the housing authority would identify people 
who have been victims of discriminatory public housing practices 
and place them near the top of the priority housing list only 
emergency cases such as a family on the verge of homelessness 
would receive a higher priority for receiving a unit 
anyone passed over because of race or national origin since oct 
1 1983 would be considered such a victim 
flynn emphasized that no current resident of public housing 
would be forced to move as a result of the agreement 
bostons housing authority is the largest in the country to 
enter into an agreement to voluntarily comply with fair public 
housing practices said robert laplante huds regional director 
for fair housing 
a second key aspect of the plan requires hud approval it calls 
for the housing authority to offer housing applicants a choice of 
apartments from a citywide list or from an individual project if 
hud rejects that system the authority would have to use a 
huddeveloped plan in which there would be no opportunity for an 
applicant to specify a housing development

flu shots are a good idea for aids victims other 
highrisk patients and those who will be taking care of them during 
next years flu season federal health officials said 
the recommendation by the immunization practices advisory 
committee was among updated influenza information contained in 
thursdays weekly report from the centers for disease control 
the committee targeted people with immunosuppression or the 
squelching of natural responses that produce immunity such as what 
occurs with aids as being at moderate risk of flurelated 
complications but suggested that people who care for them take 
extra precautions if a flu strain is present in the community 
especially during the twoweek period between the time a flu shot 
is administered and the time it takes effect 
the committee also recommended that the drug amantadine which 
has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of typea flu 
strains be used with highrisk patients when an outbreak of 
influenza a is present cdc epidemiologist nancy arden said 
the flu vaccine is particularly recommended for people who are 
at high risk for having serious complications or dying if they get 
the flu she said but the vaccine may not produce a higher 
level of antibodies with immunosuppresive persons than with people 
with a healthier immune system 
physicians nurses family members and others who have extensive 
contact with such patients could use amantadine if they have not 
received an influenza vaccine or in the interim until a vaccine 
takes effect ms arden said 
amantadine is recommended for people taking care of highrisk 
patients if they have not taken the vaccine she said another 
strategy is when influenza develops in the community people who 
havent gotten the vaccine can go to a physician and get a 
prescription for amantadine and that way they are protected 
during the time they are developing an antibody response to the 
vaccine 
ms arden cautioned however that the use of amantadine is not 
viable for all patients and physicians should evaluate its use on 
an individual basis

foreign minister nguyen co thach of 
vietnam said today he would meet with representatives from 
cambodian rebel groups in talks aimed at ending the 10yearold 
civil war in cambodia 
vietnam has said before it would send a representative to the 
informal talks beginning july 25 in jakarta indonesia but this 
was the first announcement that thach himself would be going 
there is no doubt that i will be there thach told a news 
conference 
thach and his thai counterpart siddhi savetsila also said the 
united states and the soviet union should act as guarantors of any 
agreement to end the conflict 
thach and savetsila held separate news conferences after a 
45minute meeting today on thursday they held their first talks 
since july 1986 
they reportedly discussed vietnams plans to withdraw 50000 
vietnamese troops from cambodia the problem of vietnamese refugees 
and the danger that the khmer rouge may return to power if vietnam 
pulls all its troops out of cambodia 
thailand along with the united states and china backs a 
threeparty guerrilla coalition fighting the vietnamese in 
cambodia the three are the ultraradical khmer rouge the 
westernleaning khmer peoples national liberation front and 
followers of prince norodom sihanouk 
vietnam backed by the soviet union invaded cambodia in late 
1978 driving the prochinese khmer rouge from power the khmer 
rouge killed millions of people during its attempt to impose 
radical agrarian communism on cambodia after it took over in 1975 
hanoi has promised to pull out all its forces currently 
estimated at 120000 by 1990 the partial withdrawal of 50000 
troops is scheduled to begin june 30 and continue through the rest 
of the year 
thach said representation at the jakarta talks would include the 
prohanoi government in cambodia under president heng samrin 
he said sihanouk khmer rouge leader khieu samphan and 
liberation front head son sann would attend 
although the format has yet to be clearly spelled out the four 
cambodian factions are to meet first other parties such as 
vietnam laos and southeast asian countries opposed to vietnams 
occupation of cambodia will join at later stages of the 
discussions 
siddhi said thailand would not send a representative to the 
meeting and would instead wait until the initial meeting has 
firmed up to some kind of political settlement 
thach praised the informal structure of the upcoming meeting and 
compared it to a cocktail party 
in a cocktail party there is no fixed chair for anyone so we 
can move freely i hope for the best thach said when asked 
whether he would prefer to meet any particular member of the 
antivietnamese coalition 
he urged full support for the talks if others are not in a 
hurry theyll miss the train and missing the train is not a happy 
thing he said

government troops fought 
communist rebels for two hours in the southern philippines and 12 
rebels and seven soldiers were killed a military spokesman said 
today 
lt col edgar centino spokesman for the 4th infantry division 
said government troops claimed they saw a white man acting as a 
military consultant to the insurgents during the battle 
thursday in surigao del sur province 
centino said 15 rebels and six soldiers were wounded in the 
fighting which began when troops on patrol spotted a rebel camp 
near the mountain village of diatagon 540 miles southeast of 
manila 
he said the soldiers fired mortar rockets onto the camp which 
was estimated to house 70 new peoples army guerrillas and the 
rebels fought back 
the rebels belonged to a guerrilla unit led by francisco 
navarro a defrocked roman catholic priest but the military did 
not know if he was in the camp during the battle centino said 
he said the troops also did not elaborate exactly what the 
caucasian military consultant was doing 
our soldiers were not certain of the nationality of the 
caucasian but they insist he was a foreigner centino said 
the report comes at a time of growing claims by the military 
that foreigners are helping train the rebels and taking part in 
raids on military detachments and other government installations 
last week the military arrested a swede and a west german on 
charges they were seen taking part in a rebel raid on the town of 
san francisco on luzon islands quezon province last february

city officials are putting together a 
235000 museum that will pay tribute to one of the most important 
things in kalamazoo county history celery 
celery really kind of put kalamazoo on the map said 
michigan historian larry massie from 1890 until the 1920s the 
kalamazoo area was one of the world leaders in the production of 
celery 
dutch settlers began growing celery in kalamazoo in the early 
19th century and their success spurred celery farms in portage 
massie said 
however in the 1930s celery farming gave way to paper mills 
work on the museum called the celery flats interpretive center 
is scheduled to begin in august and is to be completed by april 
1989 
the museum will offer historic and working displays on celery 
farming portage officials said they have gathered enough artifacts 
for the center but are looking for more objects such as celery 
washers and railroad carts 
its been difficult finding items because it celery farming 
happened so long ago and no one locally has a good collection of 
artifacts clifford mulder an assistant to portage city manager 
michael stampfler said recently 
the project was made possible by a 100000 grant from 
kalamazoobased upjohn co a 100000 donation from the kalamazoo 
foundation and a 25000 grant from the state

vietnamese archbishop philippe nguyen 
kim dien who defied communist attempts to control his countrys 
roman catholic church has died he was 67 
the official vietnam news agency in a report monitored in 
bangkok today said dien died of an illness on june 8 at cho ray 
hospital in ho chi minh city formerly saigon it did not give the 
exact disease 
dien was barred from work as a priest and put under house arrest 
in 1984 for urging priests not to join the committee for solidarity 
of patriotic vietnamese catholics the state had formed the group 
the previous year and critics said it was designed to control the 
church 
the clergyman spent his last years under house arrest dien 
continued to circulate letters among his parishioners however and 
authorities apparently made no serious attempt to replace him 
in 1986 cardinals and bishops from 40 countries issued a 
protest letter when vietnam barred dien from traveling to rome to 
attend the vaticans congregation for the evangelization of peoples 
the vatican said kim was born in march 1921 in vinh long the 
city was a traditional center of the catholic church in the mekong 
river delta in southern vietnam 
he was ordained in july 1947 and became a bishop in 1961 the 
vatican said the vatican vietnamese refugees and other sources 
charge that after the communists came to power in 1975 they closed 
seminaries jailed priests and took other steps to systematically 
repress the catholic church catholicism was identified with french 
colonialism and the usbacked south vietnam government of the 
vietnam war era 
authorities have made some steps toward reconciliation since 
pragmatist nguyen van linh became communist party chief in december 
1986 
there are 45 million catholics among vietnams largely buddhist 
population of about 63 million 
a vatican spokesman said today the vatican has sent a telegram 
to cardinal trinh van can archbishop of hanoi saying that pope 
john paul ii praised dien for his courage the telegram was signed 
by cardinal agostino casaroli vatican secretary of state 
the holy father joins in the sorrow of the bishops and of all 
the catholic community in vietnam the telegram said he 
commends to the lord the courageous pastor who faithfully testified 
the gospel in a life of untiring service for the people of god 
a memorial service for dien was held monday in hue where dien 
was archbishop the ho chi minh city archbishop nguyen van binh 
held a funeral service in the city two days later

safeconduct pass to argentina from buenos aires he flew to 
madrid

cadet had uncovered a plot by ortigoza and two other men to 
overthrow president alfredo stroessner 75 who has ruled paraguay 
with an iron fist since 1954

just a pretext for setting off a chain of arrests of 20 military 
officers including me who were opposed to military men being 
involved in political activities ortigoza told reporters

no right to impose his will on the people of pakistan 
according to a report today in the englishlanguage daily muslim 
islam like in the past is again being used to perpetuate 
oppressive rule she was quoted as telling journalists wednesday

breast cancer screening programs that personally 
review positive or suspicious mammograms could substantially reduce 
the number of breast cancer deaths if used nationwide federal 
health officials said 
the national centers for disease control said in its weekly 
report thursday that breast cancer deaths would be cut dramatically 
if personal followup examinations like that in an inexpensive 
breast cancer screening program used by the rhode island department 
of health is widely instituted 
rhode island cancer registry administrator john fulton who 
worked with the state health department on the program said in a 
telephone interview that mammograms give patients a two or 
threeyear edge on detecting small tumors before they spread and 
when combined with a personal followup procedure can save many 
lives 
physical examination is a very useful technique and we 
advocate its use but we know in women from the ages of 50 and 
above that mammography can actually detect cancers two to three 
years before a physician can actually feel it in a breast 
examination he said to reduce the death rate from breast 
cancer we have to increase the use of mammography 
the national cancer institute and the american cancer society 
both advocate the use of mammography the study says the test has 
been shown in previous research to reduce deaths from breast 
cancer the leading cause of death from malignancy among women 
we would consider anything that we learned from rhode islands 
experience as having relevance to all other states said cdc 
spokesman robert smith the program is relatively new and were 
still at a stage of evaluating but i think the early results are 
encouraging 
the cdc said a preliminary survey of 852 rhode island women 
about 40 years old showed only 37 percent of those responding had 
gotten a mammogram in the past year 70 percent had gotten a breast 
examination from a physician and 35 percent had done both the 
survey conducted last october showed 92 percent saw a physician 
last year 
the screening program which provides mammographies for 50 a 
staff followup of positive suspicious or inconclusive tests and a 
review by a panel of radiologists could serve as a model for use 
in other states fulton said 
fulton said the rhode island statistics for mammograms and 
physical exams are higher than the national average but are far 
from approaching those set for the year 2000 by national cancer 
institute which advocates the use of mammography and physical 
examination in 80 percent of all women age 50 to 70 by that time 
we believe our program will increase the number of mammograms 
because we have lowered the cost and have received a lot of 
physician support in the community fulton said

the british government is 
giving northern ireland police the power to use a revolutionary 
crimedetecting technique known as genetic fingerprinting after an 
ira bombing killed six british soldiers 
but prime minister margaret thatcher ruled out a reintroduction 
of detention without trial to deal without an upsurge of violence 
by the outlawed irish republican army in the british province 
british and irish government officials meanwhile met in 
belfast today to discuss security in the aftermath of the ira 
bombing wednesday that killed six offduty soldiers in lisburn 
seven miles southwest of belfast 
mrs thatchers top official in he province tom king 
acknowledged that a security lapse allowed ira guerrillas to plant 
a bomb on the soldiers van while they were running in a 13mile 
charity halfmarathon 
king said the soldiers failed to check the unmarked van for 
explosives and should not have left it unattended in a parking lot 
while taking part in the footrace the bomb exploded in the market 
town as the soldiers were returning to their barracks 
the seven pounds of plastic explosives used in the bomb were 
thought to have been smuggled into the province from libya king 
said 
ten civilians including a 2yearold boy and an 80yearold 
man were injured none seriously authorities said the bombing 
brought this years death toll from sectarian violence to 38 eight 
this week alone 
claiming responsibility for the bombing the ira vowed to wage 
unceasing war against the british security forces the 
guerrilla group is fighting to oust britain from northern ireland 
and unite the protestantdominated province with the mainly roman 
catholic irish republic 
in parliament thursday night kings deputy northern ireland 
minister john stanley said the government was giving the royal 
ulster constabulary the provinces mainly protestant police force 
new power to use genetic fingerprinting to fight terrorism 
police forces in england and wales already use the sophisticated 
technique which matches dna extracts found in a suspects blood 
semen hair or saliva with evidence found at a crime scene 
in england and wales police cannot use genetic fingerprinting 
without a suspects consent but police in northern ireland will be 
allowed to require suspects to provide saliva samples without 
consent stanley said police would take the samples with mouth 
swabs 
in the particular circumstances of northern ireland 
highlighted once again by the horrific murder of the six soldiers 
yesterday it seems to us entirely reasonable and necessary to 
give the police the power to take a mouth swab if necessary 
without a suspects consent stanley said 
earlier thursday mrs thatcher called the attack a terrible 
atrocity 
but she rejected a lawmakers proposal to reintroduce the policy 
of internment without trial used in the 1970s to round up terrorist 
suspects britain abandoned the policy in the face of widespread 
criticism of it as a violation of civil liberties 
mrs thatcher said the possibility of allowing police to detain 
suspects without trial was being kept under review but added i 
would be very very reluctant to do so 
the meeting of government officials in belfast was being held 
under the 1985 angloirish agreement which gave the irish republic 
a formal role in running the british province 
it was their first meeting since march when nine people died in 
two weeks of mayhem in belfast touched off by the shooting deaths 
of three suspected ira bombers by british commandos in gibraltar on 
march 6 
the death toll from wednesdays bombing was the highest since an 
ira bomb killed 11 protestants attending a warmemorial service in 
enniskillen on nov 8 1986

israeli troops killed a 
palestinian and wounded 18 others today when a mob of rockhurling 
arabs tried stop soldiers from blowing up a house in the occupied 
west bank a hospital official said 
the army said only five palestinians were wounded and that two 
israeli officers also were injured by stones in violence that began 
when troops entered the village of beit furik to demolish a house 
a military spokesman said the army was checking on reports of a 
fatality and others wounded 
throughout the west bank israeli troops destroyed more arab 
homes overnight bringing to 18 the number demolished or sealed in 
the last 24 hours in the armys campaign to stop youths from 
throwing firebombs the army said 
at least four of the homes belonged to alleged firebombers the 
army said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the army considered 
firebombs lethal weapons and that soldiers and civilians could 
respond with gunfire when firebombs were thrown 
we define it as a weapon and the action against the throwers 
is as if they used weapons he said on israel radio those 
selfdefense orders also include israeli citizens traveling on the 
roads 
in beit furik a village five miles southeast of nablus 
soldiers opened fire when palestinians attacked with rocks and 
bottles said an official at ittihad hospital in nablus the 
official said the troops later blew up an arab home 
the soldiers entered the village before dawn to destroy the home 
of ahmed hanani allegedly a member of a gang which killed nablus 
mayor zafer almasri in march 1986 and carried out attacks against 
israelis the army said 
palestinians saw the approaching soldiers and alerted villagers 
and about 700 arabs gathered in the streets and began throwing 
stones as about 100 soldiers entered said villager rafaq yusef 
masmoud 25 
the soldiers opened fire and the street battle lasted for about 
four hours masmoud told the associated press from a bed at nablus 
al ittihad hospital where he was being treated for gunshot wound 
to his left leg 
masmoud said he saw about 20 villagers being detained but the 
army put the arrests at five 
in addition to the wounded arabs two israeli officers were 
injured the army spokesman said adding that their condition was 
not immediately known 
the force opened fire when it was in a lifethreatening 
situation the spokesman said 
the dead man identified as 24yearold tayseer mlaitat was 
shot in the chest said the hospital official 
of the 18 other arabs wounded by gunfire at least two were in 
serious condition the hospital said adding that three others were 
injured by rubber bullets and beatings 
 
the death brings to 209 the number of palestinians killed since 
the arab uprising began dec 8 in the west bank and gaza strip two 
israelis also have died including a teenage girl accidentally 
shot by a jewish guard during a clash with palestinian villagers 
rabin in his radio interview said the uprising was widespread 
and supported by a majority of the 15 million palestinians in the 
occupied lands 
rabin said the armys actions were now aimed at preventing a 
return to the widespread violent protests that characterized the 
early stages of the arab revolt lately the uprising has consisted 
mostly of commercial strikes fires blamed on palestinian arsonists 
and clashes between soldiers and stonethrowing youths 
the army said eight homes were destroyed and 10 sealed in the 
west bank in 24 hours ending this morning most of the houses 
belonged to arabs suspected of hurling firebombs or planning 
attacks against israelis but two belonged to alleged members of a 
gang suspected of killing almasri a spokesman said 
i have eight children at home and now they want to throw me to 
the street because my son made a firebomb one homeowner 
identified only as the father of omad mahmoud shalabiye said on 
israel radio i dont know what he does hes 18 years old 
on thursday a 33yearold woman was severely injured in the eye 
by a rock hurled at her train as it passed through acre a town 
where many arab israelis live israel radio said

the only house abraham lincoln ever 
owned has been reopened to tourists after a 22 million renovation 
to erase the wearandtear caused by a halfmillion visitors a year 
the twostory brown frame house that lincoln bought in 1844 had 
been closed for about a year to complete the remaining structural 
and cosmetic repairs of a threeyear restoration project it was 
reopened thursday in a celebration featuring speeches by state 
officials patriotic music and the swearingin of 112 new us 
citizens 
gov james r thompson told the estimated 2500 people at the 
ceremony he hoped that tourists who visited the home would be 
inspired to learn more about lincoln 
president reagan in a congratulatory letter wrote i have 
always been proud of the fact that i share illinois roots with our 
16th president 
during the restoration project historians and architects 
researched such details as the houses original wallpaper patterns 
the precise shade of brown on the exterior and whether the woodwork 
was stained varnished or painted 
the results of the historical sleuthing may be a bit jarring to 
modern tastes patterns of carpet and wallpaper are extremely vivid 
and no effort seems to have been made to coordinate colors 
bill brown historic furnishings curator for the pak service 
explained that the period preference for bright colors was based on 
the fact that aniline dyes were just starting to be commonly used

democrat michael dukakis talking tough on crime 
told police recruits today that as president he would provide you 
with the kind of leadership you must have from the top 
dukakis on a southern campaign swing challenging george bushs 
claim to support in the region also received the backing of a 
group of law enforcement officials that included the democratic 
attorneys general of florida california louisiana and michigan 
meeting with the group which also included police chiefs 
sheriffs district attorneys and members of private anticrime 
organizations dukakis outlined his plan for a national crime 
council patterned after the stte council he formed in massachusetts 
he began his day at the flagraising ceremony at the southeast 
florida institute of criminal justice 
it provided a symbolic response to criticism from the bush 
campaign of his veto a decade ago of legislation that would have 
required the recitation of the pledge of allegiance to the flag in 
massachusetts schools 
dukakis vetoed the bill after the state supreme court advised 
him it was unconstitutional 
bush has begun raising the veto and saying he favors recitation 
of the pledge anywhere and everywhere 
dukakis told the police trainees they would be leading the fight 
to provide all americans with the kind of safety and security 
theyre entitled to have in their homes and in their communities 
and in their neighborhoods 
he said im going to do everything i can to provide you with 
the kind of leadership you must have from the top to provide 
you with the support and the resources and the training you need 
dukakis opened a his threeday southern campaign swing on 
thursday and talked about drugs with high school students in south 
carolina he planned to continue sounding that theme in an 
appearance before mississippi municipal officials 
no region of the country backed republican president reagan more 
solidly than the south and his vice president hopes to capitalize 
on that popularity in the fall presidential campaign 
but democrats see it differently 
anybody who thinks george bush has the kind of appeal ronald 
reagan had in the south is going to be sadly mistaken tennessee 
sen albert gore jr said thursday as he endorsed dukakis for the 
presidency 
gore who dropped his bid for the democratic presidential 
nomination last april after his disappointing finish in the new 
york primary predicted dukakis would carry five or six southern 
states 
the kind of candidacy mike dukakis brings to the south today 
is very different from what republicans were licking their chops 
over early in the campaign said gore they know now they have 
their hands full 
a new survey by atlanta pollster claibourne darden appeared to 
support gores assessment 
dardens poll of 750 voters in nine southern states said 451 
percent favored dukakis while 423 percent backed bush with a 
margin of error of 36 percent the survey amounted to a dead heat 
in the region where bush virtually clinched the republican 
presidential nomination 
the vice president swept the southern primaries on march 8 
super tuesday and broke the back of his competition for the gop 
nomination 
while dukakis won the primaries in the two biggest southern 
states on super tuesday texas and florida he never campaigned 
in several other states in the region 
the massachusetts governor was campaigning for the first time in 
mississippi alabama south carolina and tennessee 
we arent going to concede one single state in this country 
and that means the states of the south dukakis said as he 
accepted gores endorsement 
theyre open theyre ready for new leadership he said of 
the southern states 
a potential trouble spot for the democrats in the fall campaign 
was raised when dukakis was asked whether he would support the call 
for an independent counsel to investigate allegations against 
democratic house speaker jim wright of texas 
dukakis replied that he understood wright welcomed the 
independent counsel adding his attitude about this contrasts 
rather sharply with the kind of stonewalling weve had from the 
administration in case after case 
the massachusetts governor was asked if he was concerned abput 
the possibility wright would be under investigation when he was 
scheduled to be presiding over the democratic national convention 
i thought there was a presumption of innocence in this 
country replied dukakis 
dukakis was asked about his call for the resignation of attorney 
general edwin meese iii something he has not urged wright to do 
his call for meese to quit dukakis said came after repeated 
evidence of insensitivity a lack of awareness of what we mean when 
we talk about high standards 
if youre attorney general of this country and youve stumbled 
as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he has and provided 
as weak leadership as he has you ought to leave office he said

freed rapist larry singleton is not living in 
tampa his brother says but word that singleton gave authorities 
his brothers address here was enough to stir up a campaign to run 
him out of town 
a total of 10000 and a oneway ticket out of florida were 
offered thursday by a bradenton car dealer and st petersburg radio 
station if the 60yearold former merchant seaman would pack up and 
leave 
singleton spent eight years of a 14year sentence in california 
for raping a 15yearold hitchhiker chopping off her forearms with 
an ax and leaving her for dead in a ditch southeast of san 
francisco in 1978 his parole ended in april 
there was no response to the offers from singleton who earlier 
in the week had listed his brother walters tampa address with 
state officials but a neighbor said he was told by walter 
singleton that his brother is living in seclusion 2 hours from 
tampa 
the brother wouldnt disclose the location according to phil 
scalera adding that walter singleton invited 10 neighbors in to 
his home to look around but they declined 
we talked to walter singleton and he was rather belligerent 
about it scalera said but he said he isnt staying there 
he said i cant help it that he used my address its my 
fathers fault that hes my brother 
singleton as a felon had to register an address with the state 
to move to florida but authorities said the address didnt have to 
be his residence 
although law enforcement officers say singleton cannot be barred 
from living in florida businessman tom stimus wants singleton to 
feel unwelcome 
stimus who has three car and truck dealerships in the area 
placed a fullpage ad in the bradenton herald on thursday that 
read an open letter to larry singleton take this 5000 and get 
out of florida 
he also volunteered to pay rent and utilities for six months for 
singleton at a new address outofstate 
stimus 49 has previously offered rewards for the assassination 
of libyan leader moammar gadhafi and irans ayatollah khomeini 
with no takers 
meanwhile wqykfm matched stimus 5000 offer after 99 percent 
of the listeners responding to an onair poll said they wanted 
singleton to leave said station spokeswoman diana thomas 
california officials seeking to place singleton during his 
parole were met by community protests and local law enforcement 
officials said they feared they could not guarantee his safety 
singleton finally served his parole time while living in a 
mobile home within the gates of san quentin state prison

the nashville symphony association has 
filed for chapter 11 reorganization after almost five months of 
struggling with its musicians to solve money problems 
the music citys 85member orchestra shut down feb 3 because of 
financial trouble and since then a task force of board members and 
musicians have wrangled over costcutting plans to keep the 
symphony alive 
the board said last week it would file for reorganization under 
federal bankruptcy law if it failed to reach a lastminute 
agreement with the musicians union 
attorney c kinian cosner jr who filed the petition thursday 
said it will be followed within 15 days by a more detailed 
accounting of the orchestras finances 
the major asset is the endowment of the symphony 
approximately 1 million cosner said any reorganization plan 
will be funded by the income from that endowment the purpose of 
this filing is to effectuate an orderly liquidation and payment of 
the claims under court supervision 
the filing of a bankruptcy petition protects the symphony from 
its creditors until a reorganization plan can be devised the 
symphony has no plans for future performances cosner said

americas midsection since the dust bowl

eastern kansas to minnesota but the storms will be pretty widely 
scattered meteorologist hugh crowther of the weather services 
national severe storms forecast center in kansas city mo said 
today 
the fiveday outlook is pretty dry crowther said 
the dry weather has shriveled or threatened to damage corn and 
other crops in many states in the midwest and the southeast 
there aint gonna be no crops its the worst ive seen since 
36 said firmin rettinghauf 72 whose three sons farm his land 
near gilbertville in northeast iowa 
there is no more hopeless or helpless feeling than seeing your 
crops dry up because there is no alleviating that disaster said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater who grew up on a farm and 
spoke at lyngs news conference 
mississippi commissioner of agriculture jim buck ross said he 
was organizing a day of prayer for sunday

a tour of droughthit farms 
in the lower rio grande valley in texas ranchers short on feed 
had been using propane torches to remove thorns from prickly pear 
cactus so cattle could graze on them but some had to stop because 
even the cactus is shriveling up

ranch his family has owned for 106 years which has been plagued by 
early frosts and other problems for several years mcneill said 
that if it doesnt rain soon hell start selling off his 500 head 
of cattle in 100head increments

said but it looks like this is the one thats going to take us 
out

the conservation reserve program in all 53 north dakota counties

leon trotsky the revolutionary reviled for more 
than a halfcentury as a soviet traitor and enemy of socialism 
should be exonerated of criminal charges and his works reprinted a 
historian said today 
the call for a new look at trotsky by yuri n afanasyev rector 
of the state institute on historical archives runs counter to a 
central tenet of soviet orthodoxy that has stood unchallenged for 
more than 50 years 
it was one of the boldest suggestions to date under communist 
party chief mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for glasnost or 
openness 
under glasnost the soviets are taking an increasingly negative 
view of the 29year rule of dictator josef stalin the soviets also 
are exonerating communists who were branded traitors under stalin 
and killed imprisoned or exiled 
by acknowleging that trotsky was falsely accused of treason the 
kremlin would further discredit stalin who gorbachev has blamed 
for brutal and bloody political terror and choking the development 
of socialist democracy 
we have to rehabilitate all those people who were repressed 
and who were accused on false evidence and all those accused must 
be rehabilitated afanasyev told a news conference sponsored by 
the government and in line with those people is trotsky 
afanasyev noted that cleansing trotskys judicial record did not 
mean an endorsement of his ideas but even putting trotsky on an 
equal legal footing with other stalin foes would be a startling 
novelty 
born lev d bronstein the son of a prosperous jewish farmer 
trotsky was a central figure in the 1917 russian revolution and 
architect of the red armys victory over counterrevolutionaries in 
the russian civil war 
he served successively as commissar for foreign affairs and for 
war but was bested by stalin in kremlin infighting following the 
death of soviet founder vladimir lenin in 1924 and was forced out 
of the communist party in 1927 
two years later trotsky was expelled from the soviet union and 
later accused of heading an antisoviet plot he was murdered in 
mexico city in 1940 reportedly by a soviet agent 
under stalin trotsky became an official nonperson his 
role in the soviet revolution was wiped from the historical record 
and his more radical brand of revolution was branded as heresy and 
a betrayal of lenins legacy 
in a major speech nov 2 gorbachev continued the official 
condemnation of trotsky saying nothing about his role in the 
bolshevik revolution and attacking his character and ideas 
trotsky had advocated using the soviet revolution as a 
springboard to spread workingclass revolt to other countries and 
opposed stalins program to build socialism in one country 
first 
afanasyev told reporters today that there may be room soon for a 
reassessment of the ideas of trotsky and other stalin foes 
asked if the works of trotsky stalin and former soviet leader 
nikita khrushchev may be republished soon following a long ban 
afanasyev answered 
i can speak on behalf on myself and think they should be 
republished and accessible for all i think its very strange 
when professors and teachers try to criticize trotsky while they 
havent read a single word by trotsky 
afanasyev is a prominent advocate of gorbachevs reform drive 
who was chosen as a delegate to this months nationwide communist 
party conference 
on monday the soviet supreme court lifted the convictions 
against three prominent stalin foes lev kamenev grigory zinoviev 
and karl radek kamenev and zinoviev initially sided with stalin 
against trotsky but then backed trotsky both were executed 
following a trial for treason in 1936 
in february the court exonerated nikolai a bukharin another 
communist executed under stalin whose more moderate economic 
policies are very similar to what gorbachev is now pursuing

a diet high in vitamindeficient white rice 
is a primary cause of a disease that kills otherwise healthy 
southeast asian men in their sleep according to a researcher who 
spent three years studying the ailment 
ronald munger a postdoctoral fellow at the university of 
minnesotas division of epidemiology said thursday his studies 
show that stress is not the leading cause of sudden unexpected 
death syndrome as some experts believe he proposed instead that 
it results mainly from thiamine deficiency 
munger presented his findings to a conference of the society for 
epidemiologic research in vancouver british columbia 
suds is the leading cause of death for southeast asian refugee 
men ages 25 to 44 during their first few years in the united 
states the disease has claimed 117 southeast asian refugees since 
1977 according to the centers for disease control in atlanta 
nearly all died in their sleep 
although researchers know the immediate cause of suds is an 
electrical instability of the heart they dont know what causes 
the instability 
the most common theory is that the deaths are caused mainly by 
stress related to immigration and culture shock other possible 
explanations are heart abnormalities or genetic predisposition 
among southeast asians 
munger said he believes all those factors may play a part in 
suds but he places the main blame on the staple of the southeast 
asian diet white rice which is a poor source of vitamins 
brown or unmilled rice is a good source of vitamins 
particularly thiamine but few southeast asians eat it because its 
not considered socially acceptable eighty percent of the thiamine 
is lost in the milling process that produces white rice thiamine 
also known as vitamin b1 is essential to normal nerve function and 
metabolism of carbohydrates 
for his study munger gathered electrocardiographs from 80 
refugee men in thailand in 1985 and 40 refugee men in minnesota 
over the last two years he found ecg abnormalities occurred among 
culturally and genetically diverse groups including japanese 
filipinos vietnamese cambodians laotians and hmong 
but some researchers doubt mungers theory 
the thing i wonder a bit about his hypothesis is that its so 
different from what is usually seen in thiamine deficiency said 
dr gib parrish a medical epidemiologist and pathologist at the 
cdc 
thiamine deficiency often causes inflammation and degeneration 
of the nerves digestive system and heart those also are symptoms 
of the disease beriberi which is caused by a thiamine deficiency 
however most suds victims appear normal before dying 
munger said hes suggesting that there are undocumented effects 
of thiamine deficiency

today with the anticrime antidrug campaign he and republican 
george bush have been waging in the south he promised support for 
police training and accepted endorsement from law enforcement 
officials

themes was back in washington after a friday trip to richmond va 
he scheduled weekend campaigning in the midwest 
jesse jackson after wrapping up two days of seeking super 
delegate support in washington headed for texas to address that 
states democratic convention

as an nbc newswall street journal poll gave the massachusetts 
governor a 15point lead nationwide over the vice president 
dukakis had a 5228 lead among women voters 
dukakis whose only southern primary victories were in florida 
and texas found less than smooth sailing thursday on the first day 
of his southern tour in tennessee to pick up the endorsement of 
former rival al gore jr he was put on the spot about allegations 
that democratic house speaker jim wright committed ethics 
violations 
the massachusetts governor talked today with police recruits in 
miami and received the backing of a group of law enforcement 
officials that included the democratic attorneys general of 
florida california louisiana and michigan the group also 
included police chiefs sheriffs district attorneys and members of 
private anticrime organizations 
dukakis began his day at a flagraising ceremony at the 
southeast florida institute of criminal justice providing a 
symbolic response to criticism from the bush campaign of his veto 
a decade ago of legislation that would have required the 
recitation of the pledge of allegiance in massachusetts schools 
he vetoed the bill after the state supreme court advised him it 
was unconstitutional bush has begun raising the veto and saying he 
favors recitation of the pledge anywhere and everywhere 
dukakis told the police trainees they would be leading the fight 
to provide all americans with the kind of safety and security 
theyre entitled to have in their homes and in their communities 
and in their neighborhoods he added im going to do 
everything i can to provide you with the kind of leadership you 
must have from the top to provide you with the support and the 
resources and the training you need 
jackson concluding a visit to the capital on thursday 
continued to try to call in support in return of his years of work 
mobilizing black voters for democratic candidates 
the basic party leadership while accepting my investment in 
the party to make it strong has not been as reciprocal as it ought 
to be jackson said thursday after meeting with 33 democratic 
senators he pressed at the meeting for more unpledged super 
delegates to the july democratic convention to support him 
dukakis speaking to south carolina high school students at a 
conference on drug and alcohol abuse tried to shed any image of 
himself as a freespending liberal in a region that went strongly 
for ronald reagan

nine budgets in a row while the selfstyled conservatives in the 
white house havent been able to balance the budget in eight 
years 
he also cited his administrations record in reducing crime in

the shot after the teenager lunged at him 
in a speech to an annual meeting of the us jaycees in 
richmond va bush reiterated his views on strong penalties for 
those convicted of drug offenses and said the policy of zero 
tolerance for drugs should be applied to the workplace as well as 
to cars planes and boats 
earlier thursday dukakis said we welcomed having an independent 
counsel investigate the allegations against wright and found the 
issue different from the investigation of attorney general edwin 
meese iii 
if youre attorney general of this country and youve stumbled 
as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he has and provided 
as weak leadership as he has you ought to leave office he said 
both bush and dukakis were sent a message from the nations 
black mayors that the candidates must address black americans 
concerns 
those folks who want to go into office gov dukakis and 
george bush and dont take those populations that we represent 
seriously then we will not take them seriously john h smith 
mayor of prichard ala said thursday

ken monaghan paused at the top of north 
great georges street and said well this is where it all 
happened doesnt the whole place just reek of him 
he was referring to his uncle james joyce and the dublin he 
immortalized in that colossus of 20th century literature 
ulysses 
monaghan a gentle snowyhaired man of 62 was taking an 
acquaintance around the old neighborhood on bloomsday eve hoping 
to beat the influx of tourists and joyce lovers who arrived 
thursday for bloomsday itself the most celebrated day of 
remembrance ever created by a novel 
bloomsday is june 16 1904 the single day during which 
ulysses unfolds through the wanderings of joyces fictional 
alter ego stephen dedalus and that quintessential dubliner 
leopold bloom 
every bloomsday the faithful retrace the action from the 
starting point of ulysses at the tower overlooking the sea to 
the streets of inner dublin where the story ends 
they search for the little that is left of joyces meticulous 
charting some dress up in edwardian clothes beige ensembles 
favored by joyce and bloomstyle bowler and black threepiece suit 
the pilgrims meander from the forty foot the gentlemenonly 
bathing cove below the tower to no 7 eccles street where bloom 
lived with his adulterous wife molly 
in between they take in landmarks like the davy byrnes pub 
where bloom stopped for refreshment and a cemetery where he 
attended paddy dignams funeral they walk past saddened angels 
crosses broken pillars family vaults stone hopes praying with 
upcast eyes old irelands hearts and hands 
others are gathered in venice for the 11th international joyce 
conference 
at the tower now a joyce museum the dublin literati gather 
over wine and canapes to launch yet another guide to joyces 
dublin city hall as part of the celebrations of dublins 1988 
millennium has funded a series of plaques at ulysses landmarks 
this years bloomsday on thursday was especially elaborate 
with a recreation of dignams cortege complete with horsedrawn 
carriages 
it wasnt always so it took 30 years for dublin to start 
lionizing its native son and with good reason had he not written 
a profane and obscene book that poured scorn on everything from the 
roman catholic church to irish nationalism 
had he not lampooned his friends in the guise of fiction 
had he not deserted dublin in 1912 never to live there again 
monaghan remembers his aunts eva and florrie sisters of joyce 
imploring him never to tell anyone he was related to the writer 
even today joyces legacy is not all sweet his grandson 
stephen who lives in paris recently announced to the horror of 
joyceans that he had burned a series of letters by joyces daughter 
lucia who died in a sanatorium in 1982 
personal things should remain personal stephen joyce was 
quoted as saying being ill in the way my aunt was is very 
painful and it is deplorable to delve into it 
monaghans walk takes him past the home of john p mehaffy the 
late provost of trinity college dublin who once declared joyce to 
be all the evidence he needed that education was wasted on the 
irish 
belvedere school comes into view and the sidewalk joyce trod as 
a boy trying not to step on the cracks up the road lies mountjoy 
square where monaghans aunts lived he remembers them leaning out 
of a window with a telescope to read the time on findlaters church 
clock 
meanwhile back at the forty foot elderly men snort and splash 
in the emerald waters with warm sunshine merrying over the sea 
just as stephen dedalus saw it 
suddenly a gentleman in bowler and black threepiece suit drops 
a towel on a rock strips naked and plunges in 
its gerry davis a dublin painter who faithfully observes each 
anniversary with a swim at the forty foot 
despite his selfexile joyce said he never really left dublin 
all his writing was set there and he liked to say that if dublin 
was ever destroyed it could be reconstructed from his works 
dublin was slow to reciprocate early enthusiasts coined the 
name bloomsday in 1924 but only 30 years later did dublin writers 
stage the first commemoration 
today it is everything short of a public holiday copies of 
ulysses which once had to be smuggled into ireland now grace 
bookshop windows in all their unexpurgated glory 
joyce who also wrote finnegans wake and dubliners 
published ulysses in paris in 1922 and it was banned in the 
united states and britain that year joyce died in 1941 in zurich 
at age 59 
in 1924 joyce wrote in his notebook today 16th june 20 
years after will anybody remember this date

demonstrators and arrested 25 people who gathered to memorialize 
activists executed for leading the 1956 anticommunist revolt a 
dissident said today 
the government media reported only five arrests 
police arrested the demonstrators after thursdays unofficial 
gatherings in budapest dissident miklos haraszti said in a

morning vigil at the unmarked graves where former premier imre nagy 
and fellow leaders of the 1956 revolt are believed buried 
the revolt began oct 23 1956 with mass demonstrations for a 
new government and demands that soviet troops leave hungary on 
nov 4 the soviets mobilized 200000 soviet troops and 2500 tanks 
to quell the uprising in budapest 
the only official report on thursdays events came in a brief 
report carried by the mti news agency which said that five alleged 
ringleaders were detained for trying to bring under their 
influence the crowd whom they had mobilized 
the report accused the crowd of disregarding a preliminary 
warning by the police against attending the gatherings marking 
the 30th anniversary of the executions 
the protesters chanting democracy democracy and nagy 
nagy demanded rehabilitation of nagy and some of his associates 
who were also executed or sentenced to prison and sang the 
hungarian national anthem

they came with rubber truncheons and even drove motorcycles at 
a clip into the crowd to frighten and disperse it said a witness 
who spoke on condition of anonymity police were a little crazy 
i saw people knocked to the ground by the cops and beaten up 
the source said one of those injured was ottilia solt an 
activist who was taken to her home in pretty bad shape 
haraszti said police attacked deliberately and brutally and 
did not spare women or children 
witnesses said police did not interfere during an evening 
requiem mass however

associates marked 30 years since official media published a 
ministry of justice decree on june 17 1958 announcing the four 
were sentenced to death the statement said they played a leading 
role in the preparation and starting of the counterrevolutionary 
uprising in october 1956

former philippine president ferdinand marcos 
says proposed federal charges against him and his wife would be 
harassment and could not be proved but he acknowledges he is 
concerned 
of course im worried i am worried i could not sleep for one 
whole night when i learned about it marcos said thursday during 
a news conference at his home overlooking honolulu 
justice department officials have been reviewing proposed 
charges including racketeering conspiracy to loot the philippine 
government over 20 years and fraud in the way money was concealed 
behind false ownerships washingtonbased law enforcement 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said wednesday 
what is racketeering where is the proof of the transfer of 
funds marcos said 
he said there is nothing new about the allegations and dismissed 
them as the same old charges 
all along i thought this was over he said 
this has been going on for two years said marcos 70 
forced to leave office in 1986 and go into exile it is 
harassment pure and simple they should be dismissed because it is 
only hearsay 
marcos said there is no proof that he stole money while he was 
president 
on another topic marcos said he still held out hope that the 
government of president corazon aquino would allow him to return to 
the philippines for the funeral of his mother josefa edralin 
marcos who died may 4 at the age of 95 
after the news conference in marcos living room his wife

a hollywood photographer who spent 
decades shooting pictures of glamorous stars says his favorite 
subject was a shy adventurous pilot he thought of as a sister 
when albert bresnik signed on as amelia earharts personal 
photographer in 1932 he was accustomed to subjects with more flash 
and charisma than the aviation pioneer eventually he learned 
earharts inner beauty outshined the luster of his hollywood 
subjects 
she was a fantastic woman who didnt have what we call 
charisma she had an inner loveliness a gallant nature she wanted 
to prove that women should be as good as men in flight bresnik 
74 said during an interview wednesday 
i have photographed the biggest stars actresses that had a 
lot of beauty and talent but amelia has shone up above them all 
as part of the todays 60th anniversary of earharts first 
transatlantic flight bresnik is displaying rarely seen 
photographs of the aviator in this northern california city near 
san jose the photographs were taken during the five years before 
earhart disappeared in the south pacific 
on june 18 1928 earhart became the first woman to fly across 
the atlantic as a navigator she set out a day earlier flying with 
pilot wilmer stultz and an airplane mechanic lou gordon from 
trepassey newfoundland to burry port wales 
although earhart later made a solo flight across the atlantic 
the 1928 flight is hailed as a major aviation victory for women and 
was celebrated with a ticker tape parade in new york city 
earhart met bresnik four years later and hired him to accompany 
her to public events and help her prepare a book her husband 
publisher george putnam approached bresnik in 1932 while bresnik 
was a photographer for cbs 
she liked me very much right off the bat she called me her 
little brother we just joked and got along very well she didnt 
want anyone else to shoot her picture said bresnik who lives in 
the los angeles area 
several months before her mysterious disappearance they began 
shooting photographs for a book earhart wanted to call world 
flight originally bresnik was to accompany earhart and her 
navigator fred noonan and her radio control operator harry manning 
on their last flight 
however bresnik was replaced by earharts flight technician 
paul mantz 
i was supposed to go only because i would take pictures when 
she would stop and meet the heads of state during the last 2500 
miles i was to wait for her in oakland and photograph her 
arrival 
the crew of four flew to hawaii but they returned to oakland 
after the plane had mechanical problems earhart and noonan then 
recommenced their historic flight attempt heading east without 
mantz and manning 
the preparations changed daily she finally said to me well 
im leaving and i said i had a ticket to go and somewhere along 
the way i lost the ticket and she said well thats the way the 
wind blows 
i said god bless you have a nice trip and ill see you when 
you get back 
several years after the disappearance the book was published as 
last flight it features many of bresniks photographs of 
earhart and her model 10e electra flying laboratory the 
aircraft she was flying when she disappeared 
most of bresniks earhart photos were stored away after her 
disappearance he didnt bring them out until last year the 50th 
anniversary of earharts last flight 
many of the details surrounding earharts disappearance are 
unknown it is known that she completed about 22000 miles of the 
flight and it is believed she went down within 100 miles of the 
howland islands in the south pacific 
over the years there have been claims that earhart is alive and 
living on an island in the south pacific or that she and manning 
were actually spies who were kidnapped by the japanese 
while bresnik dismisses most of these claims but he does have 
one bizarre story of his own 
the day before earhart was reported missing a man walked into 
bresniks hollywood shop and identified himself as a doctor 
bresnik said he stared at one of bresniks photographs of earhart 
and said the lightforce in the picture is gone shes crashed 
and drowned bresnik said 
in hollywood we had people that were sort of crazy but i 
called george her husband and said george whats happened to 
amelia and he said shes fine i talked to her yesterday 
several hours later bresnik heard that earharts plane was lost

federal judges may be disqualified from 
presiding over cases even when they are unaware during trial of 
their personal connection to the cases the supreme court ruled 
today 
in a 54 ruling in a case from louisiana the court said the 
appearance of a conflict of interest is grounds for a judge to 
disqualify himself from presiding 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said even if a 
judge is unaware of a possible conflict while presiding over a case 
he later should disqualify himself when he learns of his connection 
the judges initial lack of knowledge of the possible conflict 
does not eliminate the risk that his impartiality might 
reasonably be questioned by other persons stevens said 
in such instances the judge is called upon to rectify an 
oversight and to take the steps necessary to maintain public 
confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary stevens said 
the case stems from a dispute over ownership of a hospital 
corporation it began in 1981 when health services acquisition 
corp filed a federal lawsuit against john liljeberg over ownership 
of a corporation known as st jude hospital of kenner la 
st jude hospital had a state certificate of approval to build a 
new facility 
us district judge robert f collins ruled on march 16 1982 
in favor of liljeberg 
but the following year health services acquisition learned that 
collins was a member of the board of trustees of loyola university 
which had been negotiating with liljeberg to sell him property for 
a new hospital 
liljebergs ability to build the hospital depended on his 
success in obtaining the st jude certificate of approval 
health services acquisition went back to court seeking to 
disqualify collins and throw out his ruling that favored liljeberg 
collins refused to disqualify himself but the 5th us circuit 
court overruled him and threw out the judgment favoring liljeberg 
in upholding the appeals court ruling the supreme court said 
collins should have disqualified himself when he became aware of 
his connection to the case even though he had a temporary memory 
lapse about his ties during the trial 
dissenting today were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white antonin scalia and sandra day oconnor 
the case is liljeberg vs health services acquisition 86957

the ptl ministry should strike a deal by 
the end of the month with one of at least four prospective buyers 
for its 2300acre heritage usa complex its bankruptcy trustee 
predicted 
mc red benton told us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds on 
thursday that all of the potential buyers want to maintain it as a 
christian retreat while allowing the church and cable television 
network to operate as a separate nonprofit corporation 
benton said he foresees no future for founder jim bakker at ptl 
either as a legitimate buyer or as a guest on the ministrys cable 
television program 
bakker has shown no positive evidence he has resources to come 
up with a plan to buy ptl and his presence on the show would be 
harmful to the ministry benton said hes still floundering out 
in left field 
bentons comments came as a bakker attorney submitted a formal 
proposal for bakker to regain control of the ministry a newspaper 
reported today 
bakker proposes to rent the heritage grand hotel and heritage 
island water park in fort mill sc while buying broadcast time 
on the ptl satellite network the charlotte nc observer 
reported 
the newspaper said bakker attorney ryan hovis gave the proposal 
to ptl attorney joe allman after thursdays court hearing 
the newspaper cited unidentified sources as saying the proposal 
is unacceptable to benton and reynolds because bakkers return 
would seriously damage the ministrys credibility 
benton said after the hearing that sports entrepreneur george 
shinn will submit a plan before the week ends to buy ptls 
property where he would build a sports complex while allowing the 
ministry functions to continue 
bakker has criticized shinns proposal because it would allow 
alcohol to be sold at the heritage grand hotel 
bakker said wednesday that he still intends to regain control of 
the ministry he began building in 1974 and believes he will be 
accepted back by ptls followers despite the sex and money scandal 
that surfaced when he resigned in march 1987 
benton said the only way ptl can survive is if it sells its 
property and forms a nonprofit ministry that is debt free ptl 
with current debts of up to 130 million and assets of 160 
million filed for reorganization in june 1987 
also thursday bakker and his wife tammy began moving into a 
house in lake wylie near ptls fort mill headquarters said bakker 
attorney james toms 
inez brown president of the bring bakkers back club said in a 
news release that members of the group leased the 1000amonth 
house for nine months for the bakkers

the supreme court resolving what it called 
a peculiar battle between two federal appeals courts told one 
of those courts today to tackle an antitrust dispute over the m16 
the us military standard rifle 
the justices unanimously ruled that the chicagobased 7th us 
circuit court of appeals should rule in the case not the 
washingtonbased us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
the justices also said the washingtonbased court was wrong 
when in the interest of justice it ruled in the case after 
deciding it lacked the proper authority to do so 
charles r christianson owner of an m16 parts company called 
international trade services inc sued colt industries operating 
corp in 1984 he charged colt which dominates the market for m16 
sales with violating federal antitrust law 
the lawsuit filed in federal court in chicago contends that 
colt abused patents it held for the rifle and its various parts to 
monopolize the market illegally 
us district judge robert d morgan ruled for christianson and 
colt appealed to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
a washingtonbased court that concentrates on patent disputes 
christianson sought to have the case transferred to the 7th 
circuit court and the federal circuit court agreed with him that 
it lacked the jurisdiction to handle colts appeal 
the 7th circuit court however ruled that the federal circuit 
court was clearly wrong in its jurisdictional decision and sent 
the case back to washington 
confronted with the case a second time the washingtonbased 
appeals court last year said that although it lacked the proper 
jurisdiction it would rule in the case 
it then ruled against christianson 
writing for the high court today justice william j brennan 
said the 7th circuit court was wrong about which court had 
jurisdiction and set aside the federal circuit courts ruling on 
the lawsuits merits 
in a victory for christianson the case now heads back to the 
7th circuit court 
the case is christianson vs colt industries 87499

the head of an animal rights group says shes not 
impressed by a poll which found that 77 percent of americans 
believe medical progress depends on the use of animals in research 
its hardly an unbiased survey i must say said ingrid 
newkirk director of people for the ethical treatment of animals 
ms newkirk considers the poll commissioned by the american 
medical association a public relations ploy saying the money 
could have been put to greater use by improving the living 
conditions of laboratory animals 
results of the survey conducted in february by tarrancesri of 
houston were reported in todays edition of american medical news 
the weekly newspaper of the ama 
of 1500 adults surveyed nationwide 77 percent said they 
believed the use of animals in medical research is necessary while 
17 percent disagreed and 6 percent werent sure the ama reported 
support of animal research appeared to grow with education and 
income level the poll found of respondents with annual incomes of 
at least 30000 83 percent approved of the research 
respondents were surveyed by telephone in a random sample of 
residential listings in the united states the margin of error was 
plus or minus 25 percent the ama said 
the overwhelming positive response to our survey question 
indicates to me that a vast majority of the american public 
recognizes the benefits their families enjoy with todays modern 
medicines which were made possible by animal research said dr 
james h sammons ama executive vice president 
the american medical association has been and will continue to 
be a very vocal proponent of responsible and let me emphasize 
responsible use of animals in medical research 
ms newkirk said the poll was nothing but an attempt to turn 
back the growing tide of public opinion that animals need some 
protection in the lab her private notforprofit group based 
in washington dc has 150000 members 
she accused the ama of leading the fight to defeat all 
legislation on capitol hill no matter how minimal that would 
affect the living and dying conditions of animals 
dr m roy schwarz countered newkirks charge that the poll was 
biased saying we certainly would stand behind the findings 
schwarz the amas assistant executive vice president for 
medical education and science also denied that the ama has tried 
to thwart efforts to protect laboratory animals 
he said the organization is supporting revision of department of 
agriculture guidelines to set higher standards and force 
improvement in animal facilities 
newkirk said the immediate goal of her group is to eliminate 
gratuitous cruelty to animals including the testing of 
cosmetics and eventually hopes to end all animal lab testing 
the congressional office of technology assessment estimates that 
between 17 million and 22 million animals are used annually in 
biomedical experiments and that 75 percent to 90 percent are 
rodents rats mice hamsters guinea pigs and rabbbits 
dogs cats and primates make up less than 5 percent with fish 
amphibians and birds making up the rest 
sixty percent of the experiments cause no suffering to the 
animal and in 32 percent of cases animals receive painkilling 
drugs or anesthesia according to stephen smith a senior scientist 
with the ama department of drugs division of drugs and toxicology 
in 8 percent of cases the animal does suffer pain he said

texas parks and wildlife commission he said he had agreed to plead 
guilty to one count of bank fraud stemming from 80 million in

four convicted killers and four other 
inmates who fled kentuckys maximumsecurity prison may have spent 
months plotting their elaborate escape plan from the 105yearold 
fortress officials say 
they had no hope of leaving legally anytime soon they had 
nothing else to do but spend their time thinking of a way to get 
out jack wood a spokesman for the kentucky state penitentiary 
said after thursdays escape 
bobby waller another prison spokesman said today that a 2 to 
3inch piece of hacksaw blade was found in one of the escapees 
cells the first tool of escape officials had found 
he said investigators had recovered other information but he was 
unable to release any details 
in fayetteville nc meanwhile authorities today recaptured 
the third of six men who escaped from a cumberland county jail on 
sunday 
prison officials are usually able to prevent escape attempts 
because they hear the rumblings that somethings going on and 
then conduct searches that turn up contraband or homemade equipment 
that could be used in an escape said kentucky state penitentiary 
warden william seabold 
but the number of escapees and the avenue they took would 
indicate it was wellplanned and not a spurofthemoment escape 
attempt seabold said 
the eight are believed to have split up after what authorities 
say was the largest prison escape in state history the search for 
the inmates was focused within two miles of the prison and there 
were no confirmed sightings of the escapees by midmorning said 
waller 
at least nine other inmates also attempted to flee the prison 
authorities said 
the penitentiary about 200 miles southwest of louisville on 
lake barkley was built in 1883 and has undergone several additions 
and renovations over the years it is surrounded on three sides by 
water and on the fourth by woods but no wall or fence enclosed the 
cellblock from which the eight fled 
waller said a boat was being used in the search as well as two 
state police small airplanes 20 troopers a dog team local 
authorities and 60 prison officers in addition pictures of the 
escapees were distributed in area stores and gas stations 
dogs tracked the scent of at least one escapee to the site where 
a pickup truck was stolen about a halfmile from the prison 
authorities warned residents to lock their doors and watch their 
children closely 
collaborators set several small fires in another section of the 
building early thursday to divert guards giving the eight about 15 
minutes to make their escape waller said 
fire in an institution like this is an extreme emergency 
wood said explaining why guards at the time were not paying 
attention to the cellhouse from which the prisoners escaped 
youve got people locked up in cells and they cant get away 
youve got an enclosed area and smoke can reach dangerous levels 
very quickly 
the escapees were housed in a cellblock known as the jail 
within the jail which is used to separate certain inmates from 
the general population wood said 
theres more security in the sense that theres more staff in 
the cellhouse wood said 
wood said six of the escapees who included four convicted 
killers were being housed in the cellhouse because they had been 
charged with or found guilty of assault on other inmates the other 
two were being investigated for an escape attempt last week 
the escapees apparently sawed open their cell doors and then cut 
through a prison window that was enclosed by a screen on one side 
and crisscrossed bars on the other he said they climbed down an 
extension cord tied to a window about 30 feet above the ground 
once outside the escapees traveled across a small parking lot 
toward lake barkley where they walked along the shore to the other 
side of the prison and up into a wooded area wood said 
one prisoner who failed to escape was found hanging from the 
window and three others were outside their cells five additional 
cells had been tampered with waller said 
the prison which houses 780 inmates remained under lockdown 
status during which time prisoners are confined to their cells he 
said 
were going to make absolutely sure there is nothing else in 
progress seabold said 
in north carolina three prison escapees were still at large 
from a sunday jailbreak including a former soldier convicted in 
two ninjastyle slayings 
gregory maurice lee 30 of fayetteville was arrested early 
today at an apartment after fayetteville police received a 
telephone tip lee who had been serving time for burglary larceny 
and assault offered no resistance said police lt william 
barefoot 
six men escaped from the law enforcement center sunday night 
after using hacksaw blades to cut through a floorlevel piece of 
steel and kick out a portion of a bar authorities said they used 
knotted bedsheets to climb four stories down the buildings side 
one escapee fell and was soon recaptured a second prisoner was 
arrested wednesday

the supreme court today struck down an ohio 
law that exempted from any deadlines the filing of lawsuits against 
outofstate defendants 
the court by an 81 vote ruled that the law unduly interfered 
with interstate commerce 
the decision upheld lower court rulings that an ohio 
manufacturers breachofcontract lawsuit against an illinois 
corporation properly was dismissed for having been filed too late 
the justices said the ohio law that would have allowed the 
manufacturer to sue even after the normal deadline had passed 
discriminated against outofstate businesses 
bendix autolite corp sued midwesco enterprises inc in 1980 
over a coalfired boiler that was installed in a bendix plant at 
fostoria ohio in 1975 
midwesco sought to have the lawsuit dismissed contending that 
under ohio law suits alleging breach of contract or fraud must be 
filed within four years of the alleged wrongdoing 
the lawyers for bendix relied on another ohio law one saying 
lawsuits against outofstate defendants do not have to comply with 
the usual fouryear deadline 
writing for the high court today justice anthony m kennedy 
said the ohio law forced outofstate businesses to choose 
between exposure to the general jurisdiction of ohio courts or 
forfeiture of the statute of limitations defense remaining 
subject to suit in ohio in perpetuity 
saying the law imposed a significant burden on outofstate 
defendants kennedy added the ohio statute imposes a greater 
burden on outofstate companies than it does on ohio companies 
subjecting the activities of foreign and domestic corporations to 
inconsistent regulations 
chief justice william h rehnquist dissented voting to 
reinstate the ohio law 
the case is bendix autolite vs midwesco enterprises 87367

a speciallybuilt dutch cargo ship is in 
the persian gulf to carry the minedamaged us navy frigate samuel 
b roberts back to the united states this month us military 
officials disclosed today 
the mighty servant 2 a 25743ton semisubmersible cargo 
ship was escorted into the gulf tuesday and went to dubai where 
the samuel b roberts is in drydock 
the 3600ton frigate has been undergoing preliminary repairs in 
dubai since it struck a mine in the central gulf on april 14 ten 
members of its crew were injured in the blast 
us officers have credited other crewmen with saving them and 
the ship itself after the mine laid by iran blew a 22foot gash 
in the hull 
the navy contracted the mighty servant 2 from its owners 
wijsmuller beheer bv of ijmuiden netherlands to carry the 
frigate back to the united states rather than attempt to sail it 
home 
maj charles boyd a spokesman for the us central command 
said no firm date had been set for the samuel b roberts 
departure but military sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the ship would leave the gulf this month 
he said it would be taken to its home port at newport ri navy 
officials said earlier that the 2yearold ship would be returned 
to the bath iron works in bath maine where it was built for 
final repairs 
the samuel b roberts had just completed escorting a 
usflagged kuwaiti tanker to kuwait and was saiing back down the 
gulf when it lumbered over what us offiers say was a freshlylaid 
minefield 50 miles northeast of qatar 
the united states retaliated for the mining four days later with 
attacks on two iranian oil platforms in the south central gulf 
that action began a day of fighting during which six iranian naval 
craft were sunk or disabled 
the navy escorts followed the us reflagging of kuwaiti tankers 
to protect neutral shipping in the gulf which has been the scene 
of spillover violence in the 7yearold iraniraq war

the white house hinted today that president 
reagan might still veto a bill designed to turn the nations 
depressionera welfare system into a jobs program but backers said 
support for the measure is so strong that a veto threat does not 
worry them 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said an amendment added 
by the senate mandating a work requirement for a small percentage 
of welfare recipients was very progressive and helpful 
but he said the administration still has some problems with 
the bill which now goes to a congressional conference committee 
to iron out differences with the version passed by the house 
we would like to go further even in some of these areas 
than the senate did the spokesman said he said the workfare 
amendment was very important and the white house would be 
studying other amendments added by the senate 
the house version without the work requirement is more 
objectionable to the administration 
well try to get changes in conference but its going to be 
very tough to reconcile with the house bill that is so far out of 
line with our judgment fitzwater said 
when asked whether the president would sign the bill the 
spokesman said there is no decision at this point well just 
have to wait and see 
the measure passed by the senate by a vote of 933 far more 
than the twothirds majority needed to override a veto sen daniel 
patrick moynihan and rep thomas downey both new york democrats 
said house and senate negotiators are expected to work out their 
differences on the bill and have it on reagans desk by labor day 
the reagan administration had voiced concerns about the measure 
but senate republicans said that if conferees agreed on a bill that 
looked like the senate version president reagan might sign it 
the two bill sponsors interviewed on nbctvs today show 
termed the differences in the house and senate bills primarily 
technical moynihan noted that the senates 933 vote indicated 
strong support in the event of a veto 
downey said the negotiators have to be concerned about a 
veto but added im not sure that that is the end of the world 
if the president vetoes it 
its possible to override the presidents veto its possible 
to attach it to something he wants its also possible to introduce 
a bill possibly with a democratic president in the next congress 
that does all that we want it to do he said 
the senate voted 933 thursday to pass the 28 billion family 
security act after bowing to nearly all of president reagans 
requests including adoption of a mandatory workfare provision for 
a small percentage of welfare recipients 
moynihan author of the bill on thursday called it the first 
legislation of its kind since the welfare system was established in 
the 1930s 
the house last december passed a 7 billion welfare overhaul 
bill moynihan and downey sponsor of the house bill refused to 
speculate on whether negotiations to reconcile the two bills would 
produce a plan acceptable to the white house 
the centerpiece of both bills is a massive new jobs education 
and training program aimed particularly at people who are longterm 
or likely to become longterm welfare recipients the 
legislation also contains stringent new child support collection 
requirements meant to assure that noncustodial parents pay their 
fair share 
the house would also offer financial incentives to states to 
raise their cash benefits to poor families which in many states 
are less than half the federal poverty line 
moynihan throughout an 18month campaign for his bill decried 
the generally low level of welfare benefits but did not include a 
provision to raise them 
we can never address the issue of benefits at the national 
level until weve persuaded the american public that this is a work 
program a child support program he said after the vote we 
have started in that direction today 
aid to families with dependent children was established in 1935 
as part of the social security system and now supports 37 million 
families some 7 million children are on afdc which would be 
renamed the child support supplement system under moynihans bill 
originally conceived as a widows benefit when women did not 
work outside the home afdc now is dominated by divorced and unwed 
mothers at a time when the majority of new mothers are at work 
within a year of having a child 
a 1987 study of welfaretowork programs found numerous problems 
including lack of money lack of essential support services 
exclusion of mothers of children under 6 and little attention to 
the people needing the most help 
under the new jobs program states would have to offer a wide 
range of activities including job training and basic education as 
well as actual work they would have to include as many people as 
they could afford and half the money would have to be spent on 
those most likely to spend years on the rolls 
both the senate and house bills commit substantial amounts of 
federal money to the jobs program and to support services such as 
child care mothers with children under 3 would be exempt from the 
worktraining requirement but states could lower that to age 1 
both bills also require states to extend welfare benefits to 
poor twoparent families the senate bill only would require the 
benefits for six months in any 12month period 26 states already 
provide yearround coverage 
negotiations throughout the week produced a number of senate 
concessions to the reagan administration including a provision 
phasing in mandatory workfare for one adult in twoparent families 
on the rolls the workfare or community work would have to total 
at least 16 hours a week 
moynihan argued against the requirement on the floor saying 
only nine states have workfare programs and many governors consider 
them costly and counterproductive 
but when senate republican leader bob dole rkan offered the 
requirement as an amendment senators refused 5441 to kill it 
they then accepted the measure by a voice vote 
senators also agreed to a white house request for mandatory jobs 
program participation rates the jobs education and training 
activities offered by the states would have to be serving 22 
percent of eligible participants by 1994 
money to cover 28 billion in new spending under the moynihan 
bill would come from making permanent a tax refund withholding 
program to recover federal debts and phasing out the business 
meals and entertainment tax deduction for people with incomes over 
360000 it would be eliminated entirely at 440000 
voting no on the bill were sens jesse helms rnc gordon

in a twist on a tactic generally used to 
increase black representation birminghams white minority has won 
a ruling allowing it to challenge atlarge local elections for 
allegedly diluting white votes 
similar suits filed by blacks have thrown out atlarge election 
systems in many other cities as violations of the 1965 voting 
rights act 
us district judge robert b propst signed a ruling thursday 
rejecting the citys request to throw out the suit which seeks to 
impose singlemember district elections for the ninemember city 
council 
propsts ruling sets the stage for trial of the lawsuit 
possibly this fall and holds that voting rights law applies to 
white minorities in the same way it has protected blacks who once 
were a minority in a segregated birmingham 
the court finds no substantial indication in the act or in its 
legislative history which suggests that some minority races are not 
protected by it said propst 
if it were so it would be contrary to other civil rights 
legislation which may have been spawned by virtue of wellknown and 
blatant discrimination against blacks but the reach of which 
extends to both black and white he said 
the suit was filed by a biracial group that claims the jefferson 
county citizens coalition led by black mayor richard arrington 
has turned birminghams white voters into an oppressed minority 
donald watkins the citys attorney in the case said he was not 
surprised by the ruling 
ever since the first hearing before judge propst in 
december my clients have realized and been prepared to go the 
long haul on this case watkins said we are prepared to go the 
distance 
the city claims that the election of three white council members 
proves that whites are not shut out of the atlarge system 
jack harrison an attorney for the plaintiffs said the city has 
not been willing to negotiate he declined comment on the judges 
ruling 
propst rejected the plaintiffs claim that the lawsuit is not a 
racial issue and gave the biracial groups attorneys 10 days to 
show why its three black members should not be dismissed from the 
action 
that would leave only the white voters claim that their voting 
strength is being diluted by black bloc voting

public criticism by revamping a radio commercial to remove an 
excerpt of the rev jimmy swaggarts public admission that he had

its basically the same kind of commercial ms neus said 
thursday of the edited spot it just doesnt have swaggart 
the promotional campaign also included a television 
advertisement that did not mention swaggart ms neus said 
swaggart a louisianabased television preacher made the public 
admission of sin in a february speech to his congregation he never 
specified the sin but he was reported to have met several times 
with a prostitute at a new orleans motel to watch her perform 
sexual acts he has not denied those reports 
william treeby a new orleans lawyer who is a board member of 
jimmy swaggart ministries said his organization did not plan to 
take any legal action against the company 
they have withdrawn all their advertisement and theyve 
apologized treeby said thursday 
ms neus said the opera had not apologized it was just in 
fun we were hoping to attract people to the opera

thousands of works of art that 
decorated the walls of dutch offices around the world are missing 
the government says and some of the paintings may even have ended 
up in the trash 
koos de jong who oversees the governments collection of 
360000 works of art said he discovered the pieces were missing 
when he took an inventory recently he was quoted friday by the 
amsterdam daily de volkskrant 
about 165000 pieces had been lent to government offices and 
embassies around the world and many never came back he said 
the government began collecting the works under a postworld war 
ii program to support dutch artists the collection also includes 
antiques and paintings by masters of the 17th 18th and 19th 
centuries 
there may be several thousand i cant predict for sure 
that are certainly gone de jong told de volkskrant artworks 
got lost or were irreparably damaged because of illtreatment 
de jong is head of collections for the dutch national pictorial 
arts service he did not disclose a damage figure and the article 
did not provide details on the missing art 
in the old days it was possible for government officials to 
come and collect paintings or bits of furniture from the national 
depot just as they pleased de jong said 
even now it can still happen that a work given on loan years 
ago becomes part of somebodys inventory and ends up among the 
garbage when the office is being moved or redecorated he said 
de jongs service itself recently moved to new quarters in the 
hague from an old amsterdam warehouse where much of the collection 
lay gathering dust 
today the art is carefully stored on specially designed racks 
in airconditioned rooms

the government has underestimated the strength of 
religion in the soviet union and should set the record straight 
four prominent intellectuals said in a letter published friday 
publication of the letter in pravda the communist party 
newspaper indicated at least some official support it appeared on 
the day the soviet union ended its twoweek celebration of the 
1000th anniversary of the arrival of christianity in what is now 
the soviet union 
those signing the letter were sociologist tatyana zaslavskaya 
literary critic and translator sergei averintsev ales adamovich a 
byelorussian writer and physicist boris raushenbach all are 
strong supporters of mikhail s gorbachevs effort to reform soviet 
society 
it is necessary once and for all to interpret the church in 
our country as a huge and complicated social phenomenon they 
wrote 
the writers said religion must be an important part of soviet 
life if the customary dogma of atheist propaganda cannot 
curtail the religious consciousness of millions of citizens 
figures on the number of believers reported by regional and 
republican authorities in the council on religious affairs of the 
ussr council of ministers patently dont correspond to 
reality the letter said 
a truer indication of its strength the writers declared is the 
35 million rubles 56 million the russian orthodox church 
contributes each year to the soviet peace fund an official charity 
western experts in the field believe there are tens of millions 
of religious people in the soviet union 
in their letter to pravda the four intellectuals proposed using 
the propaganda apparatus that preaches atheism to study the real 
situation of religious consciousness of citizens of the ussr 
to provide not illusory but a reliable scientifically based 
conception of this subject 
the constitution guarantees freedom of worship but it also 
guarantees freedom of antireligious propaganda which is carried 
out in schools official publications and elsewhere 
a 1929 law on the relationship between state and church was 
adopted in the period of huge social deformations the letter 
said in an indirect criticism of dictator josef stalin who was in 
power at the time 
under that law religious groups must register with the 
government and cannot do charitable work it also restricts 
religious education 
thousands of churches were destroyed under stalin and many 
priests were imprisoned or killed 
gorbachev told patriarch pimen head of the russian orthodox 
church in april that a new law on freedom of conscience was 
being prepared 
no details have been released konstantin kharchev chairman of 
the governments council on religious affairs refused to say when 
the law would be ready but told a news conference friday there 
is no doubt it will be done quickly 
he said the law on religion and other changes under the reform 
program gorbachev calls perestroika or restructuring will guard 
against suppression of the church 
this sorrowful past will not be repeated kharchev said 
everything will be done so as not to allow a repetition

former utah sen frank moss is seeking to 
revive interest in a massive project proposed in the 1960s to 
transport water south from alaska and canada 
perhaps the current drought will spur some action toward 
longterm solutions like the north american water and power 
alliance moss said at a news conference friday 
the project calls for canals to draw water from northflowing 
rivers and to transport it south to help irrigate the agricultural 
regions of canada the united states and northern mexico 
but moss admitted that the project is no immediate solution to 
the drought now plaguing north america it would take an about 20 
years to complete the project at a cost estimated in 1964 of 80 
billion based simply on inflation that would translate to a cost 
of 303 billion today 
the environmental impact of transferring billions of gallons of 
water from one region to another also has not been studied 
acknowledged moss and nicholas f benton who said he represented a 
committee promoting the project 
benton who described himself as a journalist for the century 
news service contended that plenty of water is available in the 
north 
however he was unable to produce any figures to back that 
assertion

a judge today denied a petition to delay the 
execution of a man convicted of two murders and accused of 14 
others while appeals on his behalf are considered 
the ruling by circuit judge john f patterson came despite 
testimony at a hearing this morning from a psychiatrist who said he 
was having second thoughts about his earlier judgment that r gene 
simmons was competent and responsible for his actions when the 
slayings occurred last december 
mr simmons seems more competent than most of the testimony 
that ive heard here today patterson said in denying the 
petition filed on behalf of the rev louis franz of star city 
representing a group called arkansas churches for life 
the judge also denied a motion to appeal simmons conviction and 
sentence 
franz and his attorney mark cambiano of morrilton filed the 
petition to stop the execution in an effort to assure an appeal of 
simmons may 12 conviction for killing two people in a dec 28 
shooting rampage at russellville 
after he was sentenced simmons read a statement asking that he 
be executed quickly and that no appeals be filed on his behalf 
simmons is scheduled to die by injection june 27 he also is 
charged with two counts of capital murder in the deaths of 14 
family members whose bodies were found t the simmons home in a 
rural area near dover north of russellville trial on those 
charges is scheduled for july 18 
dr irving kuo a psychiatrist at the state hospital in little 
rock testified today that he began to have doubts about simmons 
competence after receiving a letter simmons wrote in response to a 
letter kuo sent him after the trial last month 
officials are starting to play their little games simmons 
said in the letter to kuo the psychiatrist said that suggests 
simmons has some characteristics of paranoia 
simmons lawyers john c harris and robert e doc irwin 
and prosecutor john bynum attacked kuos new opinion 
if this letter demonstrates anything at all all it 
demonstrates is that he may be getting a little bit paranoid a 
little bit tired bynum said 
kuo said bynums opinion represented one possibility but that 
others were that he has been paranoid and is becoming more 
paranoid and he has been paranoid and its coming out more in 
the open 
kuos letter to simmons had asked for information about what 
motivated simmons in his crimes saying the request was for 
personal and professional curiosity and to obtain information that 
might be published in a scientific journal 
simmons has said in letters to newspapers that he doesnt want 
franz to be allowed to intervene and he accused cambiano of trying 
to make a name for himself in arkansas legal history

the security council on friday unanimously 
adopted a resolution appealing to the south african government to 
stay the executions of six black prisoners 
the united states which sometimes vetoes measures to shield 
south africa declined to exercise its veto and allowed the mercy 
plea to pass it was a clear signal to the pretoria government of 
washingtons displeasure with plans to execute the socalled 
sharpeville six 
on thursday secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar appealed 
for clemency 
the council said it was convinced that the executions if 
carried out would further inflame an already grave situation in 
south africa 
it called once again upon the south african authorities to 
stay execution and commute the death sentences imposed on the 
sharpeville six 
in march the 15member security council appealed to the south 
african government to grant clemency to the six the council 
frequently condemns south africa for its system of apartheid but 
south africa says the un group has no right to interfere in 
domestic affairs 
the six were convicted of participating in a 1984 riot in which 
a black sharpeville town councilor was killed but they were not 
found to have joined in the physical assault 
the members of the council are the united states britain 
china france and the soviet union the permanent five nuclear 
powers and algeria argentina brazil italy japan nepal 
senegal west germany yugoslavia and zambia 
the united states frequently vetoes security council 
denunciations of south africa and its calls for sanctions against 
the government but the united states sometimes declines to 
exercise its veto and allows certain critical resolutions to pass 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million black majority has no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services

the reagan administration on friday refused to 
endorse a landmark senate welfare bill and said a veto still was 
possible due to potential welfare demands in the house far out of 
line with our judgment 
the senate bill passed 933 on thursday carries a fiveyear 
price tag of about 28 billion while the house plan passed 
narrowly in december is much more generous and would cost 7 
billion 
it is a case of sisyphus having to push the rock up the 
mountain at this point white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
told reporters friday we will try to get changes in the 
conference between house and senate negotiators but its going 
to be very tough to reconcile with the house bill that is so far 
out of line with our judgment 
both the senate and house bills are designed to turn the 
countrys depressionera welfare system into a jobs program with a 
rigorous child support collections component government assistance 
would be a last and temporary resort 
negotiators from each chamber will start meeting in two to three 
weeks to try to reconcile the two bills they expect to have a 
compromise measure on the presidents desk by labor day 
rep tom downey dny sponsor of the house plan which gives 
more money to the jobs program said he would try to retain a 
higher spending level than called for by the senate 
if youre going to have a meaningful work program you have to 
be prepared to help finance it downey said 
downey also said a house plan to offer financial incentives to 
states that raise cash benefits which are very low in some places 
would be hotly fought and contested in the housesenate 
conference 
despite those difficulties downey said he was optimistic that 
an acceptable compromise could be struck if the administration 
will sign a welfare bill that is something similar to the senate 
bill then maybe we can work out a deal 
fitzwater indicated however that the administration had not 
yet decided whether the senate bill even with revisions sought by 
the white house was acceptable 
we still have some problems with the bill he said but 
added that white house officials would examine the changes that 
were made thursday in response to their demands 
senators agreed to compromises on two major concerns raised by 
reagan one provision says that by 1994 state jobs education and 
training programs must be serving 22 percent of eligible 
participants 
the other more controversial provision requires that states 
create workfare programs or community work projects and require 
parttime participation for one adult in each twoparent family on 
welfare 
its the first time a welfare bill has ever been passed that 
includes a federal requirement for work in association with 
welfare and in that sense we believe it is a very important 
concept to be established in law fitzwater said 
but governors generally oppose the provision as do downey and 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny author of the senate bill 
moynihan said governors consider it costly and counterproductive 
especially in states with strong labor markets

the occupational safety and health 
administration on friday tightened its regulations on concrete and 
masonary construction saying its new standards will save the lives 
of 120 workers a year 
the new regulations in the making since 1982 require 
additional bracing of concrete and masonry walls and more thorough 
testing of concrete to assure that it has hardened sufficiently 
before braces are removed or loads are put on it 
the changes were prompted by a 1978 accident in which 51 
construction workers plunged to their deaths when scaffolding 
anchored in uncured concrete collapsed on a power plant cooling 
tower being built at willow island wva 
a similar accident occurred in 1973 when 14 workers were killed 
and 34 were injured because of the premature removal of forms 
supporting the 23rd floor of an apartment building under 
construction in fairfax county va 
however the new osha regulations do not address the 
controversial liftslab construction practice involved in the 
collapse last year of the halfbuilt lambiance plaza apartment 
complex in bridgeport conn which killed 28 workers 
as with the willow island and fairfax county accidents osha 
officials determined that the lambiance plaza collapse would not 
have occurred had the contractors involved been complying with 
existing federal regulations 
officials said friday that new safety requirements for 
liftslab construction a process in which floor and roof 
slabs are cast on the ground and then jacked upward into position 
will not be proposed until later this year 
they said the agency is reopening the issue because of new 
technical information arising out of the investigation of the 
lambiance plaza accident 
the new regulations to take effect in 60 days update 1971 
standards to prohibit premature removal of forms require bracing 
for masonry walls for the first time mandate supports for precast 
panels and establish limited access zones around wall construction 
areas 
in addition they recognize new methods for testing concrete 
and to prevent workers from being impaled require that protective 
coverings be placed over exposed reinforcement bars or that the 
bars be bent over 
the changes also remove ambiguities in the old rules making 
it easier and less expensive for employers to protect their 
employees said john pendergrass assistant labor secretary and 
osha administrator 
in addition to saving 120 lives a year osha officials estimate 
that the new regulations will prevent 7000 onthejob injuries 
annually among the nations 38 million construction workers 
compliance is expected to cost contractors an additional 382 
million a year but officials said savings from less property 
damage construction delays and insurance premiums asa result of 
fewer accidents are expected to total nearly 350 million annually 
osha estimated that about 80 percent of the nearly 250000 
masonry and concrete contractors in the country have fewer than 10 
employees and that the cost to those firms would average only 339 
a year a small price to pay for saving lives and reducing the 
number of injuries pendergrass said 
many of the specific changes in the regulations were recommended 
or endorsed by construction unions 
however jim lapping a safety specialist for the aflcios 
building and construction trades department said there was no 
reason to delay the new regulations on liftslab construction 
the ansi american national standards institute committee has 
made its recommendations and there is plenty of information on the 
record lapping said but this administration has not been 
noted to responding quickly or to our advice we still dont have a 
tunnel standard that was proposed in 1972 
lapping said the building trade unions support legislation 
introduced thursday by sen lowell p weicker jr and rep 
christopher shays both rconn that would criminalize 
construction safety law violations and require a professional 
engineer to oversee all work

sen sam nunn said friday he told michael 
dukakis campaign chairman this week hes not interested in the 
vice presidential nomination 
nunn dga didnt rule out accepting such an offer saying in 
an interview it would be very presumptuous to respond to 
hypothetical questions about what he would do if the no 2 spot 
were offered by dukakis the likely democratic presidential nominee 
however he said its not my desire to have that job offered 
to me and then to turn it down i dont think thats good for the 
process or for dukakis 
nunn was among the members of congress who met individually this 
week with paul brountas dukakis campaign chairman to discuss the 
vice presidency 
the georgian who is chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said he has talked with dukakis at length on the 
telephone in recent weeks about national security issues but he 
said the only time he has talked with the massachusetts governor 
about the vice presidency was when dukakis told him brountas would 
be contacting him during his tour of capitol hill 
nunn said he got the impression from talking with brountas that 
dukakis hasnt decided exactly what he is looking for in a vice 
presidential nominee either politically or in terms of what role 
the vice president would play in his administration 
asked directly if he would accept a spot on the ticket if asked 
by dukakis nunn said i think its very presumptuous to sort of 
set up a hypothetical example of what one would do if one were 
offered something that one is not seeking and one is discouraging 
so i havent gone to the extent of making a shermanlike 
statement i feel its kind of presumptuous and at this stage 
unnecessary he said

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
met friday with un delegates about the nearly 700 million that 
member countries owe the united nations a debt that un officials 
said could close the organization 
the secretarygeneral consulted with eastern european delegates 
on friday earlier in the week he met with western european asian 
and latin american delegates and is expected to meet with african 
delegates next week 
perez de cuellar and un staff officials have said the united 
nations could become insolvent by late october if members dont pay 
what they owe 
the united states is responsible for most of the debt it owes 
467 million of the 691 million outstanding 
most of the us money has been withheld in the past few years 
due to congressional disagreements with un policies and 
operations and in an attempt to influence soviet personnel policy 
at the world body 
the soviet union has launched a campaign over the past year to 
increase its influence and standing at the united nations it has 
paid off about 60 million in arrears to the regular budget and is 
beginning to repay about 200 million it owed for peacekeeping 
operations which come under a separate budget 
the united states has traditionally been assessed onefourth of 
the annual un budget of nearly 1 billion the un money comes 
from assessments of member nations which are based on the nations 
wealth 
congress in 1985 passed an amendment to the budget bill 
sponsored by sen nancy kassebaum rkan and rep gerald solomon 
rny that allows the withholding of part of the us dues to the 
united nations 
part of the dues are paid when assessed but the majority are 
withheld until the president informs congress that adequate 
progress is being made on cutting the un staff by 15 percent and 
other budgetary reforms and that more soviet un employees are 
shifted from shortterm contracts to longterm international civil 
servant status 
the goal of the us demand for the soviet personnel policy 
change is to make soviet staff loyal to the international civil 
service and independent of moscows goals 
until recently nearly all soviets were rotated through the 
united nations on contracts of fewer than five years in may 
however the soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky 
announced that more soviets would be allowed to sign permanent 
contracts with the un secretariat 
that statement would appear to meet the last serious objection 
that us officials had to paying the full un dues assessment 
satisfactory progress has been made on the personnel cuts and 
budgetary reforms said a us official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
one un staff official suggested that if the united states 
continued to withhold funds perhaps the soviets would allow the 
early payment of the second half of their annual dues which they 
usually pay in october

within every state he visits

know it will be close but i believe the gap between george bush 
and michael dukakis will be closing

nearly 1700 guerrillas jailed in 
ugandas civil conflict were freed today the government announced 
the release is expected to bolster president yoweri musevenis 
efforts to organize peace talks with rebel armies fighting his 
government in the north and east western analysts told the 
associated press 
the internal affairs ministry said museveni had ordered that 
1671 prisoners of war be discharged from prisons 
most of the prisoners were fighting for the uganda peoples 
democratic movement a northernbased guerrilla force they were 
held without charge after being captured in clashes with government 
troops 
museveni evidently ordered their release as a concession to 
guerrilla leaders with whom government envoys have made contact in 
a bid for peace in uganda the country that has been convulsed by 
civil conflicts almost constantly since its independence from 
britain on oct 9 1962 
museveni seized power in january 1986 ending a fiveyear war 
against civilian president milton obote and the military junta that 
ousted obote in july 1985 museveni formed a government of national 
unity inviting four other rival parties to join his cabinet 
in september and october 1986 soldiers arrested several men on 
treason charges of plotting a coup courts have released most of 
the men for lack of evidence 
soldiers loyal to obote and other toppled ugandan leaders 
including former military dictator idi amin have mounted guerrilla 
operations against musevenis government since august 1986 
amin lives in exile in saudi arabia and obote in britain

congress tried to slow down the movement of 
defense department procurement officials to civilian defense 
contractors with a 1987 law 
but a growing investigation of possible pentagon and contractor 
bribery raises questions about how the revolving door law is 
working 
the law says pentagon procurement officials must wait two years 
after leaving the government before the may work for defense 
contractors with whom they had major contact in the last two years 
of federal service 
since the statute did not take effect until april 15 1987 it 
is not clear how many of those involved in the budding pentagon 
investigation were covered by the laws restrictions there were 
reports that some pentagon officials quit before the effective date 
to avoid its provisions 
rep barbara boxer dcalif a sponsor of the legislation has 
asked the pentagons deputy inspector general derek vander schaaf 
to determine whether there is cause to believe that anyone 
named by the fbi as under investigation in the case may have 
violated the revolving door law 
one provision of the law applies to midlevel civilian or 
military defense procurement officials they fall under the 
twoyear ban if they spent the majority of their work during their 
last two years at a defense contractors plant or working on a 
major weapons system the contractor was selling 
another section forces the twoyear waiting period on highlevel 
officials who acted as government representatives in the 
negotiation or settlement of a contract of more than 10 million 
this applies to anyone who was a decisionmaker even if he did 
not have official responsibility for the negotiations 
rep charles e bennett dfla a prime sponsor said this 
provision applied to cases such as the highranking navy department 
officials who negotiated multimilliondollar deals with general 
dynamics and then went to work for that corporation 
the law requires that companies submit to the secretary of 
defense the names of former pentagon officials now working for the 
defense contractors 
penalty provisions include a civil fine of up to 500000 for 
companies offering compensation to an official it knows is covered 
by the restrictions 
the official can receive a civil fine of up to 250000 
when the 1987 law was passed the strongest advocates of closing 
the revolving door blamed the procurement system for the 
problem not the integrity of individuals 
even that has changed now that a search warrant has revealed 
that the government is investigating the bribery of public 
officials as part of a scheme in which defense contractors got 
inside information from former government officials whom they had 
hired as consultants 
taking note of the change boxer said in a floor speech this 
week now it is bad enough that such a situation undermines 
public confidence in the procurement system 
it is far worse to learn that former and current public 
officials may have broken the law in a rush to cash in on the 
contracts that they gained at taxpayers expense nothing could be 
lower than that 
an illustration of the revolving door is the case of melvyn r 
paisley a major target in the current investigation 
he left his navy job in april 1987 to become a washington 
consultant and some of the largest defense contractors lined up to 
hire him 
paisley 63 had played a key role in president reagans naval 
buildup as a private executive he was selling information a 
commodity much in demand among the various companies seeking any 
edge they could get in the competition to sell weapons to the 
government 
a general accounting office study in 1986 said more than 20 
percent of the people who left jobs at the pentagon in 1983 and 
1984 to join defense contractors were spending at least some time 
working on the same projects they had overseen for the government 
the study said 45 percent of the former pentagon employees said 
their new jobs in industry required them to communicate with former 
colleagues at the pentagon and 26 percent acknowledged they were 
in positions to affect the work of their future employer during 
their last two years at the pentagon

the united states protested to senegal on 
friday for dropping charges against two libyans arrested for 
allegedly carrying explosives 
the government of senegal released without trial two known 
libyan terrorists caught redhanded in dakar airport last february 
attempting to smuggle arms and explosives into senegal state 
department spokesman charles e redman said 
the two men were sent back to libya on thursday according to 
official spokesmen in dakar 
were extremely disappointed by senegals action redman 
said it raises questions about that countrys commitment to the 
struggle against international terrorism 
he said us dissatisfaction was communicated through 
diplomatic channels 
the libyans mohamed abdou salam and mansour oumrane were 
arrested on arrival in the west african country on feb 19 after 
customs inspectors allegedly found the weapons in baggage 
in past years senegal has criticized libya for its involvement 
in fighting in chad but senegalese president abdou diouf elected 
to a second term recently has said relations between his country 
and libya have considerably improved 
state department officials have said the arrests in senegal were 
evidence of a possible renewal of terrorism sponsored by the libyan 
government of moammar gadhafi 
the officials said libyan involvement was suspected in attacks 
in europe and asia earlier this spring around the time of the 
anniversary of the april 1985 us bombing raid against gadhafi 
strongholds in tripoli and benghazi

us government agencies and private firms 
operating in panama will be allowed to pay social security payroll 
taxes to the panamanian government for their panamanian employees 
the state department said friday 
department spokesman charles e redman described the decision as 
an exemption to an april order by president reagan halting all 
payments to the panamanian government by american citizens 
another official who asked not to be identified said the 
exemption will provide about 3 million a month to the panamanian 
government 
but he said the exemption would not necessarily be a net gain 
for panama pointing out that the taxes are used to provide health 
care to panamanian workers and their families 
redman said the exemption was made for humanitarian purposes he 
said that ousted president eric arturo delvalle whom the united 
states continues to recognize as the legitimate authority in 
panama had expressed concern about the possibility of severe 
hardships for panamanians who might otherwise have been denied 
medical care at state facilities 
another official said some panamanians already had been turned 
away from these facilities because their us employers had not 
been contributing to the social security system 
redman said the exemption in no way reflects a softening of the 
us policy of bringing economic pressure to bear on the panamanian 
government the administrations objective is to force gen manuel 
antonio noriega commander of panamas defense forces to surrender 
power 
reagan had ordered a halt to all us private and official 
payments to the panamanian government on april 8 invoking his 
authority under the international emergency economic powers act 
in addition to the ban on payments to the panamanian government 
the administration also has effectively frozen all panamanian 
assets in the united states

the parliament of azerbaijan refused friday to 
give up a region of the southern republic that armenia has voted to 
annex a soviet official said the dispute was at a deadlock 
the decision by the supreme soviet of azerbaijan was expected 
because the republics presidium or executive committee already 
rejected armenias demand that nagornokarabakh be made part of 
armenia soviet parliaments rarely go against the wishes of their 
presidiums 
the tass news agency reported the decision and said the 
parliament session was broadcast live on the republics television 
and radio stations western reporters have been barred from armenia 
and azerbaijan since the dispute erupted earlier this year 
the ethnic unrest led to bloodshed in february when 32 people 
mostly armenians were killed in riots in the azerbaijani city of 
sumgait 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told 
reporters that the dispute has taken the form of a collision 
between two articles of the soviet constitution 
one article requires that any territorial changes be approved by 
the republics involved and be ratified by the supreme soviet in 
moscow because azerbaijan has refused to give its consent to the 
change it appears that under this article the central supreme 
soviet does not have to get involved 
but armenians cite another section of the constitution providing 
for the free selfdetermination of nations and the voluntary 
association of equal soviet socialist republics 
gerasimov acknowledged it is not clear how the constitutional 
question can be resolved 
there is a legal dispute going on about how these articles 
should be implemented so we have to wait and see how the 
events develop and a fuller answer therefore will be given 
later he told reporters 
the supreme soviet of neighboring armenia voted wednesday to 
call for annexation of nagornokarabakh siding with armenian 
demonstrators who since february have been holding sporadic street 
rallies marches and strikes 
armenians consider the region part of their ancestral homeland 
more than threequarters of its 160000 residents are armenians 
a journalist for the azerbaijan news agency azerbinform said the 
supreme soviet determined that giving up nagornokarabakh would be 
contrary to the interests of the people the journalist spoke 
on condition he not be identified 
the armenian supreme soviet in its resolution said a majority 
of residents of armenia and nagornokrabakh want the region taken 
out of azerbaijan the legislature asked its azerbaijani 
counterpart to approve the switch and the central supreme soviet in 
moscow to give its approval 
central communist party officials in moscow rejected the 
annexation demand in february but the central supreme soviet has 
not reviewed the issue 
gerasimov also said students had ended a sitin they had 
launched may 25 in armenias capital yerevan soviet newspapers 
however have reported this week that unrest continues in 
stepanakert the main city of nagornokarabakh armenians in the 
city have been marching and striking since may 23 
the soviet government made nagornokarabakh an autonomous region 
of azerbaijan in 1923 
armenians are predominantly christian most azerbaijanis are 
moslem

israeli soldiers fired on 
stonethrowing palestinians who tried to stop them from blowing up 
an arabs home friday killing one and wounding 18 hospital 
officials and witnesses said 
army officials confirmed the death but said only four arabs were 
wounded they said two soldiers were injured by stones in the 
confrontation before dawn at beit furik five miles southeast of 
nablus in the occupied west bank 
at least 209 palestinians have been killed in the rebellion that 
began dec 8 in the west bank and gaza strip which israel captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war an israeli soldier and a 
jewish settler also have been slain 
troops demolished seven other homes in the west bank and sealed 
10 during a 24hour period ending friday most belonged to 
palestinians suspected of throwing firebombs 
increased use of firebombs in recent weeks prompted army 
officials to order harsher punishments including house demolitions 
and sealings defense minister yitzhak rabin said this week the 
army considers firebombs lethal weapons to which soldiers and 
israeli civilians could respond with gunfire 
israeli soldiers entered beit furik at about 4 am to destroy 
the home of ahmed hanani an alleged member of a gang that 
assassinated nablus mayor zafer masri in march 1986 and carried out 
attacks on israelis the army said 
rafaq yusef masmoud a 25yearold villager said young men 
guarding the village alerted residents with portable loudspeakers 
and about 700 armed with rocks and bottles rushed into the streets 
to face about 100 soldiers 
he said the troopers opened fire and the ensuing street battle 
continued for about four hours masmoud who was shot in the right 
leg spoke to the associated press from his bed at al ittihad 
hospital in nablus 
the house was blown up about two hours after the israelis 
arrived and i saw a big cloud go up into the sky masmoud said 
after the house exploded the fighting really picked up 
bahar khareb 15 said he and four friends rushed outside when 
the soldiers came 
we threw stones at a passing jeep said khareb a slight 
youngster who was wounded in the right shoulder and spoke 
haltingly the jeep stopped an officer stood up and fired 
directly at us from about 15 meters he hit all five of us 
an army official said soldiers entering beit furik encountered 
roadblocks and masses of villagers who attacked the force with 
bottles cement blocks and stones 
five arabs were detained the army reported masmoud said he saw 
soldiers taking 20 villagers away 
two army jeeps were parked at a roadblock outside beit furik 
later friday and soldiers barred reporters from the village 
a doctor at al ittihad said five of the 18 people wounded by 
gunfire were in serious condition they said the victims a 
22yearold woman who was shot in the throat and paralyzed from the 
chest down 
casualties were brought to the hospital throughout the morning 
about five hours after the battle an 18yearold arrived in the 
emergency room with a bullet wound in the right leg 
the young man his face contorted with pain said he walked 
miles on back roads to avoid soldiers 
rabin said thursday that the emphasis in the rebellion has 
shifted from mass demonstrations to commercial strikes civil 
disobedience and individual acts of firebombing and stoning 
the firebombs are the most disturbing problem maj gen 
amram mitzna army commander in the west bank told israel radio 
we shall do everything possible to stop this phenomenon 
mahmoud shalabiye of jericho in the west bank said soldiers 
knocked on his door at midnight thursday and told him to remove his 
belongings so they could seal the house 
i have eight children at home and now they want to throw me to 
the street because my son made a firebomb he said on the 
radio i dont know what he does he is 18 years old 
jewish settlers said the army should be tougher we are asking 
to deport people who throw firebombs uri ariel head of the west 
bank settlement council told the radio 
israel has deported 21 arabs during the rebellion most on 
charges of inciting antiisraeli violence

a woman convicted in the nations first 
deathbyproduct tampering trial was sentenced to 90 years in 
prison today for killing her husband and a stranger with excedrin 
capsules laced with cyanide 
us district judge william dwyer recommended that stella 
nickell not be eligible for parole for a minimum of 30 years 
saying the jury has found the defendant guilty of appalling 
crimes 
mrs nickell 44 of suburban auburn sat at the defense table 
with her hands tightly clasped in her lap her fingers intertwined 
and her thumbs fidgeting she appeared to pale when the sentence 
was read 
it must be said that these are crimes of exceptional 
callousness and cruelty dwyer said taking note of the fact that 
the poisoned capsules had been left on store shelves and could have 
easily fallen into the hands of innocent victims 
mrs nickell received 90year terms each for two counts of 
producting tampering that resulted in the deaths of her husband 
bruce nickell and susan katherine snow of auburn she faced 
possible life terms on those two counts 
additionally she was sentenced to three 10year terms for lacing 
with cyanide extrastrength excedrin capsules found in the nickell 
home and on the shelves of area stores 
all terms were to run concurrently 
prosecutors had requested a sentence of 230 years with a 
minimum of 67 years served before she would be eligible for parole 
saying entire families could have died because of the tampering 
it is unnerving to think just how many people stood to die 
because of this womans greed said us attorney joanne maida 
who prosecuted the case 
it was a tough case said mrs nickells attorney thomas 
hillier who told dwyer during the hearing that he was working on 
an appeal of her conviction we expected a tough sentence we 
were prepared for it we were prepared for worse 
on thursday dwyer rejected mrs nickells try to win a new 
trial saying she her guilt was determined by an attentive 
thorough and impartial jury 
hillier had sought a new trial on grounds that juror laurel 
holliday didnt mention during jury selection that three months 
before the trial she had accepted 500 in an outofcourt 
settlement of her own productcontamination lawsuit against a 
cracker manufacturer 
prosecutors argued there was no evidence ms holliday was 
biased and in fact she was the only juror arguing for acquittal 
during deliberations she later changed her vote to guilty 
in a 28page ruling dwyer said there was no evidence ms 
holliday answered jury selection questions dishonestly 
even if all the facts known after the trial had been brought out 
during jury selection dwyer said there would not have been 
grounds to excuse ms holliday for cause 
mrs nickell was convicted may 9 of five counts of product 
tampering including two that resulted in the june 1986 deaths of 
her husband and ms snow 
she was the first person in the united states brought to trial 
under a federal law concerning death by product tampering 
king county prosecutor norm maleng has said he would wait until 
after sentencing to decide whether to file state murder charges 
prosecutors alleged mrs nickell killed her husband because she 
was tired of him and wanted to collect 176000 in life insurance 
they said mrs snow who had no connection with the couple was an 
innocent victim of a plot to make nickells death appear to be the 
work of a random killer 
in addition to the tamperings that caused the deaths mrs 
nickell was convicted of one count of putting cyanide in a second 
bottle of extrastrength excedrin found in her home and two counts 
of putting the poison in two other bottles found on store shelves 
in auburn and kent 
federal prosecutors had asked dwyer in their sentencing 
memorandum to give mrs nickell 100 years on each of the death 
counts and the maximum 10 years on the three other counts with the 
terms to run consecutively 
mrs nickell they wrote willingly risked the lives of 
countless other human beings to conceal her identity as her 
husbands killer an unconscionable unforgiveable act against 
humanity which not only justifies but compels the most serious 
punishment available to this court 
the deaths set off a nationwide tampering scare and caused 
excedrin manufacturer bristolmyers to recall its nonprescription 
capsule medicines 
seven people died in chicago in 1982 from cyanidelaced 
extrastrength tylenol but those deaths remain unsolved

cher the actress and entertainer once 
performed in south africa but has been taken off a list kept by the 
un antiapartheid agency because she promised not to do so again 
the list contains the names of more than 200 performers and 
members of related professions who have worked in south africa 
since 1981 a person can be taken off by promising in writing not 
to perform there while the government practices the apartheid 
policy of race segregation 
the sixth annual list will be published next month frank 
sinatra tina turner eartha kitt and others were removed earlier 
this year 
sotirios g mousouris assistant secretarygeneral of the un 
center against apartheid said friday the letter from cher 
responded to one he wrote to the actress 
in an interview he said he congratulated her on the academy 
award she won for her performance in moonstruck 
after telling cher her career had been marked by sensitivity 
and talent and her roles in silkwood mask and suspect show 
her concern about injustice and oppression he expressed surprise 
that her name was on the list 
mousouris said he suggested that she might be unaware of it 
since the listing dated from a performance in august 1981 
in a letter dated may 25 cher wrote this is to state that i 
shall not be performing in south africa as long as apartheid lasts 
in that country 
the lists purpose is to persuade performers to join the boycott 
and inform countries groups and individuals about those who work 
in south africa 
most artists are sensitive to the issue of racial justice and 
would want to be removed mousouris said adding that linda 
ronstadt goldie hawn and telly savalas were among those to whom he 
would write letters similar to the one he sent cher 
fighting apartheid has been a major cause in the un general 
assembly and security council which have condemned the race laws 
that preserve power for south africas 5 million whites and deny a 
voice in national affairs to the 26 million blacks 
on sept 24 the un special committee against apartheid will 
sponsor a meeting in athens at which prominent artists performers 
theater and movie directors and writers will discuss the cultural 
boycott 
among about 30 people expected to attend are harry belafonte 
jules dassin yves montand and joseph papp

minnesota may be known as the gopher state 
but this small township celebrates a bounty hunt to get rid of the 
pesky rodents 
township officials collected more than 1300 pairs of gopher 
feet thursday and doled out 1377 to kick off the 114th annual 
viola gopher count 
the township pays 1 each for a pair of feet from a pocket 
gopher and 25 cents for two pairs from striped gophers 
townspeople say its worth it 
pockets are a problem in a hayfield said township board 
member richard brennan they build mounds that high he said 
raising his hands 8 inches off the table and its rough you 
cant mow it and its tough on the machines 
hunters of all ages carried their bounty to the township 
thursday in freezer bags socks cigar boxes and buckets one had 
his nailed to a board in pairs for easy counting 
this years champion bounty hunter was lyle splittstoesser 71 
he turned in 374 sets of feet worth 33575 but because 
splittstoesser always turns in several hundred sets he is 
considered a professional and doesnt qualify for the 
championship prize of 10 
the township near rochester in the southeastern corner of the 
state has celebrated the hunt ever since a group of residents 
gathered for a lemonade picnic in a pasture in 1874 and agreed to a 
competition to see who could collect the most gopher tails by the 
next year

former gov evan mecham says his acquittal 
on charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan shows justice 
can occur in arizona when the politicians who removed him from 
office are not involved 
a state jury on thursday cleared mecham and his brother 
willard on all counts 
justice in the political arena will take a little longer 
mecham said today he pledged to push for a measurable effect 
in elections for the state legislature this fall and also to press 
for a new state attorney general 
we dont have any vindictive feelings mecham said at the 
outset of a news conference adding that i see much need for true 
reforms in the judiciary in arizona including barring selective 
prosecution so justice is evenhanded 
as for himself he said today is not the day to discuss my 
political future he said his legal bills so far total about 
500000 that donations total about half of that amount and that 
he was reactivating the mecham legal defense fund 
the firstterm republican became the first us governor to be 
impeached and removed from office in 59 years on april 4 when the 
arizona senate convicted him on two unrelated impeachment counts 
the house impeached him in connection with the 350000 loan to 
his 1986 campaign but the senate decided not to hear that charge 
for fear of prejudicing his criminal trial 
willard mecham also at the news conference today said there 
were two dark days in the history of arizona in 1988 the first was 
the day we were indicted and the second was the day evan was 
impeached 
being indicted unjustly was the most evil experience i have 
ever had in my life he added 
justice can occur in arizona when you get to the people and 
outside the politicians mecham 64 told reporters outside the 
maricopa county courthouse thursday were happy were happy 
youre always apprehensive but not really surprised 
assistant attorney general barnett lotstein one of two 
prosecutors in the case said he had no quarrel with the 
decision 
we believe we presented a responsible case that had to be 
presented we obviously felt we had a good case a lot of the 
people in this community feel that he has suffered enough and 
perhaps that was a factor lotstein said outside the courtroom 
as the verdict was read mecham smiled broadly and embraced his 
attorney michael scott hugged his wife florence then walked 
over to the jurors and shook their hands 
winning this is better news than winning the election because 
if he lost the election he wouldnt have gone to jail mrs 
mecham said later thursday 
its been terrible listening to people call your husband a 
liar she said he has never told a lie a day in his life but 
sometimes it seems you cant convince some people of that 
as superior court judge michael ryan declared the trial over 
mechams supporters cheered scott asked ryan whether mecham could 
make a statement but the judge refused saying this is a court 
of law mr scott 
mecham acknowledged he did not itemize the loan from developer 
and lawyer barry wolfson on personal or campaign financial 
statements required by the state the defense called the failure an 
innocent mistake partly due to willard mechams inexperience as a 
bookkeeper 
however the prosecution insisted that mecham badly needed the 
loan to keep his campaign afloat then hid it to avoid spoiling his 
theme of being beholden to no one 
the jury deliberated 6 hours wednesday and thursday after 
hearing seven days of testimony and two days of closing arguments 
mecham could have been sentenced to 22 years in prison if 
convicted on all six felony counts of perjury willful concealment 
and filing false documents his 67yearold brother who was his 
1986 campaign treasurer faced a maximum 9 years on three similar 
counts 
gov rose mofford the democratic secretary of state who took 
over after mechams removal said in a statement that she hoped her 
predecessor and his entire family can resume their lives as 
private citizens 
the end of this trial signals a hastening of a healing process 
which has begun and that the citizens of this great state so richly 
deserve she said 
state attorney general bob corbin whose office prosecuted the 
case said he had offered to let mecham plead guilty to a 
misdemeanor before the trial began but mecham rejected the offer 
corbin said he felt the case had been proven well beyond a 
reasonable doubt 
lotstein said the main issue was whether the mechams intended to 
break the law when they filed the disclosure forms 
the word knowingly is what swayed most of us said juror 
anthony christie of phoenix we did not think he knew he was 
doing anything wrong those were innocent mistakes 
mecham a former auto dealer ran for governor four times 
unsuccessfully before winning a threeway race in november 1986 
he sparked controversy just one week after taking office in 
january 1987 when he canceled a martin luther king holiday for 
state workers saying it was created illegally 
mecham later made remarks that angered blacks women jews 
homosexuals and japaneseamericans he was also accused of making a 
series of substandard appointments to top state positions

pope john paul ii said friday he will soon 
publish a major document on the role of women in the roman catholic 
church and in society 
the vatican said the document will be published before the aug 
15 conclusion of the churchs marian year which the pontiff 
proclaimed to honor mary the mother of jesus 
i intend to soon publish a document on the dignity and the 
vocation of the woman as it already was announced in the papal 
encyclical redemptoris mater the pope told the council of the 
secretary general of the synod of bishops 
in such a way i intend to respond to the desire that the 
synod fathers have expressed in this regard and at the same time 
insert reflections on the role of the woman in the context of the 
marian year he added 
redemptoris mater which in latin means mother of the 
redeemer was john pauls sixth encyclical the most authoritative 
form of a papal letter at the time vatican circles interpreted 
remarks in the document to be a restatement of the churchs 
opposition to women in the priesthood 
in the march 1987 encyclical john paul wrote that the figure of 
mary sheds light on womanhood as such by the very fact that god 
in the sublime event of the incarnation of his son entrusted 
himself to the ministry the free and active ministry of a woman 
it can thus be said that women by looking to mary find in 
her the secret of living their femininity with dignity and of 
achieving their own true advancement he said 
women are not allowed to serve as priests or deacons and the 
church opposes artificial birth control abortion and sex outside 
of marriage

a parachuting instructor and aerial 
acrobat who died while saving a student making her first jump was 
honored friday at the airport where he was killed 
walter hawk leno 45 of bolton was an ultralight 
enthusiast stuntman and instructor who held records for his 
airborne acrobatics his dramatic rescue and death saturday was 
captured on videotape by the students husband 
hawk did a lot for the sport parachuting in vermont said 
ray beresford lenos jumping partner for the past five years 
he exposed a lot of people to it who wouldnt have learned 
about it otherwise its unfortunate he had to die this way its 
just what he didnt want beresford told the friends and admirers 
at shelburne airport the base for most of lenos flying and 
jumping 
authorities have refused to release the name of the student 
whose parachute jump was a gift from her husband 
the footage taken by the husband shows leno and the woman 
falling end over end as they left the plane at 4000 feet said 
state police investigator leo blais 
blais who reviewed the videotape with a us parachutists 
association official said the students primary chute became 
caught between her legs she and leno tried to loosen it and leno 
finally pulled her emergency chute at about 600 feet he said 
leno however could not pull his chute at the same time because 
the two might have become entangled and neither would have worked 
blais said 
but by the time he cleared her he was at just 200 feet and by 
the time he pulled his chute open he had hit he said 
it was just 23 seconds from the time leno and his student jumped 
until he hit the ground he was traveling 130 mph at impact blais 
said 
he said the student suffered injury to her tailbone 
its very clear from the video that he gave up his life to 
save hers said blais 
leno launched his own business barnstormers aviation last 
year he assembled and sold ultralight planes and did jumps for 
parties county fairs and weddings

during his tenure as us attorney leon kellner 
saw an indictment against panamas gen manuel antonio noriega and 
drug charges against officials in haiti nicaragua bolivia the 
bahamas turks and caicos suriname and cuba 
i had no inkling i would be at the eye of the hurricane and i 
still have trouble understanding it kellner said before his last 
day in office friday im not doing anything profound i just 
take a case where the evidence leads 
kellner spent three years as an assistant and three years as 
chief prosecutor in the southern district of florida among the 
busiest federal districts in the nation 
kellners office indicted leaders of the colombiabased medellin 
cartel responsible for up to 80 percent of us cocaine imports 
and he successfully prosecuted scores of miami police who ran a 
drugripoff ring 
kellner 42 who usually is very serious and lowkey but flashes 
an occasional ironic smile is proud he aimed for the leaders of 
drug rings but says only drying up the demand can really stem 
trafficking 
when i became us attorney one of the things i wanted do was 
go as high up in the narcotics trafficking business as i could 
said kellner and i think thats what i did 
but not without personal danger 
his most chilling moments came after the extradition of medellin 
cartel leader carlos lehder rivas when swat teams and federal 
agents responding to death threats were sent to guard him and his 
family against possible reprisals from the violent drug ring his 
family fled their coral gables home and for a time had to be 
escorted on routine errands 
what is interesting about that episode is that the 
government was prepared to do anything no matter what the cost to 
ensure the safety of people working on the case says kellner 
whose jewish parents fled nazi germany before world war ii 
he contrasts that with the violence the cartel has wreaked on 
colombia where a justice minister an attorney general and 
hundreds of other law enforcement officials have been gunned down 
that experience made him even more militant on winning 
extradition rights from countries which have been traditional 
havens for traffickers 
the reason extradition is so important in my mind is that 
there is a recognition that foreign countries do not enforce 
their own laws because of the power of the cartel the threats of 
the cartel he says 
the noriega indictment and the subequent political firestorm 
over negotations to drop the charges forced kellner to take a 
strong public stand against politicizing law enforcement but he is 
understanding of the administrations problems 
what that flap indicates is the extraordinary problems that we 
have in dealing with narcotics in the international sphere he 
says this is the most unique problem that law enforcement has 
ever dealt with 
kellner differs strongly with those who say legalization of 
drugs could solve problems stemming from the drug trade 
while drugs have been the focus of most of his attention one of 
the most professionally painful moments of his tenure came over 
another highprofile investigation into arms smuggling to the 
contra rebels in nicaragua 
critics accused him of buckling under to the reagan 
administration and stalling an investigation of a 1985 weapons 
shipment to the contras out of fort lauderdale but kellner notes 
he has been cleared by every investigation into that case and an 
indictment in the case is expected later this month 
those criticisms his wifes bout with thyroid cancer from which 
she is recovering the noriega drama and his inability to stem drug 
trafficking eventually took their toll on kellner however 
after taking the summer off with his family kellner will return 
to washington to rejoin the firm he helped found anderson baker 
kill amp olick there comes a point when i get frustrated says 
kellner i did the job for six years sometimes you just have 
to recharge your batteries

the daughter and two sons of a wealthy 
lebanese jeweler who were kidnapped three days ago by gunmen 
demanding 3 million in ransom were freed friday and returned home 
safely 
it was not known whether their father zuheir ariss paid the 
ransom the kidnappers demanded in a telephone call 
interior minister abdullah rassi said the kidnappers had not 
been arrested but that the investigation was continuing 
the children who were snatched tuesday from their 
chauffeurdriven mercedes in west beirut said they were not hurt 
during their captivity 
we had chicken for breakfast lunch and dinner for the past 
three days i dont want to see chicken for the rest of my life 
9yearold samer ariss said at his home on west beiruts hamra 
street 
ramzi 5 said he missed his parents and was very frightened 
because we were locked in a room filled with cockroaches and 
ants 
they the kidnappers did not hurt us said his sister 
dana 14 
a police spokesman said mediators from the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god handed the children to brig gen ali 
hammoud the syrian armys intelligence chief in beirut and 
lebanese police chief col issam abu ziki at the syrian army 
command in beirut on friday morning 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
regulations said hammoud and ziki delivered the children to their 
home about 40 minutes later 
ariss owns a plush jewelry shop and a money exchange company 
in a statement broadcast by the moslem voice of the nation 
radio ariss expressed gratitude to all those who helped achieve 
the release of my children 
we thank god because this ordeal was brought to an end we 
thank god for the safe return of our three children he said 
ziki refused to say if the ransom demand was met or to elaborate 
on how the children were freed from the kidnappers 
in a separate development friday police said seven people were 
wounded overnight in sporadic machine gun fire between followers of 
yasser arafats palestine liberation organization and members of 
the syrianbacked antiarafat faction called fatahuprising 
the new casualties brought the overall toll to 31 killed and 137 
wounded in the latest round of fighting for control of chatilla and 
bourj elbarajneh camps 
a police spokesman said two libyan military observers entered 
chatilla on friday to try to enforce a ceasefire and disengage the 
combatants two other libyans were to enter bourj elbarajneh later 
libya is an ally of both arafat and syrian president hafez 
assad its leader col moammar gadhafi played a key role in 
bringing assad and arafat to meet in a reconciliation effort in 
april 
palestinian sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
arafat had sent a letter to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
discussing ways of ending fighting in the camps between his 
fighters and those of the syrianbacked breakaway faction led by 
col saeed moussa 
assad a soviet friend and arafat have been bitter enemies 
since syria backed the may 1983 uprising against arafat

a bill that some believe is the first step of 
a 3 billion project to map the human genetic pattern passed the 
senate friday by a vote of 88 to 1 
the legislation called the biotechnology competitiveness act 
does not authorize the start of any laboratory research but 
experts in the biotechnology field said the bill creates a 
framework that would enable the start of a major genetic project in 
about two years 
sen william proxmire dwis cast the single dissenting vote 
the bill has four major provisions these are 
establish a 20member national biotechnology policy board to 
review federal research support efforts and to make recommendations 
on biotechnology issues the first report to the president and to 
congress is due by jan 31 1990 
establish an advisory panel on the human genome that will 
develop a strategy needed for a project to map and sequence the 
human genome or genetic pattern experts say that a crash program 
of research on the genome would take seven to 10 years and cost 
about 3 billion 
establish a 10 million biotechnology information center at the 
national library of medicine 
and finally the bill would reauthorize a biomedical ethics 
board that would analyze the reports of the biotechnology policy 
board and the human genome advisory panel 
provisions in the bill are estimated to cost 104 million in 
fiscal year 1989 which begins in october the cost would rise to 
142 million in 1990 154 million in 1991 and 13 million 
annually for the following two yeasrs 
richard d godown president of the industrial biotechnology 
association said the 88 to 1 vote shows the overwhelming support 
of the united states for the biotechnology industry 
godown said that establishing the boards and panels described in 
the bill are essential for organizing the genome research a 
project that may involve hundreds of laboratories and thousands of 
scientists 
this clears the way for the money to be appropriated later 
he said godown said it may be two years before the project is 
organized but that the organizational structure established by the 
bill is the first step 
godown said that private industry and some federal laboratories 
already are studying the human genome and this work will continue 
while the committees conduct their studies 
the human genome is the genetic pattern contained in the human 
chromosones the pattern which is unique to each individual 
determines fundamental physical characteristics many diseases are 
related to genetic patterns and scientists hope that by 
understanding the genome that these diseases can be treated or 
prevented 
godown said understanding the genome is fundamental to the 
revolution occurring in biotechnology 
mapping the sequence of the human genome will determine the 
degree of success we realize from the biotechnology revolution 
he said by understanding the genetic pattern godown said 
scientists will significantly advance an understanding of how the 
human body works 
the bill was drawn up after studies by scientists at the 
national research council strongly supported a federally funded 
effort to map and sequence the human genome 
one major consideration supporting the genome research is 
international competition 
the department of commerce has estimated that the market for 
biotechnology products which would include pharmaceuticals and 
agricultural products will exceed 40 billion a year by 2000 
france germany and japan already have national biotechnology 
programs which includes human genome research

more than 1600 rebels were freed from 
ugandan prisons on friday on the orders of president yoweri 
museveni the government said 
the release is expected to improve musevenis efforts to 
organize peace talks with several rebel armies fighting his 
government in the north and east of uganda western analysts told 
the associated press 
the internal affairs ministry said the guerrillas were freed 
following a directive by museveni earlier this week that 1671 
prisoners of war be freed 
most of the prisoners were fighting for the uganda peoples 
democratic movement a northernbased guerrilla force they were 
held without charge after being captured in clashes with government 
troops 
museveni evidently ordered their release as a concession to 
guerrilla leaders with whom government envoys have made contact in 
a bid for peace in uganda the country has been convulsed by civil 
conflicts almost constantly since its independence from britain on 
oct 9 1962 
museveni seized power in january 1986 ending a fiveyear war 
against civilian president milton obote and the military junta that 
ousted obote in july 1985 museveni formed a government of national 
unity inviting four other rival parties to join his cabinet 
in september and october 1986 soldiers arrested several men on 
treason charges of plotting a coup courts have released most of 
the men for lack of evidence 
soldiers loyal to obote and other toppled ugandan leaders 
including former military dictator idi amin have mounted guerrilla 
operations against musevenis government since august 1986 
amin lives in exile in saudi arabia and obote in britain

drought that is curling corn leaves and 
darkening wheat fields across the nations heartland calls for a 
blueprint for aiding farmers and guarding against stepped up food 
prices lawmakers said friday 
we have to have a battle plan before too long sen david 
pryor dark said as a congressional task force met with 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng to discuss possible means of 
responding to the drought 
the bipartisan housesenate task force was formed this week to 
monitor the drought and its effect on crops and to prepare 
recommendations for congressional action if that should prove 
necessary 
lyng has been saying lawmakers should wait to learn more about 
the full extent of the damage before they begin to formulate aid 
legislation 
usda officials reiterated that much of the wheat crop in montana 
and the dakotas already is severely damaged but an inch or so of 
rain once a week for the rest of the growing season could save the 
midwests corn and soybean crops 
we need teamwork repoublican and democrat house and senate 
and the administration to make sure that the federal government 
responds to the catastrophe that many american farmers today 
face house agriculture committee chairman e kika de la 
garza dtexas said 
he said the goals of the task force should be to assess the 
impact on trade and food prices and to formulate recommendations 
for farm aid 
de la garza applauded lyng for a decision thursday to loosen 
usda rules to allow farmers to cut hay on conservation reserve 
program acreage he had earlier resisted such a step saying 
growers already had been paid by the government to keep the highly 
erodible lands out of production for a decade 
de la garza called lyngs decision a first step a number of 
lawmakers have been calling for livestock grazing on the acreage 
a senate agriculture committee contingent planned to visit wheat 
country over the weekend for firsthand inspections of drought 
damage 
pryor said the task force should not overlook the health effect 
that the longprotracted heat wave has on the rural elderly 
sen howell heflin dala said the task force should look into 
the possibility of cooperation between federal and local 
governments as well as the private sector on providing irrigation 
to farmers who are without it 
sens tom harkin diowa and thad cochran rmiss called on 
lyng to look into some way of utilizing the federal crop insurance 
program to aid farmers caught in a complex financial bind by the 
drought 
because the drought threatens to make agricultural commodities 
scarce it already is driving up their prices but higher prices 
in turn are likely to shrink federal incomesupport payments that 
growers receive 
the payments are the difference between market prices and 
higher target prices set by congress and adjusted by the secretary 
of agriculture as the difference narrows the farmers payment 
shrinks meanwhile the drought may leave the grower without a crop 
to sell at the higher market levels 
the problem is even worse for many farmers who have received 
part of their incomesupport payments in advance and now are faced 
with the prospect of having to repay part of them 
harkin said it might be possible to reopen the signup period 
for obtaining federal crop insurance 
officials said it would be worthwhile to explore ways that the 
crop insurance system might be useful but they added that there 
could be problems 
if we move into some kind of a relief package we need to 
recognize those who did have the willingness to buy crop 
insurance lyng said but at the same time we cannot ignore 
those who did not

fourthgeneration farmer robert 
seidenstricker spent the spring pouring millions of gallons of well 
water over his parched fields and praying for rain 
but he doesnt stop at prayers 
seidenstricker is one of new breed of farmer who armed with an 
agribusiness degree uses a computer to deal with the drought 
plaguing the nations farmlands 
how will he know when or whether to plant his soybeans 
weve got the numbers on lotus 123 seidenstricker said 
friday referring to the popular ibm personal computer software 
you dont wake up some day and say hell its too late no 
no no i update the figures daily 
i can figure the amount of bushels well yield on each acre of 
beans planted and put those numbers against the presold contracts 
liquidated damages and determine whether it will be profitable to 
plant he said we are not flying by the seat of our pants 
this is a business this is a science we have an accountant 
and we have our lawyer were on our second computer system and 
were not a large farmer by any means we dont stand out in any 
shape form or fashion a lot of farms are very intensely managed 
its not just the production end of it any more 
seidenstricker 30 a graduate of arkansas state university 
runs a 1300acre farm with his parents in tollville about 45 
miles east of little rock planted mostly in rice sorghum and 
usually soybeans 
but the ground hasnt been moist enough to get the beans planted 
this year prompting the unprecedented preplanting irrigation 
last month was the states driest since 1970 and the 
fifthdriest ever recorded according to the national weather 
service aggravating what were already drought conditions 
seidenstricker estimates rainfall is a foot below normal in 
prairie county so even irrigation may not be enough he said he 
needs a steady 2inch rain to get his 400 acres of soybeans 
planted if the family cannot plant before the fourth of july the 
season may be lost 
with a usual yield of 40 bushels of soybeans per acre 
seidenstricker estimated that hell lose two bushels an acre for 
each day the beans dont get planted starting from thursday 
and because he and other farmers have presold some of their 
soybeans hell have to pay the contract price in damages to the 
buyers if he cant provide the beans 
were trying things that have never been tried before to 
cope with the drought seidenstricker said everyone is 
a farm outbuilding houses seidenstrickers office his desk 
piled high with crop reports market forecasts and computer 
printouts he sat in the office in jeans a golf shirt and boots 
before taking a reporter on a tour of his arid fields 
seidenstricker said the drought is the worst since he began 
farming in 1979 
said his father fred seidenstricker a more traditional farmer 
who leaves the computer work to his son i have been through the 
30s and i have been through 1980 and this is the worst that i 
have seen 
the younger seidenstricker serves on a local bank board but he 
declined to say whether he thought the drought would put some 
farmers out of business 
hes worried about the potential longterm effect of the dry 
season noting that soybean prices have soared to 930 a bushel 
for november delivery 
thats the highest since i can remember seidenstricker 
said youd like to have some to sell at this price but looking 
at the longer term consider that brazil and argentina our major 
competitors in soybeans will look at that price and theyll expand 
their acreage they have large land mass good soil cheap labor 
they can grow cheaper than we can he said a high price 
will encourage them

the senate on friday approved a bill 
authorizing 2 billion for the national science foundation in the 
1989 fiscal year 
the bill passed 881 would direct the foundation to establish 
programs to stimulate research at colleges and universities and in 
states that historically receive little federal research funding 
sen william proxmire dwis cast the only dissenting vote 
the bill increases the federally funded research into 
superconductivity by 30 percent adding 5 million to the 165 
million already planned by the reagan administration 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said the commercial opportunities 
in superconductivity the study of chemistry that allows 
electricity to flow without resistence are mindboggling for 
transportation computers medicine and energy 
i want us to lead in this field to gain a competitive 
advantage over other nations and i believe we can if we provide 
the resources to our best scientists so that they cand do the 
research they are eager and able to do bentsen said 
the bill authorizes 205 billion for the nsf in fiscal 1989 
which begins oct 1 it boosts the authorization to 215 in 1990 
247 billion in 1991 283 billion in 1992 and 324 billion in 
1993 
several new programs benefiting universities and certain states 
were established in the bill 
the provisions call for the nsf to help colleges renovate 
obsolete laboratories start a program to encourage undergraduate 
research and to assist both colleges and states that have received 
relatively few of the federal research dollars in the past 
also included in the bill is a provision directing the national 
academy of sciences for earthquake engineering research efforts

the cuban government is broadcasting at night 
on two am radio frequencies used by us stations but the federal 
communications commission said friday it has received no complaints 
about interference 
in the broadcasts which began thursday night and were monitored 
by the fcc the cubans said they would continue broadcasting 
through sunday night on the frequencies as part of a music festival 
on the caribbean island 
the fcc said the cubans did the same thing a year ago as part of 
the same music festival but the national association of 
broadcasters said the transmissions were clearly a show of 
force in response to a senate proposal to beam american 
television programs to cuba 
the senate appropriations committee on thursday approved 
spending 75 million to start a us government tv service to cuba 
to supplement radio marti which has been broadcasting to the 
communistrun nation for three years 
when radio marti was being debated on capitol hill in 1983 
cuban leader fidel castro fired up powerful transmitters and beamed 
music and political programs to the united states interfering with 
broadcasts by us radio stations as far away as salt lake city 
utah 
the nab has raised concerns about tv marti citing the 
possibility of retaliatory jamming by cuba of american am stations 
and interference to southern florida tv stations from the tv marti 
signal itself 
the fcc said the cubans broadcast thursday from about 7 pm or 
8 pm to 1216 am at 150 kilowatts of power on the 1040 and 1160 
kilohertz frequencies the cubans broadcast at that power during 
the day but ordinarily they lower their power at night so as not 
to interfere with two us stations that use those frequencies 
said fcc spokeswoman rosemary kimball 
she said the two stations whose signals might have been affected 
by the broadcasts were who in des moines iowa which uses the 1040 
frequency and ksl in salt lake city which broadcasts on 1160 
john dehnel chief engineer at ksl said the station received no 
complaints of interference from listeners thursday night but it 
usually takes two or three nights for people to realize its not 
something wrong with their radio that its interference 
kimball said the cuban broadcasts thursday night were aimed at 
tourists at the cuban beaches and that no political programming was 
heard

the allmale cosmos club whose members once 
included supreme court justices oliver wendell holmes and louis d 
brandeis is about to vote for the third time in its 110year 
history on admitting women but for the first time the leadership 
of the club has unanimously endorsed the idea 
members of the club are scheduled to vote saturday afternoon 
and although no one will say for certain how the vote will come 
out club president tedson j meyers said the question of whether 
to admit women has become the main topic of conversation among 
members 
meyers a lawyer and former member of the city council in 
washington said that the club currently has about 3000 to 3100 
members down several hundred in the past few years but meyers 
denied that the vote on admitting women has anything to do with the 
decline in membership membership seems to go up and down he 
said 
meyers also denied that the vote saturday is a direct result of 
a ruling last fall by the washington human rights office that 
there is probable cause to believe that the clubs menonly 
policy violates the citys antidiscrimination law the office is 
ready to order public hearings on the case which could result in 
the loss of all city licenses and permits if the allmale policy 
stays in place 
its a matter the club would have taken up in any event 
meyers said although he acknowledged that the human rights 
offices action did act as a catalyst 
and while meyers confirmed that a committee of concerned 
members formed in 1980 to advocate the admission of 
distinguished women still exists he said that it was not the 
committee that had put forth the latest proposal to admit women 
this is the first time the officers and the board of directors 
brought the proposal forward meyers said they unanimously 
endorsed it they always opposed the idea before 
the club located in a mansion on the citys socalled embassy 
row first voted on whether to admit women in 1973 after 61 
members signed a petition proposing that women be allowed to join 
the proposal was killed by a 274203 vote 
again in 1974 50 members called for a vote on admitting women 
the vote in this round was 407204 against the proposal 
a twothirds majority is needed to change the clubs bylaws 
meyers said 
he pointed out that women can and do use the club female 
guests of members as well as wives and widows of members and 
former members are allowed to dine in the downstairs dining rooms 
but women are not allowed in the secondfloor members dining room 
except on thursday and friday evenings and weekends 
members of the club have included cabinet members pulitzer 
prize and nobel peace prize winners supreme court justice harry a 
blackmun was a member for 18 years but resigned last winter 
the club was founded by geologist john wesley powell in 1878 and 
originally met in powells living room it now charges a 900 
initiation fee and 900 in annual dues

the senate began considering legislation 
friday that would make it tougher for corporate raiders to succeed 
in hostile takeovers and increase criminal penalties for people 
convicted of insider trading 
several days of debate loom over the bill pitting lawmakers who 
argue that takeovers cost jobs and cut productivity against others 
who insist that shareholders need the power to readily remove 
inefficient managers 
sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the senate banking 
committee and sponsor of the bill described corporate raiders as 
agents of greed and said americans are rightly fed up with 
this takeover game 
proxmire and his supporters argue that corporate takeovers have 
become a primary goal of american business activity causing 
executives to spend much of their time on mergers and acquisitions 
instead of enhancing their companies competitiveness 
in addition they say successful bidders often sink so deeply 
into debt that to repay their lenders they must sell productive 
parts of the companies they have acquired often costing jobs 
but opponents say cocalled hostile takeovers actually consist 
of willing sellers surrendering their stock to willing buyers 
instead they say it is abuses by managers who fear being fired by 
new owners that must be controlled 
hostile acquisition of companies is a traditional technique 
used to change corporate policy or displace incompetent 
management said sen jake garn of utah ranking republican on 
the banking panel 
the legislation would give investors buying 5 percent of a 
companys stock five days to report the transaction to the 
securities and exchange commission and bar them from acquiring 
more shares until the report is filed 
currently there is a 10day reporting deadline and purchases 
can continue before the report is filed permitting takeovers to 
proceed before the activity is publicly known 
share buyers would be required to report whether their goal is 
to make an investment or acquire the entire company 
share holders would be given 35 business days nearly doubling 
the current 20 days to consider public tender offers in which a 
buyer offers to buy stock at a specified price buyers who acquire 
25 percent of a company would be required to make future purchases 
through tender offers 
in addition the sec would be given the power to sue investors 
who disobey disclosure requirements for up to 50 percent of the 
value of the stocks they acquired currently violators are often 
ordered simply to stop their violations or correct the inaccurate 
information they have provided 
maximum penalties for insider trading would be increased from 
five years to 10 years in jail and 100000 to 1 million 
some lawmakers say they believe the legislation puts roadblocks 
in front of raiders without halting abuses by corporate management 
one amendment will be offered to bar the issuance of nonvoting 
shares of stock which some companies use to limit the number of 
people who control corporations 
others will be considered that are designed to limit golden 
parachutes or expensive severance benefits for executives poison 
pills or moves by companies aimed at discouraging raiders such as 
increasing debt and greenmail or payments by target companies of 
high prices for stocks to raiders who agree to halt their takeover 
efforts

campaign contributions is a ridiculous charge designed to 
stifle concerns of average citizens a spokesman said friday 
robert brandon vice president of citizen action said the gop 
committees recent charges against the 175 millionmember group

pushing issues solely among members instead the committee said 
they used donations to make a pitch for political candidates to 
members and the general public 
brandon said the committees allegations contained a great 
deal of misstatement falsehood and inaccuracy about the nature of 
our organization 
committee members brandon said have decided to embrace this 
ridiculous charge thats really designed to stifle the legitimate 
concerns of average citizens he added that many members of 
citizen action were in fact republicans 
the gop committee has said it will ask the internal revenue 
service and the federal election commission to investigate its 
charges against citizen action

parched farmland soaked up moderate rain in parts of iowa on 
friday ohio officials warned of the possibility of mandatory water 
conservation and barges sat idle near shallow sections of the busy 
mississippi and ohio rivers 
i dont think the public understands the gravity of this 
problem ohio lt gov paul leonard said friday they think 
this is a great summer from the beach point of view this may be a 
great summer but from a water availability point of view this 
could be a dangerous summer 
in the south reservoirs on the savannah river in south carolina 
are at low levels comparable to their status during the severe 
droughts of the 1930s and 1950s the army corps of engineers says 
several points in northwestern and northcentral iowa received 
half an inch of rain or more friday but other areas got nothing 
more than clouds when a warm front made its way southeast through 
the region 
this is probably our last chance for rain for a week said 
chuck myers forecaster for the national weather service in iowa 
he said weather patterns would shut off any moisture from the gulf 
of mexico fridays rain came from a weak weather system that came 
all the way from the pacific 
iowa state extension climatologist elwynn taylor said fridays 
rain barely made a dent in the amount of moisture needed he said 
dry counties in northeastern iowa need five inches of rain to get 
back to normal growing conditions the rest of the state needs 
between two and four inches 
in other developments iowa ordered irrigators and other heavy 
water users along the winnebago english and little cedar rivers 
and a section of the cedar river to stop pumping with officials 
saying similar action is being considered to protect other 
lowflowing streams 
the weather service has predicted a continuation of the 
unusually dry midwestern weather through at least july 15 raising 
the possibility of a 2025 percent loss in corn yields as opposed 
to the 10 percent loss suffered to date 
futures traders on chicago kansas city and minneapolis 
commodities exchanges have been bidding up prices for future 
delivery of grains and soybeans on the chicago board of trade 
corn futures have risen about 40 percent since may 1 and soybeans 
have advanced about 35 percent and cash prices have followed suit 
in ohio the lieutenant governor was named by gov richard 
celeste to head a special state agency task force being created to 
draft recommendations for gubernatorial and legislative action in 
response to the drought 
leonard said that while dry farms have gotten most of the 
publics attention in my opinion an equally serious risk is 
facing ohio communities in terms of potential water shortages or 
eventual contamination of water supplies in ohio communities 
leonard would not rule out the possibility of mandatory 
restrictions that would certainly be a last resort but at this 
point in time you cant rule anything in or rule anything out 
until you get a good assessment of the problem he said 
about 1000 barges were halted on the mississippi near 
greenville miss while nearly 700 barges were stranded on the 
ohio near mound city ill authorities said with water down to 7 
feet deep in spots 2 feet too shallow for loaded barges 
the coast guard shut down a 7mile stretch of the ohio near 
mound city on tuesday to begin dredging a 2100foot channel 11 
feet deep by 250 feet wide the guard planned to reopen the ohio to 
traffic thursday night shifted that to friday then delayed the 
opening again until sunday because of dredging problems 
the mississippi is at its lowest levels since authorities began 
keeping records in 1872 eight dredges from greenville to cairo 
ill were working roundtheclock and only a few barges were 
passing at a time

drought is having a major impact on farm 
income this year but an analysis issued friday by the agriculture 
department showed that economists have not caught up the rapidly 
developing situation 
the report by the departments economic research service showed 
that net cash income in 1988 will be even higher than predicted a 
month ago in a range of 53 billion to 59 billion compared with 
a record 56 billion in 1987 
last month as it had for some time the agency forecast net 
cash income the difference between gross cash income and cash 
expenses at 50 billion to 55 billion and the 1987 net at 57 
billion 
the forecast range for farmers 1988 net cash income was 
raised to reflect early june data but it does not yet reflect 
potential impacts of the drought the report said 
prospects of higher feed costs and lower livestock prices have 
reduced the outlook for cattle and hog producers 
lack of rainfall this spring raised concerns about pasture and 
range conditions as cattle movements off spring pastures 
increased the report said conditions were the worst since 
1934 
the report added if marketings of grain fed cattle rise and 
their prices drop enough to cause financial losses feeder cattle 
prices will also be pushed down 
a rise in hog slaughter could reduce hog prices in late summer 
from the level of around 50 per 100 pounds in may the report said 
despite lower income prospects for hog and cattle producers 
cash receipts for the livestock sector as a whole will about equal 
last year thanks to strength in poultry receipts it said

the rev billy graham said friday he sensed 
stirrings of a quiet religious revival in the soviet union due 
in part to kremlin reforms but he called the reforms no substitute 
for religious faith 
graham who ended his fourth visit to the soviet union on 
friday also said he was assured that some members of the 
government are true believers but he would not elaborate his 
10day trip to the soviet union included meetings with church and 
government officials 
perestroika means restructuring but we must have spiritual 
restructuring the 69yearold southern baptist evangelist said 
in an interview 
perestroika soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs reform program 
has included promises to loosen regulations on religious 
denominations and their members in the officially atheist land 
soviet religious activists however say organized religious 
groups remain under the tight control of the government and ruling 
communist party 
i think perestroika has generated a tremendous hope among the 
people graham said some people say its a false hope i think 
that if all mr gorbachev is saying is going to come to pass it is 
going to be a very historic turn in this country 
graham who first visited the country in 1958 was an honored 
guest at governmentsanctioned ceremonies celebrating the 1000th 
anniversary of christianity in what is now the soviet union 
graham who also preached in the soviet union in 1982 and 1984 
said the crowds that formed to hear him preach in moscow and kiev 
were the largest he had addressed in the country 
for the first time they put up amplification outside and no 
police held people back he said when i was here before they 
wouldnt shake hands they were nervous or afraid 
graham said gorbachevs more liberal policies on selfexpression 
and incurably religious human nature had combined to rekindle 
interest in religion 
there is a quiet religious revival going on in russia in the 
hearts of its people graham said i think that under stalin 
and khrushchev and to a certain extent under brezhnev the people 
were held back now its been opened up some and will probably be 
opened up more 
graham said he thought soviet authorities were stunned by the 
hunger for faithshown by many citizens during the millennium 
celebrations which began june 5 and ended friday 
graham was asked if the church could be sure of its future in a 
land where atheism is official doctrine 
christianity has always grown under rulers who didnt believe 
in christ or in god yes the soviet government is atheistic but 
i believe that in this government there are true believers added 
graham who said he had been assured of this by soviets 
grahams 1982 visit to the soviet union sparked controversy when 
he told a news conference in moscow that the church in the country 
was free 
graham maintained friday that he had said churches have a 
measure of religious freedom but were not free in the sense 
that we call freedom

police beat several people and detained 
at least 25 who took part in peaceful demonstrations to honor 
leaders executed after the 1956 anticommunist uprising a 
dissident said friday 
the detentions occurred during a rally thursday afternoon in 
downtown budapest at which about 400 demonstrators called for 
democracy and the rehabilitation of imre nagy who was hungarys 
leader in 1956 dissident writer miklos haraszti said by telephone 
he was reached from vienna at his budapest apartment 
haraszti said all of those detained were released later 
wellknown dissidents roza hodosan and underground publisher 
gabor demszky were thrown to the floor of a police station and 
beaten by officers in front of about 15 other detainees he said 
witnesses to the rally said some people were injured when riot 
police moved into the crowd including dissident sociologist 
ottilia solt who was taken home in pretty bad shape one 
source reported privately 
earlier thursday demonstrators held a peaceful vigil at 
unmarked graves in a budapest cemetery where nagy and some of his 
associates are believed buried they were marking 30 years since 
official media published a justice ministry decree june 17 1958 
announcing the death sentences 
the afternoon rally was held at an eternal flame to lajos 
batthyany a hungarian premier executed in the abortive 1848 
revolution against austria witnesses said it began peacefully with 
2030 people laying flowers at the base of the monument then 
rejoining the crowd 
according to the witness accounts dissident writer miklos tamas 
gaspar was detained when he tried to speak and police took his 
notes 
those in the crowd chanted democracy democracy and nagy 
nagy and sang the national anthem after about half an hour 
they moved toward the danube river whichdivides the historical 
towns of buda and pest then west to the huge white building that 
houses the state television 
riot police moved in after janos kis another dissident 
addressed the crowd from the steps of the building 
witnesses said his speech was largely drowned out by 
demonstrators taunting police with chants of avo the dread 
secret police under matyas rakosi a protege of soviet dictator 
josef stalin 
the uprising was sparked by popular revulsion for rakosi who 
had dismissed nagy as premier and expelled him from the communist 
party early in 1956 it began oct 23 with mass demonstrations for 
a new government and demands that soviet troops leave hungary and 
nagy was made premier of a new government the next day 
on nov 4 200000 soviet troops and 2500 tanks arrived in 
budapest to quell the revolts 
demands have increased for the rehabilitation of nagy and some 
associates who also were executed or sentenced to prison 
one group speaking for nagy is a 37member committee called let 
justice prevail that includes his daughter eszsebet she lives in 
paris and attended the unveiling there thursday of a monument to 
her father 
rehabilitation of the uprisings leaders probably would require 
approval from moscow as well as the hungarian communist party 
janos kadar who took over after the soviets crushed the 
uprising still is president of the hungarian party a ceremonial 
post but he was replaced as general secretary last month by 
premier karoly grosz

hundreds of barges sat idle friday on the mississippi and ohio 
rivers as a lingering drought kept water levels low and officials 
said sunday would be the earliest that safe travel could resume 
drought has lowered channels in the rivers to about 7 feet in 
spots 2 feet less than needed for loaded barges and officials 
warned that aquatic life could suffer if the dry weather continues 
flow rates in the two rivers are so slow that more sediment than 
normal is settling to the bottom forming new sandbars that become 
navigational hazards 
its not good ron blake of the us coast guard in paducah 
ky said of conditions on the ohio pretty much of the river is 
bank now its that shallow 
about 1000 barges were halted on the mississippi near 
greenville miss waiting a turn through a narrow channel while 
nearly 700 barges were stuck on the ohio awaiting completing of 
dredging near mound city ill authorities said tow boat owners 
were losing about 10000 a day officials said 
ed green of the army corps of engineers in washington said the 
ohio is the nations only inland waterway shut down because of 
shallow water and it is at its lowest levels since january 1969 
water levels stood at 7 feet to 8 feet on the mississippi near 
greenville said robert anderson of the corps memphis tenn 
office the river is at its lowest level there since authorities 
began keeping records in 1872 
eight dredges were working roundtheclock from greenville to 
cairo ill to dig channels of at least 9 feet green said its 
be pretty much clogged up until sunday he said 
right now the only things passing are the small tows just a 
few barges at a time 
the coast guard on tuesday shut down a 7mile stretch of the 
ohio near mound city to begin dredging a 2100foot channel 11 
feet deep by 250 feet wide 
water depths of 8 feet in the troubled section have caused 
numerous barge groundings in the past two weeks the guard planned 
to reopen the ohio to traffic thursday night shifted that to 
friday then delayed the opening again until sunday because of 
dredging problems 
underwater cables rocks and debris forced the corps of 
engineers to delay the reopening said corps spokesman chuck 
shumann in louisville ky 
blake said 42 towboats were waiting to go downriver while 26 
needed to go upstream 
the drought also is threatening aquatic life in the ohio because 
of low oxygen and prompting algae growth that can taint drinking 
water a river monitoring official said 
peter tennant water quality programs manager of the ohio river 
valley sanitation commission said local water treatment operations 
can make the algaecontaminated water safe but cant eliminate the 
bad taste 
tennant also said that if the drought continues for two weeks 
more the oxygen level could drop to the point where it would 
affect the reproductive quality of fish

archbishop philippe nguyen kim dien of 
hue vietnam has died after spending his last years under house 
arrest for defying communist attempts to control the countrys 
roman catholic church he was 67 
the official vietnam news agency in a report monitored in 
bangkok on friday said dien died of an unspecified illness on june 
8 at cho ray hospital in ho chi minh city formerly saigon 
a vatican spokesman in rome reported that the vatican sent a 
telegram to cardinal trinh van can archbishop of hanoi saying 
pope john paul ii praised dien for his courage 
the holy father joins in the sorrow of the bishops and of all 
the catholic community in vietnam the telegram read he 
commends to the lord the courageous pastor who faithfully testified 
the gospel in a life of untiring service for the people of god 
it was signed by cardinal agostino casaroli vatican secretary 
of state 
dien was barred from priestly work and put under house arrest in 
1984 for urging priests not to join the committee for solidarity of 
patriotic vietnamese catholics the communist government of vietnam 
formed the committee in 1983 and critics said it was designed to 
control the church 
authorities apparently made no serious attempt to replace dien 
however 
the vietnamese news report dated thursday said a memorial 
service was held on monday in hue the ho chi minh city archbishop 
nguyen van binh held a funeral service in hue on wednesday which 
was attended by communist party and government officials concerned 
with religious affairs it said 
the vatican said kim was born in march 1921 in vinh long a 
traditional center of the catholic church in the mekong river delta 
in southern vietnam was ordained in july 1947 and became a bishop 
in 1961 
there are 4 million to 5 million catholics among vietnams 
largely buddhist population of about 63 million 
the vatican vietnamese refugees and other sources charge that 
after the communists came to power in 1975 they closed seminaries 
jailed priests and took other steps to repress the catholic church 
authorities have moved toward reconciliation since nguyen van 
linh became communist party chief in december 1986 a seminary was 
reopened and many priests were freed from political 
reeducation camps where they were confined since 1975 
relations with the vatican also improved somewhat although 
hanoi has condemned the vaticans scheduled canonization this 
sunday of 117 people who were martyred in vietnam in the 18th and 
19th centuries 
vietnamese officials say the vatican has allowed anticommunist 
vietnamese exiles to use the occasion to criticize hanoi

a fuel tank collapse that fouled water in 
three states would have only been a leak if ashland oil inc had 
used modern steel instead of weaker 1940s steel to build the tank 
in 1987 a federal agency said friday 
a national bureau of standards study agreed with earlier 
findings of the battelle memorial institute that a dimesized flaw 
caused the 48foot tank wall to split in a fraction of a second 
said richard n wright director of the agencys center for 
building technology 
modern steel could have resisted total collapse he said 
virtually every older tank may be susceptible to this type of 
accident said us rep doug walgren dpa who requested the 
nbs probe and introduced a bill that would raise construction 
standards on large fuel tanks 
the flaw was in the steel before the 4 milliongallon tank was 
built in cleveland around 1940 said battelle a private columbus 
ohiobased institute hired by ashland to investigate the cause of 
the spill ashland dismantled it and reconstructed the tank at its 
floreffe terminal south of pittsburgh in 1987 
it burst while being filled jan 2 during freezing weather 
even without the flaw the steel did not meet current industry 
standards becoming brittle below 80 degrees said wright no 
standards existed when ashland first erected the tank 
modern steel retains its strength at zero degrees he said 
the accident sent about 700000 gallons of oil into the 
monongahela and ohio rivers the source of drinking water for 
communities in pennsylvania west virginia and ohio 
ashland has admitted failing to obtain the necessary local 
permits before erecting the tank the company has assumed 
responsibility for the accident and has already paid 6 million of 
the 7 million cleanup costs plus 12 million in damage claims 
to government agencies businesses and individuals 
the nbs and the american petroleum institute say they do not 
know the age of the nations several thousand large fuel tanks 
wright said he believed a substantial number are made of old steel 
a hunters stray bullet a pickup truck whose brakes fail 
even a sledge hammer blow could explode some tanks walgren said 
the difficulty of preventing and detecting flaws underscores the 
importance of using strong steel said wright

the foreign office on friday announced the 
expulsions of an israeli diplomat and a plo official following a 
british courts conviction on weapons charges of a palestinian who 
was accused of spying for israel 
the foreign office said that israeli attache arie regev and the 
plos london press officer zaki al hawa were no longer welcome 
because of activities incompatible with their diplomatic duties it 
said they must leave the country by the end of june 
the department also made clear that britain had expressed 
irritation that the israeli intelligence agency mossad had not kept 
britain informed of its operations in britain 
in jerusalem a foreign ministry spokesman said we regret 
that her majestys government has seen fit to take measures of the 
kind adopted israel did not act against any british interests 
the decision follows a london trial of 28yearold palestinian 
ishmael sowan convicted wednesday at the old bailey court of 
possessing explosives grenades and rifles he was sentenced 
thursday to 11 years in jail 
prosecutors said sowan kept the arms for abder mustapha a 
palestine liberation organization member mustapha was suspected of 
arranging the murder in london of an arab cartoonist ali naji awad 
aladhami 
at the same time sowan was spying on mustapha for mossad the 
prosecution alleged 
the foreign office said it understood that the plo official al 
hawa was a member of force 17 whose function is to provide 
personal security for plo leader yasser arafat and senior officials 
overseas 
in its coverage of the trial the times of london said the 
mossad failed to tell british authorities of the presence in 
britain of mustapha britain had made an exclusion order against 
mustapha and was unaware he had returned to britain 
press association the domestic news agency quoted unidentified 
government officials as saying the exclusion order against mustapha 
was because of suspicion about his activities but that there was no 
evidence he had committed an offense 
sowan was arrested in august when police were investigating the 
shooting of aladhami 
he testified that the weapons found in his house in the eastern 
port of hull belonged to mustapha sowan was not a suspect in the 
shooting of the cartoonist police said mustapha fled to the middle 
east after aladhami was shot 
the london times said mustapha was linked to the murder of three 
israeli vacationers on a yacht at larnaca cyprus in june 1986 he 
was also wanted for an attack on an israeli el al bus in west 
germany in 1970 the newspaper said 
on friday the foreign office summoned israeli ambassador yehuda 
avner and told him arie regev should leave it later summoned 
faycal aouidha head of the plo in london and told him the home 
secretary had ordered the departure of zaki al hawa 
the foreign office also confirmed that the israeli embassy was 
told last year that an attache at the embassy jacob barrad who 
was out of the country would not be welcome to return 
regev who has been in london since 1984 and barrad were 
thought to be the officials at the embassy who coordinated the work 
of mossad press association said

the east and west coast leaders of the 
striking writers guild of america voted friday to reject a 71 
million contract offer that movie and television producers had 
hoped would settle the 15weekold walkout 
the unanimous vote was held during a telephone conference call 
between the unions two governing boards said west coast executive 
director brian walton 
he said that only a very small part of the meeting was 
devoted to considering whether to accept the contract with most of 
it spent reviewing details of the offer which was rejected 
thursday by the guilds negotiating committee 
members of the 9500member union will meet wednesday in new 
york and los angeles to vote on the contract union officials said 
they expected a rejection despite pressure from a union splinter 
group to sign a contract 
walton said he believed producers intended to divide the union 
thursday by making an offer they knew would be rejected 
presumably they wanted to see if the membership would follow the 
leadership thats the only explanation i can give for the 
offer 
walton characterized the offer by the alliance of motion picture 
and television producers as quite better than the previous 
offer but still not acceptable in the area of domestic 
television and foreign residuals for reruns 
we are very disappointed we have nothing more to give said 
producers spokesman herb steinberg 
while no new talks were scheduled walton said the guild has 
offered to resume negotiations 
the rejected offer represented an acrosstheboard increase of 
147 percent over a fouryear contract and a value of 71 million 
steinberg said the producers previous offer was valued by the 
alliance at 52 million

president reagan said friday that he was 
pleased with the latest narrowing in the trade deficit and 
indicated that it would not be a terrible calamity if the 
deficit does not return to zero 
the monthly trade deficit shrank to 99 billion in april from 
117 billion in march the best showing in more than three years 
the commerce department reported this week 
asked during an interview on cable news networks moneyline 
if he thought the report signaled that the trade deficit problem 
for the united states was cured reagan replied 
well it seems to be consistently going down now and last 
month was the lowest that weve had 
actually i think that is a reasonable trade deficit some 
place along the line he said adding that such a deficit is 
not the terrible calamity that some people have pointed it out to 
be 
reagan left unclear whether he would like to see the deficit 
decline further the trade deficit is the difference between 
imports and exports 
we are the biggest exporter in the world we are also the 
biggest importer in the world he said 
if the united states started trying only to sell to foreign 
nations and not to buy goods from them that could create some of 
kind of economic problems worldwide and that would affect us 
last year the trade shortfall was a record 1703 billion

roxanne pulitzer whose 1982 divorce trial 
featured details of cocaine use extramarital sex and jetset 
hijinks told members of the florida bar on friday that lawyers and 
judges cost her custody of her two children 
the palm beach divorce case almost destroyed the children 
she said about her twins then 5 when the sexanddrug allegations 
were outlined mack and zack went out the window all it was 
was proving me an unfit mother 
ms pulitzer told the family law section of the florida bar 
meeting that lawyers for her husband peter pulitzer offered her 
total custody of the children if she agreed to a financial 
settlement 
when she refused they twice prevented a reconciliation and it 
became a war between lawyers she said 
circuit judge carl harper awarded custody to her husband because 
the newspaper heirs lawyers created him into a thoroughly 
reliable loving parent while painting her as a lesbian adultress 
druguser and uncaring mother she said 
judge harpers final decree stripped me naked far more than 
playboy ever did she said referring to her posing for the 
maleoriented magazine after the trial 
harper cited flagrant acts of adultery and other gross marital 
misconduct for finding her unsuitable as a mother her appeal of 
his ruling failed 
ms pulitzer who is on a nationwide tour publicizing a book she 
wrote about the divorce said she often speaks to divorce lawyers 
in efforts to prevent them from ignoring the needs of their 
clients children 
in her book the prize pulitzer she blames her exhusband 
for nearly everything that went wrong 
asked what she thought of ms pulitzers criticism of her 
colleagues familypractice attorney cynthia stump swanson of 
gainesville said i agree with her to a certain extent lawyers 
are supposed to represent their clients but not to the detriment of 
the children 
a newly developing guardian program that intervenes in a 
divorce suit solely on behalf of the children would have made a 
big difference said another divorce lawyer who heard the speech 
nancy rainey palmer of casselberry

the state department said friday it would 
support new restrictive measures in hong kong to stop a flood of 
vietnamese boat people if the rules are applied humanely and 
according to united nations standards 
the department issued a statement that it understands a 
decision by british authorities in hong kong to incarcerate newly 
arriving boat people as illegal aliens any arrivees who cant 
prove they fled to avoid persecution will be sent back to vietnam 
according to the rules imposed on tuesday 
nearly 8000 boat people have arrived in hong kong so far this 
year compared to 650 for the same period in 1987 and the new 
measures are designed to deter more people from coming 
hong kong and other southeast asian nations have agreed to be 
first asylum countries for refugees passing through on their 
way to the west but the flood of boat people is taxing their 
willingness the department said 
in their defense thailand indonesia malaysia and hong kong 
have complained that the united states and other industrialized 
nations that have promised to resettle refugees are not taking 
enough of them 
the state departments statement aimed at all those countries 
not just kong kong reflected resignation among us experts that 
southeast asian nations are moving toward steps to stop the influx 
and concern that that the methods might be too harsh 
in recent months for example the united states has accused 
thailand of pushing overcrowded and leaky boats with asylumseekers 
back out to sea 
the department said it accepted the hong kong rules because 
authorities had given assurances that 
arriving boat people will be let into the country not pushed 
back to sea 
everyone who arrives will get a chance to apply for refugee 
status 
those whose applications are rejected will be housed in 
humane and safe holding centers 
in view of these firm assurances that the new policy will be 
implemented in a reasonable and responsible manner the united 
states understands the action which the british and hong kong 
authorities have concluded they must take in order to preserve 
first asylum for refugees the department said 
we would expect that the screening program would apply unhcrs 
current criteria for determination of refugee status for vietnamese 
boat people and that the vietnamese would be informed of their 
right to seek refugee status the statement said 
we would be prepared to support the action of the british and 
hong kong in that case it said

landmark us supreme court decision outlawing organized prayer in 
public schools 
there wasnt anything to celebrate before we were still 
struggling said mrs ohair 70 before festivities celebrating 
the 25th anniversary of a related court decision that resulted from 
a suit she filed 
now she said weve made it were here there is no way that 
we can be pushed out of society any more there are too many 
atheists now 
the supreme court in 1963 outlawed daily bible reading in public 
schools based on a landmark ruling the previous year that 
organized school prayer violated the constitutions first amendment 
prohibition against any state establishment of religion 
mrs ohair then madalyn murray in 1959 had complained that 
her son bill was being required to pray in his public schools in 
baltimore 
there has been a long struggle said mrs ohair referring 
to continuing hostility and challenges to the court victories 
against organized prayer 
american atheists the organization mrs ohair founded began 
the anniversary celebration friday with a ribboncutting planned 
primarily for reporters to see its new headquarters the building 
cost 175 million before renovations and was paid for in cash as 
is the groups custom mrs ohair said 
over the weekend the atheists planned tours of the headquarters 
and a celebration of the summer solstice about 200 people were 
expected said rob sherman the groups national spokesman 
mrs ohairs son jon and granddaughter robin murrayohair 
bills daughter work with her mrs ohair says she does not

publisher rupert murdoch on friday proposed to 
put his boston uhf television station in an independent trust to 
comply with government rules barring common ownership of a 
newspaper and tv station in the same city 
a waiver allowing murdoch to own wfxttv and the boston herald 
expires june 30 and although he won the right in court to request 
an extension of the waiver murdoch had said he would sell the tv 
station 
but the media magnate said friday he had decided to avail 
himself of the trust option which is allowed by the federal 
communications commission as a method of complying with the 
crossownership rule 
murdoch proposed to the fcc that the trust be managed by former 
sen edward brooke of massachusetts and former new york gov hugh 
carey 
lawrence kessler general counsel of murdochs company news 
america publishing inc said the trust was chosen because it 
seemed a more appropriate thing to do right now it lets us remain 
the beneficiary of what we believe will be a valuable property 
under terms of the trust agreement murdoch would relinquish 
control of the station but would still receive profits the station 
could not be sold for less than 35 million it could be sold for 
more than that amount if murdoch agrees but he would be able to 
consider only the financial terms and conditions of the 
proposal 
the station has been valued at between 30 million and 50 
million 
the agreement also provides that the trust would be terminated 
if the station were sold or ceased operation or if murdoch sells 
the boston herald 
andrew schwartzman executive director of the media access 
project a public interest law firm said he was concerned that the 
agreement would allow the station to be held by the trust 
indefinitely 
thats very troubling schwartzman said in an interview 
these guys brooke and carey arent broadcasters we want to 
license people who are going to be broadcasters on a permanent 
basis 
murdoch in march sold the new york post for 37 million to real 
estate developer peter kalikow to comply with the crossownership 
rule 
murdoch had engaged in a bitter battle with congress over 
temporary waivers allowing him to own the two boston properties and 
the new york post and wnywtv in new york 
sens ernest hollings dsc and edward kennedy dmass late 
last year pushed through the congress a little noticed measure 
prohibiting the fcc from eliminating or modifying the 
crossownership rule and barring it from extending any waivers of 
the rule 
in march murdoch successfully challenged the legislation in the 
us circuit court of appeals and won the right to request an 
extension of his waiver from the fcc 
however he decided against a further extension saying the 
station had suffered as the result of a regulatory cloud

soviet television aired an interview with cia 
defector edward lee howard friday and showed him at a country 
dacha walking down moscows arbat shopping street and discussing 
his life since he arrived here in 1985 
the broadcast included a home movie howard made for his family 
during travels around the soviet union he said he was happy but 
he also said he had few friends 
howards wife and son did not accompany him to the soviet union 
his defection to moscow was the first by someone known to have 
worked for the cia 
he shed little light during the interview on how he managed to 
slip through fbi surveillance of his home in santa fe nm and 
reach soviet soil 
howard did say he traveled to hungary since defecting and that 
his disagreements with the central intelligence agency were 
mostly political i am opposed to secret methods 
in a previous interview on soviet tv howard said he was granted 
political asylum in the soviet union and had never done anything 
that would damage or threaten my countrys security 
the soviets reportedly paid howard 6000 for information which 
compromised many cia operations in the soviet union and is believed 
to have led to the arrest and execution of at least one soviet 
working for the cia 
howard spoke mostly in english during the friday interview and 
his remarks were translated into russian while strolling down the 
arbat he chatted in russian with his interviewer 
the home movie included footage of churches which he said were 
one of his favorite sights in the soviet union he said he has 
always been a roman catholic but it was not clear where he 
worshiped 
he was shown inside his dacha which appeared plush by soviet 
standards he said he also had an apartment in moscow but this was 
not shown perhaps for security reasons 
howard said he met in moscow at length with david wise an 
american based in washington who has written several books critical 
of the cia the defector said he might write a book on his 
experiences after a time 
howard 36 went to work for the cia in 1981 and was fired by 
the agency in june 1983 some sources said he quit because he was 
angry at being assigned to moscow and others because his superiors 
became concerned about his personal life

the defense department has agreed to accept 
penalties from the environmental protection agency if it violates 
agreements with epa to clean up superfund toxic waste sites 
epa announced friday 
in such a case the department will seek appropriations to make 
the actual transfer of funds from its pocket to epas 5000 for 
the first week of violation and 10000 for subsequent weeks 
the agreement similar to one reached last month with the energy 
department provides for the administrator of epa to settle any 
disputes between the staffs of epa and the department over whether 
a violation has occurred 
amendments to the superfund law in 1986 required epa and the two 
departments to try to agree on a penalty formula leaving the 
actual funds to be appropriated by congress 
if epa assesses a penalty the installation affected must report 
the facts to congress 
we think this provides greater incentive to comply said 
christopher grundler head of epas federal facilities hazardous 
waste compliance office the colonel commanding a base doesnt 
get to be a general if he has to march up to congress to explain 
whats been going on 
federal facilities such as air bases are frequently among the 
most contaminated waste sites because of years of neglect of such 
problems as the disposal of powerful solvents used to clean 
aircraft engines 
though epa can list such sites on its superfund priority list 
the owning agency is responsible for cleanup and epa may spend 
none of its own funds there 
epa must negotiate cleanup agreements in such instances the 
justice department has claimed that any legislation requiring epa 
to order cleanups would unconstitutionally infringe on the 
presidents powers to direct the executive branch 
congressional investigations have documented widespread 
violations of waste handling laws at defense facilities and have 
estimated that tens of billions of dollars will be needed for 
cleanup some members of congress have accused particular bases of 
ignoring their waste problems 
the defense department has been devoting increasing amounts to 
cleanups and now spends about 400 million a year according to 
grundler 
epa has placed 29 defense sites on the priority list has 
proposed 15 more and expects to add another 50 to 70 grundler 
said there are two or three energy department installations on 
the list and more will be added he said

west german chancellor helmut kohl on friday 
urged scientists to work with politicians to combat global economic 
problems in the same way they spurred attempts to protect the 
earths ozone layer 
kohl accepting an honorary doctorate of laws from toronto 
university said he and the six other leaders eeting in toronto 
next week need help from scientists if they are to meet their 
challenges 
we will use all means at our disposal to promote stable 
noninflationary world economic growth kohl said we will 
resolutely combat global protectionism of any kind 
he said they also would have to find ways of keeping developed 
countries from overproducing food while the poorest countries 
especially in africa have increasingly less food 
they likewise will have to improve the economy of the third 
world including finding a way to ease the developing nations 
indebtedness kohl said 
all these crucial problems pertaining to the world economy and 
the international debt situation cannot be solved by any one 
country alone regardless of its economic strength he said 
these problems present challenges that require cooperation 
between politicians and scientists kohl said we need 
scientific and technological innovation 
he said politicians need scientists as an early warning 
system to sound the alarm about threats in nature technology and 
society as they warned about the dangers that chlorofluorocarbons 
from refrigerants foam and aerosols pose to the earths protective 
ozone layer 
those warnings have prompted global efforts to restrict 
further still the production and use of such substances kohl 
said 
the west german chancellor who addressed the canadian 
parliament on thursday also paid a visit to david peterson 
premier of ontario toronto which is hosting the economic summit 
conference starting sunday is capital of ontario canadas 
wealthiest and most populous province 
kohl then went to kitchener ontario one hour to the southwest 
of toronto for a speech to the germancanadian community the 
ethnic group consisting of more than 2 million people is the 
third largest in canada after the british and french canadians

the church of england said friday night that four 
british legislators will travel to iran in an effort to improve 
relations hoping that this could lead to the release of three 
britons kidnapped in lebanon 
an announcement from the residence of robert runcie archbishop 
ofcanterbury said the church had organized the mission at the 
invitation of the iranian government 
the delegation is scheduled to leave sunday and meet with 
highranking iranian officials in tehran 
a foreign office spokesman said we have been informed but not 
consulted as far as we are concerned it is a privately organized 
visit 
eighteen foreigners including nine americans are missing in 
lebanon and it is believed that most are held captive by members of 
the proiranian hezbollah or party of god movement 
one of the missing britons is terry waite 49 runcies foreign 
affairs adviser who disappeared jan 20 1987 during his fifth 
mission to seek the freedom of abducted westerners 
waite had previously negotiated the release of 10 captives in 
the middle east including prisoners in iran and libya 
the other kidnapped britons are john mccarthy 31 a television 
journalist missing since feb 17 1986 and alec collett 64 a new 
yorkbased journalist who disappeared march 25 1985 while on 
assignment for the united nations relief and works agency 
an islamic extremist organization claimed collett had been 
killed but his body has not been found and there has been no proof 
that he is dead 
brian keenan 36 from the british province of northern ireland 
was abducted april 11 1986 while walking to the american 
university of beirut where he worked as an english teacher he 
holds an irish passport 
the longestheld hostage is american terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press who was 
kidnapped in beirut march 16 1985 
iran and britain reduced their diplomatic staffs last summer in 
a series of retaliatory expulsions following the beating of a 
british diplomat in tehran and the shoplifting arrest of an iranian 
envoy in britain iran now has only one diplomat in london and 
britain has one in tehran 
the four lawmakers in the mission to iran are cyril townsend and 
robert hicks of the governing conservative party thomas clarke of 
the labor party and lord tordoff of the social liberal democrats 
runcie spokeswoman eve keatley said john lyttle from runcies 
public affairs office was instrumental in arranging the mission 
she said lyttle was in iran and met with senior government figures 
the group is not going to negotiate for the return of 
hostages it is a factfinding mission to find ways to improve 
relations with iran which could lead to the freeing of terry waite 
and the other british hostages mrs keatley said 
we have repeatedly made it clear we are not prepared to be 
party to any deal which would indicate in any way that 
hostagetaking pays dividends she added 
on june 10 britain and iran agreed during talks in london to 
compensate each other for damages to their diplomatic offices 
the british embassy and consular officers in tehran were damaged 
by mobs in the late 1970s and the iranian embassy in london was 
burned in 1980 during a commando assault to rescue hostages in the 
building 
under the agreement britain will pay iran the equivalent of 
32 million and iran will pay britain 16 million 
waites brother john waite said of the church mission i am 
sure this would be terrys way to advance the cause of the 
hostages he is on record as saying that he didnt believe in deals 
but he was a great believer in discovering the other persons 
point of view and finding common ground that is what the 
delegation is all about 
the friends of john mccarthy a group formed to push for his 
release also welcomed the mission 
we support all efforts aimed at bringing the hostages home we 
are glad that this mission is being organized under the auspices of 
the church of england said a spokesman 
we hope that dialogue with the iranian authorities will help 
to create an atmosphere for the release of hostages this 
mission underlines the need to talk to all those who can aid their 
freedom

cosmonaut landed softly friday on the sweltering dusty plains of 
soviet central asia at the end of a 10day mission staterun media

some texas democrats in town for their partys 
state convention held a bologna buffet friday in the hotel 
suite that is vice president george bushs official state residence 
its pretty well known that george bush moved out of texas 
some years ago and moved to maine said ty fain an austin 
businessman and democratic party activist who rented suite 271 at 
the houstonian hotel and conference center 
you cant begrudge anyone that but sometimes politicians get 
carried away with their own baloney and we can poke holes in them 
and anyone who walked through here can see this is not a home 
fain added 
fain munching a bologna sandwich on white bread led visitors 
around the threeroom suite which rents for 515 a night showing 
off two bedrooms each with kingsize beds and each with a small 
bathroom the suite with floortoceiling oneway glass windows 
overlooks the hotel pool just a few feet away outside 
every man lines up in this room at the windows said elisa 
lyles who works for fain as she watched men in the room gaze at 
dozens of bikiniclad women tanning themselves on the pool deck 
fain said he called the hotel said he was going to be in town 
for a couple of days and thought it would be fun to rent the suite 
im absolutely delighted fain said this is one of the 
finest hotels ive ever been in were just trying to have a little 
fun 
but the question of george bush being a hometown boy is a 
little out of date when he comes to texas and parades around as a 
hometown boy i think this is a little bit of baloney 
bushs residency was subject of a court challenge a few years 
ago but a houston judge ruled the vice president could vote in the 
city as a texas resident 
bush who has wrapped up the republican presidential nomination 
lived in texas for years and served as a congressman for a houston 
district however he has not owned a home in texas since becoming 
vice president in 1981 he was born in massachusetts grew up in 
connecticut and has a vacation home in maine

the parliament on friday adopted a new 
military oath that deletes a pledge to serve in alliance with the 
soviet army a clause long criticized as an affront to polish 
sovereignty 
a brief statement by the official news agency pap said the new 
oath which was recommended by the government and the defense 
ministry was passed unanimously 
the government has called the change merely a matter of updating 
antiquated language and has said it would not affect relations with 
the soviets 
previously military inductees pledged to guard peace in 
brotherly alliance with the soviet army and other allied 
armies an outlawed opposition group freedom and peace had long 
charged the oath affronted polish sovereignty 
the new oath contains no reference to the soviet union and the 
pledge is only to guard peace in the brotherhood of arms with the 
allied armies 
it also drops a reference to defending poland against the 
threats of imperialism 
government spokesman jerzy urban has stressed that the revised 
wording does not reflect any lessening of polands alliance with 
the soviet union 
the alliance with the soviet union provides the foundation for 
the polish armed forces urban said last march no matter how 
this truth is expressed in words the essence of the matter will 
not change 
urban said the oath was changed because it came into existence 
some time ago so it requires some adjustments 
all periods in time have their specific styles he added 
freedom and peace leader jacek czaputowicz said many people has 
been imprisoned simply for opposing the old oath he said his group 
deserved credit for the proposed change 
these changes are because of the activity of freedom and 
peace he said he called the change a very big success i 
think the biggest success of freedom and peace in its short 
history 
he said his group hoped the new oath would be more than a 
symbol a onetime action but the start of a process of changing 
the role and function of the army in polish society 
 
the government has denied that freedom and peace affected the 
decision to change the oath 
freedom and peace says 16 of its supporters are in prison 
either for refusing to take the oath or to comply with polands 
mandatory twoyear military draft 
the group also demands the right to alternative national service 
for conscientious objectors the government has announced it is 
considering some form of such service but said inductees would 
have to serve up to four years 
the old oath also contained the promise to guard unyieldingly 
the rights of the working people guaranteed in the constitution 
unyieldingly stand guard of the peoples rule and remain faithful 
to the government of the polish peoples republic 
the new oath says simply i swear to serve the homeland and 
the nation with no specific reference to the government or 
working people 
czaputowicz said it was significant that the references to 
socialism and the government were dropped 
some people from freedom and peace who refused to take the 
oath said they cannot swear to the government because this 
government is not our government he said it is not the 
government of the whole nation 
five freedom and peace supporters from gdansk were detained 
outside parliament on thursday 15 minutes after they sat down on 
the pavement to demand passage of the new oath czaputowicz said 
the protesters were also calling for release of freedom and 
peace member slawomir dutkiewicz 24 of szczecin who was 
imprisoned for resisting the draft 
dutkiewicz has been forcefed since he began a hunger strike in 
november he has lost 44 pounds and his health has deteriorated 
significantly according to dr zofia kuratowska a physician who 
examined him in prison earlier this week

of attempted murder against the policemen after they put rubber 
tubing over her face and ducked her head in a river during

arrests in townships across the country thursday as blacks marked

restrictions on reporting antigovernment activity 
regulations already in effect restrict reporting on security 
force activity unrest various types of peaceful protest and a 
range of subversive statements

the cost of dollars and food soared 
taxi drivers quadrupled fares and two unions demanded pay raises of 
600 percent friday two days after the leftist sandinista 
government introduced freemarket measures 
among actions taken were a huge devaluation of the cordoba 
nicaraguas currency a neardoubling of gasoline prices and a 
general pay increase of 30 percent 
the government retained subsidies on some basic foods but in 
markets where goods sell outside the rationing system at 
freemarket rates the price of a liter of milk just over a quart 
had gone from 66 to 21 cordobas meat from 50 to 100 cordobas a 
pound and a dozen eggs from 50 to 80 cordobas 
a dollar was worth 80 cordobas instead of the former 13 at the 
official rate on the black market friday a dollar bought 250 
cordobas 90 more than the market offered before devaluation 
the transporation system was in disarray because of the new 
gasoline prices cab drivers ignored the official tariff of 5 
cordobas for a short trip demanding 20 and many who own their 
taxis simply stayed home 
two major unions controlled by the socialist party demanded 
raises of 600 percent the government called the positions of the 
workers federation of nicaragua and general federation of 
independent workers unreal and inflationary 
primary school teachers earn about 2500 cordobas a month and 
their guild says that is not enough to live on president daniel 
ortega said he would meet with the teachers sunday 
so far no public protests of the economic measures have been 
held 
ortega told domestic critics thursday they were playing with 
fire by opposing the program and the political opposition might 
disappear if they dont respond with the patriotism our country 
demands

rep pat swindall apologized friday for 
considering a proposal to finance a 1 million home with laundered 
drug and gambling money saying he was wrong and ashamed but will 
still run for reelection 
the republican congressman said his political future should be 
left up to the voters of georgias 4th district in atlantas 
eastern suburbs 
i was wrong to have ever considered such a proposal to have 
discussed it swindall said i was wrong not to have gone to 
the authorities before i did 
he said however that he made the right decision in walking 
away from the deal before he got in too deep 
i do know the difference between right and wrong swindall 
said at a news conference i did not break the law nor do 
anything unethical 
swindall who appeared to choke back tears while making his 
opening statement apologized to his supporters and family for 
making them bear this burden 
swindall said he would continue his campaign for reelection 
because there is not another candidate who will reflect the 
majority view of this district in congress 
he said he had no ill will for the federal investigators 
because i think what they were doing is exactly what they should 
be doing 
i think the drug situation in this country is such that we 
need sting operations he said 
the atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution reported 
thursday that transcripts of tapes made secretly by federal 
authorities show swindall was told money he was seeking to borrow 
for a home in stone mountain might be illegal drug or gambling 
profits 
the tapes were made by internal revenue service agent michael 
mullaney mullaney posing as a money broker for underworld 
figures was investigating charles lechasney when the atlanta 
businessman brought in swindall to negotiate an 850000 loan 
lechasney was indicted in february on federal money laundering 
charges 
swindall said he did receive a 150000 check at one point but 
he returned it uncashed he said he terminated all dealings with 
lechasney when he began to suspect the money was tainted 
a us congressman ought to be totally above reproach he 
said i wasnt above reproach i will say that i have never been 
as ashamed about anything as i am ashamed about what i have done 
georgia democratic party chairman john henry anderson sent rep 
newt gingrich rga a letter of complaint against swindall 
asking gingrich to sign it and forward it to the house ethics 
committee 
gingrich who filed a complaint that has led to an ethics probe 
of house speaker jim wright dtexas said thursday he would look 
into a possible investigation 
swindall at his news conference said he would welcome such an 
investigation as well as any other probe 
i think i am subject to every investigation that can be 
conceived by the human mind when i make mistakes i will confess 
them and say this was a mistake he said 
earlier friday guy davis an atlanta lawyer who was the georgia 
republican gubernatorial nominee in 1986 said he met with 
lechasney in jail early this year and was warned swindall would be 
politically damaged by the laundering investigation 
state party leaders heard the warning and rejected suggestions 
that they get another candidate into the race for swindalls seat 
said two participants in the discussions davis and rich 
richardson an atlanta businessman and past financial contributor 
to swindall 
some believed that pat was such a mr clean guy that hed come 
out of it richardson recalled 
because the qualifying period has ended no name other than 
swindalls can appear on the republican primary ballot 
writein votes are not allowed in the aug 9 primary so any 
republican other than swindall wishing to run would have to wage a 
writein campaign in november against the winner of the threeway 
democratic primary said lee raudonis executive director of the 
georgia republican party

the parliament on friday have staged an 
unprecedented rebellion against the ruling communist party 
leadership refusing to unseat an officeholder to create a vacancy 
for a former politburo member 
also friday deputy foreign minister tadeusz olechowski was 
appointed foreign minister to succeed marian orzechowski who 
assumed new communist party responsibilities earlier in the week 
as foreign minister since 1985 orzechowski saw poland through a 
period of improved relations with western countries such relations 
deteriorated following the 1981 military crackdown on the 
independent solidarity trade union movement 
on the legislators action one deputy said it was the first 
time the sejm or parliament had turned down such a motion from 
the party 
i think it was a kind of warning addressed to the state 
leadership that the old methods are not going to be effective and 
not going to be tolerated said mikolaj kozakiewicz a sejm 
deputy and member of the communistallied united peasant party 
the vote came the same day parliament passed unanimously a new 
military oath that deleted a pledge to serve alongside the soviet 
army the old pledge had been seen by some as an affront to polish 
sovereignty 
polish government officials have said the change was only an 
updating of antiquated language and did not reflect a lessening of 
the alliance with the soviet union 
the parliament revolt came on a motion to remove gen tadeusz 
hupalowski as head of the supreme chamber of control a post 
similar to auditor general to make room for wlodzimierz 
mokryszczak who left the politburo of the polish united workers 
communist party on tuesday in a leadership reshuffle 
only 154 deputies less than a majority of the 460member sejm 
voted in favor of removing hupalowski with 140 voting against and 
40 abstaining the motion was defeated 
state radio initially announced hupalowski had been removed and 
mokryszczak would replace him but later corrected the report 
a spokesman for the government press office said friday night 
there would be no immediate comment on the matter 
deputy kozakiewicz said hupalowski had been doing a good job and 
most deputies felt his removal would harm parliament he said the 
proposed replacement didnt arouse such enthusiasm 
increasing the power and independence of the sejm has been one 
of polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelskis aims in his program of 
political reforms but because the communist party dominates the 
sejm and the government party dictates in the past have been 
treated as law 
some deputies complained openly when they were instructed to 
approve ministerial appointments with only a few hours to review 
nominees during a government shakeup last year 
kozakiewicz said the parliament action friday was important 
proof that something is going on in the sejm that something is 
changing that some kind of mechanisms are at work 
of the 460 deputies in the sejm 245 are communists 106 are 
members of the united peasant party 35 are members of the 
democratic party and 74 are nonparty members 
the constitution says the communist party has the leading 
role and its leadership is recognized by the other two parties

michael dukakis insists an investigation of house 
speaker jim wright will not affect his presidential bid but 
republicans who think otherwise are looking forward to pressing the 
issue during what should be dukakis shining moment the 
democratic national convention 
dukakis the certain democratic presidential nominee wasted few 
opportunities during the primary season to lambaste malfeasance in 
the reagan administration delivering particularly harsh criticism 
of embattled attorney general edwin meese iii 
now republicans who successfully sought a house ethics 
investigation of wrights conduct are firing back and trying to 
neutralize the socalled gop sleaze factor with attacks on the 
nations highestranking elected democrat 
wright is chairman of the national convention in atlanta and as 
such will attract lots of national television time during the 
threeday gathering 
an embarrassment for dukakis 
i thought there was a presumption of innocence in this 
country was his reply when asked thursday 
that may be true in the courts perhaps not in politics 
in a politically charged atmosphere its going to take on a 
life of its own said bob beckel who managed walter f mondales 
1984 presidential campaign the reality is that the republicans 
are going to make every bit of political hay out of this and they 
should 
when the democrats huddle next month to crown dukakis as their 
nominee and to set the tone for the campaign against republican 
george bush there will be plenty of gop strategists on hand to 
offer their perspective to the news media 
wright will be in the limelight and under the spotlight 
he will be up there at the podium longer than michael dukakis 
or anyone else for all to see and that is an embarrassment 
said william schneider a political analyst at the american 
enterprise institute 
and every night well have national gop chairman frank 
fahrenkopf on television talking about the democrats and their 
sleaze factor said schneider imagine if ed meese was 
running the republican convention 
dukakis aides say there have been no attempts to reduce wrights 
visibility at the convention 
the governor has talked to speaker wright and the speaker 
assured him that this will move expeditiously and that the outcome 
will be fine said chuck campion dukakis national political 
director we see no ramifications at all 
there may also be an independent investigation of allegations 
wright lobbied improperly on behalf of oil companies with which he 
may have had financial relationships questions surrounding 
publication of a book for which he received a higherthanusual 
royalty and which was produced with the help of a congressionally 
paid staffer contacts with federal officials on behalf of texas 
savings and loans and the use of a condominium for which he paid no 
monthly rent 
dukakis maintains the speakers troubles are not comparable to 
those of meese or others in the reagan administration who have been 
convicted of or accused of wrongdoing pointing to wrights 
cooperation while saying many in the administration have tried to 
stonewall investigators 
and he sees no inconsistency in his demand that meese resign 
while he is making no such request of wright 
if youre attorney general of this country and youve stumbled 
as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he has and provided 
as weak leadership as he has you ought to leave office dukakis 
said 
he insists otherwise but the allegations against wright must 
trouble dukakis who built his reputation as a goodgovernment 
reformer by challenging entrenched boston pols who openly relished 
their power 
it must irritate him wildly to see this thing happening to 
democratic leaders said schneider one gets the impression 
that hed like to fire jim wright this is just the type of thing 
that drives michael dukakis crazy he wants to keep a thousand 
miles away from anything that associates him with the sleaze 
factor 
that wont be possible 
in addition to the convention dukakis might also run into 
wright this weekend at the texas democratic convention dukakis 
aides said they were not sure if the two would hold a private 
meeting there 
at the convention in houston on friday night wright drew a 
standing ovation from delegates he made no mention of the ethics 
probe during a keynote speech but exgov mark white who 
introduced wright called on republicans who levied the allegations 
at wright to clean up your own house before you slander the name 
of jim wright 
texas democratic chairman bob slagle said the allegations of 
financial improprieties are based on party politics saying what 
is really bothering the republicans about jim wright is he is the 
most effective speaker since sam rayburn died 
dukakis was quick to criticize meese when questioned thursday 
but attacks on the attorney general were missing from dukakis 
rhetoric during three massachusetts events this week designed to 
portray him as a tough crimefighter seemingly the perfect type of 
forum to criticize the nations top law enforcement officer 
i think its wise for him to do that now said schneider 
what he has to do is talk about the yardlong list of indictments 
and convictions in this administration not just ed meese 
beckel said the greatest test is how dukakis handles himself at 
the convention 
dukakis should keep his distance from wright but not abandon 
him beckel said hes got enough to worry about right now for 
dukakis its like walking into a mine field

a colombian alleged to be among the worlds major 
cocaine traffickers was indicted with five other people friday in 
an alleged attempt to establish a cocaine distribution center in 
colorado 
the fivecount indictment handed down in us district court 
here alleges that pablo emilio escobargaviria a principal in the 
medellin cartel of colombian cocaine traffickers and five others 
planned to ship up to 800 kilograms of cocaine a week into the 
denver area 
authorities who arrested four of the defendants and seized 738 
pounds of cocaine in a may 25 motel raid estimated that 800 kilos 
of cocaine could have a street value of as much as 17 million 
the indictment accuses the men of importing the cocaine with the 
intent of distributing it in the united states 
escobar 39 also is under indictment in the southern district 
of florida on charges of conspiracy to import and distribute 
drugs said us attorney michael j norton 
escobargaviria is considered by some to be one of the major 
cocaine traffickers in the world norton said 
escobargaviria and another man named in the indictment remain 
at large four others named in the indictment were arrested may 25 
at a motel in boulder by agents of the fbi and drug enforcement 
administration and accused of trying to smuggle 335 kilograms or 
about 738 pounds of cocaine into colorado 
the drug cartel told our informants that increased federal law 
enforcement efforts in south florida south texas and southern 
california had made them seek new distribution centers in the 
us norton said 
members of the cartel also complained that increased efforts by 
law enforcement authorities in colombia were hurting the cartels 
drug operations norton said 
norton said a threemonth dea investigation disrupted plans to 
fly the cocaine from colombia to colorado for further distribution 
in california and florida as well as the fertile rocky mountain 
area 
the cocaine would have been flown by a private twinengine plane 
into jefferson county airport at broomfield about 18 miles 
northwest of denver norton said

street vendorpoet dennis lobban was 
found guilty friday and sentenced to hang for the murder of reggae 
star peter tosh and two of his friends 
a jury of eight women and four men took six minutes to convict 
lobban on three counts of murder 
i am innocent sir lobban answered when justice carl 
patterson asked if he had anything to say before sentencing him to 
hang on each count 
the judge told the jury i would have arrived at the same 
verdict i have no doubt in my mind that he went there to toshs 
home that night and killed tosh and the others 
it was just by chance that the other four visitors at the 
house survived or we would have had seven people lying dead 
lobban 33 a convicted felon with a long police record was out 
on parole when the murders were committed 
he insisted throughout the trial that he was innocent he 
claimed he was drinking with friends far from toshs house the 
night of sept 11 1987 when tosh radio disc jockey jeff dixon 
and wilton doc brown were murdered by three gunmen who burst 
into toshs home 
the trial began monday and had been expected to last for weeks 
like all trials in jamaica involving illegal firearms it was 
held behind closed doors in the gun court division of home circuit 
court reporters were allowed into the courtroom on condition they 
not publish the names of witnesses 
steve russell 26 of kingston who had been charged jointly 
with lobban was freed on thursday the judge accepted a nocase 
motion from russells lawyer who said the prosecution failed to 
show russell was involved in the slayings 
russell claimed he only drove the killers to toshs home without 
going inside or knowing they were going to kill tosh 
lobban who turned 33 on thursday is a higgler or street 
vendor and a dub poet who recites poetry to reggae music 
he has been convicted of eight previous felons ranging from 
illegal possession of firearms to armed robbery 
lobban was escorted from court by armed guards and taken to 
prison to join 188 other people on death row 
any appeal would go to the jamaican court of appeal the final 
court of appeal is the privy council in england 
tosh 42 years old at the time of his death was nominated for a 
grammy in 1985 for his album captured live 
tosh bob marley and neville livingstone in 1963 formed the 
group the wailers which thrust reggaes driving rhythms from the 
slums of kingston onto the world stage 
born winston herbert macintosh tosh left the wailers in 1973 
one later tosh group was word sound and power 
outside jamaica tosh was perhaps best known for his 
collaboration with rolling stones lead singer mick jagger on the 
smokey robinson song you got to walk and dont look back

portauprince haiti ap president leslie manigat fired the 
commander in chief of the haitian army and two other generals 
friday night accusing them of insubordination 
national television read a communique stating that manigat had 
retired lt gen henri namphy the commander and two other members 
of the general staff brigadier generals carl michel nicolas and 
wilton cherisson 
col morton gousse was promoted to brigadier general and named 
acting commander in chief until the senate names a new one the 
communique said 
the president overruled namphy on wednesday by rescinding an 
order issued the previous day transferring and retiring 
highranking officers manigat said the order was unconsitutional 
because it was done without consulting him 
manigat alleged to be the armys candidate in juntarun 
elections last january has maintained that he rules independently 
namphys order had included the transfer of col jeanclaude 
paul commander of the largest unit in haitis 6000man army who 
was indicted on drug trafficking charges by a federal grand jury in 
florida earlier this year 
the constitution names the president as nominal commander in 
chief of the armed forces and the head of the army as effective 
commander in chief 
manigat took over on feb 7 from namphy as haitis chief 
executive namphy had been president of a ruling junta for exactly 
two years after presidentforlife jeanclaude duvalier fled to 
exile in france 
manigat met for four hours wednesday with the army general 
staff headed by namphy and obtained a statement from the general 
staff pledging allegiance to manigats civilian government and 
tentatively accepting manigats decision to overrule namphy 
according to local news reports 
manigats decree said that despite their pledge on wednesday 
namphy and other members of the general staff began to execute 
the order retiring and transferring officers 
it said their action is a sort of insubordination toward 
the constitutional commander in chief the president 
the communique said all members of the cabinet endorsed 
manigats action including defense minister williams regala 
regala was the other military member with namphy of the 
threeman junta that ruled haiti until manigat was inaugurated 
following elections in january 
manigats decision to rescind his top army commanders order 
resulted in the first crisis between his civilian government and 
the military which has traditionally held power in this 
improverished caribbean nation 
namphy had ordered col paul transferred as commander of the 
700man dessalines barracks the most feared army unit in haiti to 
assistant chief of staff a largely administrative post paul 
reportedly refused to accept the transfer 
it was unclear why namphy ordered the transfer whether it 
signified a power struggle within the army or whether the transfer 
was linked to the charges of drugrunning against paul who has 
denied the charges 
soldiers under pauls command were blamed for widespread 
violence against voters that forced cancellation of last novembers 
independently adminstrated general elections and left more than 30 
people dead 
gen nicolas who was the army chiefofstaff earlier this year 
accused the foreign press of singling out col paul 49 for 
attacks related to the drug allegations

charged 170 people as members of a huge international drug ring 
linked to panamas manuel noriega that dealt in more than 1 
billion worth of marijuana and cocaine 
noriega was not charged in the indictments which disclosed that 
that the panamanian strongman allegedly laundered profits from the 
sale of marijuana shipped to a louisiana shipyard 
this organization is sophisticated well orchestrated and 
rivals any multinational corporation us attorney joe cage 
said its sole motivation greed and money caused its scope and 
influence to transcend local national and international 
boundaries 
cage said the indictments resulted from the same federal 
investigation that led to noriegas indictment in florida on 
charges of laundering us drug money through panamanian banks 
if noriega had not been indicted already in florida in my 
opinion there would have been sufficient evidence for an 
indictment here said judith lombardino lawyer for the federal 
organized crime drug enforcement task force 
cage said the widespread 2yearold federal investigation 
extended into florida north carolina and michigan 
the indictment alleges that 170 people conspired to import 
nearly 15 million pounds of marijuana into the country of the 
170 more than 100 also are accused of traveling to lafayette to 
arrange the importation of 280000 pounds of marijuana 
cage said 500000 pounds of marijuana was imported to and 
distributed from lafayette and several thousand pounds of cocaine 
was flown to shreveport 
the louisiana investigation centered to a large extent on 
shipments of marijuana believed to have been unloaded at the 
intracoastal drydock and shipbuilding co on the vermilion river 
near the town of bancker la 
the federal grand jury charged abbeville la residents william 
e faciane and james c faciane both employees of the family owned 
shipyard with importing 500000 pounds of marijuana to the bancker 
site 
noriega is alleged to have laundered profits from the sale of 
280000 pounds of marijuana shipped there the indictment alleges 
cage refused to comment on any details of noriegas alleged 
involvement with the drug ring or whether colombias medellin 
cartel was involved in a federal indictment handed up feb 4 in 
miami noriega was charged with taking protection money from the 
cartel 
cage would not identify any of those indicted as ringleaders 
nor would he pinpoint a headquarters for the drug ring 
each and every individual named in the indictment allegedly 
played a vital role in the success of this organization there is 
no such thing as a minimal role in planning and executing a network 
of this size 
many of those charged in the 131page indictment were identified 
as john doe 
among those indicted are several foreign nationals believed to 
be involved in the systematic trafficking of marijuana and cocaine 
they include david arrana cesar cura vanderbilt bowie davis 
lucio cardona all of colombia 
edward gill bodden of the cayman islands felice napolitano 
of panama ed whyte a canadian citizen living in jamaica and 
carlos zayascastro of colombia and the cayman islands 
cage said several arrests have been made but he refused to say 
how many 
he said the federal governments organized crime drug 
enforcement task force headed up the investigation code named 
the bulldog 
the investigation resulted in the indictment of at least 82 
other people in the federal judicial districts in north carolina

after a storm of protests from private pilots 
and some members of congress the government has scaled back its 
proposed requirement for small planes to be equipped with 
altitudetracking equipment 
the federal aviation administration said thursday it would 
require small private planes to have altitudeencoding transponders 
if they fly near 138 airports and in some cases as far as 30 miles 
from the runway the devices provide air traffic controllers with 
altitude information about a specific plane on their radar screen 
only four months ago the faa said it was considering 
regulations that would ban small planes from all airspace within 40 
miles of 254 airports and above 6000 feet when not flying near an 
airport

the dimensions of the pentagon procurement 
bribery investigation are beyond the wildest imagination sen 
charles grassley told his colleagues friday while another senator 
called the matter the most serious case in the history of the 
department of defense 
president reagan said investigators waited until this week to 
tell him about the twoyear investigation of the alleged sale of 
confidential pentagon information to defense contractors through 
their paid consultants so that there would be no leaks the affair 
came to light when search warrants were issued and telephone taps 
disclosed 
reagan in an interview on public broadcasting services 
nightly business report said i think all of that was part 
of the need to keep it so absolutely secret that there wouldnt be 
any tipping off that then might allow some wrongdoers to escape and

taba egyptisrael border ap taba might be returned to egypt 
in a few months but for now its as israeli as a kibbutz it 
fact it is israel 
try popping over from egypts sinai peninsula for lunch at the 
plush 327room aviyasonesta beach hotel the only place that 
really counts in the tiny enclave claimed by both egypt and israel 
are you going to israel asked the egyptian policeman at the 
gate of a chainlink fence a few hundred yards from the 
whitepainted 10story hotel 
no just to that hotel 
that the policeman said is israel 
it took 30 minutes to complete paperwork required to get from 
the egyptian gate to a similar one 75 yards away where israeli 
customs inspectors waited 
lunch is delayed 90 minutes more 
did anybody in egypt give you anything to deliver in israel 
one of the israelis asked 
no i just want to have lunch in that hotel there 
did you buy anything in egypt that you didnt see being 
packed 
no i live in egypt i just want to have lunch in that hotel 
right there 
they didnt try to tell you in egypt that taba is not 
israels did they 
taba where nobody lives permanently and the hotel its guests 
and the beach are all that matters is a political curiosity left 
over from war 
at the extreme eastcentral edge of the sinai peninsula where 
the gulf of aqaba ends it fell to the israelis in the 1967 
arabisaraeli war the israelis pulled out of the rest of sinai in 
1982 in accordance with the peace treaty signed three years 
earlier but kept taba a squib of 250 acres just south of 
israels eilat and west of jordans aqaba both on the gulf of 
aqaba 
the crux of the competing claims is the location of marker 91 
the southernmost marker delineating britishmandated palestine in a 
1906 agreement between the british and the ottoman empires the 
egyptians say their maps show the marker generally where israels 
entry point is israels maps put it at the egyptian fence 
after years of contention egypt and israel agreed in september 
1986 to appoint arbiters to sit down in geneva and decide whether 
taba is extreme eastern sinai egypt or extreme southern israel 
both sides summed up their arguments in april and under the 
arbitration agreement a judgment should be issued by midsummer a 
final binding decision 
before the israelis came taba basically comprised a 
stoneandsand beach at the end of a desert wadi 
theres still precious little in taba besides the sonesta and 
rafi nelsons village a swimming facility with a pub and snack bar 
at the beach 
coiled barbed wire separates the hotels swimming pool and 
volleyball courts from the road a hill with a guard tower at the 
top commands one side of the hotel on the other side are 800 yards 
of gulf of aqaba beach and rafi nelsons village the employees of 
the hotel and the village live in eilat a mile or so away 
while on the face of it taba hardly seems worth the fuss it 
seems clear that both governments went to the wall for their claims 
with an eye to domestic politics 
egypts leaders have said repeatedly that israel will be ceded 
not one centimeter of egyptian land thus taba either must be 
returned or it must be adjudged not to be egyptian 
as for the israelis they too undoubtedly would find a binding 
legal verdict more palatable than a bilateral compromise publicly 
they say the enclave would be strategically critical for eilat 
should the egyptians the only arabs at peace with israel turn 
hostile again 
tabas guard tower is manned by the multinational force and 
observers an international group organized under the 1979 
usbrokered peace treaty which the arbitration agreement brought 
into the enclave for the first time 
the implication was that until sovereignty was determined the 
enclave would be a no mans land 
cairo never has told its people otherwise and they cant learn 
firsthand because their government has forbidden them to enter taba 
until the egyptian claim is vindicated 
as for the hotel owned by israeli eli papoushado and managed by 
the sonesta chain nobody wants to talk about what might happen if 
taba becomes egyptian its too sensitive an issue right now 
in the meantime western women occasionally doff bikini tops 
around the swimming pool and on the beach 
but one indication of what might happen in an egyptian taba are 
the signs at the gate going back to egypt 
no doffing of swimsuits at the egyptian beach they say

author robert daley knows that the 
quick grip of fear and splitsecond decisions that can make or 
break a cops career are not just the stuff of police fiction 
a former deputy commissioner of the new york city police 
department daley has grabbed the attention of readers on subjects 
ranging from treasure diving in florida to bullfighting in spain 
but is best known for his insiders tales of street crime and 
police bureaucracy 
during an interview at the converted cottage on his ridgefield 
estate where he does his writing the bestselling author of year 
of a dragon hands of a stranger and prince of the city 
explained how fact and fantasy merge in his latest novel man 
with a gun simon amp schuster 1995 
most of the incidents happened to me one way or the other but 
they didnt happen just that way daley said all of them have 
been extracted from the way they actually happened and moved 
together to make a story 
the story of man with a gun is loosely based on events 
surrounding the harlem mosque murder of 1972 when a police officer 
was killed during a confrontation between black muslims and 
authorities the book deals with the power and politics behind the 
police handling of a situation where every decision has longterm 
consequences 
in moments of terror you do what it seems like you have to do 
and no one is responsible for that daley said 
i made some mistakes which didnt seem like mistakes at the 
time he said of his involvement in the mosque riots 
daley and the central character in man with a gun phillip 
keefe are alike in many ways keefe is a deputy police 
commissioner and like daley resigns after the incident keefe is 
a former journalist daley worked for five years as a foreign 
correspondent for the new york times keefe drives a porsche so 
does daley 
however keefe is daley the author insists i have no ghosts 
to exorcise 
for one thing keefe is not a successful author daley has 20 
books to his credit five novels have been made into films and 
paul newman is slated to play the lead role in man with a gun 
in his novels the 57yearold daley aims to provide more than a 
mirror image of life literature should provide new insights into 
your own life into everybodys life a new understanding of what 
we are all up against he said 
novels about the police however tend to be grouped together as 
thrillers said daley who considers thrillers to be books with 
preposterous characters doing preposterous acts all the time 
thriller means discardable thriller means light 
entertainment thriller means not important he said the word 
denigrates what i am trying to do i think i am writing something 
else and keep getting accused of writing thrillers 
as an undergraduate studying literature at fordham university 
daley said he wanted to be the greatest writer that ever lived he 
has since lowered his goal to writing books that will stand the 
test of time 
translations of daleys books cram his closets i cant throw 
them away because they are books and books are icons samples of 
his photographic work decorate his walls 
daley bought a camera when the new york times offered to pay him 
15 extra for every photograph used in the newspaper his 
photographs have since been exhibited at the baltimore museum the 
art institute in chicago and the new york gallery of modern art 
but he prefers writing 
to me literature is the greatest of the arts because it takes 
you further outside yourself than any other he said adding 
theres also a practical side to his work i dont want to be 
poor i wouldnt give up the things we have in order to be a 
renowned writer that no one ever reads he keeps apartments in 
france and new york as well as his connecticut home where he lives 
with his wife 
currently working on a part personal memoir part history of 
france daley said he considers the time spent writing the book 
as a rest period from the pressures of producing what is expected 
of him 
i have to write something thats going to sell he said 
you get trapped in whatever it is that you are doing thats 
successful

foreign arms sales have been a quiet source of 
funds for chinas military establishment in the 1980s but for the 
government the deals can be a political minefield 
no sooner did controversy die down over chinas surprise sale of 
mediumrange missiles to saudi arabia than reports circulated that 
beijing was selling missile technology to argentina and pakistan 
and that pakistan used the technology to produce a missile capable 
of carrying nuclear warheads which would be a threat to india 
all sides denied the reports but they highlighted chinas 
growing role as an international arms merchant with increasingly 
sophisticated wares and seemingly few scruples about the buyers 
a case in point is chinas muchpublicized sale of silkworm 
missiles to iran after selling fighter planes to irans enemy iraq 
primarily a donor of small arms to african and southeast asian 
revolutionaries in the 1960s china has become the fourth largest 
weapons seller to the third world after the soviet union united 
states and france according to the us government 
china sold an estimated 15 billion worth of weapons in 1986 
and about 2 billion worth in 1987 according to us figures 
china does not release any figures and chinese officials refused 
to discuss arms sales 
china still lags far behind the worlds leading arms seller the 
soviet union which had 1986 sales of more than 15 billion but 
weapons make up an increasing share of chinese exports from less 
than 2 percent in 1978 to more than 5 percent last year 
for that it has mainly to thank the 8yearold iraniraq war it 
has sold 45 billion worth of arms to both sides according to 
us government estimates including the silkworms to iran that 
gave china its first taste of political backlash 
the united states last year briefly halted its program of 
expanding hightech sales to china to show its pique over the 
silkworms with which iran threatens persian gulf shipping china 
insists iran gets the silkworms from someone else 
iran in turn reportedly is unhappy over chinas recent sale of 
css2 missiles to saudi arabia substitutes for us f15 fighters 
that the us congress blocked 
the missiles have a range of 2200 miles and can be fitted with 
nuclear warheads iran with which saudi arabia recently severed 
diplomatic relations is a logical target 
missiles and other sophisticated weapons still account for only 
a small portion of chinas arms sales which consist mostly of 
small arms and field artillery however its tanks and fighter 
planes have become increasingly popular especially since china 
began upgrading them with british and italian technology 
pakistan a regular buyer of chinese aircraft replaces the 
engines in them with british ones 
foreign sources who keep watch on arms deals say sales abroad 
have helped fund weapons development for the chinese military 
whose share of the state budget dropped from 175 percent in 1979 
to less than 10 percent in 1986 as the government puts priority on 
economic development 
but china also is believed to be seeking influence and 
recognition as an important player in world trouble spots even at 
the cost of criticism 
chinas main customers are developing countries embroiled in 
regional conflicts and who dont want to depend solely on the 
soviet union or the united states thailand which buys most of its 
arms from the united states bought an estimated 10 million worth 
of tanks armored personnel carriers and artillery from china last 
year in part as a gesture of independence 
low prices speedy delivery and simple weapons design that can 
easily be maintained by lowtech third world armies are other 
attractions the tanks china sold thailand for example cost about 
200000 each less than onefifth the price of us tanks that 
thailand bought a few months later 
the chinese tanks were delivered within months of order the 
us tanks have yet to arrive

during their sevenyear marriage fred 
astaire often told his wife robyn people have taken advantage 
of me all my life try to see that it doesnt happen after im 
gone 
that has been mrs astaires consuming mission since the dancing 
actors death a year ago 
i didnt realize how difficult it would be she said 
everyone wants a piece of fred now 
she cited a hollywood boulevard operator who has been selling 
lifesize cutouts of astaire to be used in stores and amusement 
parks companies have tried to merchandise fred astaire lines of 
tuxedos jewelry and cologne robyn astaire has hired a lawyer to 
try to police such ventures and she is supported by new laws 
protecting the names and images of deceased celebrities 
mrs astaire is also disturbed by the use of her husbands name 
and works by companies or individuals who dont consult her such 
as the sale by mca to the disney channel of the astaire tv 
specials the only films that he owned he made his classic 
musicals while under contract to studios 
she doesnt rule out licensing of products that met the astaire 
standards of class 
fred wanted me to do that she said he was so afraid that 
he wouldnt be able to provide for me after he was gone you see 
when he turned 78 he decided it was time to put his affairs in 
order he never expected to marry again so he gave most of his 
wealth to his family keeping only what he needed to live on 
then he met robyn smith a lithe young jockey who had broken 
the sex barrier in thoroughbred racing they were married june 24 
1980 when he was 81 and she was 35 the marriage astonished 
hollywood and appalled freds sister adele and daughter ava but 
it endured 
mrs astaire recently talked about her life with fred at the 
hilltop home she shared with him it is unchanged as is she daily 
running keeps her 5foot7 frame at 106 pounds 
by the time we were married fred had done everything in his 
life more than once she related he was in a mood to relax 
and take it easy that was fine with me he was such an exciting 
person to be around that we didnt have to do a lot we just always 
had a lot of fun i know that 
i was happy with my life before that as with any athlete 
when you get into your 30s you are forced to retire everyone 
thinks youre over the hill when you turn 25 
besides fred wanted me to get out of the racing business 
because it was very dangerous i was ready to quit anyway but i 
made fred sell his horses because i wasnt about to let him run 
them if i couldnt ride 
fred and robyn astaire played some golf together and attended 
the latest movies always at 12 oclock at a neighborhood theater 
so he wouldnt be recognized she even had him watch his own 
movies at home 
i had never seen a fred astaire picture that i can remember 
she admitted i just wasnt interested in musicals when i was 
young i never realized what i had missed 
fred never liked watching himself in movies but i wanted to 
see them and they absolutely blew my mind at my insistence he 
started watching them with me he was so cute when i said oh 
darling its so spectacular hed say oh was it really good 
toward the end of his life he enjoyed watching the films which he 
had never allowed himself to do 
i wont dance goes the old astaire tune and he wouldnt do 
so after his last tv show at 70 but on their rare appearances at 
hollywood events fred danced with robyn and nightly after dinner 
they exited the dining room in a comic tango that convulsed the 
servants 
astaire was in perfect health until the last six months of his 
life she said he started losing weight and that alarmed her his 
doctors could find nothing wrong but robyn feared that he might 
develop pneumonia the killer of the aged 
i thought fred would live into his 90s she said his 
mother had died at 96 and he was just like his mother all of a 
sudden when he reached 86 he started to get weaker and weaker he 
wasnt ill his batteries were draining 
last june he developed pneumonia she drove him to century city 
hospital late at night to avoid public notice and entered him 
under his mothers maiden name his presence there was kept secret 
until his death on june 22 
for the past year mrs astaire has devoted herself to 
preserving her hubands rich legacy but she realizes she will need 
to start a life of her own next month she is enrolling in an 
intensive course at the university of california at los angeles to 
determine what kind of a career she should pursue 
she grinned i just hope the results dont show that the only 
thing im qualified for is to be a jockey

antiunion laws japanese work 
techniques and a scarcity of jobs have begun to transform britains 
oncemilitant labor unions 
singleunion and nostrike deals are spreading provoking a 
bitter fight among the countrys declining unions and threatening 
to split their umbrella organization the trades union congress 
the tuc 
in this ugly redbrick yorkshire city of 59000 a new 
93million plant being built jointly by cocacola co and cadbury 
schweppes plc is bringing 500 new jobs to a region where 
unemployment is 127 percent nearly 4 percentage points above the 
national average 
the plants work force will be represented by a single union 
where past practice would have meant each worker category would 
have had its own union 
but while that may be bad news for the 120yearold tuc it is 
no big issue in places like wakefield where the decline of 
traditional coal and textile industries makes getting a job much 
more important than defending union rights 
unions are on the way out said wakefields nigel bilton 22 
years old and unemployed i think unions should be abolished 
thirty singleunion deals 10 of which include nostrike 
provisions have been struck in british industry up from six 
singleunion deals and zero nostrike agreements five years ago 
according to the amalgamated engineering union aeu 
the number is growing we envision it doubling by the end of 
this year says john mann the unions research manager 
such deals under which one union represents all the workers at 
a plant and arbitration replaces strikes are expected to multiply 
even faster after a stunning defeat for the unions in scotland this 
past march 
japanese then american and now british companies have sought 
these new singleunion deals because they find it simpler and 
cheaper to negotiate with one union rather than several 
the 42000 workers at ford motor co in britain for example 
have 12 different unions 
ford has scrapped plans to build an electronics plant in dundee 
in scotland because it couldnt get its unions to accept the 
singleunion deal it had reached with the amalgamated engineering 
union 
the dramatic reversal scuttled what would have been fords 23rd 
british plant cost 450 new jobs and provoked widespread anger 
against what scottish secretary malcolm rifkind termed the unions 
neanderthal attitudes 
opponents of singleunion deals maintain however that one 
union cannot adequately represent a work force ranging from 
engineers to typists 
championing the new union deals are the 800000member aeu and 
the 360000member electrical electronic telecommunication and 
plumbing union eetpu 
membership in the 84union tuc has shrunk from 13 million to 9 
million since 1979 and the government can now boast that the days 
when britain could be crippled by strikes are over days lost to 
strikes have fallen from 29 million in 1979 to just 25 million in 
the year up to march 
unemployment is one reason but another is prime minister 
margaret thatchers legislation which forces unions to take strike 
votes and obtain a 55percent yesvote before calling a walkout 
the legislation also outlaws secondary picketing and no longer 
requires employers to recognize a union even if employees have 
chosen it in a vote 
the trades union congress is threatening to expel the eetpu 
electricians at its annual meeting in september over singleunion 
deals 
at the same time the eetpu is asking its members in a ballot 
whether to pull out of the tuc and talking to the aeu about joining 
forces to form their own breakaway organization that would take 
away oneninth of the tucs membership 
such a split in the union movement would change the face of 
industrial relations and have serious implications for the labor 
party the independent newspaper wrote 
the labor party is the main opposition to mrs thatchers 
conservative party government and the unions are the laborites 
power base 
the wakefield factory which is europes newest softdrink 
plant is going to mean a lot for the community of wakefield 
said mayor george parkinson 
dick croft a local official for the engineering union that will 
represent the wakefield plant workers said the community was lucky 
that coke and cadbury decided to have any union at all 
the new style has been introduced largely by egalitarianminded 
japanese companies that have abolished separate dress codes put in 
employee canteens and provided parking lots for hourly workers as 
well as for management 
they offer enticing wages in return for high productivity and 
shopfloor moderation british workers have embraced the change 
confounding those who accuse them of resisting change and upholding 
class distinctions 
norman willis the tucs general secretary argues that 
singleunion deals encourage damaging competition among unions for 
a smaller pool of members in the trade union movement 
the 135millionmember transport and general workers union 
britains largest also is a major opponent of the new style for 
pretty much the same reasons 
but up here in yorkshire the engineering unions croft said 
the world is changing we dont enjoy the same franchise we had a 
few years ago

costars james wilby graves costar last year in maurice as 
lady brendas hapless husband tony it opens in new york on june 
24 
im very pleased im afraid about the reaction that im 
getting its so nice to have ones work appreciated scott 
thomas said in an interview about her repeated raves from the 
british press 
while reviews were mixed for the movie as a whole critics 
hailed its female lead with the kind of accolades that banish 
anonymity forever 
alexander walker in the standard called the actress the films 
great find adding it will be criminal if british cinema 
doesnt make a great star of her 
hugh montgomerymassingberd in the daily telegraph and derek 
malcolm in the guardian both called her a revelation iain 
johnstone in the sunday times found the parisbased actress a 
singular sensation in a movie that has returned her in triumph to 
the country she left eight years ago 
i never really thought id be able to work in england so a 
handful of dust was an enormous pleasure and a great privilege 
said the 28yearold actress who dropped out of londons central 
school of speech and drama after a year to move to paris 
i was doing a teacher training course and hated it wanted to 
change and couldnt said scott thomas occasionally interrupting 
the interview to tend to the cries of her monthold daughter 
hannah 
i was told id never be an actress anyway and would never be 
able to play for real she said i thought it would be better 
to be totally miserable somewhere else and learn french at the same 
time 
in paris her life took a happier turn beginning with her 
marriage to a french obstetrician after drama training in french 
she began getting parts in theater and in movies and landed a role 
opposite the rock superstar prince in his second movie a bomb 
called under the cherry moon 
the film was not a financial success and was lampooned by 
critics however it enjoyed an international release charles 
sturridge the director of handful of dust and of the hit waugh 
tv adaptation brideshead revisited saw it and cast scott 
thomas as lady brenda 
she had studied the book at school and said she seized the 
chance to become part of the film 
i was sure it was going to be great she recalled before 
going back to the novel to immerse herself in lady brendas 
emotionally fatal attraction to the callow and cunning beaver 
she likes taking someone who is absolutely dreadful and 
turning him into this fascinating young man whom no one can 
understand what she sees in him scott thomas said explaining 
the fascination on which the films denouement depends it makes 
her different too 
in the end beaver is much worse than lady brenda ever thought 
he was really by then shes in too deep she said 
the daughter of an affluent naval officer who died when she was 
five scott thomas said she was bemused by the critique of the 
english class system that pervades the book and the film 
its quite sort of endearing really but it is ridiculous 
said scott thomas a graduate of the posh cheltenham ladies 
college its like some dear old piece of furniture that you like 
but you think is quite the most hideous thing in the world 
she hopes not to be typecast as aristocratic english swells and 
would like to do a french film next 
i live there and i want to work there you have to work hard 
and i really mean to work hard she said ive got to make sure 
that the revelation doesnt turn out to be a disaster

mountain parks and sunny beaches beckon 
americans by the millions in summer to pack up their lunches and 
picnic a seemingly simple meal however can pose a hazard if not 
properly prepared and handled 
sometimes it seems like the scientists are trying to take the 
fun out of everything with their warnings yet the department of 
health and human services reports that as many as one american in 
six will be the victim of food poisoning in an average year 
and nearly all of these cases are easily preventable with a 
little common sense say government food safety experts 
to get out that word the food and drug administration and the 
department of agriculture are testing a tollfree hotline for food 
safety questions this summer 
the test limited to the states of florida illinois and 
massachusetts will continue through august residents of those 
states can call 18004263758 from 10 am to 4 pm edt 
residents of other states may call the agriculture departments 
meat and poultry hotline 18005354555 
in general the common food safety rules apply keep hot foods 
hot and keep cold foods cold that means hot foods should be stored 
and served at 140 degrees fahrenheit or more cold foods at 45 
degrees or lower 
here are some suggestions from the usda 
shop with a plan pick up perishable items last so they can be 
taken home and refrigerated speedily 
you can pack nonperishable items the night before the picnic 
things like paper plates plastic utensils napkins potato chips 
and so forth bring along extra plastic bags for trash and garbage 
pack the cooler on the day of the picnic use plenty of ice and 
a wellinsulated cooler containing only the items that need to be 
kept cold such as hot dogs hamburgers salads eggs and the like 
make sure the foods are tightly wrapped 
uncooked hamburgers and other raw foods should be sealed in 
plastic bags or containers so juices cannot contaminate other items 
scrub vegetables and other items that may be eaten raw to 
remove parasites and germs as well as any insecticide that may have 
been sprayed on them 
at the picnic keep the cooler in the shade keep the lid 
closed and remove items only when they are needed 
hungry picnickers may urge speedy cooking if you have chicken 
chops or other items that take time to cook cook them at home in 
advance and then just reheat on the picnic grill to save time when 
reheating barbecue sauce will keep meats from drying out 
be sure to cook raw meats thoroughly foodpoisoning organisms 
can sometimes survive a short cooking time 
dont start cooking until people are ready to eat so food wont 
sit around when foods are left standing for two hours or so 
bacteria multiply rapidly 
keep lefotvers only if there is enough ice in the cooler to 
preserve them until you get home otherwise discard them

takes in children no one else wants the abused the abandoned the 
sickly the scarred it doesnt matter odo finds a place for each

his public life he urges others to do the same 
as ohios administrator for special adoptions odo works to find 
homes for children especially those hard to place he needed no

who share his 10bedroom home range from 6 years old to 22 
theyll be together fathers day but its just another day 
odo said there may be handmade gifts but the gifts he treasures 
most are his children 
the kids are my dreams he said they bring me a level of 
satisfaction and achievement you can take my life my money 
my car you can burn down my house you cant take away whatever i 
helped my kids achieve 
the achievements for some of the children include walking with 
crutches after doctors predicted lifetimes in wheelchairs or 
living when they were supposed to die 
if this seems like a miracle it isnt odo says love and 
stability are allimportant if it sounds inspirational it is 
if you have the capacity to raise and deal with all those 
children youre definitely a credible individual said coworker 
carol hectorharris someone who lives it as well as works it 
theyre believable 
odo says he is proof people neednt be mainstream america to 
adopt a child 
in a gray flannel world of buttondown bureaucrats odo 48 
favors kneehigh boots a knit skull cap and thick clanging silver 
bracelets ten golden earrings circle one ear a gold ring pierces 
a nostril and a jeweled stud sits smack dab at the center of his 
chin 
odo former civil rights activist and teacher originally 
planned to adopt children once he married when he was ready 
however he was still single and adoption posed many obstacles for 
a single black man 
after a long investigation odo received his first child a 
7yearold onearmed boy he had had seven placements in seven 
years he recalled he was emotionally scarred right to the 
heart but a survivor 
once when odo hoisted up his son up to a mirror the boy broke 
into tears odo thought he was hurting him then he found the 
problem 
he had always been told he would grow an arm odo said 
when he didnt grow an arm he stopped looking in the mirror 
that boy became odos pride he grew and made you grow too 
he recalled at 16 he played football and basketball had 
girlfriends and took college entrance exams 
but in 1982 an assailant stabbed the boy to death in new york

institution 
his childrens abilities vary some earn as and bs at school 
others never finish some help with the cooking and watch the 
younger children others are limited to simpler tasks such as 
sweeping floors 
odo had reservations as his family grew 
up to 12 or 15 kids after every kid id say no more id 
reach a point at where the kid had adjusted id think god there 
are so many kids out there weve gotten the routine down well i 
can take one more 
odo adopts sight unseen he reviews their records but says 
there is no way you can fabricate a meeting without the kid 
knowing youre shopping 
some of odos children had families unwilling or unable to care 
for them 11 of the children are siblings from five families 
others came from institutions 
odo never calls his children handicapped i consider labels to 
be cages he said if i say challenged the skys the limit 
that attitude motivates 
he was the first man who opened my world said son konata 
28 a social worker and freelance artist who lives in new york 
he was to me the ideal man successful very articulate 
he loved people he loved kids 
but odos no pushover 
he expects a lot from us said his 17yearold son 
kefentse he taught me selfrespect he taught me how to love 
you have to look at the person and see what they need hes 
broadened my horizons hes made a future for me 
the children share a tradition african names beginning with 
k odo composes a list of choices after they tell me what they 
want their names to say about them or their potential

odo is father mother teacher and friend after work he 
ignores the ringing of video games and the tv and maneuvers around 
wheelchairs and braces cluttering the hallway reprimanding one son

people have told me i should have help he said i want 
the children to feel its a family not an institution 
odo wakes up about 530 am and stuffs the first load of 
laundry into the machine he spends about 1600 a month to feed 
his huge family every three months he buys a cow for slaughter 
odo supports his family with his salary money from speaking 
engagements and government subsidies paid for his children 
i think every kid has the potential to do more than they have 
done he said if we give them the vehicle thats all ive 
been theyll make use of it some will be doing it better than 
others some will be doing it quicker than others all of them do 
it

more scientists in more countries are 
doing more research on aids than ever before but progress toward 
better treatments remains disappointingly slow 
i had a feeling during the year that wed see a little more 
movement on the treatment side said dr mervyn silverman 
president of the american foundation for aids research im a 
little bit disappointed in that 
silvermans comments were echoed by others as the fourth 
international conference on aids the largest aids meeting ever 
held ended last week 
seventhousand researchers from 140 countries had met to pore 
over 3200 research reports on acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
and its cause the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
more people are studying hiv than any other virus said 
david baltimore of the whitehead institute in cambridge mass 
aids research is a growth industry said silverman and 
id like to think with all that dedication there will be some 
breakthroughs 
no breakthroughs were announced in stockholm 
bo oberg of the karolinska institute in stockholm said more than 
50 experimental drugs were under development as possible aids 
treatments 
its hopeful that a large number of compounds are coming 
along he said but its going to be complicated to evaluate 
them 
as of june 1 the world health organization had received reports 
of 96433 aids cases from around the world double the number 
reported at the time of the third international conference on aids 
held in washington dc a year ago 
jonathan mann director of whos aids program estimated that 
the actual number of aids cases in the world was closer to 150000 
and that another 150000 cases would occur this year 
at least 5 million people are infected with the aids virus and 
as many as several hundred million people are engaging in behavior 
that puts them at risk of aids mann said 
in the united states alone new aids cases are being reported at 
the rate of one every 14 minutes said dr james curran of the us 
centers for disease control in atlanta 
curran who updates the us statistics each year at the 
international aids conference seemed painfully aware of the human 
toll that those figures represent its getting harder every 
year he said 
standing in the cavernous main hall at the stockholm convention 
center curran looked up at two enormous quilts suspended from the 
ceiling each with a score of panels bearing the names of aids 
victims its even harder to have the predictions turn out 
right he said 
the aids research effort has matured curran said providing a 
solid foundation of knowledge on the virus and the epidemic but he 
said thornier questions remain to be answered 
more people are getting involved in prevention and behavior 
research but still not enough he said theres a gap in 
understanding of sexual behavior and intravenous drug abuse 
such research is crucial because as a swedish aids publication 
said last week knowledge is the only vaccine we have 
azt also known as zidovudine or retrovir remains the only drug 
thats been shown to improve the lot of people with aids or pwas 
as theyre often called 
with azt weve improved the quality of life and extended 
survival said dr margaret fischl of the university of miami 
she too said she was disappointed by the pace of drug research 
dr samuel broder of the national cancer institute a leader in 
the us governments effort to devise newer and safer aids drugs 
had a different view 
there is more drug development and more progress against the 
aids virus than against any other virus known he said half a 
dozen drugs look especially promising and are under intensive 
development he said 
the disappointment that some researchers expressed reflected a 
sense of frustration of the urgency of the problem he said 
we all have a sense of urgency to come up with safe and 
effective ways of handling the aids virus as long as we have one 
patient who will die of aids we havent made enough progress 
if the development of drugs to treat aids is tough the 
development of a vaccine to prevent aids is tougher still dr 
jonas salk the polio vaccine pioneer and dr daniel zagury the 
courageous french researcher who in 1986 injected himself with an 
experimental aids vaccine both reported encouraging plans and 
little progress toward an aids vaccine 
attempts to vaccinate chimpanzees against aids have largely 
failed various researchers reported 
we should not despair said reinhard kurth of the paul 
erlich institute in frankfurt west germany many avenues have 
not been tried yet 
one important development welcomed at the conference was the 
finding that a new aids test called the polymerase chain reaction 
test or pcr is apparently much more sensitive and accurate than 
any existing test 
the test which can detect even very small amounts of the aids 
virus will assist researchers studying the development of aids in 
infected individuals 
and if its effectiveness is confirmed in subsequent studies the 
test may be critical to the detection and treatment of aids in 
infants researchers said 
infants born to infected mothers carry aids antibodies that they 
have acquired in the womb but not all actually acquire the virus 
yet because all of them have antibodies to the virus antibody 
tests cannot reveal which are infected and which arent 
the pcr could provide the first definitive diagnosis of aids in 
infants the number of such unfortunate babies is growing as aids 
spreads among drug abusers 
this years aids conference was somewhat unusual in that 
participants were regularly reminded that the object was to cure 
sick people not merely to advance an intellectual enterprise 
many medical conferences are rather impersonal affairs in which 
science is discussed on a lofty plane and the immediate concerns of 
patients are left to another place and time 
at this conference however a variety of talks dealt with the 
importance of taking care of patients 
ive been critical of some meetings in the past because 
patient care hasnt been important said dr constance wofsy of 
san francisco general hospital and i think thats important 
dr anthony pinching of st marys hospital medical school in 
london brought the concerns of patients to center stage 
emphasizing that doctors have much to learn from them 
they are the most important teachers pinching said and 
if we listen there is hope

it was a goofy daffy idea a mickey mouse 
notion if ever there was one to combine cartoon characters with 
human actors in a big budget film 
the walt disney co is taking a gamble that might have given 
pause to even its risktaking founder who framed roger rabbit 
reaches the nations screens wednesday after three years of 
planning and production and an estimated 40 million in costs 
its a project that combines a 1940s privateeye caper with just 
about every cartoon character in film history 
the movie stars bob hoskins christopher lloyd and joanna 
cassidy plus mickey mouse bugs bunny dumbo daffy duck betty 
boop donald duck and two cartoon newcomers the comic roger rabbit 
and his sexpot wife jessica 
in the film a downattheheels detective hoskins is hired by 
a cartoon studio boss to uncover why his star roger rabbit is 
unable to perform hoskins discovers the stars voluptuous wife is 
being blackmailed as part of an elaborate scheme to take over the 
cartoon studio to make way for real estate development and a 
freeway 
the project originated from a book by gary k wolf who 
censored roger rabbit which an earlier disney regime bought for 
a feature film a rising young director robert zemeckis read the 
script in 1982 and was interested in making the film but the 
disney company beleaguered by flops and takeover threats was 
unable to mount the production 
four years later zemeckis had already directed the hits 
romancing the stone and back to the future and disney had 
been revitalized by new management the company enlisted steven 
spielberg as a partner and he showed the script to zemeckis in the 
winter of 1985 
the first thing we had to do was decide whether in fact we 
could make the movie said zemeckis who resembles an overgrown 
kid at 37 it had never been done before 
so we asked disney for permission to do a test a 30second 
obstacle course for roger richard williams animated it and ilm 
industrial light and magic did the optical work when it was 
finished we were all astounded and there was no doubt that we 
were going forward 
one of the prerequisites that i laid down to do the movie was 
that it really needed all the cartoon characters from the other 
studios 
spielberg was the spark plug in acquiring the clearances 
zemeckis bypassed the disney animation department and hired 
williams a canadian as animator williams had made a number of 
imaginative films including the 1971 academy awardwinning a 
christmas carol and done the pink panther animation 
bob told me he wanted the disney articulation warners 
characters and tex avery humor but not so brutal williams 
said avery was the gifted animator of bugs bunny and other farout 
characters 
in other words we should aim for believability but it could 
be zany williams and his staff faced the challenge of developing 
the title character after all rabbits had already been cartoon 
stars from walt disneys oswald of the 1920s to bugs bunny 
theres an awful lot of oswald in roger said williams he 
has the little overalls and hes a white rabbit oswald was 
shorter so we had to stretch him out with the red overalls white 
rabbit and blue bow tie he became like an american flag 
originally scenes including both humans and animated characters 
were to occupy 40 minutes of the film the final amount was 58 out 
of the 103minute running time 
we knew we had to have great actors that was the key to it 
zemeckis said thats why it was important to cast someone like 
bob hoskins who is first and foremost a great actor he had not 
only to do his performance but simultaneously imagine the cartoon 
performance plus all the technical things eyelines marks and 
the pantomime that he had to do 
hoskins was aided by charles fleischer a standup comic who 
played roger rabbits voice 
charlie stood offcamera and gave me rogers lines said the 
british actor that was a big help so was playing with those 
little dolls they dreamed up 
zemeckis provided the actors with charactersize dolls to act 
with and had extensive storyboards to illustrate how the scenes 
would look at the end of each completed scene another reference 
take was filmed as an aid to animators who would draw in the 
characters 
the exterior live action of roger rabbit was filmed in los 
angeles beginning in december 1986 interior sets were built at 
londons elstree studio many of them 10 feet off the stage floor 
to accommodate puppeteers working with robot arms and wires 
zemeckis edited the film scene by scene and handed the material 
over to williams and his animators 
previewers have marveled at how masterfully the live actors 
combine with the cartoon figures 
we did it by violating the rules williams explained 
fortunately i never knew the rules 
the old way of doing it was to lock the camera and light the 
live actors flat because the animation would be flat why just 
before roger rabbit i did a couple of fanta soft drink 
commercials for overseas using disney characters i shot the live 
action myself running the camera through a bunch of kids playing 
football then i animated mickey and donald running with the ball 
through the kids legs it wasnt supposed to work but it did 
totally 
it was a little more work to make the animated characters 
compensate for the perspective i told bob just to shoot his scenes 
with wideangle cameras and wed just draw in the characters to 
fit the space we tried it and it worked 100 percent 
having devoted three years of his life to roger rabbit 
zemeckis plans to vacation this summer he plans to take his wife 
and son to hawaii and spend the rest of the time at home 
his next movie 
a nice film with live actors and no special effects he said

producer steven spielberg was able to land 
bugs bunny betty boop woody woodpecker porky pig and daffy duck 
but he couldnt get popeye olive oyl or felix the cat 
it was all part of the difficult task of acquiring rights to 
famous cartoon characters from five studios to appear in the movie 
who framed roger rabbit its a cinematic first 
i dont think anyone else in hollywood except steven spielberg 
could have done it said director robert zemeckis 
because of the nature of the project and who was involved it 
wasnt as complicated as it might have been once we landed the 
warners characters bugs bunny daffy duck porky pig everyone 
else came on board 
since spielberg produced goonies the color purple and 
other moneymakers for warner bros getting bugs bunny and other 
warners cartoon stars into the fold was a relatively easy sell 
the 40 million movie is a project from the walt disney cos 
touchstone pictures so using the beloved disney animated 
characters was no problem spielberg is an executive producer 
he was able to enlist woody woodpecker from universal betty 
boop from paramount and the mgm stable but he hit a roadblock on 
popeye and olive oyl who declined the project on orders from their 
copyright owners king features spielberg also couldnt snare the 
pioneering felix whose origins date to 1914 
contracts for use of the cartoon characters were voluminous 
they are very important stars at their own studios said 
zemeckis the companies wanted to know who the animators would 
be and they supervised the designs they really look out for those 
characters 
naturally they wanted to be sure their stars would not be 
portrayed in anything derogatory such as drug dealing but of 
course we would never do anything like that 
the major restriction on disney was that the loanout stars 
could not be featured in advertising they are included in the 
films credits but cannot be used in commercials not to worry 
the studio has a few characters of its own to use 
on the whole the other studios were very cooperative giving 
us style sheets to guide our animators said richard williams 
who directed the animation 
but i had plenty of style sheets myself having collected them 
over the years from many different sources 
not all the cartoon stars for which rights were obtained ended 
up in who framed roger rabbit mgms tom and jerry were 
casualties of the cutting room 
but at least 15 of them ended up with speaking parts including 
daffy duck tweety bird bugs bunny porky pig and sylvester all 
mel blancs voice and betty boop mae questel yosemite sam joe 
alaskey mickey mouse wayne allwine goofy tony pope minnie

at his final round of economic summitry 
president reagan will challenge his colleagues to deny hijackers a 
refuge and to make it harder for drug dealers to keep their 
illgotten profits 
economic problems will be the primary focus as the leaders of 
the worlds seven industrial democracies gather this week in 
toronto 
but as they have tended to do over the years the leaders 
probably will be looking to a number of other concerns such as 
international trouble spots and eastwest relations in the wake of 
the moscow summit 
such topics usually come up over meals when the leaders have a 
chance to talk informally officials say 
reagan in a recent address sketching his goals for the summit 
said he will ask the leaders of canada britain france italy 
japan and west germany to join together to attack the lifeblood 
of one trade that should never be part of international trade the 
international narcotics trade 
at this summit we should join in a common offensive against 
money laundering and the flow of drug profits through the worlds 
financial institutions reagan said through the socalled 
practice of money laundering drug dealers transfer their 
illegal profits through legitimate banks 
secretary of state george shultz has expressed hope the united 
states will be able to enlist the leaders in a broad and 
comprehensive effort on the problem 
shultzs top economics adviser undersecretary of state allen 
wallis said that he expected a general discussion of the whole 
drug problem from beginning to end at the conference 
treasury secretary james baker iii said that he hoped the summit 
could find a way to improve our cooperation on halting the 
money laundering as well as improving exchanges of intelligence 
information to battle the drug problem 
but for all the attention the issue may receive at the summit 
like many other matters the outcome is uncertain 
john d steinbruner the director of foreign policy studies at 
the brookings institution in washington said the drug issue is 
emerging as the hottest immediate political topic but nobody quite 
knows what to do about it 
i think there will be a lot of debate but not much 
resolution steinbruner said 
on a related subject shultz said he intended to use the summit 
to discuss the drug trafficking of panamanian gen manuel antonio 
noriega who was indicted earlier this year in florida on narcotics 
charges us economic sanctions designed to help drive noriega 
from power have not borne fruit 
asked whether a new plan was in the works shultz said we 
dont have a new plan to get him out of panama but we can 
certainly describe to the leaders and have his association with 
drug dealing and the great undesirability of having a person who is 
that prominent in a country associated with drug dealing 
terrorism is another topic expected to be discussed this week 
at last years venice summit the leaders basically reiterated a 
statement reached at the tokyo summit in 1986 that condemns 
states that deal with terrorists 
but this time shultz said he expected the seven leaders to 
exercise the noplacetohide doctrine and to call on all 
countries around the world to deny fuel to airplane hijackers 
the idea is to prevent hostageholders from taking off with 
their victims shultz said at a us information agency telecast 
and a white house briefing last week 
its a specific thing that if given broad endorsement might be 
helpful the secretary said 
shultz also predicted a serious discussion of a multilateral aid 
package for the philippines and said western leaders were expected 
to talk about assisting afghan refugees who are attempting to 
resettle in their nation as the soviet invaders withdraw 
reagan in his recent speech discussed aid to restore the 
economies of warravaged afghanistan and the philippines but 
reagan said the philippines need aid because of its communistled 
insurrection and made no mention of the countrys money woes in 
the wake of the fall of longtime president ferdinand marcos 
on south africa shultz indicated that the united states would 
resist any discussion of imposing stiffer economic sanctions on the 
country that practices racial segregation 
we dont see here in the united states that it is a good idea 
to go further shultz said 
wallis of the state department said the leaders also are 
expected to quiz reagan about his experiences from his meetings 
with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
they will want to sound out the president on his visit to 
moscow the state department official said 
and if they have the time the leaders are expected to try a 
novel approach and talk about the future both about problems they 
foresee and ways to deal with them 
this is an experiment we havent done this before wallis 
said explaining that while summit planners have attempted to make 
time for such a topic before it has never been accomplished

for more than two decades the gas 
chamber at san quentin prison has been idle while california built 
up one of the nations largest death row populations 
for those 231 prisoners all of them men the countdown has 
begun 
the cases are moving along now said gary mullen executive 
director of the california district attorneys association the 
states foremost prosecutors organization we expect that in the 
near future probably before the end of the year there will be a 
death penalty case that will be cleared all the way through the 
state supreme court 
there has been a dramatic change in the state court adds 
john meehan district attorney of alameda county and one of the 
states foremost death penalty experts an execution could occur 
by the end of this year or the beginning of next year 
throughout the nation 100 people have been executed since the 
us supreme court allowed states to restore the death penalty in 
1976 so far only 12 of the 37 states with capital punishment laws 
have resumed executions of the 25 states which have not 
california has the largest deathrow population 
this year the california supreme court reversed one of its most 
important earlier rulings that impeded executions declaring that a 
killer can be put to death even if there was no intent to murder 
the ruling marked a sharp departure from the philosophy of the 
previous supreme court dominated for a decade by the liberal 
appointees of former gov jerry brown his chief justice rose 
bird was removed from office by voters in 1986 along with two 
liberal colleagues 
in one year the new court under chief justice malcolm lucas has 
affirmed more than a dozen death sentences compared to four death 
sentences affirmed during the 10year tenure of the bird court 
the court now is controlled by a 52 majority appointed by 
republican gov george deukmejian who as a state senator sponsored 
the 1977 death penalty act 
under california law all death sentences are automatically 
reviewed by the state supreme court if the state high court 
affirms the decision the death sentence is appealed directly to 
the us supreme court followed by a second round of challenges 
raising issues not addressed previously and often focusing on the 
competency of the defendants original attorney the litigation 
commonly takes years 
there has been a dramatic turnaround said mullen i think 
the state supreme court has become more mainstream 80 percent of 
californians support the death penalty according to polls 
the death penalty cases are speeding along said michael 
laurence a san francisco attorney who handles death penalty 
appeals it was difficult before because you are working uphill 
for a person who has already been convicted and sentenced to death 
now its a little more difficult 
californias legislature moved quickly to restore capital 
punishment following the us supreme courts 1976 ruling that 
permitted executions to resume 
a narrow death penalty bill sponsored by deukmejian was 
approved by the legislature in 1977 and vetoed by brown the 
legislature for the first time overrode browns veto 
in november 1978 california voters approved a death penalty 
initiative extending capital punishment to accomplices and other 
types of murders not covered by deukmejians legislation most of 
the controversial state supreme court rulings dealing with the 
penalty have focused on the meaning and constitutionality of the 
initiative 
depending upon the course of their respective court battles the 
next to die will probably be one of three killers robert alton 
harris of san diego stevie lamar fields of los angeles or earl 
lloyd jackson of long beach 
they are regarded as the furthest along said bob gore a 
spokesman for the state corrections department as to which one 
it will be right now we cant say 
prosecutors led by alameda county district attorney john 
meehan a death penalty expert believe the most likely prospect is 
harris who gunned down two teenagers in north san diego county 
after stealing their car for a 1978 bank robbery after the 
killings harris calmly munched hamburgers hed taken from his 
victims according to court testimony from an accomplice 
fields kidnapped tortured raped and killed a university of 
southern california librarian jackson raped and murdered two women 
in their 80s on successive nights 
executions were common in california for more than a century 
with 502 people put to death by rope or by gas between 1851 and 
1967 
the last to die was sacramento copkiller aaron mitchell who 
was executed at san quentin while jerry brown led a candlelight 
vigil outside the prison ronald reagan then the states governor 
and his clemency secretary edwin meese iii declined to intervene 
to block the execution 
californias two most notorious killers cultist charles manson 
and sirhan sirhan the assassin of robert f kennedy are not on 
death row since their crimes occurred prior to 1972 when the 
capital punishment statute was overturned 
perhaps the two most famous california executions were those of 
caryl chessman and barbara graham 
chessman the red light bandit who committed 17 crimes 
during a 20day los angeles spree in 1948 went to his death 
smiling on may 5 1960 a prolific author and jailhouse lawyer 
chessman captured international attention as he evaded eight 
execution dates in 1961 the ucla law review called chessmans 
court battle the most extensively litigated case in the annals of 
american criminal law 
chessman was executed for kidnapping and robbery not murder 
under current law criminals can only be executed if the crime 
involves a death 
graham known in the press as babs the party girl was 
executed in 1955 for the murder of an elderly invalid woman her 
two accomplices were also put to death in a tripleexecution day at 
san quentin 
grahams odyssey from petty theft to murder was depicted in the 
1958 movie i want to live starring susan hayward she won an 
oscar for the performance

downturns ever this week in a trend that could continue until 
drought conditions ease according to beef industry sources 
id say its a complete collapse of the feeder cattle 
market said omaha cattle feeder bob gottsch weather will be 
the determining factor in the forseeable future 
its just kind of panic selling theres been some panic and 
fear come back into the marketplace gottsch said thursday 
gottsch and others in the industry said cattlemen fear that a 
continued decline in prices combined with high grain prices 
caused by drought conditions will erase their profits and begin 
to cause losses 
cattle prices remain at nearrecord levels 70 per 100 pounds 
but cattlemens costs for feed are rising just as fast 
if it doesnt rain for the next three weeks id say prices 
could go to 65 with a danger of 60 on fat cattle gottsch said 
fat cattle are animals that have been fed and are ready for 
slaughter at packing houses 
gottsch said corn prices now 250 per bushel may rise to 4 
per bushel and soybeans may hit 12 to 15 per bushel up from the 
current 9 he said nearly all producers and feeders would lose 
money on cattle at those prices 
in direct sales to packing houses on wednesday prices paid to 
eastern nebraska cattle feeders for steers and heifers started the 
day 1 lower and finished 2 to 3 lower the us department of 
agriculture reported 
it marked the sharpest oneday price decline ever usda

technical rally

a level to stabilize and then straighten up he said but its

federal authorities have revised their 
charges against fallen carpetcleaning whiz kid barry minkow by 
filing a superseding indictment that adds conspiracy and 
creditcard fraud counts to the original case 
the revised 57count indictment filed thursday names the 
22yearold minkow and three other defendants as participants in an 
alleged conspiracy to commit securities fraud obtain funds 
fraudulently and falsify legal documents 
the new indictment also alleges that minkows illegal conduct 
began when the entrepreneur who founded the zzzz best 
carpetcleaning empire was 18 years old at least two years 
earlier than previously disclosed 
an added count of credit card fraud alleges that as early as 
october 1984 minkow devised and participated in a scheme to 
defraud by making unauthorized charges to creditcard numbers of 
zzzz best customers 
minkow allegedly obtained more than 29800 from 16 customers 
through the creditcard scheme 
minkows defense attorney david kenner could not immediately 
be reached for comment but at a news conference a week ago kenner 
declared that his client was a fall guy nothing more than a 
stepchild of organized crime 
a racketeering count which carried a 20year maximum sentence 
has been deleted from the new charges 
assistant us attorney james asperger said the racketeering 
count allowed federal authorities to seize minkows assets but 
asperger said those assets have become tied up in us bankruptcy 
court 
the prosecutor said the revised indictment increases the maximum 
prison term minkow faces if convicted from 350 years to 403 years 
the original indictment which was unsealed jan 15 charged 
minkow and 10 other defendants with 54 counts of bank fraud money 
laundering tax fraud and racketeering a 12th defendant was named 
in a separate complaint 
most of the previously filed counts are included in the new 
case although all but the four remaining defendants have pleaded 
guilty or are expected to do so before trial 
minkow founded his zzzz best carpetcleaning company in his 
parents garage in suburban reseda when he was just 15 
four years later in 1985 he incorporated the business and the 
zzzz best co became a publicly traded firm in the overthecounter 
market in january 1986 
however the revised indictment alleges that as early as march 
1985 minkow and other defendants falsely claimed zzzz best was 
performing restoration work on buildings damaged by water fire and 
other causes 
at its height the restoration work purportedly comprised over 
90 percent or 437 million of zzzz bests annual revenues the 
indictment states in fact zzzz best performed virtually no 
restoration work 
when accusations concerning the fraudulent nature of minkows 
carpet restoration work began surfacing in may 1987 the indictment 
alleges minkow orchestrated a coverup in which he recruited 
various persons to lie to attorneys accountants and others who 
were investigating the zzzz best carpetcleaning company

a top administration official acknowledged 
today that the united states is facing intense opposition in its 
efforts to eliminate farm subsidies worldwide but he said the fact 
the matter was even being discussed was encouraging 
at the sevennation economic summit which begins sunday in 
toronto president reagan will again propose an elimination of what 
he calls the farms race the 150 billion industrial countries are 
spending every year to subsidize agricultural products 
treasury secretary james a baker iii said today in a broadcast 
interview with foreign journalists that the farm subsidy issue 
would receive a fullfledged discussion at the threeday summit 
baker said the united states hoped to receive a commitment from 
the other countries to move forward with negotiations begun two 
years ago as part of worldwide trade liberalization talks he said 
this would be similar to a pledge made last month by 24 industrial 
countries at a paris meeting 
however that statement was seen as a major defeat for the 
united states delegation led by baker because america had 
originally wanted much tougher language committing the countries to 
working for a specific date for the scrapping of subsidies 
but baker today disputed the contention that no progress had 
been made in paris 
the fact that we are even discussing this very difficult 
problem of agricultural subsidies represents progress he said in 
an interview made available to overseas broadcasters by the us 
information agency 
it is not going to be at all easy to move toward eliminating 
subsidies or reducing subsidies for any of us unless we are all 
able to go to our farmers and say the world is going to do this 
he said 
the united states is hoping to keep the pressure on so that hard 
bargaining to end protectionism in agriculture can take place at a 
montreal trade meeting in december 
the montreal meeting will be a midterm review for the current 
round of global trade talks which were launched in 1986 in uruguay 
and scheduled to end in 1990 
the united states wants trade negotiators to prepare a detailed 
outline at the montreal meeting of what they intend to accomplish 
between this year and the scheduled end of the uruguay round of 
trade talks two years from now the united states wants the outline 
to state as a goal the phase out of subsidies by a date certain 
probably the year 2000 
while this will be the us stand in toronto it is likely that 
the leaders will instead adopt a less ambitious statement similar 
to one adopted last month at a paris meeting of the organization 
for economic cooperation in which the summit countries pledged to 
work for reduction of the subsidies rather than totally scrapping 
them 
all countries agree in principal that farm subsidies are a major 
drain on their treasuries but europeans claim that political 
pressures make it impossible to totally eliminate farm support 
programs 
instead they are arguing for an effort to reduce the subsidies 
to a less costly level perhaps onehalf of where supports are 
currently 
president reagan isnt going to be there to implement the 
elimination of the subsidies so he can hang tough but other 
foreign leaders who may want to run for reelection again see his 
approach as far too radical said robert z lawrence an 
economist at the brookings institution a washington research 
organization 
the battle over food subsidies has been a highly contentious 
trade issue for several years as countries have waged costly 
battles to support their own farmers 
the food glut has occurred in part because of various advances 
in developing new and improved crop strains which occurred as many 
countries decided in the past two decades that they wanted to be 
selfsufficient in farm production 
western europe the worlds largest food importer in 1970 is 
now second to the united states in the amount of food it exports 
the united states is still the worlds largest exporter of farm 
commodities accounting for roughly 40 percent of the volume of 
wheat and feed grains sold on world markets but since reaching a 
record of 417 billion in 1981 us farm exports steadily 
declined for five years falling to a low of 266 billion in 1986 
they posted a slight increase to 29 billion in 1987 
with the drop in us agricultural sales abroad has come a rise 
in foreign farm shipments to this country the traditional trade 
surplus america runs in farm products has shrunk from 266 billion 
in 1981 to just 65 billion last year 
the reagan administrations push to reduce farm subsidies 
through trade negotiations has generated very little reaction among 
farm lobbying groups in this country 
a recent review of the situation by the general accounting 
office said that many farm groups believe the us proposal is a 
good negotiating strategy but believe it is highly unrealistic to 
think that countries would totally dismantle their domestic support 
programs 
but the issue is unlikely to go away because of the cost of the 
programs in government spending and higher food prices to consumers

the big game for money managers on wall street 
these days is not investing but something called asset 
allocation 
this is not just the substitution of a fancy phrase for a simple 
word to make the subject sound more elaborate 
it is a different approach to the business of managing pension 
funds and other large pools of money that comes close to the heart 
of the recent debate over computerized program trading the 
collapse of stock prices last fall and the future of the market 
to put it in simplest terms asset allocation involves the 
effort to spread and shift money among various categories of 
investments for the greatest possible return 
the three main categories of financial investments in the us 
markets are stocks bonds and short term interestbearing 
securities such as treasury bills that are known in wall street 
parlance as cash 
the philosophy behind this as described by the brokerage firm 
of kidder peabody amp co in a treatise on our position on 
financial market reform is that the asset allocation decision 
the choice of the proportions of the portfolio to hold in stocks 
bonds or cash is of greater importance than the stock selection 
decision 
these new asset allocation strategies consider the us 
equity market in aggregate 
active management is employed in shifts between stocks bonds 
and cash but passive management may be used within each category 
of assets 
passive management means not trying to beat the performance of a 
given market but rather simply seeking to duplicate it 
in the case of stocks that may translate into buying a fund or 
package of stocks set up to duplicate the performance of a market 
index such as standard amp poors 500stock composite index 
when you get seriously into the process of asset allocation 
program trades and stock index and bond index futures are the 
mechanisms whereby exposure to each asset class are most easily 
adjusted kidder peabody said 
what could be wrong with all this many pension managers 
sensibly enough stopped trying to pick individual stocks when they 
were confronted with studies showing they had little chance of 
beating the market that way they were just too big 
brokerage firms developed program trading the index futures 
strategy known as portfolio insurance and other asset allocation 
systems in large measure to try to meet the needs and desires of 
those pension managers who are some of the brokers most important 
customers 
in addition the growth of international investing has 
contributed to the popularity of asset allocation and index 
investing 
as kidder peabody says many global investors view a countrys 
stock market as a single unit and prefer to trade it as such 
buying and selling individual stock issues when an investment in a 
foreign market is desired can be a very inefficient and costly 
means of active international investing 
the problem some people have with all this is the lumping of all 
stocks together as a single market that can be bought and sold 
making stocks no more distinguishable from one another than bushels 
of corn or sheets of plywood 
if everybody practices asset allocation and nobody cares about 
individual corporate earnings or dividends then the market would 
logically stop fulfilling its role as a means of promoting and 
rewarding business success 
we are at the point that traditional equities investors will 
capitulate control of the equities market to the futures traders 
said william king at nikko securities international 
raymond f devoe jr at legg mason wood walker inc maintains 
the function of financial markets is not to provide a private 
hunting preserve where large institutions can get in or out quickly 
with minimum costs 
the real function of the markets is to raise necessary capital 
and to allocate it in the most efficient productive way and there 
the markets are failing badly

fourteen arab air carriers and five financial 
institutions have agreed to form a consortium to purchase up to 220 
new planes the chairman of the kuwait airways corporation said 
ahmed mishari said thursday that studies by the consortium show 
a need for the aircraft by the year 1995 
mishari who also chairs the projects steering committee said 
the consortium will be named the arab aviation finance company and 
will be formally inaugurated in 1989 
in an interview he said the group was in the process of 
selecting a consulting firm to conduct a feasibility study for the 
purchases which could cost up to 10 billion 
aviation sources who declined to be identified by name said most 
of arab aircraft purchases in the coming decade would be from 
boeing co and the european airbus consortium 
in addition to mishari steering committee members include the 
chairmen of the national airlines of jordan and morocco the 
secretarygeneral of the arab air carriers organization and 
representatives of five banking establishments 
they are the national bank of kuwait the international gulf 
bank the gulf investment establishment the arab banking 
establishment and the arab bank for international investment 
mishari said 50 of the new aircraft will be needed to meet 
expansion plans while the other 170 planes will replace aging 
aircraft 
mishari said that the venture was prompted in large part by the 
aggressiveness of foreign airlines that sought to control the arab 
market

housing construction plummeted 122 percent in 
may the steepest drop in five months the government said today 
the commerce department said the drop dragged construction 
activity down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 138 million 
units in may the lowest level since january when 2000 fewer 
units were begun 
it was the steepest drop since december when starts plunged 
158 percent they had fallen again in january by 12 percent 
before posting increases of 99 percent 07 percent and 31 
percent in february march and april respectively 
the huge may decline suprised analysts who had been expecting 
only a modest decline because of rising mortgage interest rates 
rates on 30year fixedrate mortgages climbed from 1005 
percent at the start of april to 1058 percent at the end of may 
according to the federal home loan mortgage corp they eased 
slightly in the first weeks of june 
however some analysts had said the growing popularity of 
adjustable rate mortgages would curb the effect of rising longterm 
rates an increase of a half percentage point from 100 percent to 
105 percent would boost a homebuyers monthly payment on a 
30year 100000 mortgage by about 37 
economists watch housing activity closely because it is often a 
harbringer of the direction of the economy as a whole however 
they cautioned against overreacting to one months report 
if we got two three four months of backtoback declines 
then it would give plenty of reason for concern because a 
pretty big size slice of the economy is tied to housing said 
john savacool an economist with the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa forecasting service i expect to see some sort of recovery 
in june and july 
construction of singlefamily homes dropped 92 percent in may 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 988000 that followed a 
72 percent decline singlefamily starts have not been lower since 
august 1984 when they totaled 967000 on an annual basis 
construction of multiunit dwellings toppled 189 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted rate of 396000 units in may following a big 
367 percent advance in april this sector has been in the doldrums 
for more than a year because of high vacancy rates and changes in 
the tax law that made investment in rental housing less profitable 
housing permits considered a good sign of future construction 
activity declined 15 percent in may following a 18 percent 
decline in april 
the precipitous may drop was led by identical 223 percent drops 
in the northeast where construction of housing was begun at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 206000 and the midwest where 
homes were started at a 269000 yearly rate 
it was the lowest level of construction activity in the 
northeast since september 1984 when the rate was 203000 and the 
steepest drop since the 24 percent plunge of november 1985 
starts in the south dropped 64 pecent to 555000 and starts in 
the west fell 48 percent to 354000

a number of smokestack stocks are basking in the 
spotlight these days having edged out sleeker consumeroriented 
issues in the quest for wall streets favor 
the shift in investor focus from consumer product stocks to more 
industrial equities has been building for several years but 
analysts say it has intensified since the market collapsed last 
october 
indeed a number of companies once relegated to the proverbial 
rust belt have outperformed higherprofile conglomerates that make 
identifiable fastselling products 
for example colgatepalmolive co maker of toothpaste pet 
food and detergents was trading at about 23 a share at its 
postcrash low it currently is holding at about the 44ashare 
level still shy of its precrash october peak of 50 
farm equipment maker deere amp cos performance on the other 
hand is far more impressive deere recently has traded in the 
50ashare range far beyond its postcrash low of 23 as well as 
its october peak of 40 a share 
while colgates advance appeared stalled deeres has been 
very dynamic a steady rise that is characteristic of a powerful 
technical advance said eugene peroni a technical analyst at 
janney montgomery scott in philadelphia 
analysts say the stark measures many heavy industries took over 
the years from layoffs to paring of businesses to automation 
are starting to pay off 
they have become lean green money machines and there isnt 
too much waste anymore one trader said to be sure the 
belttightening measures have made many companies far more 
resistant to economic cycles than they were a decade ago 
and investors are sensitive to their new strength individuals 
are witnessing first hand the revitalization of industry 
they are seeing some businesses hiring back workers factories 
expanding peroni said 
consumeroriented companies themselves are not entirely in the 
doldrums although debtladen americans have been cutting back on 
spending as lackluster retail sales attest 
but these stocks are suffering from some neglect as any 
increased focus on the industrial sector must come at the expense 
of something else 
traders are seeking out opportunities that are undervalued 
and theres recognition of the rustbelt companies there is a 
certain charm and interest there since they are perceived as the 
nations historic backbone peroni said 
to pair two other unlikely bedfellows bethlehem steel corp has 
managed to outperform bristolmyers co maker of clairol hair 
products excedrin and other products 
bristolmyers stock has recovered from a postcrash low of about 
29 a share to about 42 of late which is still below its october 
peak of 53 
bethlehem steel however is trading at about 21 a share above 
its october peak of 19 and more than double its postcrash low of 
10 a share 
analysts are divided as to whether the new focus actually spells 
good things for the economy some say that expansion in the 
industrial sector could be viewed as inflationary as both factory 
utilization and employment increase 
as the november election nears analysts say the presidential 
candidates are likely to tout the recovery of basic industry 
its going to become prevalent to the public that we pulled 
ourselves out of complete deterioration in the industrialized 
world one trader said 
it is not likely to be made apparent however that this new 
strength carries its own price

housing construction tumbled 122 percent in may for the 
steepest drop in five months the government said today in a report 
that suggested rising interest rates have jolted the homebuilding 
business 
the drop dragged construction activity down to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 138 million units in may the lowest level 
since january when 2000 fewer units were begun the commerce 
department said it was also the steepest drop since december when 
starts plunged 158 percent 
the housing report showed how sensitive the home construction 
industry is to interest rates which rose sharply in recent months 
rates on 30year fixedrate mortgages climbed from 1005 percent at 
the start of april to 1058 percent at the end of may according to 
the federal home loan mortgage corp 
although the housing report suggested economic weakness it 
added confusion to other statistics released thursday that 
indicated no clear trend 
a report by the federal reserve board said us factories mines 
and utilities operated at 829 percent of capacity last month a 
02 percentage point increase over april it was the sixth increase 
in eight months and the highest operating level since march 1980 
when the rate hit 837 percent 
some economists expressed concern that the trend will push 
prices higher as manufacturers have difficulty producing enough to 
meet demand but others say the may report is good news because 
operating rates cooled in the hottest industries and increased in 
sectors with excess capacity 
a separate report thursday by the commerce department showed 
business inventories rose 05 percent in april signaling slower 
economic growth for the second quarter business sales fell 02 
percent in the same month 
economists generally take rising inventories as a sign that 
buying demand is declining and as an indication that manufacturers 
may have to reduce production but the report of higher factory 
utilization rates as well as other recent evidence of economic 
strength suggested no significant slowdown 
financial markets largely ignored the government reports 
thursday focusing instead on the inflationary impact of an 
agricultural drought that could raise food prices later this year 
severely dry weather in the farm states caused prices of corn 
soybean and oat futures to soar on the chicago commodity exchanges 
which in turn incited runups in livestock and meat futures 
there also was concern among stock and bond investors that 
foreign banks might raise interest rates which could intensify 
pressure for higher rates in this country 
in the bond market a key barometer of inflation and 
interestrate trends the 30year treasury issue dropped 1250 per 
1000 in face amount and its yield jumped to 894 percent from 
883 percent late wednesday 
the bond selloff spread to wall street where the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials fell 3716 points after rising 32 points 
in the prior two trading days broader market indexes also fell 
on foreign exchange markets the dollar declined against most 
key currencies in response to the speculation of higher foreign 
interest rates

the top trade official of the european 
economic community on friday accused the us government of using 
confrontational tactics in transatlantic trade policy talks 
willy de clercq the eec external affairs commissioner told the 
european parliament that the united states had become less 
cooperative on trade issues 
the willingness of the united states to find negotiated 
solutions is diminishing he said instead they are trying to 
obtain satisfaction on a number of issues through confrontational 
tactics 
de clercq said the eec or common market was willing to 
continue discussing trade matters with the us government but 
it must be in a spirit of cooperation and not one of 
confrontation he said 
de clercq gave no examples of the tactics he ascribed to 
washington but he recently has complained about a us decision to 
reduce the amount of farmland held out of production the eec 
claims this move is likely to increase us crop production at a 
time of global surpluses 
the eec also has strongly objected to us complaints that its 
subsidies to soybean producers and processors are hurting american 
soybean exports to western europe on thursday the 96nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade which sets and monitors 
world trade rules accepted a us request to establish a special 
committee to hear the complaint 
useuropean trade relations are expected to be one of the 
topics at the toronto summit meeting of leaders from the seven 
largest industrialized nations that begins sunday 
de clercqs comments were in response to a european parliament 
report that urged action to strengthen gatt procedures for settling 
trade disputes 
in another sign of trade trouble the eec said friday it would 
impose punitive duties of up to 28 percent on a range of polyester 
products imported from the united states and six other countries 
the action is in response to a yearlong eec inquiry that 
concluded polyester producers in these countries were selling their 
products in the community at prices below the cost of production 
the eec decided to impose duties ranging between 25 percent to 
28 percent on imports of various polyester fibers imported from the 
united states mexico romania taiwan turkey and yugoslavia 
duties of between 27 percent and 26 percent will be charged on 
polyester yarns imported from mexico south korea taiwan and 
turkey 
the share of the eec polyester fiber market held by companies in 
these seven countries grew from 96 percent in 1984 to 178 percent 
last year the eec said

heavy trading attributed to the years second triplewitching

us trade representative clayton k yeutter 
announced today he was leaving immediately for japan saying a deal 
may be near on ending that nations restrictions on beef imports 
we certainly have not yet reached an agreement but im 
persuaded that the news is sufficiently encouraging to justify a 
trip the nations top trade negotiator told reporters 
a day earlier yeutter had said he would go to tokyo only if 
it becomes apparent to me that we have a settlement in sight 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we remain 
hopeful until theres a deal theres no deal 
a previous agreement between the two countries that permitted a 
japanese quota of 214000 tons of beef imports annually expired 
april 1 and negotiations had been deadlocked since then 
the united states insisted on an end to quotas also applying to 
citrus products and sought to have the matter resolved under the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade but japan vetoed such a 
procedure 
the overall value of the japanese beef market has been placed at 
2 billion by the department of agriculture 
yeutters office announced the trip early today to reporters 
attending an international business breakfast at which the trade 
representative was the featured speaker he elaborated when an 
australian questioner asked what he could to do to help tame us 
farm lobbies that have frustrated australian exporters 
within the next 72 hours or so i hope that our australian 
friends will say good things about what weve been doing with 
regard to the beef situation and japan yeutter said so 
to our aussie friends i would say this is an opportunity to 
freeload so enjoy it 
he said later that by freeload he meant compete with 
american beef exporters in a newly opened japanese market 
thats assuming we reach an agreement yeutter said 
he said he did not want to discuss the details of whatever 
preliminaries have been resolved at this point there has been 
speculation on capitol hill about a possible multiyear phaseout of 
quotas accompanied by tariffs but yeutter said nothing of such 
specifics

more than most lawsuits the landmark 
cipollone cigarette liability case seemed to rest mainly on how the 
questions were framed than on positions the lawyers argued 
the question asked by the cigarette makers was should a company 
really be forced to pay money because a smoker contracted lung 
cancer when she knew people were saying cigarettes were dangerous 
attorneys for rose cipollone who died in 1984 at 58 after four 
decades of smoking put it another way shouldnt the makers of her 
cigarettes be held responsible for their actions in making a 
potentially dangerous product 
and the 4month trial which ended monday with the first 
liability finding against the industry posed a broader question 
is the courtroom the place to change public policy 
the verdict reached by a jury of six new jersey people seemed to 
answer none of those questions 
the panel cleared liggett group inc lorillard inc and philip 
morris inc of conspiring to misrepresent the dangers of smoking 
but it granted 400000 to antonio cipollone in finding that 
liggett which made the cigarettes mrs cipollone smoked before 
warning labels were put on packs in 1966 violated advertising 
promises that its products were safe 
however it answered none to the jurysheet question of what 
damages mrs cipollone sustained 
the jury also partly found against liggett on a failuretowarn 
claim determining the company should have told consumers of 
smokings risks before 1966 that the omission contributed to mrs 
cipollones smoking and that the smoking contributed to her death 
yet the panel said mrs cipollone was mostly responsible for her 
injuries and thus not entitled to damages 
aside from the industrys exoneration on the fraud conspiracy 
claim company lawyers said they essentially won the case because 
the jury found mrs cipollone responsible for her injuries 
supporting the classic industry argument that smokers make an 
independent intelligent choice to puff on cigarettes 
but cipollones lawyers said the verdict supported the charge 
that smoking causes cancer which the industry denies has been 
proven and that actions by a cigarette maker can be blamed for a 
smokers disease 
industry victory proclamations caused some skepticism in 
antismoking ranks 
to me it seems like the captain of the titanic saying just 
a little ice folks said don davis an austin texas attorney 
whose firm handles cigarette liability cases 
the verdict led both sides to promise an appeal they will have 
until june 29 to file posttrial motions with us district judge 
h lee sarokin with oral arguments expected toward the end of 
july the outcome will shape arguments in appeals courts 
a different court the often cited court of public opinion 
must wrestle meanwhile with the significance of the cipollone 
verdict and all other cases like it 
antismoking advocates see liability cases as a way of reducing 
the number of smokers raising the price of cigarettes through 
mounting industry legal bills and drumming up public opinion 
against cigarettes but others dont see that as the role of the 
courts 
im not a big fan of getting social reform by litigation 
said boris yavitz a columbia university business school professor 
with a chair in business ethics 
a jury rules in favor of a plaintiff or defendant but doesnt 
rule on the issue involved he said 
consensus on rules of a society should be reached first through 
public debate and the actions of elected officials and the courts 
should then enforce compliance with what is decided in yavitz 
view 
but the courts have often been put to good use for important 
causes said john f banzhaf a george washington university law 
professor and antismoking activist 
environmental protection and rights for minorities prisoners 
and women have been won and maintained in courtrooms he said 
the courtroom also removes the advantages of lobbyists and 
influence of a powerful institution 
from the point of view of an activist which i am there are a 
number of forums and you use all of them he said 
cigarette liability trials with an individual victim and 
testimony from bereaved family members have a way of personalizing 
the statistics about smokings casualties in his view 
a momentous verdict like in the cipollone case sparks the 
attention of legislators and an antiindustry verdict will spawn 
more filings spreading the industrys legal resources thin and 
creating more opportunity for errors by industry lawyers banzhaf 
contended

the dimensions of the pentagon procurement 
bribery scandal are beyond the wildest imagination sen 
charles grassley said today while another senator called the probe 
the most serious case in the history of the department of 
defense 
attorney general edwin meese iii said he anticipates indictments 
within 90 days in the massive criminal investigation of the alleged 
sale of confidential pentagon information to defense contractors 
through their paid consultants 
it involves people enriching themselves on propriety 
information and the scope is beyond the wildest imagination said 
grassley who was briefed thursday by henry hudson the us 
attorney for the eastern district of virginia and the coordinator 
of the massive investigation 
grassley riowa called for more vigorous enforcement of 
antifraud laws and for the use of regional task forces of federal 
prosecutors to fight whitecollar crime in concentrated defense 
industry areas such as southern california and texas 
sen john warner a former navy secretary and the ranking 
republican on the senate armed services committee said he was 
briefed thursday by federal law enforcement officials about the 
case which is focusing on the alleged sale of secret information 
to defense contractors through their paid consultants 
warner rva said on cbstvs this morning that it was 
the most widespread case i or anyone else has ever seen because 
youve got literally dozens upon dozens of contractors and 
literally hundreds and hundreds of people are now being 
subpoenaed 
it is the most serious case in the history of the department 
of defense it is widespread and it is deep warner said 
an unusually detailed search warrant made public thursday says 
much of the confidential information was improperly funneled to 
mcdonnell douglas corp the warrant was one of 38 served this week 
on 15 defense contractors half a dozen pentagon personnel and 
consultants 
according to the warrant information was passed along by former 
pentagon official melvyn paisley assistant secretary of the navy 
for research engineering and systems from 1981 to april 1987 
paisley is now a washington consultant to numerous defense 
contractors 
mcdonnell douglas did 77 billion worth of pentagon business in 
fiscal 1987 making it the nations largest defense contractor the 
warrant says mcdonnell douglas received confidential information on 
several pentagon programs including the 35 billion advanced 
tactical aircraft manufacturing competition won by the st louis 
company 
paisleys consulting office was bugged and his phone there was 
tapped by federal investigators conducting the corruption probe 
according to government sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
sources said paisley is a consultant for united technologies 
whose washington offices also were searched tuesday by fbi agents 
the agents took away all documents in united technologiess files 
relating to paisley said the sources 
the agents also took documents relating to the 404 and t406 
engines made by pratt amp whitney a united technologies subsidiary 
paisley began working as a united technologies consultant within a 
week after he left his pentagon job last year according to the 
sources 
meese declined to give a direct answer when asked if bribes had 
been accepted in the pentagon saying that will all come out in 
the course of the indictments and ultimately in the trials he 
said we are hopeful that indictments will be completed within the 
next 30 to 90 days 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater described president 
reagan as very concerned about the revelations after a meeting 
tht included the president vice president george bush meese and 
fbi director william sessions 
in other developments 
the new york times citing unidentified legal sources at the 
justice department and elsewhere reported today that the offices 
of at least three house members had been placed under investigation 
as part of the probe the sources would not identify the lawmakers 
or say whether the house members or their aides were under 
investigation 
the los angeles times reported today that rep bill chappell 
jr dfla who oversees the pentagon budget as chairman of the 
house appropriations subcommittee on defense was identified by 
sources as one of those under scrutiny 
asked today if he is under investigation chappell said its 
a bunch of bunk he said there was all kinds of wild rumors 
flying which he attributed to election season 
chappell said he didnt know if is telephone was tapped 
nbc news reported thursday that the courtauthorized wiretaps 
lasted 290 days and overheard nearly 4800 conversations of which 
671 were considered incriminating 
the washington post citing an unidentified law enforcement 
source reported today that at least 12 phones had been tapped 
including that of william galvin a colleague of paisleys and a 
consultant associated with several defense contractors 
the source also said one government employee received more than 
100000 in cash in return for information and that investigators 
also were looking into allegations that personal bills vacations 
and other expenses of government employees were paid by 
consultants the newspaper reported 
according to the mcdonnell douglas warrant paisley provided 
classified andor confidential documents to company executives

texaco incs annual meeting drew a packed 
house today as a closely watched proxy war between the nations 
third largest oil company and financier carl c icahn came to a 
close 
stakes were high in the meeting called to order by texaco 
chairman alfred c decrane jr who told shareholders the company 
was aggressively restructuring to put its legal and bankruptcy 
ordeals into the past 
the bottom line of all of this is were reshaping your company 
as reflected in texacos new advertising theme up ahead theres 
texaco star of the american road decrane said that theme 
expresses what we intend to be in this industry 
later decrane cut off icahn when the financier ran past his 
10minute speaking limit and icahn responded i think this is a 
manifestation of the inflexibility that caused texaco its 
problems the crowd of more than 1000 responded with a mixture 
of scattered boos and cheers 
after months of invective lawsuits charges and 
countercharges shareholders have cast millions of votes on 
whether to support management or icahn texacos largest 
stockholder who has offered to acquire the company in the biggest 
corporate buyout in american history 
results will not be known for weeks because it will take that 
long to count the proxy ballots 
icahn holder of 148 percent of texacos 243 million shares 
was running with four allies for the five seats up for election to 
the companys 14member board 
he seeks the seats to pressure the company to let stockholders 
vote on his offer to buy the texaco shares he does not already own 
for 60 each or about 124 billion adding the 12 billion he 
already paid for his stake would raise the acquisition cost to 
136 billion the biggest sum ever paid in a corporate buyout 
after nearly four weeks of voting the race widely was believed 
to be close 
several major institutions were reported to have sided with 
icahn while others were said to be leaning toward texaco 
traditionally individuals tend to vote for management but various 
sources said it was impossible to assume anything this time 
texaco president james w kinnear and other top executives 
plannedto address shareholders company spokesman k peter maneri 
said adding certainly mr icahn as the largest shareholder 
will also have a chance to speak 
icahn said previously that if he lost he would sell his stake 
and go away but he in recent days he also said he might try a 
hostile takeover bid 
texaco and icahn each have lawsuits pending against the other 
and have engaged in months of verbal warfare texaco being 
evermindful of icahns long record as a successful corporate 
takeover strategist 
icahn began buying up texaco shares last fall while the company 
was struggling to overcome a 103 billion judgment won by pennzoil 
co in a court fight over texacos acquisition of getty oil co the 
ruling ultimately led to texacos filing for bankruptcy court 
reorganization in april 1987 
pennzoil agreed in december to settle the case for 3 billion in 
a deal that was the keystone of the texaco reorganization plan 
ultimately approved by the court in april 
texaco officials calling for shareholder support touted the 
plan as the vehicle for a new more profitable texaco to come 
icahn accused texaco management of incompetence charging it was 
seeking to entrench itself while ignoring the interests of its 
shareholders 
in response management accused him of looking out only for his 
own interests at the expense of other shareholders and of 
seeking to bleed the company for the highest shortterm profit 
possible 
icahn gained some support from stockholders in his fight 
as a result texaco agreed to include a vote on certain 
corporate governance issues on the proxy ballot including 
among others restrictions on the adoption of takeover defenses an 
antigreenmail provision and more participation by shareholders in 
choosing directors

the supreme court today made it easier for 
creditors to garnish employee benefits from workers covered by the 
federal employee retirement income security act erisa 
by a 54 vote in a case from georgia the court said erisa 
benefits are not shielded from garnishment even when a state law 
seeks to protect the benefits from being obtained from creditors 
justice byron r white in his opinion for the court said erisa 
preempts state laws in such cases 
the court ruled in favor of the lanier collection agency amp 
service which represents people owed money by 23 longshoremen 
the longshoremen received vacation and holiday benefits from the 
south atlanticila vacation and holiday fund the fund provides 
benefits to longshoremen in north and south carolina georgia and 
florida 
a georgia law exempts from garnishment most benefits covered by 
erisa plans 
but the supreme court said the state law conflicts with erisa 
and is preempted by the federal law 
the decision upheld a ruling by the georgia supreme court 
dissenting today were justices anthony m kennedy harry a

the supreme court striking down an ordinance 
from the cleveland suburb of lakewood ohio today limited 
communities power to regulate the placement of newspaper boxes on 
public sidewalks 
the court by a 43 vote ruled that the lakewood ordinance 
violated freespeech rights because it vested the mayor with too 
much discretion in deciding which boxes would be allowed 
the ordinance empowered the citys mayor to grant or deny 
applications for annual permits to publishers to place the boxes 
called newsracks on public property 
the supreme courts decision dealt only with the mayoral 
discretion it sent the case back to lower courts to determine 
whether the ordinance which also attached other conditions on the 
placement of newsracks could survive constitutional attack if the 
mayoral discretion is dropped 
writing for the court justice william j brennan said the 
ordinance could allow a mayor to deny permits based on a 
newspapers content 
a law or policy permitting communication in a certain manner 
for some but not for others raises the specter of content and 
viewpoint censorship brennan said 
significantly the court agreed with the american newspaper 
publishers association and numerous publishing companies that 
placing newspaper boxes is a form of communication in a public 
forum 
a host of local government organizations had contended that no 
freespeech questions existed in the case they said various 
conditions should be attached to the property rights created when a 
newspaper is allowed to place a newsrack on public property 
the lakewood controversy began in 1982 when the plain dealer a 
cleveland newspaper sought permission to place coinoperated 
newsracks in various locations in the community of about 62000 
residents 
the request was turned down in its entirety and the newspaper 
subsequently sued the city 
a federal judge ruled that the ordinance as amended was valid 
but the 6th us circuit court of appeals invalidated three parts 
ruling 
that the ordinance impermissibly gave the mayor unlimited 
discretion to grant or deny a permit and make it subject to almost 
any conditions he may choose 
that the citys architectural board of review had 
standardless discretion to approve the design of newsracks even 
when such authority was not narrowly tailored to serve a 
significant governmental interest 
that the newspaper could not be forced to insure and indemnify 
the city for personalinjury liability that might result from 
accidents involving newsracks because no such insurance is required 
for bus shelters or telephone booths 
the appeals court however ruled that lakewood could charge 
rent for newsracks placed on public property and it said the city 
could ban newsracks from residential neighborhoods 
about 5 percent of the plain dealers total sales come from 
newsracks the bulk of the newspapers sales come from home 
delivery 
brennans opinion was joined by justices thurgood marshall 
harry a blackmun and antonin scalia 
justices byron r white john paul stevens and sandra day 
oconnor dissented 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice anthony m 
kennedy did not participate 
in other action the court 
ruled that federal judges may be disqualified from presiding 
over cases even when they are unaware during trial of their 
personal connection to the cases 
in a 54 ruling in a case from louisiana the court said the 
appearance of a conflict of interest is grounds for a judge to 
disqualify himself from presiding 
made it easier for creditors to garnish employee benefits from 
workers covered by the federal employee retirement income security 
act erisa 
by a 54 vote in a case from georgia the court said erisa 
benefits are not shielded from garnishment even when a state law 
seeks to protect the benefits from being obtained from creditors 
resolved what it called a peculiar battle between two 
federal appeals courts telling one of those courts to tackle an 
antitrust dispute over the m16 the us military standard rifle 
the justices unanimously ruled that the chicagobased 7th us 
circuit court of appeals should rule in the case not the 
washingtonbased us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
a common feature of any citys landscape newsracks often have 
been a source of friction between local government and the press 
usa today which depends heavily on its distinctive 
blueandwhite coin boxes for national distribution has been 
involved in several cases 
the parent gannett co inc won a federal lawsuit against new 
yorks metoropolitan transportation authority which wanted to 
charge 75 per newsrack or 150 per station whichever is higher 
for the privilege of placing usa today newsracks 
a judge ruled that fees could only cover administrative costs 
but that ruling was reversed 
gannett also joined with publishers in minnesota to win a state 
court ruling that struck down a newsracklicensing ordinance in 
minneapolis a judge ruled that the ordinance represented an 
unconstitutional prior restraint on publication 
several newspapers are challenging a newport ri ordinance 
banning newsracks from all public property

share prices fell friday on the london stock 
exchange as the market was hit by worries about interestrate 
increases 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index finished down 
118 points or 063 percent at 18501 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials was up 
089 point at 209513 as the london trading session drew to a 
close after opening 338 points higher 
of the ftse 100 shares 16 were higher while 73 were in 
negative territory and 11 showed no change at the end of the 
session 
london analysts said the market was upset by the perception that 
the british government would increase interest rates to douse an 
overheating economy 
we know the authorities would love to tickle up interest rates 
a fraction if they only have the opportunity said one trading 
floor manager at a large british brokerage 
british economic indicators released at midday friday did 
nothing to allay the interestrate worries dealers said 
industrial production rose 15 percent in april from march and was 
up 43 percent from a year earlier while retail prices rose 04 
percent in may from april and were 42 percent higher than in may 
1987 
the rise in london share prices over the week was another source 
of concern analysts said as they questioned the speed of the 
ascent 
we ran up too far and too fast this week and it just wasnt 
sustainable one dealer said 
in addition the upcoming threeday toronto economic summit kept 
players guessing about the intentions of the leaders of the group 
of seven major economic nations 
the g7 may agree on some policy to push up interest rates to 
wring some of the excess liquidity out of the system one dealer

the european economic community 
commission said friday it was studying allegations of dumping of 
steel coil from argentina and canada following a complaint by 
eurofer which represents the eecs main steel companies 
the commission had notified eurofer that previous antidumping 
duties imposed in 1983 on exporters from the two countries were 
close to expiring but eurofer alleged the eec steel industry would 
be injured if the duties were dropped 
according to eurofer canadian exporters were still selling the 
products at up to 40 percent below eec prices 
in the case of argentina eurofer said that it was worried about 
a diversion of steel exports to the eec from the us market 
because of the decline in value of the dollar 
eurofer said worldwide argentinian exports of steel products 
rose to 1176 million metric tons in 1986 from 752000 tons in 1982

the united states would be happy to consider 
negotiating a freetrade agreement with japan along the lines of 
the treaty reached with canada treasury secretary james a baker 
iii said friday 
while there are no current discussion about such a treaty it 
would fit into this countrys overall strategy to break down trade 
barriers wherever they exist he said 
we have a major trading relationship with japan baker said 
it a free trade agreement would be something that the united 
states would be pleased to consider if it were something that the 
government of japan wanted to consider 
bakers comments came in a television interview with foreign 
journalists for broadcast outside the united states by the us 
information agency the session was a preview of the sevennation 
economic summit opening sunday in toronto 
president reagan addressing the annual conference of the usia 
international council meantime reiterated his belief in free 
trade while saying trade barriers of other countries are generating 
protectionist pressures in america 
it damages the entire world economy when foreign countries 
fail to offer the same opportunity to american exports that america 
offers to their products reagan said it is this basic sense 
of fairness that has helped generate protectionist pressures in 
america let me repeat protectionism the closing of americas 
markets is the wrong response opening markets that i firmly 
believe is the answer 
meanwhile there appeared to be movement on another contentious 
trade dispute between japan and the united states 
us trade representative clayton yeutter announced friday that 
he was leaving immediately for japan saying a deal may be near on 
ending that nations restrictions on beef imports 
we certainly have not yet reached an agreement but im 
persuaded that the news is sufficiently encouraging to justify a 
trip yeutter said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we remain 
hopeful but added until theres a deal theres no deal 
the agriculture department has placed the overall value of the 
japanese beef market at 2 billion 
a usjapan freetrade agreement would presumably be of 
substantial benefit to this country because us officials for 
years have pressured the japanese to open their markets to american 
products as a way of reducing the huge trade imbalance between the 
two nations 
the japanese ran up a trade surplus with the united states last 
year of 598 billion more than onethird of this countrys 
americas overall trade deficit of 1703 billion 
the uscanada pact now being considered by congress and the 
canadian parliament would end all trade barriers within 10 years 
some critics have charged that specific trade pacts such as the 
uscanada agreement or the plan to eliminate all barriers between 
the 12nation european economic community by 1992 pose risks of 
returning the world to the trade cartels of the 1930s which worked 
to shrink trade rather than expanding it 
but baker disputed this saying the united states saw any trade 
liberalization agreements as beneficial he said america preferred 
to pursue reduction of trade barriers through the discussions being 
held under the auspices of the 96nation general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
but he hinted that if those talks did not reach a successful 
conclusion the united states would look to trade pacts with 
smaller groups of countries 
baker said the summit between president reagan and other western 
leaders would include a fullfledged discussion of reagans 
proposal to eliminate all farm subsidies by the year 2000 these 
subsidies are costing the major industrial countries 150 billion 
annually in higher government support payments and increased food 
costs to consumers 
he acknowledged that the us proposal to eliminate subsidies 
was facing intense opposition with washington hoping basically for 
a reiteration in toronto of a pledge the industrialized nations 
made last month in paris to press forward in negotiations on the 
issue 
the us delegation led by baker had pressed for more specific 
language to adopt reagans call for a subsidyfree world in 
agricultural trade by a specific date 
but baker contended friday that progress had been made in paris 
the fact that we are even discussing this very difficult 
problem of agricultural subsidies represents progress he said 
it is not going to be at all easy to move toward eliminating 
subsidies or reducing subsidies for any of us unless we are all 
able to go to our farmers and say the world is going to do this 
european nations have argued that it is politically impossible 
to eliminate all farm subsidies and a proper compromise would be to 
reduce them perhaps by cutting them in half 
the united states is hoping to keep the pressure on so that hard 
bargaining to end protectionism in agriculture can take place at a 
montreal trade meeting in december 
the montreal meeting will be a midterm review for the current 
round of global trade talks which were launched in 1986 in uruguay 
and scheduled to end in 1990

the superfund toxic waste dump cleanup 
program is ineffective inefficient and still choosing pennywise 
poundfoolish cleanup methods that may have to be redone later at 
great expense a congressional study said friday 
technical evidence confirms that all too frequently superfund 
is not working environmentally the way the law directs it to 
said the report issued by the office of technology assessment 
the environmental protection agency is not consistently 
fulfilling the mandate of 1986 amendments that it should prefer 
waste treatment technologies that permanently reduce the 
toxicity mobililty or volume of the waste in question the 
report said 
ota investigators examined decision documents for about 100 
sites affected by the 1986 amendments and selected for detailed 
study 10 they believed to be representative 
study of such documents what epa calls the record of 
decision for the site is particularly useful because even 
after eight years cleanup technology is a new and fastchanging 
field and the work force is relatively young and inexperienced 
recent college graduates are often put in charge of multimillion 
dollar projects they have almost no one to learn from as 
turnover is high research papers and technical manuals are 
quickly outdated 
too much flexibility and lack of central management control 
are working against an effective efficient superfund program 
the report said 
winston porter assistant epa administrator in charge of 
superfund criticized the study for a superficial look 
they continually pressure us to be consistent but i keep 
telling them the communities arent consistent the states arent 
consistent and the problems arent consistent porter said the 
law requires epa to consider preferences of affected communities 
and the states 
of the 104 decisions that fall under the 1986 amendments 
treatment technologies were possible in 87 instances and were 
chosen in 67 porter said 
porter said the report contained some valid technical points 
but i disagree with the extrapolations they make 
the report called the decisions at the 10 sites questionable 
because 
if different and readily available technical information had 
been used the decision would have changed significantly 
the range of cleanup alternatives was too narrow 
the analysis was not comprehensive and was not fair to 
different technologies 
the study work was not internally consistent 
mistakes were made in calculations and estimates 
critical assumptions were false 
conclusions were stated without analysis and documentation 
in five instances treatments were selected before results came 
in from smallscale treatability studies of whether the method 
would work at the particular site 
eight of the 10 sets of documents were signed on sept 29 or 
sept 30 last year the last day of the fiscal year and two on the 
last day of the following quarter which the ota analysts said 
could be an indication that decisions were rushed for the sake of 
boosting the number of sites moved along the decision pipeline 
the agency is selecting impermanent remedies purely because 
they are cheaper in the short run the report said decisions for 
onsite containment or landfill disposal of contaminants seldom 
analyze the risk of future failure damages and further cleanup 
community concerns about impermanence are not very likely to 
lead to a more expensive cleanup technology the report said 
noting that epa appears to be more responsive to companies paying 
for cleanups to states contributing to them and to its own need 
to spread its funds around as far as possible 
some examples from the report 
in tulsa county okla epa chose to cap an abandoned landfill 
even though caps have been described as only a temporary 
solution at other cleanups by the same regional office this does 
not meet the statute and there was no examination of any 
alternative other than incineration of all the wastes involved nor 
of the longterm uncertaintites potential environmental risks 
and future cleanup costs 
at reading ohio epa chose to glassify the contaminated soil 
in place by a novel technique rejected elsewhere in the region and 
appears to have overestimated incineration costs by a factor of two 
at elizabeth nj another unproven inplace solidification 
technology was selected over incineration whose costs were 
overestimated

stock prices inched higher today amid record 
volume attributed to moves to capture dividends and the quarterly 
triplewitching hour the simultaneous expiration of futures 
and options contracts 
there was a crush of activity as the opening bell sounded with 
volume exceeding the previous firsthour record in just 45 minutes 
trading in occidental petroleum accounted for almost a third of 
the days volume with most of the activity related to the 
companys impending quarterly dividend 
in addition traders said volume was typically heavy as the 
quarterly triplewitching hour got underway some stockindex 
contracts expired at the opening while others expired at the close 
of trading 
analysts found nothing unusual in the heavy volume considering 
the doublepronged effect of the triplewitching hour and the 
dividend plays they noted however that such activity distorted 
the real motivation in the market 
alfred goldman director of technical market analysis at ag 
edwards amp sons inc in st louis said the triplewitching hour 
rendered the markets movements meaningless and nearly 
impossible to analyze it is totally controled by nonmarket 
noneconomic factors he said 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials opened slightly higher 
but was off more than 16 points before moving back into plus 
territory shortly before the close

the supreme court made it more difficult 
friday for communities to regulate the placement of newspaper boxes 
on public sidewalks 
by a 43 vote the court said placement of the boxes called 
newsracks is a form of expression in a public forum protected by 
the constitutions first amendment 
the decision struck down as unconstitutional a lakewood ohio 
ordinance because it gave the suburban citys mayor too much 
discretion in deciding which newsracks would be allowed 
in other decisions the court 
struck down by an 81 vote an ohio law that exempted from any 
deadlines the filing of lawsuits against outofstate defendants 
the justices said the law unduly interfered with interstate 
commerce 
made it easier on a 54 vote for creditors to garnish 
employee benefits from workers covered by the federal employee 
retirement income security act the court said erisa benefits are 
not shielded from garnishment even when a state law seeks to 
protect the benefits from being obtained from creditors 
resolved a jurisdictional tugofwar between two federal 
appeals courts involving an antitrust dispute over the m16 the 
us military standard rifle the justices unanimously ruled the 
chicagobased 7th us circuit court of appeals should rule in the 
case not the washingtonbased us court of appeals for the 
federal circuit 
writing for the court in the newsrack decision justice william 
j brennan said the ordinance could allow a mayor to deny permits 
for newsracks based on a newspapers content 
nothing in fridays decision however necessarily prevents a 
community from banning all newsracks 
such a ban would not be based on content brennan noted and if 
challenged could be upheld if found to be a reasonable restriction 
on the time place or manner of constitutionally protected 
expression 
three justices voted to uphold the lakewood ordinance and said 
communities should be free to ban newsracks from all public 
property 
but brennan said the courts majority was not going to discuss 
the validity of such a ban 
about lakewoods ordinance brennan said a law or policy 
permitting communication in a certain manner for some but no for 
others raises the specter of content and viewpoint censorship 
the lakewood controversy began in 1982 when the plain dealer a 
cleveland newspaper was refused permission to place coinoperated 
newsracks in various locations throughout the suburban city 
the newspaper sued and a federal trial judge and the 6th us 
circuit court of appeals invalidated the ordinance the appeals 
court however ruled that lakewood could charge rent for newsracks 
placed on public property and could ban newsracks from residential 
neighborhoods 
plain dealer publisher thomas vail said friday the supreme 
court has recognized that improper restrictions on newsracks are 
subject to prompt constitutional challenge this is an important 
application of first amendment principles to the public interest in 
convenient and effective access to the nations newspapers 
jerry w friedheim president of american newspaper publishers 
association said the ruling underlined what numerous lower 
courts legal scholars and newspapers have always believed the 
distribution of news deserves the highest first amendment 
protection by reminding public officials that they have strictly 
limited powers when they regulate newspaper distribution the court 
gives both newspapers and municipal governments a strong impetus to 
find the best ways of keeping the public informed 
the decision produced a lively exchange between brennan and 
justice byron r white author of a combative 27page dissenting 
opinion 
while brennan compared regulating newsracks to regulating people 
who pass out leaflets white said the better comparison was the 
regulation of newsracks and softdrink vending machines 
the first amendment does not create a right of newspaper 
publishers to take a portion of city property to erect a structure 
to distribute their papers white wrote for himself and justices 
john paul stevens and sandra day oconnor 
but brennans view joined by justices thurgood marshall harry 
a blackmun and antonin scalia prevailed 
the effectiveness of the newsrack as a means of distribution 
especially for lowbudget controversial neighborhood newspapers 
means that the twin threats of selfcensorship and undetectable 
censorship are if anything greater for newsracks than for 
pamphleteers brennan said 
the justices sent the lakewood case back to a federal appeals 
court which must determine whether the ordinance can survive 
constitutional attack if the mayoraldiscretion aspect is dropped 
several similar legal fights are pending in lower courts 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice anthony m 
kennedy did not participate in the case

financial institutions in washington the treasury department said 
thursday night 
petricioli also urged us treasury secretary james a baker iii 
to place the foreign debt crisis high on the agenda when leaders of 
the group of seven industrialized countries meet next week in 
toronto 
mexicos inflationfighting plan and a possible new bond issue 
to foreign creditors willing to retire mexican debt paper also were 
discussed during the washington meetings the treasury said in a 
statement

fertilizer industry during his trip and also met with federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan world bank president barber 
conable and international monetary fund director michel camdessus 
mexican treasury department officials who accompanied petricioli 
held informal discussions with authorities from canada france 
spain japan britain and west germany 
participants in those meetings discussed the search for more 
efficient formulas for the treatment of the problem of the debt and 
how to reach an adequate equilibrium between servicing the external 
obligations of mexico and the undeferable necessity of recuperating 
economic growth the statement said 
mexicos 105 billion foreign debt is the developing worlds 
second largest after brazil 
the meetings studied not only a proposal but also a range of 
possibilities in which banks financial authorities international 
organizations and mexico will continue working to reduce the weight 
of our debt the statement said 
it added that the representatives of those nations agreed to 
explore various alternative solutions to easing mexicos interest 
and principal payment schedules the officials will meet again

apartment and house building plunged 122 
percent in may as singlefamily home construction slumped to the 
lowest level in more than three years the government said friday 
economists who were surprised by the steepness of the nose 
dive blamed rising interest rates and high home prices 
particularly in the northeast section of the country where 
construction starts fell 223 percent 
housing activity is closely watched because it often is a 
harbinger of the direction of the economy as a whole however 
analysts cautioned against overreacting to one months report and 
said they expected at least a modest rebound this summer 
the report had little effect on the stock market where the dow 
jones industrial average of 30 stocks rose 978 points to 210402 
trading of nearly 344 million shares on the new york stock 
exchange heaviest of the year was attributed to dividend plays 
and technical factors associated with triple witching hour 
expiration of futures and options contracts 
inflation fears continued to plague the credit markets where 
the yield on the 30year treasury bond edged above 9 percent 
the commerce department said the may decline dragged overall 
housing construction down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
138 million units compared with a rate of 158 million units in 
april 
singlefamily construction dropped 92 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 988000 after dipping 72 percent in april 
multifamily building starts a volatile category dropped 189 
percent to a rate of 396000 units in may bouncing off a 367 
percent increase a month earlier 
apartment building has been in the doldrums for more than a year 
because of high vacancy rates and changes in the tax law that made 
investment in rental housing less profitable 
it was the most precipitous drop in total housing construction 
since decembers 158 percent fall and the lowest level in activity 
since january 
construction of singlefamily units have not been lower since 
august 1984 when units were begun at a 967000 annual rate 
mortgage interest rates were rising pretty quickly during the 
month of may and that rise may have scared a lot of builders into 
pulling back said richard w peach deputy chief economist of 
the mortgage bankers of america 
according to the federal home loan mortgage corp rates on 
30year fixed rate mortgages climbed from an average of 1005 
percent early in april to 1058 percent late in may the averages 
do not include addon fees known as points 
rates have eased so far this month averaging 1035 percent this 
week however most economists are predicting rising rates through 
the end of the year 
if youre seriously considering buying a home in the near 
term sooner is going to be better rather than later said john 
savacool an economist with the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa 
forecasting firm theres a window of opportunity here where 
rates are down a little bit its probably going to be more 
favorable than you can expect over the next 12 months 
an increase of a half percentage point from 100 percent to 
105 percent boosts a homebuyers monthly principal and interest 
payment on a 30year 100000 mortgage from 878 to 915 
some analysts pointed to may figures on housing permits 
considered a good indication of future construction activity as a 
sign of hope singlefamily permits edged up 08 percent in may 
although overall permits declined 15 percent 
however david seiders chief economist of the national 
association of home builders said a survey of home builders early 
this month showed their confidence slipped significantly from early 
may the proportion of builders saying sales prospects were good to 
excellent fell from 41 percent to 34 percent he said 
the may drop in housing starts was led by identical 223 percent 
declines in the northeast where construction of housing was begun 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 206000 and the midwest 
where homes were started at a 269000 yearly rate 
however midwestern starts were seesawing off a 321 percent 
increase a month earlier while the decline in the northeast came 
on top of an 86 percent drop in april and a 59 percent fall in 
march 
it was the lowest level of construction activity in the 
northeast since september 1984 when the rate was 203000 units 
and the steepest drop since the 24 percent plunge of november 1985 
starts in the south dropped 64 pecent to 555000 and starts in 
the west fell 48 percent to 354000 
michael sumichrast a real estate economist in washington said 
soaring prices of new homes in the northeast and in california are 
responsible for declines in those areas other factors are the 
scarcity of suitable land and tight regional labor markets 
the enormous increase in prices has made it virtually 
impossible for firsttime home buyers to buy homes he said i 
have been telling builders they are pricing themselves out of the 
market 
he said builders have been concentrating too heavily on the 
moveup home buyer and should build more modest homes on smaller 
pieces of land in order to attract less wealthy buyers

the stock market finished mixed friday amid the 
heaviest volume of 1988 which brokers attributed to 
dividendcapture strategies and the triplewitching hour 
expirations of futures and options contracts 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 978 points to 
close at 210402 a late wave of bluechip buying pushed the key 
index up just before the close but the broader market remained 
depressed 
declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
642 issues up 850 down and 450 unchanged 
trading was the heaviest this year and the fifth busiest ever 
volume on the nyse floor totaled 34392 million shares up from 
16155 million in the previous session nationwide consolidated 
volume in nyselisted issues including trading at regional 
exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled 36725 
million shares 
volume exceeded the previous firsthour record just 45 minutes 
after the opening bell then slowed trading in occidental 
petroleum accounted for nearly a third of the days volume with 
more than 104 million shares changing hands much of the activity 
was related to the companys impending quarterly dividend 
in addition traders said the quarterly triplewitching hour 
contributed to the crush of stocks traded some stockindex 
contracts expired at the opening while others expired at the end 
of the session 
analysts said the heavy volume obscured the more basic 
motivations behind trading 
alfred goldman director of technical market analysis at ag 
edwards amp sons inc in st louis noted that the triplewitching 
hour helped to render the markets movements meaningless it is 
totally controlled by nonmarket noneconomic factors 
still traders said institutional investors showed some healthy 
interest in buying equities the dow average had been down much of 
the day but bargain hunters stepped in along with some 
computergenerated buying at the end of the day 
there was some good activity in the blue chips and the dow 
which had been off almost 17 points swung back in the last 20 
minutes one trader said 
many strategists remain optimistic that the dow index which had 
climbed about 200 points in recent weeks will continue to head 
higher into july as money managers with huge pools of cash are 
pressed to invest before the end of the quarter 
but goldman said hes getting nervous crowds are very 
dangerous to your health in the stock market 
among actively traded issues texaco was down 1 at 48 the oil

of irreparable damage to droughtstressed crops analysts said 
the market is obviously convinced that the dry weather pattern 
is in place and going to continue said rich feltes director of 
commodity research with refco inc a large chicagobased trading 
firm 
corn crops which are now entering a critical pollination stage

the report showed a record number of cattle placed on feedlots 
last month to be fattened for slaughter outpacing most prereport 
estimates and resulting in predictions of lower cattle futures 
prices next week 
much of the increased placements were probably due to producers 
selling cattle to feedlots because of dry pastures analysts said 
the pasture levels are at their worst since the 1930s since 
the dustbowl period said tom ohare an analyst with smith 
barney harris upham amp co in new york 
most analysts expect cattle and hog producers to liquidate large 
portions of their herds driving prices sharply lower if the 
drought continues

a late rally pushed the stock market higher 
friday as trading surged to its fastest pace of the year 
volume on the new york stock exchange totaled 34392 million

hands june 8 
prices were down most of the day but stocks rallied late in the

hour session traders noted some stockindex contracts expired at

the delaware amp hudson railway co will 
seek protection under of chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws on 
monday the railways parent company announced friday 
guilford transportation industries said a federal arbitrators 
ruling earlier this week and other financial conditions forced 
the move 
under a decision wednesday by arbitrator richard kasher 
delaware amp hudson could not be leased to the springfield terminal 
railway co to generate income guilford said in a statement 
the decision left the railroad with only enough cash reserves to 
operate for another 48 hours to 72 hours guilford said in a 
statement 
the interstate commerce commission the federal railroad 
administration and the states of new york and pennsylvania were 
notified friday of the companys decision to seek chapter 11 
protection on june 20 according to the statement 
the arbitrators decision forced guilford to reverse a massive 
reorganization of its railroad lines that began last year rehire 
employees award back pay and reinstate old work guidelines 
it was the third blow to the railroad this week following a 
federal complaint about inadequate service and an arbitrators 
decision ordering guilford to rehire 1200 workers after a 
sevenmonth strike and give them 15 million in back pay 
kasher said all work rules pay rates and working conditions 
from the old boston amp maine corp and maine central railroad corp 
must apply to the springfield terminal which guilford created last 
year to replace the two lines 
the ruling effectively crippled guilfords reorganization to cut 
costs to compete with the trucking industry 
the delaware amp hudson was the nations oldest continually 
operated transportation company formed in 1823 as a canal company 
its sale was finalized in january 1984 to guilford which bought 
the financially ailing railway after a series of government 
subsidies by federal and state governments including new york 
guilford last year began switching operations of four 
subsidiaries boston amp maine maine central portland terminal 
corp and delaware amp hudson to springfield terminal 
friday state department of transportation spokesman timothy 
hulbert said the department had just been informed of guilfords 
plans and did not have an immediate comment 
earlier this week however dot said it would take steps to block 
any interruption of service along the new york freight railroad 
network served by guilford transportation industries 
state dot officials said they would petition the interstate 
commerce commission to force guilford to keep lines operated by the 
damph open the state said it would also move to repossess 165 
boxcars from the delaware amp hudson provided by the state under a 
lease agreement

leaders of the worlds seven biggest industrial 
democracies began arriving friday for their annual economic summit 
with canadian prime minister brian mulroney forecasting progress on 
dismantling farm subsidies and alleviating third world debt 
several downtown streets were fenced off and a police robot was 
used to check one parking lot for explosives as a security cordon 
enveloped the metropolitan toronto convention center where the 
heads of state and government will meet for three days starting 
sunday 
mulroney told some of the 1300 accredited media that the 
principal objective of the summit is to maintain the ongoing 
pattern of increased growth in a noninflationary climate 
canadas annual inflation rate rose friday to 41 percent from 
40 percent last month 
mulroney said summits will be much poorer without president 
reagan attending his eighth and last gathering 
the canadian leader looked for modest but very important 
progress in solving the global escalation in farm subsidies 
estimated at 150 to 200 billion a year 
it is very important that all of us including japan 
recognize that these subsidies to agriculture are tradedistorting 
in nature and eventually protectionist he said they cost 
treasuries more money than any of us can legitimately afford and 
ultimately theyre very harmful to the farmers 
he noted that canada and france canceled 580 million worth of 
debt from african nations last year and if other summit countries 
do likewise it would wipe away 14 percent to 15 percent of the 
debt owed by the poorest of the poor 
some of these countries are so crippled by this oppressive 
debt that they couldnt pay it if they lived forever he said 
its uncollectable 
the summit site was sealed off by 15foothigh fences and a 
3000member security force was on full alert following the recent 
arrests of suspected japanese red army terrorists in the united 
states and the philippines 
japanese terrorist groups were linked to rocket and bomb attacks 
during the last two summits in tokyo and venice 
were equipped to deal with anything that might happen said 
metropolitan police superintendent bernard nadeau 
security was especially tight at the six downtown hotels hosting 
presidents reagan and francois mitterrand of france prime 
ministers margaret thatcher of britain mulroney noboru takeshita 
of japan and ciriaco de mita of italy chancellor helmut kohl of 
west germany and european community commission president jacques 
delors 
kohl visited the university of toronto where he received an 
honorary doctor of law degree and announced a fiveyear program 
enabling canadian scientists to study at the west german research 
institute of their choice he spent friday evening with a group of 
germancanadians in kitchener ont 
takeshita arrived here friday after a oneday stopover in 
vancouver 
mrs thatcher de mita and delors arrive saturday and reagan 
and mitterrand go straight to sundays official welcoming ceremony 
the british prime minister is the senior leader having taken 
office in may 1979 but reagan gets preference in protocol since he 
is head of state as well as head of government queen elizabeth ii 
is head of state in britain 
in a presummit interview with the toronto star published 
friday reagan said he will ask his partners for help in resettling 
5 million afghan refugees back into their country following the 
withdrawal of soviet troops 
they literally come home with nothing he said 
reagan also looks for action on reducing the burden of farm 
subsidies which has drained treasuries while producing wasteful 
surpluses but he said we must do it in a way that does not 
suddenly pull the rug out from under farmers in any of our 
countries 
each nation is bringing its own agenda from italys concern 
about acid rain to a threepronged british plan for easing third 
world debt 
the final communique on tuesday is expected to urge more 
structural reforms such as deregulation tax reform and 
privatization to promote growth and avert protectionism 
the 14th economic summit is the first ever held in a major north 
american city the security curtain in canadas largest metropolis 
upset some residents including student and antiwar protest groups 
denied permission to gather anywhere near the meeting site 
why when these guys get together is it that all of the basic 
rights we are supposed to be celebrating in the western world 
suddenly disappear opposition legislator bob rae complained in 
the ontario legislature 
fifty toronto prostitutes marched to royal canadian mounted 
police headquarters to protest sweeps resulting in 723 charges 
against streetwalkers and their clients prostitution is legal in 
toronto but solicitation is not 
its as if politicians think these foreign visitors are 
smalltown kids and are going to be offended complained valerie 
scott of the canadian organization for the rights of prostitutes

the international family feud over use of the 
gucci name for retail sales was partially settled friday with a 
federal judge ruling the grandson of the companys founder cannot 
use his own name as a trademark 
gucci is barred from designing and selling merchandise under the 
company name paolo gucci as he has in the past the judge said 
but us district judge william c conner in a 33page 
decision ruled paolo gucci can attach his name to other 
trademarked products 
paolos name can follow an existing trademark for example 
american tourister luggage by paolo gucci the judge wrote but 
his name cannot be more prominent than the trademark and there 
must be a disclaimer that he does not work for gucci conner said 
it is clear that if paolo gucci were to continue to use 
his name as a trademark or a trade name an appreciable number of 
consumers would confuse his goods with those of the defendant 
conner wrote in his ruling 
an attorney for gucci shops inc which has 21 stores around 
the united states was in a meeting at his washington office and 
was unavailable for comment on the ruling the company sought to 
block paolo from using the gucci name on competing products 
paolo 57 is now designing lamps sunglasses furniture 
sleepwear bedding accessories wall covering lingerie plates and 
flatware 
i just got off the phone with paolo from london and hes 
thrilled totally ecstatic said his attorney randy lipsitz 
he considers this a complete victory 
paolo the grandson of company founder guccio gucci was ousted 
from the company following a family dispute in 1978 despite 
attempts to patch things up with his cousin maurizio now owner of 
50 percent of the company the pair have instead ended up in court 
settling their differences 
the suit settled friday was filed five years ago the cousins 
are embroiled in another legal fight currently before an 
arbitration panel in geneva switzerland

bond prices tumbled friday on a combination of 
inflation and interestrate worries pushing longterm interest 
rates over 9 percent again and more than erasing a big price rise 
earlier in the week 
prices of the treasurys closely watched 30year bond dropped 1 
points or 1250 for every 1000 in face value more than half of 
the decline occurred in very light activity in the afternoon 
session analysts said 
over the past three trading sessions the price of the long bond 
has fallen about 30 more than offsetting the 21 gain it made 
tuesday on news of a narrower us trade deficit in april 
as prices fell friday the 30year bonds yield rose to 909 
percent from 898 percent late thursday yields had fallen to 881 
percent on tuesday last week the long bonds yield finished at 
904 percent 
analysts said the latest decline in prices reflected a 
continuation of the markets reappraisal of the outlook for 
interest rates and inflation 
people are looking at the economy more closely said harold 
nathan economist for wells fargo amp co the economy still remains 
robust and strong enough to generate inflation 
nathan said the markets mood is so sour that it shrugged off a 
commerce department report friday that housing construction 
plummeted 122 percent in may the steepest drop in five months 
a report indicating economic weakness is usually seen by bond 
traders as an encouraging development because it indicates there 
may be weaker demand for credit and less inflationary pressure 
stronger credit demand pushes interest rates higher and bond prices 
lower while inflation erodes bond values 
robert chandross chief economist for lloyds bank in new york 
said the market is preoccupied with speculation that the west 
german central bank may tighten its monetary policy and that other 
central banks may follow its lead in encouraging higher interest 
rates 
he expects rates will work higher over the next few months 
with yields on 30year treasury bonds approaching 10 percent by the 
end of september 
nathan of wells fargo said he also feels the trend in interest 
rates is upward and expects the long bond could yield 975 percent 
by late august 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues fell point intermediate maturities fell by 
point to point and 20year issues lost point according to 
figures provided by telerate inc a businessinformation service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures prioces of all treasury issues with maturities of a year 
or longer fell 647 to 114402 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer lost 226 to 28067 
in the taxexempt market prices fell point according to the

yields on threemonth treasury bills rose 8 basis points to 637 
percent a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point

the disposable contact lens introduced 
on a limited basis in this country only last year will be much 
more visible this summer 
on friday bausch amp lomb the nations leading maker of contact 
lenses and related solutions introduced its entry into the 
disposable market called seequence 
the lenses designed for replacement every one to two weeks 
will cost a customer between 300 and 500 a year and will be test 
marketed in six cities in california and florida 
they are a further extension of the companys fresh lens 
frequent replacement program started in 1985 which calls for 
periodic office visits and new lenses every month or several months 
about 75000 patients are enrolled in that program in the united 
states and overseas 
we see that the entire concept of dispoale contact lenses has 
a lot going for it said franklin jepson a spokesman for bausch 
amp lomb we think people are realizing theres other reasons to 
replace a contact lens besides having lost one torn one or not 
being able to see out of one 
meanwhile the company that first brought disposable contact 
lenses to the untied states vistakon inc of jacksonville fla a 
wholly owned subsidiary of johnson amp johnson is planning a news 
conference on tuesday to announce that its acuvue lenses will be 
available nationally in july 
vistakon has been quite pleased with its sales so far in 
florida and california where it launched the disposable lenses 
last year said dr sheldon wechsler a company vice president 
disposable soft contact lenses are being touted as healthier for 
the eye and easier to use than both dailywear lenses which have 
to be disinfected each night and extendedwear lenses which have 
been cited as contributing to some eye ailments because theyre 
worn for long periods of time 
the disposable lenses are not significantly different than 
lenses currently on the market said irving aarons an analyst who 
follows the eye care industry for arthur d little inc in 
cambridge mass 
the difference between conventional and disposable lenses stems 
from the cost of making and packaging them aarons said the 
wholesale cost of soft contact lenses is about 8 to 12 but 
vistakon sells its disposable lenses for about 250 a pair aarons 
said 
bausch amp lomb is following on the coattails of vistakon with 
its disposable lenses but wants to make sure it has something on 
the market in case disposable contact lenses skyrocket aarons said 
the disposable contact lens concept started in denmark in the 
mid1980s and has been used there and in scandanavia since

collision damage waivers charged by car rental companies 
under the model drawn up at the national association of 
insurance commissioners conference rental car companies would no 
longer be able to sell collision damage waiver insurance and they 
not the customer would be liable for any damage to a rental car 
the model legislation is aimed at keeping car rental companies 
from selling consumers insurance they do not need the 
commissioners believe that many car rental customers are covered 
under their private auto policies 
nebraska insurance commissioner william mccartney head of the 
national groups market conduct surveillance task force said the 
naic subgroup on rental car insurance began looking into the 
problem more than a year ago

waivers known as cdws which cost an average of about 10 a day 
mccartney said the group concluded the waivers were too 
expensive the contracts too vague and that they allow for such a 
broad interpretation that the coverage may be worthless 
the result is the proposal endorsed friday at the end of the 
weeklong national conference held in new york 
the primary drawback to the proposal is that rental companies 
would likely hike basic rental fees to cover the cost of assuming 
responsibility for damaged cars 
mccartney said he hoped that would not be the case and that the 
proposed legislation would protect consumers from the confusion 
and abuses inherent in the current practices of selling cdws 
the commissioners will now take the proposal back to their state 
legislatures in hopes of having it enacted 
we are definitely in support of legislation that would result 
in the abolishment of cdws and have been working with people on the 
state level about this issue for some time said demetria mudar 
a spokeswoman for avis based in garden city ny 
we certainly endorse anything that moves us closer to the 
elimination of cdws all across the united states said joseph 
russo of hertz 
he said hertz based in park ridge nj was concerned that 
some car rental companies were not treating cdws as an option and 
were in fact using coercion and intimidation making it virtually 
mandatory for customers to buy cdws instead of the option that it 
should be 
not all of the companies favored the proposal 
liz clarke of alamorentacar said the consumer would end up 
paying in the end 
no car rental company can absorb the full cost of damages to 
its fleet without passing substantial increases in rental rates to 
100 percent of its rental base she said

united airlines filed a complaint friday with the 
department of transportation charging japan air lines with unfair 
competitive practices for blocking japanese travel agents from 
using uniteds apollo computerized reservations system 
the complaint filed in washington contends that jal has 
engaged in discriminatory and anticompetitive practices which 
restrict uniteds access to japanese markets for its apollo system 
while we regret that we have to take a step as serious as this 
filing we must protect our rights to do business in japan said 
john r zeeman uniteds executive vice president for marketing and 
planning in a statement released friday 
jals denial of access to united and covia in japan is 
inconsistent with the basic principles of reciprocity and is 
detrimental to the commercial relationship between the united 
states and japan he said 
covia is the computer reservations subsidiary of ual corp 
uniteds parent and operates the apollo system 
morris simoncelli jals deputy director for public relations 
said he was aware of the complaint but the airlines lawyers in 
washington had not yet seen it 
we cant comment until we have a chance to look at it said 
simoncelli contacted by telephone at jals new york city office 
uniteds complaint alleges that jal has violated the 
international air transport associations fair competitive 
practices act by refusing to permit japanese travel agents to use 
apollo to write tickets on jal in japan 
at the same time there are no restrictions on jal using its own 
computerized reservation system jalcom to write tickets on united 
in japan said rob doughty a united spokesman 
he said us travel agents were also free to issue tickets on 
jal using the apollo system 
united has been trying for more than two years to obtain the 
rights to have apollo issue tickets on jal in japan but jal has so 
far refused to sign the international ticketwriting agreement 
required by japanese banks for settling payments from one airline 
to another doughty said 
the complaint contends that jals refusal to grant ticketing 
authority to united preserves the japanese carriers domestic 
monopoly for its own reservation system 
doughty said uniteds reservations system was more 
sophisticated and offers more benefits than jals but japanese 
travel agents were reluctant to purchase apollo because they could 
not use it to make bookings on jal 
the complaint did not specify how much united has lost in 
potential revenue from jals practices doughty said 
doughty said united hoped that filing the complaint would lead 
jal to lift its restrictions on issuing tickets 
if jal remained intransigent united would ask that the 
transportation department impose forceful retaliatory action 
against jal by barring it from using any us computer reservations 
system for booking and ticketing

california insurance regulators on friday 
denied batus incs application to buy farmers insurance group 
inc dealing a potential death blow to the kentucky companys 45 
billion hostile takeover bid 
insurance commissioner roxani gillespie said the decision was 
based on a section of the state insurance code that forbids 
ownership of an insurer by government agencies 
there are governmental entities or agencies that together own 
more than 10 percent of bats stock ms gillespie said in a news 
release referring to batus british parent bat industries plc 
were delighted said farmers spokesman tom welch 
batus announced that it would sue to have the decision reversed 
batus believes the departments interpretation is 
unconstitutional and will promptly take appropriate legal action to 
reverse the departments decision the company said in a news 
release farmers and many other california insurance companies 
count government entities among their shareholders said batus 
spokesman wilson wyatt 
government investors in bat include british city councils and 
pension funds and foreign governments including some arab 
governments ms gillespie said the government entities together 
own more than 10 percent of the company but no one entity owns more 
than 2 percent she said she didnt know the exact percentage of 
government ownership of batus 
management of farmers the nations thirdlargest auto and home 
insurer opposes the takeover which batus has been pressing in a 
3month tender offer of 63 a share for all outstanding farmers 
stock before the decision was publicized friday batus announced 
that holders of 28 percent of farmers stock had offered to sell at 
that price 
if batus were able to acquire a controlling interest in farmers 
it would still need approval of insurance regulators in nine states 
in which farmers does business californias approval was 
considered pivotal since farmers is based in los angeles 
arizona the only other state to rule on the matter approved 
batus application 
ms gillespie rejected to farmers arguments that batus was 
unfit to own an insurance company because it also owns cigarette 
companies she said in a telephone interview from her san francisco 
office 
nor was she swayed by a parade of elected state and municipal 
officials who publicly denounced the takeover because bat has 
business interests in racially segregated south africa 
farmers had suggested that its nonsmoker discounts wouldnt 
continue under batus and that tobacco product liability suits 
could drain batus resources 
we did take a look at those issues but we did not find against 
bat on those issues she said 
aside from the government ownership batus met all the tests for 
eligibility to own a california insurer ms gillespie said 
she declined to speculate on the rationale for the prohibition 
on government ownership of an insurer but said the commission 
staff always interprets the code to mean the 10 percent limit 
applies to aggregate ownership by government entities 
this narrow approach has always been the approach of the staff 
in these cases ms gillespie said 
batus owns brown amp williamson tobacco corp maker of kool 
viceroy raleigh and belair cigarettes and retailers including saks 
fifth avenue in new york 
farmers with 11 billion in assets is the nations 
thirdbiggest home and auto insurer and seventhlargest property 
and casualty insurer 
batus had extended the deadline on its tender offer which was 
set to expire thursday until july 14
