joel steinberg was sentenced friday to the 
maximum 8 13 to 25 years in prison for killing his illegally 
adopted daughter in a case that riveted national attention on the 
problems of domestic violence 
steinberg a disbarred attorney spoke about the charges for the 
first time just before he was sentenced by state supreme court 
justice harold rothwax in manhattan on his manslaughter conviction 
for the 1987 death of 6yearold lisa steinberg rothwax 
recommended against parole 
his extraordinary narcissism and selfinvolvement his extreme 
need to control everyone led him to become the instrument of 
lisas death rothwax said before passing sentence there is 
nothing in the record to mitigate the extreme callousness and 
harshness of his conduct 
steinberg denied hitting the girl and said she received 
constant love 
those children were not locked in a house of horror 
steinberg said of lisa and the infant boy he also adopted illegally 
but assistant district attorney john mccusker told the court 
lisas death resulted from steinbergs life of violence 
selfishness and selfgratification at the expense of other people 
mr steinberg has shown not one ounce of remorse for killing 
elizabeth mccusker said 
i understand the meaning of remorse said steinberg 47 who 
did not testify at his trial i have remorse about losing my 
life 
i feel that pain every day steinberg told the judge adding 
that the loss belongs to all those whose life lisa touched and 
received the love that she gave 
hedda nussbaum steinbergs battered companion watched the 
sentencing on television at the manhattan office of her attorney 
betty levinson who quoted her as saying how can he stand there 
and lie with such a straight face 
he just got up there and lied and shes furious ms 
levinson said of ms nussbaums reaction to steinbergs statements 
he was weaving together this totally untrue and fantastic 
rendition of what happened 
steinberg was convicted jan 30 of firstdegree manslaughter in 
lisas death but was acquitted of the more serious charge of 
seconddegree murder he had received the child at birth from an 
unmarried teenager and raised her as his own rather than 
fulfilling his promise to arrange for the babys adoption 
on nov 2 1987 lisa was taken unconscious from the greenwich 
village apartment steinberg shared with hedda nussbaum a 
16monthold boy also was found and eventually returned to his 
natural mother 
lisa died three days later murder charges were filed against 
steinberg and ms nussbaum charges against ms nussbaum were 
dropped when prosecutors said she was so physically and mentally 
incapacitated on the night of the murder that she was not 
criminally responsible for lisas death 
in testimony against steinberg ms nussbaum described an 
11year relationship with him that included beatings brainwashing 
food deprivation bizarre punishments and drug use 
steinberg told the judge lisa received constant nurturing 
constant caring constant love and desribed their relationship as 
joyous superb delightful 
steinberg said he regretted a delay in medical attention that 
may have contributed to lisas death 
i feel i should have sensed when i came home a need for 
medical attention he said if there was anything wrong with 
lisa when i left i would not have left 
he denied hitting the child but said i dont deny that 
during the course of administering cpr ok i could have caused 
some injury he dispassionately discussed the technical aspects 
of lisas bruises 
the testimony established joel was basically a fine human 
being defense attorney perry reich said 
steinberg had a happy and cheerful nature and never hit 
lisa reich said 
steinberg smiled chuckled and fidgeted while his lawyers 
offered lengthy presentencing motions 
behind them sat michele launders lisas biological mother and 
grace ann smiegel the grandmother of travis steinbergs other 
illegally adopted child both women cried when the sentence was 
delivered and mrs smiegel nodded in approval 
its a lie ms launders said after steinbergs declaration 
of mourning i dont believe he feels anything i dont think he 
has the capability to feel for anybody but himself 
four jurors and an alternate from the trial also attended the 
sentencing i think he deserved the maximum said juror allen 
jared 
society should be protected from him said juror helena 
barthell i think hes a very violent person who committed a 
terrible heinous crime 
under the general practice in new york steinberg would serve a 
maximum of 16 years and eight months twothird of the legal 
maximum if he earns time off for good behavior 
technically steinberg will be eligible for parole in seven 
years because he has served 16 months of the 8 13year minimum 
term since he has been held without bail from the time of his 
arrest on nov 2 1987 
reich said a notice of appeal was filed friday adding were 
very optimistic it is fair to say this was just round one 
rothwax received hundreds of letters from adoptive parents 
childless couples and people abused as children urging him to 
give steinberg the maximum term in lisas beating death 
we had recommended that he get the maximum few defendants 
have so richly deserved that recommendation district attorney 
robert morgenthau said later we hope the case serves as a 
catalyst to stem child and drug abuse 
court sources said the letters came from around the country and 
as far away as alaska and florida none of the letters recommended 
leniency for steinberg the sources said some demanded the death 
penalty which new york does not have

a 50pound mountain lion was seized 
thursday in a onebedroom long island apartment where it had spent 
the last few months running around bouncing off the furniture 
a state spokesman said 
it was fully clawed not an ideal pet for an apartment said 
scott florence an officer with the state department of 
environmental conservation 
he said the owner whose name was not made public but who lived 
in deer park called our wildlife unit last monday and said he 
wanted to turn the cat in 
the owner said he had bought it as a 3monthold kitten and 
thought it would be a neat thing to have but then it apparently 
outgrew its cuteness florence said the owner was charged with 
possession of an endangered species 
the cat was just being kept in his apartment florence said 
he kept it in a small room he put it on a leash when we got 
there 
he had a dog in there and the 50pound mountain lion in there 
running around bouncing off the furniture said greg drossel 
general manager of the long island game farm in manorville where 
the cougar was taken 
shes in very good shape like a big tabby he said the cat 
6 months old and 18 inches high about a third of its fullgrown 
size had all its teeth 
drossel said the farm would keep the cat as a favor for the state 
until the dec decided what to do with it its not like they could 
take it to bideawee and hope some one adopts it drossel said

house passage of a plan to raise the minimum 
wage shifts the partisan battle to the senate where the leading 
proponent of an increase is urging president bush to refrain from 
further veto threats while congress settles on a final bill 
the house voted 248171 thursday in favor of legislation that 
would raise the minimum wage from the current 335 an hour to 455 
by october 1991 with the first increase taking effect later this 
year 
the house then joined the senate on an easter recess that ends 
april 3 
high on the senate agenda when it returns is a bill sponsored by 
sen edward m kennedy dmass that would raise the minimum wage 
to 465 by 1992 
kennedy has said he is open to amending his bill and in a 
statement issued after the house vote he asked bush who has 
threatened to veto any attempt to raise the hourly minimum above 
425 to keep an open mind until the house and senate agree on a 
bill 
this is an excellent opportunity for congress and the 
administration to demonstrate that they can work together and in 
doing so achieve a fair increase in the minimum wage and an honest 
training wage kennedy said 
bush has insisted that a sixmonth subminimum training wage 
covering all newly hired employees be created in any legislation to 
raise the minimum wage a provision he said will help offset 
potential job losses caused by raising the minimum 
sponsors of the house bill while disputing gop projections of 
massive job losses added a provision allowing a subminimum wage to 
be paid to new hires for two months provided it was their first job 
that falls far short of the white house demand and with kennedy 
also opposed to bushs trainingwage proposal that issue likely 
will be a major sticking point in any attempts to reach a compromise 
several republicans insisted that democrats were going to have to 
give in to bush who appears to have the votes to sustain a veto 
or let a ninth year pass without any change in the minimum wage 
the question is do you want a bill or do you want a political 
issue rep steve gunderson rwis said during an unsuccessful 
gop effort to substitute bushs proposal for the house leaderships 
measure if you truly want to raise the minimum wage this is the 
only game in town 
but democrats argued they had given enough by cutting the final 
increase from 465 an hour to 455 and by adding the newhire wage 
as amended the house bill would boost the minimum wage to 385 
an hour on oct 1 to 425 on oct 1 1990 and to 455 a year 
later the provision for the newhire wage to be pegged at 85 
percent of the minimum wage would expire sept 30 1992 
it also would expand exemptions allowing small businesses to pay 
wages lower than the minimum wage and would allow employers of 
workers who earn tips to pay them 50 percent of the minimum wage 
down from the current 60 percent 
current law exempts service businesses with annual sales of less 
than 362000 from the minimumwage law the house bill increased 
that level to 500000 the provision is rarely used however 
because of confusing regulations lawmakers say will be simplified in 
conference committee if the senate passes a minimumwage bill

fresh chilean grapes are being trucked across 
the country today after a twoweek absence from store shelves 
because of a cyanide poisoning scare industry leaders say 
consumers may see slightly higher prices on the produce 
initially but prices are expected to drop back to prescare levels 
in a couple of weeks when supply catches up with demand they said 
losses to chilean exporters and to us fruit importers as a 
result of the cyanide scare over grapes and other produce are 
estimated at 240 million ronald s bown executive director of the 
chilean exporters association said thursday 
some of those losses may be offset by a plan being developed by 
the chilean government to compensate us importers wholesalers and 
retailers as well as chilean growers and exporters bown said 
officials at the chilean embassy in washington did not return 
telephone calls for comment on the plan thursday 
an estimated 50 million to 75 million worth of chilean fruit is 
being destroyed under the us food and drug administrations 
advisory that was issued after the agency on march 12 found traces 
of cyanide in two grapes from chile earlier in the month an 
anonymous caller to the us embassy in the chilean capital of 
santiago had threatened to inject cyanide in export fruit 
some 2 million to 3 million crates of the fruit grapes 
berries pears nectarines peaches melon and apples had been 
removed from store shelves or was being held in warehouses until the 
fda concluded last week that it would have to be destroyed because 
it could not be readily inspected 
the fda then announced a plan for steppedup inspections of 
chilean fruit at the docks and on ships to clear the way for the 
chilean exports to get back into the stores with safety assurances 
bown said the chilean fruit industry is anticipating a 
sustained level of consumer demand in the united states and is 
doing all it can to ensure that fruit coming from chile will be 
fresh nutritious of premium quality and available at a 
reasonable price 
the reason he said is simple the us is by far our biggest 
and best customer and we want to keep it that way 
exporters are concentrating their efforts on returning table 
grapes to us markets since they constitute 70 percent of chilean 
fruit exports pears and nectarines will follow and should be on 
some store shelves by the weekend bown said 
there was no estimate when other fruits may begin appearing the 
fda has been holding up distribution until laboratory tests can give 
inspectors a better idea how to see evidence of cyanide tampering 
prices initially may be slightly higher than they had been 
before the scare began because of pentup demand said george f 
carstens president of the american produce association which 
represents 65 companies that import chilean fruit 
when you return fruit to the pipeline the initial demand will 
be very very strong and the initial impact of the first few 
days might be perhaps slightly higher in terms of our prices to the 
retailers he said 
speaking for retailers charles tryon director of produce for 
3200 super valu stores and presidentelect of the produce marketing 
association said we wont see dramatic increases in costs 
neither bown nor david holzworth general counsel for the chilean 
exporters association would discuss details of the chilean 
governments plan for compensation 
holzworth said the chileans are negotiating with the world bank 
on a line of credit so that chile can set up a financial structure 
that will allow importers working with their buyers to get the fruit 
that must be destroyed out of the pipeline and get new shipments 
of fresh fruit back in us stores

farm state lawmakers say the us department of 
agriculture is mishandling last years emergency drought relief and 
ignoring this years arid potentially disastrous conditions on the 
high plains 
rep bill sarpalius a texas democrat and member of house 
agriculture subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains said 
the texas panhandle is extremely dry yet he cant find out from 
anybody what we can do to help our farmers 
at a hearing thursday an angry rep pat roberts rkan said 
the central part of the country is blowing away and i cant 
get any damn answers because of the bush administrations slow 
pace in filling key policy jobs at usda 
people are crawling out of train wrecks faster than theyre 
getting people on board roberts said during a subcommittee 
hearing on usdas handling of the 39 billion drought bill 
milton hertz administrator of usdas agricultural stabilization 
and conservation service countered that farmers receiving drought 
benefits do not face an undue paperwork burden he also said he 
doesnt believe the agency has suffered during the transition to the 
bush administration 
as of feb 28 more than 558000 producers have received disaster 
payments and emergency feed assistance amounting to more than 27 
billion hertz testified 
the amount paid to date represents 70 percent of what the agency 
anticipates will go to farmers stricken by the devastating drought 
of 1988 he said 
hertz said he was not aware of efforts at usda to draft 1989 
drought relief although subcommittee chairman rep dan glickman 
dkan said its no secret the central part of america is blowing 
away right now 
sarpalius said he supports another droughtrelief bill this year 
because texas panhandle wheat crops are burned up and decimated 
by insects livestock also has suffered 
agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas said 
drought conditions extend from north dakota to south texas 
the dust is blowing the seed wont germinate said de la 
garza asking hertz to determine whether farmers must plant seed 
when they know it wont germinate in order to collect disaster 
relief 
ron rivinius an elgin nd wheat producer and 
secretarytreasurer of the national association of wheat growers 
inc said congress needs to consider extending drought disaster 
assistance 
g chandler keys iii director of congressional relations for the 
national cattlemens association said usda had problems 
misunderstandings foulups and general disregard for the intent of 
congress when promulgating regulations for emergency livestock 
feeding programs under the drought bill 
for all the good intentions in the drought bill it may be for 
naught with many livestock producers because of the lack of good 
followthrough and good faith on the part of the usda keys said

southern schools are the nations most 
integrated as a result of court orders and federal compliance plans 
dating from two decades ago but a new report says clear signs of 
erosion are threatening their achievements 
alabama and mississippi show major increases in segregation and 
have joined the list of the nations most segregated states for 
black students said the study released thursday by the national 
school boards association 
other southern and border states including florida are 
experiencing gradual declines that may reflect a failure by many 
fastgrowing districts to update their desegregation plans the 
report says 
the report based on federal statistics cited encouraging trends 
in blackwhite integration through mandatory citysuburban busing 
plans in st louis las vegas indianapolis and elsewhere 
but the picture was uniformly grim for hispanics hispanic 
students are becoming more highly segregated in virtually every part 
of the country and among each major subgroup the report said 
hispanic students are increasingly isolated in center cities with 
declining white enrollments it said and have been largely ignored 
by the government agencies and civil rights groups that brought 
about the desegregation of black schools 
the march to school integration is certainly not over and 
school systems are finding no quick and easy solutions james 
oglesby presidentelect of the association said in issuing the 
study of desegregation trends from 1968 to 1986 
at the national level the study found that school desegregation 
remained relatively stable in the 1980s in spite of the harsh 
attacks by the reagan administration and the widespread impression 
that the policy was being abandoned 
nevertheless the study said the federal government should end 
its attacks on school desegregation and its efforts to dismantle 
plans that are stable other positive steps would be to resume 
research on effective desegregation techniques and offer assistance 
to districts trying to desegregate it said 
gary orfield a university of chicago professor and coauthor of 
the study suggested that the nation make a concerted effort to 
achieve residential integration which would automatically result in 
integrated local schools he also said rapidly developing areas 
should update their desegregation plans 
the report uses federal statistics to rate regions states and 
cities on their desegregation efforts orfield said it is not meant 
as a commentary on the quality of education in particular 
communities but noted there is a very strong relationship 
between high minority student populations low test scores and high 
dropout rates 
the study said hispanic segregation has always been worst among 
puerto ricans in the northeast but statistics show alarming trends 
elsewhere the percentage of hispanic enrollment in 
90percentto100 percent minority schools rose from 68 percent in 
1968 to 235 percent in 1986 in the midwest and from 117 percent 
to 247 percent in the west 
the growing proportion of hispanic students and the lack of major 
desegregation litigation suggest a future of continuingly 
increasing segregation the report said 
for blacks the most segregated states are illinois and new york 
while integration is at its highest levels in the south we made 
the largest effort in the south and it had the largest impact but 
were beginning to see in the 1980s a slow resegregation of the 
south orfield said 
the most striking example of the trend is in alabama the report 
said the percent of the states black students attending schools 
with white majorities fell by 8 percent in the 1980s the proportion 
of students in highly segregated schools rose by 93 percent in the 
1980s and the percent of white enrollment in a typical black 
students school fell almost to the level of 1970 before the 
implementation of the large urban busing orders 
in contrast to the black and hispanic experiences the study says 
asian students are not segregated the average asian student attends 
a school with a majority of whites 20 percent asians and 25 percent 
blacks and hispanics

fierce winds have eroded nearly 47 million 
acres of land in the great plains this winter one of the most 
extensive losses on record according to an agriculture department 
survey 
much of this damage is due to the drought wilson scaling 
chief of the departments soil conservation service said thursday 
we went into the wind erosion season with poor cover in much of 
the great plains because of the drought then this winter weve had 
a combination of no snow cover and highvelocity winds in many 
areas 
scaling said 88 percent of the acreage damaged was cropland with 
rangeland accounting for most of the remainder 
the scs surveys great plains damage annually from nov 1 through 
the following may 31 a sevenmonth period when winds are highest 
and soils are driest the damage to 47 million acres was through 
february 
scaling said the northern plains were hard hit with montana 
showing damage to nearly 14 million acres about 30 percent of the 
10state total losses in montana and wyoming have been greater than 
at any time since scs began the regular surveys in 1955 
agency records go back to the mid1930s but figures for some of 
those years were obtained from other sources 
the worst damage was done to about 16 million acres in 195455 
although the old dust bowl probably exceeded that in the early 1930s 
before annual figures were compiled 
but the 198788 season was bad too with more than 13 million 
acres damaged in the region another was in 198081 when the agency 
reported 125 million acres 
land is considered winddamaged when the effects of wind are 
apparent to the eye by that time according to conservationists 
the erosion rate has reached about 15 tons per acre a year usually 
at least three times faster than is tolerable or naturally 
replaceable 
a loss of five tons per acre translates into a layer of soil 
about the thickness of a dime spread over one acre 
scaling said farmers used emergency tillage on more than a 
million acres to help reduce the blowing by roughing the surface 
exposed to wind texas accounted for 80 percent of the emergency 
tillage about 880000 acres 
in addition to the land damaged during the fourmonth period 
scaling said more than 225 million acres were in condition to 
blow as of march 1 the most in 32 years highest on the list are 
kansas north dakota and texas he said 
according to the survey which was made in 541 counties of the 
regions 10 states here is the statebystate breakdown comparing 
damaged acres in november december january and february with the

a new 55page handbook has been designed by the 
agriculture department to help farmers shippers and local 
communities cope with the loss of railroad service 
martin buzz fitzpatrick jr head of the departments office 
of transportation said thursday the handbook contains information 
on rural rail assistance from a number of sources and summarizes 
regulations as these apply to rail abandonments 
many of the lightdensity branch lines being cast off are 
located in agricultural regions he said without rail 
transportation the marketing options of local producers are 
limited 
the topics include abandonments alternatives to abandonment and 
guidelines for evaluating the possibility of small railroad 
operations information is included for potential buyers who have 
little or no railroad experience 
fitzpatrick said many if not all of the major railroad 
companies have programs or plans for assisting in line sales and 
many of those have worked with rural communities and shippers to 
explore ways of retaining rail service this information is also in 
the handbook he said 
copies of the booklet are being sent to federal state and local 
organizations involved in rural railroad service assistance he 
said a limited supply is available free of charge for general 
distribution

the agriculture department says egg production 
is down about 6 percent from a year ago mostly reflecting a sharp 
cutback by producers because of low prices last year 
total production during the first three months of the marketing 
year that began dec 1 was estimated at 167 billion eggs down from 
177 billion a year earlier the department said thursday in a 
report 
as of march 1 laying hens totaled 271 million down from 282 
million a year ago the march 1 flock included about 232 million 
hens producing eggs for consumer use and 389 million producers of 
hatchingtype eggs 
the departments economic research service says 1989 egg 
production is expected to be down around 2 percent from last year 
because of the reduction in laying hens 
producers cut back flocks in response to the lowest net returns 
since usda began estimating those figures in 1972 the agency said

over spicy thai shrimp and piquant vegetables 
in a washington restaurant jampacked with reporters soviet 
ambassador yuri v dubinin exuded glasnost and good cheer 
superpower relations are on the upswing and dubinin was all 
smiles except on natos plan to extend the range of shortrange 
nuclear missiles 
its unacceptable at any rate not for the soviet union but for 
the process we are talking about dubinin said its just 
something which is going against the mainstream of peaceable 
development of the world its something which goes against the 
process of disarmament 
his tone of voice serious dubinin added theres absolutely no 
need to do it because we have begun in europe a historic process of 
reducing forces unilaterally by the soviet union and multilaterally 
in negotiations 
in any event dubinin said the soviet union will not modernize 
its own battlefield nuclear weapons we are strongly in favor of 
beginning negotiations to eliminate this class of weapons too he 
said 
indeed soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is on a disarmament 
offensive and the united states and its allies are caught up in the 
process 
a treaty in 1987 banned all us and soviet intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles negotiations have begun in vienna between nato and 
the warsaw pact to reduce tanks antiaircraft artillery and possibly 
other conventional armor in europe 
and gorbachev is unilaterally cutting soviet defense spending 
withdrawing six tank divisions from eastern europe and has 
announced a projected reduction of 500000 troops overall 
dubinin fielded questions with ease after reading a prepared 
boilerplate speech english is his fourth or fifth language but 
dubinin needed only occasional help from an interpreter and when he 
was done he gave an interview in spanish to a journalist from 
madrid for good measure 
soviet news conferences here and in moscow have become a 
frequent occurrence a few weeks ago dubinin called in american 
reporters at the soviet embassy and answered their questions for 
nearly two hours 
at the session thursday at the thai restaurant dubinin said the 
soviets would be willing to reduce their military aid to nicaragua 
a bone in the us throat as part of a peaceful settlement in 
central america 
he said jews were free to leave the soviet union or to return 
if they wished and even leave again perhaps he suggested with a 
smile they were coming and going for the love of travel 
dubinin said moscow accepts as a reality the growing union in 
western europe and said his government wants to develop a normal 
relationship with the 12country community 
and he declined to criticize the bush administration for delaying 
a resumption of negotiations to reduce longrange nuclear missiles 
the delay is a delay he said its absolutely clear but 
we understand the new administration needs some time to get things 
together its understandable 
the nato plan to make us lance missiles more powerful also is 
running into obstacles within the western alliance west german 
chancellor helmut kohl with support from some other allied leaders 
is seeking a delay 
the united states is determined to go ahead but still has to 
convince kohl whose chance for reelection next year may hinge on 
the missile issue in a country where disarmament forces are strong 
congress meanwhile is unlikely to fund the modernization with 
west germany on the fence 
soviet criticism of the nato plan could deepen the division 
within the alliance whatever the outcome dubinin said the soviets 
would not modernize their own battlefield nuclear weapons 
the ambassador spoke with the confidence of a government that 
seems to believe momentum is on its side

vice president dan quayle has become the 
administration advocate for the strategic defense concept known as 
brilliant pebbles a method of seeding outer space with 
satellites that track and destroy missiles 
in a speech thursday to the navy league of the united states 
quayle stressed the relatively small size comparative low cost and 
fast schedule for development of the satellites 
cost complexity and pace of development are among the issues 
raised by critics of the star wars program 
in short if tests of the brilliant pebbles concept show the 
promise that is expected it could revolutionize much of our 
thinking about strategic defense quayle said in his speech 
the brilliant pebbles technology relies on thousands of small 
satellites that would float freely in space tracking incoming 
missiles and destroying them by colliding with them 
the system based on research under way at the lawrence livermore 
national laboratory has been touted by the retired director of the 
star wars program lt gen james a abrahamson 
quayle however is the first high ranking administration official 
to speak out on brilliant pebbles others have declined to say 
whether the concept might refocus us research on the strategic 
defense initiative 
abrahamson urged the pentagon in february to embrace the 
technology saying it offered better performance and dramatic cost 
reduction over other techniques 
brilliant pebbles could be used in an opening phase of the star 
wars system at a cost of not more than 25 billion according to 
abrahamson 
one administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
on thursday said that while no decisions have been made on whether 
to go with brilliant pebbles it certainly is a very attractive 
prospect and one that is being looked at closely 
quayle also said that despite the soviet unions internal changes 
under president mikhail s gorbachev i know of nothing that has 
occurred since 1983 that should change our thinking about strategic 
defense 
the pentagon has estimated that a firstphase star wars system 
using both groundbased and spacebased weapons and sensors would 
cost about 69 billion critics say the system probably would be far 
more expensive and wouldnt work anyway

showing aaron and nick gerstler pictures of his 
five children rep dick armey explained how each has a different 
personality one son armey said is a worrier 
does he worry about dying asked one of the gerstler brothers 
in a quiet small voice 
armey deftly changed the subject and to the amazement of the 
brothers from desoto texas presented them with a flag that had 
flown over the capitol a day earlier 
is it ours asked aaron 10 
whered you get it asked nick 9 do we get to keep it 
and so began armey promised a great adventure for two children 
with duchennes muscular dystrophy a rare form of the disease that 
usually takes the life of its victims by the age of 15 
with their parents harold w and penny pushing their 
wheelchairs armey in the lead and nicks twin sister angelee 
scampering ahead of everyone the little convoy set out to explore 
the capitol in the dim light of evening when the click of heels on 
the tiled floors resonates through the empty corridors 
the brothers rubbed the feet of will rogers statue for good 
luck saw where machine gun bullets grazed across a table in the 
house chamber three decades ago and blood stains that had seeped 
into a marble staircase during a shootout involving a kentucky 
congressman and newspaper reporter in the early days of 1890 
while on the floor of the house chamber aaron asked armey if the 
lawmakers leave a lot of trash littered about at the end of the day 
they talk a lot of trash said armey a republican from 
texas but they dont mess the place up 
you cant call anybody a bad name armey said explaining how 
congressmen ask each other will the gentleman yield when they 
want to talk

weather and no coats we were really thrilled 
mrs gerstler said the family had expected warmer weather and 
the jackets they had brought werent dressy enough for the white 
house 
she said the trip to washington was the boys first choice for 
their wish with wings ahead of hawaii and all the nintendo games 
ever made the boys are a students with a big interest in social 
studies she said 
i like the building aaron said of the capitol its big i

highway because the country music star has moved 15 miles away

the stretch of us 31e about five miles from mandrells former 
palatial home on old hickory lake the singer moved to joelton last 
year 
there are no hard feelings because she left gregory said

discuss it again april 4 
jeannie ghent a spokeswoman for the performer said there will 
be no ill feelings if the signs come down 
we were so honored when they made that stretch of road but 
with her moving out we dont blame gallatin at all she said 
we were honored by the time we had it

free enterprise has collided with the academy 
awards and everybodys trying to pick up the pieces 
with oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than 10000 
and a chicago trophy company casting alleged academy award clones 
the national academy of motion picture arts and sciences is 
scrambling to make sure oscars golden sheen isnt tarnished by 
hollywood hucksterism 
if you know about an infringement and fail to object to it you 
risk having your trademark become public domain said bruce davis 
the academys executive administrator in explaining the lawsuits 
the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of 
electroplated pewter 
but despite the academys crusade against crass commercialism 
this years awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising 
wrinkle some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to the 
oscar telecast will be equipped with doormounted coolers jammed 
with diet coke cocacola classic and other cocacola co beverages 
when the limo doors swing open in front of the shrine auditorium 
and the celebrities tumble out the coke logo will be on display in 
front of an audience that includes millions around the world 
it seemed like a good marketing opportunity said cocacola 
spokesman ira gleser the academy approached our local bottler in 
los angeles and said were going to have a lot of thirsty people 
but even as the academy embraces this new intrusion of 
merchandising it has lashed out at whatever else it considers a 
blemishing of the oscar name 
when mgmua the distributor of rain man published newspaper 
advertisements touting the films oscar nominations before the 
nominations were even announced the academy issued a harsh 
statement condemning mgmuas promotional gamble after the ads 
appeared rain man collected nine nominations 
we regard this as a serious matter and we have communicated 
our concern said richard kahn president of the academy 
for nearly 50 years the academy has maintained strict security 
around both the nominations and the award winners it also has 
envisoned the statuette itself as something of an icon 
so auctioning the oscar has greatly distressed the academy 
the collectors book store local sponsors of monthly 
entertainment memorabilia auctions has sold off seven oscars in the 
past year including the best picture trophy for 1951s an 
american in paris 15760 marlon brandos best actor prize for 
1954s on the waterfront 13000 and the black and white 
interior decoration oscar for 1941s how green was my valley 
17715 
none were sold by the original recipients heirs or friends who 
had later received the trophies put them on the block 
when malcolm willits the book stores owner announced that he 
would hold a february auction for the 1957 bestpicture trophy for 
around the world in 80 days the academy said enough initiating 
a court action that for now has blocked any future trophy sales 
the academy insists that a contract signed by oscar winners 
mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering 
them to the academy for a nominal fee 
but now that the word is out that these awards are worth 
10000 to 50000 people are reluctant to sell them back to the 
academy for 10 willits said 
the academy has created something of great value here this is 
the most famous award in the world the most instantly recognizable 
award the nobel prize might be a greater honor but people know 
more about what an academy award looks like 
and theyre very limited too theres not too many of them 
around twenty years ago you wouldnt have a movie poster in 
your living room unless you were a college student now you can go 
into beverly hills homes and theres a movie poster and the darn 
things worth 10000 or 20000 dollars 
when the academy won a court order temporarily blocking future 
auctions willits decided to sell his store it seemed to be the 
final straw i dont like lawsuits he said im getting older 
and id like to write movie scripts 
yet the academy has lost its most recent attempt to save its 
trophys integrity a copyright infringement suit brought against 
the houston international film festival was dismissed march 16 in a 
california federal court 
the academy had claimed the lone star statuette designed and 
built by chicagos creative house promotions was practically 
identical to the oscar the court found otherwise

christopher columbus discoveries in the 
new world brought riches to this ancient city in southern spain 
five centuries later columbus is doing it again 
this time it is expo 92 an exhibition commemorating columbus 
voyages it will run for six months and end on oct 12 1992 500 
years to the day the explorer reached land in the caribbean 
expo 92 is a gamble by spains socialist government to catapult 
one of europes most beautiful and most neglected cities into the 
21st century 
on an island across the guadalquivir river from the old citys 
narrow streets and shaded patios construction workers labor under a 
warm sun to transform about 600 acres of largely barren space into 
the biggest international exposition ever held 
the monastery where columbus remains were once buried is being 
restored as the spanish royal pavillion where king juan carlos 
expects to greet dignitaries from the 88 countries including the 
united states that have signed up to take part in expo 92 
a new railroad station will be built on the tracks that run by 
the site and a bullet train will carry passengers to the exhibition 
in half the three hours time it takes now 
but right now seville is snarled in traffic as work progresses on 
dozens of new bridges roads and other public works that must be 
completed by opening day april 20 1992 
in addition to the 922 million the government has budgeted for 
administrative costs and onsite construction authorities will pour 
an estimated 56 billion into public works projects to improve 
roads railways and airports throughout southern spain 
seville is going to have a difficult time because its a small 
city for so much construction said antonio rodriguez almodovar 
who coordinates public works funded by the regional andalusian 
government 
weve got to ask residents for patience and compassion because 
after 1992 this is going to be the most important city in southern 
europe rodriguez added 
the government of prime minister felipe gonzalez a native of 
seville has billed expo 92 as the starting point for the citys 
economic renaissance 
angel ojeda the andalusian autonomous regional tax commissioner 
and a member of the expo 92 corps board of administrators said 
the project is expected to break even on the proceeds from entry 
fees royalties pavillion rental and sponsors contributions 
once the administrative capital of spains overseas empire 
seville now presides over andalusia the countrys poorest region 
where unemployment runs at about 30 percent compared to the national 
jobless rate of 187 percent 
a recent study by the national employment institute estimated the 
exhibition will generate 130000 construction jobs over the next 
four years about 7000 other people will be needed to keep expo 92 
running 
forty million people are expected to visit the exhibition which 
will leave seville with an olympic stadium a communications center 
a huge municipal park several theaters and hundreds of new 
buildings that organizers hope will house a research and development 
complex spain will be the host of the 1992 summer olympics 
six high technology companies ibm alcatel telefonica de 
espana fujitsu rank xerox and siemens have signed contracts to 
convert their pavillions into research and development and 
jobtraining centers after the fair ends 
the expo 92 corp has what it calls the 1993 plan a 
postexhibition project to cut travel time between seville and the 
coastal resort areas of malaga to the southeast huelva to the 
southwest and cadiz to the south rather than massive investments 
in hotels in seville itself the number of hotel beds in seville 
will be doubled however 
its better to improve communication with the huelva coast 
which will be 45 minutes away than build hotels in seville that are 
forced to close in 1993 said jacinto pellon general director of 
the expo 92 corp 
three luxury hotels are planned for the expo 92 site along with 
an expo city of residential units for people who come here to 
set up the exhibitions 
expo 92 project has not missed any construction deadlines so 
far and public works coordinator rodriguez said contracts called 
for all the major public works to be finished on time 
but pellon said poor administrative coordination has held up 
approval of marina de sevilla a private 696million complex that 
includes a civic center 300room hotel a marina and shopping 
center on about 40 acres of public land along the river 
marina de sevillas managing director arturo moya said if the 
city and central governments do not approve the development by may 1 
investors will reconsider the project among the investors is 
management resources of tustin calif which has pledged a 
33percent stake

americas birthplace has big problems and 
its mayor once mentioned as a potential vice president is taking 
the heat 
residents complain about too few police too many dirty streets 
and reduced services they blame mayor w wilson goode whom they 
have forced to back off from a proposed 70 million tax increase 
even a political ally admits the mayor has been a disappoinment 
goode was mentioned as a vice presidential possibility in 1984 by 
democratic presidential candidate walter mondale but that was 
before the 1985 debacle in which 11 people were killed when police 
with goodes goahead confronted the radical move group and forever 
damaged the mayors image 
goode has insisted that things in philadelphia are not as bad as 
critics claim but last week he abruptly halted a telephone 
interview on the first question when asked if the city was in 
trouble 
i dont want to talk about it he said just say the mayor 
doesnt want to comment 
challenges remain for goode the first black mayor in the 
nations fifthlargest city who is nearly halfway through his 
second fouryear term 
fresh off reversing the citys commitment to a new 
courthousejail complex after spending 30 million on it goode 
faces the wrath of the citys legal community and a federal court 
order to relieve prison crowding forced by public pressure to back 
off the tax increase goode is trying to put together a budget amid 
projections of a 100 million deficit and the clamor for more 
services 
even a special tax policy and budget review committee appointed 
by goode rebuffed the mayors tax proposal 
i thought it would be a whitewash and it wasnt that in itself 
indicates the severity of the problem said w thacher longstreth 
the senior republican in city council 
many contend goode hasnt been a good manager and even 
supporters such as edward mezvinsky former pennsylvania democratic 
chairman and cochairman of goodes 1987 reelection campaign 
acknowledge his political dilemma 
hes got to take unpopular positions because there is a lot 
less money available mezvinsky said the city has to make it on 
its own its got to pull in its belt and cut out unnecessary 
services it has to be done if the city is going to survive 
at recent town meetings which goode arranged this winter in a 
futile effort to sell his tax plan tempers frequently flared as 
citizens confronted the frustrated sometimes angry mayor demanding 
more police protection clean streets and charging that drug 
dealers control too many neighborhoods 
former mayor william green under whom goode was city managing 
director declined to discuss the managerial style of his successor 
the facts speak for themselves green said 
several top democrats did not return phone calls or declined to 
comment publicly on the mayors standing the political ally who 
said goode has been a disappoinment would speak only on condition of 
anonymity 
he really isnt running the city well he is not a dishonest 
person and is trying to do his best but integrity isnt enough to 
manage and his mismanagement has allowed his detractors to have a 
field day which has undermined his effectiveness the goode ally 
said 
this city is more divided today than ever before all the blame 
isnt goodes alone others have to share it like the council like 
the business community the judiciary everyone seems to have an axe 
to grind and goode has been unable to bring the diverse elements 
together so the city can be run well the ally said 
republicans looking ahead to this falls district attorney and 
city controller elections smell blood its been nearly four decades 
since republicans last controlled the government of this city which 
has a 3to1 democratic registration 
if you listen you can hear people saying philadelphia is ready 
for a complete change in government and politics said state sen 
m joseph rocks the gop choice for controller 
goode has shown hes listening he said recently he would hire 
400 more police this year and then add 300 more in each of the next 
three years to a force now at about 6000 down from the 7800 when 
he took office in 1984 
councilman james tayoun a democrat often at odds with goode 
said the mayor must cooperate to get things done 
hes now being forced to understand that he has no higher taxes 
in sight that he has to increase the police that he has to clean 
the streets and if he does that the city will begin to turn 
around tayoun said

building on a housetohouse search 
the suspect armed with a mac11 submachine pistol opened fire 
on the two officers hitting one in the chest and neck and wounding 
the other with flying glass as they entered a townhouse in the 
arapahoe ridge subdivision 
the gunman then shot a 18yearold hostage in the back and went 
upstairs and shot himself in the head police said 
all he said was jesus christ jesus christ he shot me and 
then went upstairs and shot himself arapahoe county sheriff pat 
sullivan quoted the hostage jake carper as saying 
a police swat team rescued the wounded officers lobbed flash 
grenades into the house and found the hostage and thompson sullivan 
said 
the gunman was taken with the wounded officers to swedish medical 
center where he died at 556 pm said hospital spokeswoman 
beverly jacobsen 
carper was in critical condition with multiple gunshot wounds 
deputy arthur l hilton 37 was in serious condition with a chest 
wound and deputy daniel thomas 36 was in good condition with a 
leg wound and face cuts hospital officials said 
sullivan a critic of assault rifle sales said the gunman used 
the semiautomatic mac11 which is sold overthecounter and that 
said there was evidence the weapon had been modified to fire fully 
automatic 
when the weapon was recovered there were only five rounds left of 
its 32round magazine he said 
authorities were at a loss to explain a motive for the oneman 
crime wave 
this man is extremely dangerous said douglas county 
sheriffs lt bill walker we have four or five crime scenes and a 
lot of people hurt and injured 
the state department of corrections said its only record of 
thompson was that he had been charged for seconddegree burglary 
but he never served time in state prison apparently having been 
granted probation officials said 
eugene strauber regional vice president of the cenikor 
foundation cocaine residence treatment program in suburban lakewood 
said thompson had been enrolled in the program as part of his 
probation and eventually was kicked out for stealing but never 
hinted at violence 
he left about three months ago we ask people how severe their 
addictions are and he reported he had a 30aday cocaine habit he 
was a very average person not the type who stands out he came 
in at age 20 and had a long history of substance abuse strauber 
said 
he never exhibited mood swings here if he had shown violent 
behavior we would not have allowed him to stay here strauber 
said 
more than 100 officers from three counties and the state patrol 
joined a manhunt in southern metropolitan denver where creeks with 
grassy floodplains run amid housing subdivisions 
authorities said the man broke into a house in jefferson county 
southwest of denver about 3 am and a woman there called a police 
emergency number she hung up before she could give her address but 
authorities traced the call and found her garage door open and the 
woman and a car missing

her home in a burglary gone sour and forced her to drive to the 
home of her motherinlaw janice irene swartz 68 in rural 
littleton

of shootings in a subdivision in douglas county authorities found 
the two women dead and two men in shock 
douglas county sheriff steve zotos said the women were tied up 
and shot with a semiautomatic weapon the two men were tied up but 
not harmed and were able to untie themselves and telephone 
authorities their names were not disclosed 
the gunman then stole a car and drove about 10 miles to a 
southern denver subdivision and pulled in behind a limousine that

limousine and wrecked it a short time later when he crashed into a 
fence authorities said he fled on foot to the arapahoe ridge 
house about three blocks distant and holed up with carper it was 
not immediately clear whether carper was living at the townhouse 
based on the damage to the car authorities believed the man was 
injured in the accident the man was acting erratically and may 
have been taking drugs walker said 
hes high on something high and desperate for some reason

its 6 am in the pino suarez subway station 
and the transit police are dividing the river of morning commuters 
rushing toward the trains women on the right men on the left 
any man found on the wrong side is apt to be publicly humiliated 
excuse me sir a uniformed official said to a young man 
joining his female companion in the womens line 
over there the officer ordered pointing morning commuters 
silently stared as the couple moved over 
mexico city has the only subway system that segregates its 
passengers by sex during rush hour said miguel gerardo requis 
bustos manager of stations and transportation 
women who use the metro on weekdays between 5 am to 9 am and 
4 pm to 9 pm say theres only one reason 
they separate us because the men are abusive they like to grab 
the women said seamstress modesta baez 50 who rides the womens 
cars daily women dont try to grab other women 
itziar lozano a feminist counselor who has been sexually 
harassed on the metro agreed 
although the womens cars are just as crowded and you cant 
move or breathe you dont have to worry about sexual aggression 
lozano said 
requis said the segregated cars which began 10 years ago are 
necessary for maintaining order on the subway the modern system 
daily moves an estimated 5 million people over almost 90 miles of 
track 
it is the only metro in the world that gives additional 
attention to women and children by separating them requis said 
this way they can travel more comfortably 
women can ride in the mens cars during rush hour but men are 
prohibited from the womens cars 
mexico city doesnt have a corner on metro mashing said antonio 
santamaria a psychoanalyst who has written extensively on mexican 
male aggression known as machismo 
he said such harassment occurs elsewhere but the fact that 
segregated subway cars exist only in mexico says a lot about mexican 
culture 
santamaria believes the cars exist because mexican men want to 
protect their women from other men like themselves 
you have to understand that this is a society in which the 
woman is an object something that can be carried away taken he 
said 
ever since the spanish conquistadores ran off with the aztecs 
wives the mexican male has worried other males will try to 
steal his women santamaria said 
that insecurity says santamaria also leads the mexican male to 
try to conquer women who belong to others 
mexican writer octavio paz has said that to the mexican there 
are only two possibilites being the sexual aggressor or the one who 
is violated 
in his collection of essays the labyrinth of solitude paz 
writes one word sums up the male aggressiveness insensitivity 
invulnerability and other attributes of the macho power 
few men interviewed agreed with santamarias theory 
it isnt machismo or a way to protect women from the damned 
mexicans said hector castillo an urban sociologist from the 
national university of mexico its just a space of greater 
comfort for the women and children because the men are stronger

yale university and a chicago 
architectural foundation have chosen a model for 21st century urban 
development des moines 
mario gandelsonas a new york city architect and faculty member 
at yale university will spend much of the next three years studying 
the citys layout and architecture in turn they hope to teach the 
rest of the country how cities should grow 
every city wants to have little skyscrapers growing up said 
gandelsonas and there are secondary office boxes growing up in 
suburbia without any order producing total chaos in the landscape 
without any rational organization 
gandelsonas has studied the development of us cities but he 
has yet to find one that could serve as a futuristic model for the 
city beautiful movement that started in chicago during this 
centurys first decade 
that movement arose from the burnham plan written for the 
columbian exposition in chicago during the early 1900s the plan has 
served as the blueprint for the expansion of that city until now 
in looking for a new city to serve as a model for urban 
development gandelsonas said he wanted a place in the middle of the 
country with a strong architectural heritage a riverfront and a 
healthy economy 
des moines he said was a natural 
des moines has a long tradition of planning which very few 
people know about he said des moines got into planning at the 
turn of the century with chicago and throughout the century there 
have been a number of plans and theres a fantastic architectural 
tradition in des moines 
gandelsonas has been working with the citys artistic business 
and political leaders for several months to start the study he led 
a group of 10 yale graduate students who spent several days taking 
hundreds of photographs of des moines 
since then gandelsonas said he has been constructing computer 
models of des moines at the chicago headquarters of the 
skidmoreowensmerrill foundation 
the work will end in 1992 with the publication of a book showing 
how other american cities can grow by following des moines example 
among his findings so far are that university avenue the citys 
major eastwest thoroughfare serves not only as a physical dividing 
line but also as a socioeconomic meridian for the city he said he 
is also impressed at the physical separation between the state 
capitol and downtown des moines and the views along several downtown 
streets

some legislators want the state to cash in 
on credit cards as a way of balancing demands for increased spending 
and lower taxes 
a house committee on thursday approved legislation that would 
have the state issue mastercard or visa cards for a commission 
if approved by the full house during the next week it would be 
sent to the senate 
this predominantly agricultural state of 804000 residents could 
reap in millions of dollars in extra revenue by sponsoring the card 
said democratic rep mark okeefe 
montanas chief tax collector revenue director ken nordtvedt 
thinks its a good idea 
every organization under the sun is doing this he said i 
have two of those cards in my pocket right now from fraternal 
organizations 
and this being our centennial year where theres a little more 
sense of pride in montana the department of revenue is certainly 
willing to administer such a program he said 
okeefe who sponsored the legislation said the idea came from a 
constituent 
at first i thought the guy was crazy okeefe said but 
the more i looked into it it seemed it was not only legal but it 
might work 
the card would have a special montana design and would be issued 
by banks which would assume all liability and would process the 
transactions okeefe said 
each bank would pay the state a commission perhaps 1 percent of 
sales 
the plan could mean up to 76 million a year for the state 
depending on the terms it negotiates with banks and how popular the 
card becomes okeefe said 
such groups as labor unions wildlife organizations and the 
national rifle association sponsor such affinity cards okeefe 
said banks like the idea because it gives them a broader base of 
cardholders and more interest income 
its such a cutthroat industry that the affinity cards have 
become big business for banks he said it increases the number 
of people who want to carry these cards and all of these 
organizations are making money on it 
okeefe who believes montana would be the first government 
entity in the nation to try the idea took his proposal to the house 
taxation committee this week 
there a lobbyist for the montana league of savings institutions 
liked it so much he proposed an amendment to allow savings and loans 
to participate along with banks 
the panel questioned whether state funds would be at risk under 
such a plan as collateral for credit charged to the cards but 
okeefe said participating banks would assume all the risk 
the bill approved 135 by the committee calls for half the 
money generated by commissions to go to the states general fund 
the rest would be used for public schools which must receive 
more state money because of a february ruling by the state supreme 
court overturning montanas school finance system 
using the card to support public schools would only be right 
okeefe said considering all the retired montanans who spend their 
summers in the mountains but desert montana in the winter for the 
sunbelt 
all of our snowbirds in arizona all winter 1 percent of their 
purchases could come back to fund their grandchildrens education 
okeefe said

am radio waves which have brought so many 
songs that touched the heart are now being used to zap the hearts 
of patients whose rapid heartbeats cant be treated with drugs 
scientists said 
the radiowave method of treating arrhythmia is safer than 
electric shock or surgery researchers reported at the american 
college of cardiologys annual meeting which ended thursday 
the technique being tried by doctors in san francisco and 
europe is like using a ball peen hammer instead of a 
sledgehammer said dr douglas zipes a professor at indiana 
university school of medicine 
like radio waves alcohol also is being applied directly to the 
heart by catheters thin long tubes that are inserted through 
blood vessels to halt various abnormal heart rhythms without 
surgery zipes said 
so far dr jonathan langberg and colleagues at the university of 
california san francisco have used radio waves to control rapid 
heartbeats in 10 patients whose abnormal heart rhythm couldnt be 
treated with drugs 
it failed on six others four of whom then were treated 
successfully with electrical shocks 
langberg said about 1 million americans suffer from 
supraventricular tachycardia which can make the heart beat up to 
200 times a minute causing patients to pass out or suffer shortness 
of breath lightheadedness and occasionally sudden death 
the researchers hope to use radio waves to treat the much more 
serious rapid heartbeat called ventricular tachycardia which kills 
about 500000 mostly older americans a year 
for now patients who have a peasize part of their heart zapped 
to death with radio frequency energy must wear pacemakers afterward 
as do almost all patients who have their abnormal heartbeats fixed 
with the older method of shock said langberg an assistant 
professor of medicine 
but radio waves can be applied in much smaller controlled doses 
than electricity making it safer and less painful he added 
langberg hopes to use radio waves to slow rather than cut the 
cardiac electrical connection that causes rapid heartbeats allowing 
certain patients to do without pacemakers 
dr lawrence epstein also at ucsf and french scientists already 
have done that successfully for one type of rapid heartbeat using 
milder electric shocks 
for arrhythmia patients who arent helped by medication open 
heart surgery to cut faulty electrical connections that cause 
abnormal heartbeats has been supplanted in recent years by catheters 
tipped with electrodes 
dr melvin scheinman who heads the ucsf research team pioneered 
the catheter method seven years ago a pacemaker to maintain normal 
heart rhythm is implanted at the same time 
in the new method also being tried in europe a radio 
transmitter is connected to the catheter which acts as an antenna 
to zap the heart with radio energy at 550 kilohertz near the low 
end of the am dial langberg said 
the method destroys offending heart tissue with only 30 to 40 
volts so it doesnt hurt and can be done with local anesthetic 
where the catheter enters a vein the shock method delivers 1000 
volts and requires general anesthesia 
langberg said the radio wave technique also is safer than shock 
because it doesnt reset the hearts electrical activity or risk 
burning a hole in the heart 
if the radio device can be refined to avert the need for 
pacemakers in those treated with it then many supraventricular 
tachycardia patients may opt to have a onetimeonly hospital 
procedure in lieu of a lifetime of pilltaking langberg said 
researchers also have used alcohol to kill tiny parts of heart 
muscle that cause ventricular tachycardia zipes said five patients 
in holland and two in portland ore have been treated by having 
the alcohol released by catheter into the coronary artery that 
supplies blood to the arrhythmiacausing spot

eight tons of food and medicine was 
airlifted by india into this capital which is surrounded by moslem 
rebels trying to overthrow the afghan government a foreign ministry 
spokesman said today 
rebels meanwhile destroyed a bridge on the main highway linking 
kabul to the strategic eastern city of jalalabad the government 
said thursday 
the antigovernment forces have pressed in on jalalabad in an 
effort to bring about a quick demise of kabuls marxist government 
in the wake of the soviet troop withdrawal 
the afghan capital is surrounded by rebels trying to oust the 
government of president najib and convoys carrying supplies into 
this city of 225 million people are occassionally attacked or 
delayed 
the indian supplies were flown in thursday said the spokesman 
who cannot be identified under briefing rules another shipment of 
nine tons of supplies is being readied the spokesman said today 
from new delhi 
the indian government announced earlier this month that it would 
provide humanitarian and economic assistance to afghanistan 
india is the only nonsoviet bloc nation that maintained 
relations with kabul after the soviet union intervene militarily in 
1979 to prop up its client regime in afghanistan 
the last red army soldiers left afghanistan on feb 15 as part of 
a unsponsored peace accord 
blowing up the bridge could signal a renewal of guerrilla tactics 
rather than direct battle in the 18day battle for jalalabad the 
guerrillas have found it difficult to confront an army with air 
power and longrange missiles 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani told reporters 
thursday that the bridge near sarobi midway between kabul and 
jalalabad was destroyed by explosives planted on the span he said 
the bridge was one of about 100 on the paved highway 
he said three other roads all unpaved and more circuitous 
remain open to military convoys between kabul and the city which is 
75 miles to the east near the khyber pass 
moslem insurgents who are based in pakistan and also backed by 
the united states launched their offensive on the eastern city on 
march 6 but they have not succeeded in dislodging government troops 
soviet troops completed their withdrawal last month after more 
than nine years of intervention in a civil war that began with a 
communist coup in april 1978 the soviets continue providing 
military supplies to kabuls government 
amani said the guerrillas fired 2000 rockets and artillery 
shells at government positions outside jalalabad in the previous 24 
hours 
no government forces were killed but five soldiers and five 
civilians were wounded he said he said 89 guerrillas including 
four local commanders were killed in the same period 
sovietmade scudb rockets have been fired daily from kabul 
toward jalalabad since the battle began according to foreign 
observers and residents of kabul they have a range of at least 175

the markets key index started falling shortly after the start of 
morning trading as market investors began reacting to an overnight 
drop in the dow jones industrial average in new york said tatsuo 
kurokawa with nomura securities in tokyo 
because the tokyo market which has been adjusting its price 
levels recently was not in an uptrend with stockbuying incentives 
the drop in new york stocks directly affected the market he said 
the dollars firmness in foreign exchange dealings also 
discouraged participants kurokawa added

the currency after us federal reserve board governor h robert 
heller indicated he backed a stronger dollar dealers said 
heller in a speech thursday before the richmond virginia

the us trade balance would result in rising import prices

randall dale adams returned home to hugs 
from his mother flowers from well wishers a job offer from the 
mayor and word from texas that a murder charge for which he was 
nearly executed was being dropped 
i couldnt have dreamed this i knew i would be home but not 
this way said adams whose 1977 conviction was questioned in the 
12th year of his prison term by the movie the thin blue line 
adams was set free tuesday a few weeks after the texas court of 
criminal appeals set aside the conviction saying prosecutors had 
suppressed evidence and witnesses had given perjured testimony 
in the film documentary an inmate on death row for another 
murder recanted his testimony against adams and all but confessed to 
the 1976 killing of dallas police officer robert wood 
about 100 people cheered loudly thursday as the 40yearold 
suburban grove city native rushed through an airport gate and into 
the arms of his mother mildred adams 
he was presented with a daffodil lei an ohio state buckeyes cap 
and an easter basket topped with a yellow ribbon 
i feel happy really happy said mrs adams clutching her 
sons arm as they left the gate youre supposed to have a 
resurrection around easter i guess this is it 
adams fought back tears as he embraced errol morris director of 
the thin blue line another cheer arose minutes later when news 
arrived that the dallas county district attorney announced he was 
dropping the case 
but adams who appeared flushed and complained of feeling ill 
shortly after arriving from texas cautioned against enthusiasm 
ill wait until i hear it from my attorney he said 
in houston adams attorney said his clients name has been 
cleared and that adams has been vindicated 
im now satisfied the final chapter has been written 
attorney randy schaffer said 
district attorney john vance told reporters in dallas that it was 
unlikely enough evidence could be produced to retry adams 
its almost impossible to find sufficient credible evidence to 
try a case that is 13 years old vance said 
but vance who was not in office when the case was tried 
defended prosecutors actions including a legal fight earlier this 
week that delayed adams release 
the easy route would have been to release mr adams 
immediately however my obligation is not to the media or to play 
the part of the hero vance said my responsibility in every 
case is to the victim his family dallas county citizens and the 
state of texas 
adams who was unemployed before his arrest said he had no 
immediate plans although he is mulling a job offer from columbus 
mayor dana rinehart who was among those greeting him at port 
columbus international airport 
rinehart said he will discuss what jobs are available with adams 
once he settles in at home 
adams who in 1980 came within three days of execution before his 
sentence was commuted to life in prison said he harbors no ill 
feelings toward texas officials and gave morris and his film partial 
credit for his release 
i still believe i eventually would have won it may have taken 
us some time but thankfully errol was sent to me by my fates 
mrs adams agreed 
i dont have any hard feelings for anyone randys home she 
said adding that she now considers morris another one of my 
sons 
adams and his family planned to spend the evening at a private 
gathering at mrs adams home 
its going to take some time we need time to have the family 
together he said 
ive been standing in a twilight zone for the past 12 years 
i was in that twilight zone until the door opened thank god it 
did

fourteen young people were heading home to west 
virginia today after spending their spring break as volunteers at a 
homeless shelter in the windy city rather than the beaches of the 
sunbelt 
i knew i would get a lot more out of this than florida said 
jennifer jackson an 18yearold high school student who traveled to 
chicago with the group 
the 14 worked this week on the citys west side at the chicago 
christian industrial league which provides social services to the 
homeless mentally ill and substance abusers 
they spent five days cleaning doing maintenance work and meeting 
people who use the shelter operated by the 80yearold agency 
the volunteers affiliated with the baptist temple church in 
huntington wva traveled by van to work in the nine buildings of 
the league former warehouses west of the loop that were donated by 
several corporations 
they came here to experience another kind of life another type 
of existence said richard roberts the leagues executive 
director 
renee childers 21 a sophomore at huntingtons marshall 
university said the experience hit home 
i think it is something to really make me grow up she said 
i didnt like how my life is going it was at a standstill and i 
needed something to get me going 
she said she was impressed with the people she worked with 
i was sort of afraid at first because of the homeless i saw in 
huntington she said i will look at the people at home 
differently now these people have hopes and goals they want to 
get their lives back in order 
the trip was the idea of greg creasy the huntington churchs 
youth leader who visited the shelter last summer as a member of a 
singing group he said a car wash and dinner was held to raise money 
for the trip 
we worked hard to get here and worked hard here he said 
in addition to cleaning off years of grease and grime in a 
kitchen the group cleared a basement of debris accumulated during 
the decades the buildings were used as warehouses 
they did a major service for us by cleaning out that area 
eliminating a fire hazard said roberts it will allow us to 
store more food donated for the homeless 
roberts said the league helps about 400 people a day it has a 
fulltime staff of 18 and depends on the homeless for much of the 
work to maintain its facilities 
the league is located in an area that once was chicagos skid 
row it is now a focus of intense redevelopment including an 
upscale apartment complex two blocks away 
it is not uncommon to see people lined up to use the soup 
kitchens while jaguars mercedesbenzes and cadillacs drive by 
said roberts it was something also noted by creasy 
there is a great need here he said and to go across the 
street and see great wealth it is sort of shocking to see that 
roberts said he could understand the jolt the volunteers 
received coming from their middle class surroundings in west 
virginia 
they were in the bowels of the inner city working with 
exfelons recovering alcoholics and women who have been abused 
he said 
it was the most amazing trip i have had in my entire life

reported cases of rubella have declined 99 percent 
in the 20 years since a vaccine was licensed but health officials 
say many people who still get the disease are women of childbearing 
age 
of the cases reported during a threeyear period 582 percent 
occurred in people 15 and over the us centers for disease control 
said thursday 
the statistics for 198587 did not indicate the sex of the 
rubella patients but the cdc noted that age group includes women of 
childbearing age 
the continued occurrence of rubella in childbearingaged 
populations suggests that potentially preventable cases of 
congenital rubella syndrome may continue to occur during the next 
1030 years the atlantabased cdc said in its weekly report 
rubella also known as german measles is most dangerous when it 
attacks pregnant women said cdc epidemiologist dr paul a 
stehrgreen 
though the main symptom of rubella is a mild rash for adults it 
can cause serious birth defects or fetal deaths he said 
the real danger of rubella is when a pregnant woman is 
exposed to the virus stehrgreen said it can cause serious 
birth defects including cataracts heart disease enlargement of 
the liver and spleen and mental retardation 
the licensing of a rubella vaccine in 1969 followed a major 
epidemic from 196264 in which 125 million cases were reported in 
the united states and there were 11000 fetal deaths 
but the latest cdc figures show there were just 221 us cases of 
rubella reported in 1988 
that amounted to 01 case per 100000 people and represented the 
lowest total since 1966 when the government began compiling 
statistics on the disease 
in 1987 the latest year for which complete figures are 
available there were 306 cases of rubella reported in the united 
states the cdc said 
though the numbers themselves are a lot lower the proportion 
of cases among young adults is increasing stehrgreen said 
statistics from illinois michigan and new york city the only 
areas that at the time reported rubella cases by specific age groups 
indicate that from 196668 the last three years before the 
rubella vaccine was licensed people in the 15andolder age group 
accounted for just 229 percent of the cases 
the public health service in its health objectives issued in 
1980 set a goal of fewer than 1000 overall rubella cases and fewer 
than 10 congenital cases a year by 1990 
although the goal for congenital rubella syndrome has also 
been reached unacceptable morbidity is still occurring the cdc 
said in its weekly report 
there was one case of congenital rubella syndrome reported in 
1988 according to the cdc but three already had been reported this 
year through wednesday 
stehrgreen said most of the rubella cases occurring now stem 
from people failing to get vaccinated though there are some cases 
of the vaccine failing to work 
there is some percentage of people who get the vaccine and for 
a variety of reasons it doesnt take he said but this is more 
an issue of failure to vaccinate rather than a failure of the 
vaccine 
the government recommends that children get rubella vaccine when 
they are 15 months old stehrgreen said adults who are not sure if 
theyve been vaccinated are advised to get the shot again

government reluctance to make public an air 
terrorism threat in europe is bringing new calls from relatives of 
the pan am flight 103 bombing victims for disclosure of all serious 
threats against commercial aviation 
white house state department and transportation department 
officials all attempted on thursday to downplay the hijacking threat 
against us airlines in western europe still some officials 
transportation secretary samuel skinner in particular expressed 
anger that it was released to the public in leaks to british news 
media 
but several relatives of victims of the dec 21 bombing of pan am 
flight 103 over scotland said they believe the way the government 
handles terrorism bulletins warns diplomatic and military personnel 
while keeping other potential passengers uninformed about risks 
british investigators have concluded that a terrorist bomb 
concealed in a radiocassette player blew up the boeing 747 over 
scotland killing all 259 people aboard and 11 others on the ground 
in lockerbie scotland 
the relatives in telephone interviews criticized government 
failure to provide the public with information about terrorist 
warnings such as the march 16 memorandum sent by the federal 
aviation administration to airlines airports and european security 
officials 
the faa acknowledged the existence of the memo but declined to 
discuss its contents which were nonetheless reported by the daily 
express and other london news media 
the newspaper said a hijacking by three palestinians was 
threatened during the easter weekend us officials denied that the 
bulletin contained any reference to this weekend they also denied 
the newspapers assertion that us diplomatic and military 
personnel were warned of the threat 
president bush in an interview published today rejected the 
idea of blanket public warnings saying that could encourage a lot 
of crackpots to call with threats 
but it is prudent and thats the existing directive to 
allow the security people to know about these things and to take 
as many precise steps as possible as relating to an individual 
flight bush said in the interview with the washington times 
relatives of the lockerbie victims say the lack of public 
notification puts travellers at unnecessary risk 
we dont think they should use the american public as live 
bait said colleen hermann of huntington ny whose brother 
john michael ahern was killed on flight 103 
bert ammerman a spokesman for the relatives of lockerbie 
victims said the group is not calling for general public 
announcements every time there is a terrorist threat 
but he said that until prudent security measures can be taken 
to protect american carriers throughout the world a telephone 
number should be set up for travellers to call to get information on 
any threat against a flight they plan to take 
i dont think thats going to paralyze the aviation industry 
said ammerman of demarest nj whose brother tom was killed in 
the pan am bombing 
some of the relatives noted that pan am warned passengers of a 
new yorkparis flight last week of a bomb threat and gave them the 
option of taking another plane pan am said only 17 of the 200 
passengers left the plane and 11 of those flew the same flight the 
following day 
paul hudson an albany ny lawyer who lost his 16yearold 
daughter melina in the pan am explosion said present security 
policies amount to a selective warning system 
what happens when this information is kept secret and yet is 
passed around to literally thousands of security people is that it 
is bound to leak out and hurt the credibility of security hudson 
said it then tends to sow panic even among those not directly 
threatened 
tim cole a washington aviation consultant said if all threats 
were made public they might become so commonplace that people would 
simply ignore them with 600 or so threats a year youd be crying 
wolf all the time he said 
officials say all but a handful of threats are hoaxes 
meanwhile authorities in london frankfurt rome and brussels 
said security had been tightened after they received the faa 
warning but authorities in paris amsterdam athens and madrid 
reported no additional precautions 
travellers on us air carriers should be confident that all 
reasonable precautions are being taken to ensure that the highest 
level of security exists the faa said in its statement thursday 
skinner said the unauthorized release of an faa bulletin 
compromises intelligencegathering efforts and jeopardizes the 
lives of airline passengers he ordered an investigation to find 
out who leaked the bulletin

presidentelect alfredo 
cristiani said he would accept peace talks with leftist rebels but 
warned of any us interference in el salvadors civil war 
we are willing to open doors to the guerrillas to incorporate 
them in the salvadoran democratic process said cristiani the 
victor in sundays presidential election 
we are willing to work with the united states cristiani 
added in remarks made available thursday but this partnership 
must be based upon mutual respect and working together not as an 
imposition 
although president bush congratulated cristiani on his victory 
some congressmen have said his rightwing republican nationalist 
alliance party known as arena should demonstrate it has become a 
democratic institution before more us aid is provided human 
rights groups diplomats and others have linked arena to 
farrightist death squads 
the salvadoran government has been the biggest recipient of us 
economic and military aid this decade receiving more than 35 
billion washington now provides 500 million a year in aid to el 
salvador 
the presidentelect said the leftist farabundo marti liberation 
front must interpret for the first time the feelings of the great 
majority of salvadorans that they no longer want violence that 
they want peace 
if the guerrillas want to solve the salvadoran peoples 
problems they must come and express themselves publicly and 
peacefully so that the people can judge whether what they offer is 
valuable or not he said 
he made no specific proposals for talks however before the 
elections rebels asked for a sixmonth postponement to give them 
time to participate 
the government and arena both objected to the plan and peace 
talks never got under way 
according to the final results cristiani won with 54 percent of 
the vote in an election boycotted by the rebels francisco merino 
also of arena was proclaimed vice presidentelect 
fidel chavez mena presidential candidate of the incumbent 
christian democrats received 36 percent of the vote president jose 
napoleon duarte suffering from terminal cancer by law could not 
run for reelection 
more than 18 million salvadorans were registered to vote and 
turnout was 52 percent election officials said 
in his remarks wednesday christiani also said his administration 
would oppose direct intervention by the us government in the 
nineyear civil war the conflict has killed more than 70000 
people most of them civilians 
arena was linked in the early 1980s to extremerightist death 
squads blamed for the murders of tens of thousands of suspected 
leftists former us ambassador robert white once called arena 
founder roberto daubuisson a pathological killer 
however cristiani contends his candidacy shows his party has 
moderated its views 
cristiani said neither he nor his party are antinorth 
american 
but he said if they want us to respect the democracies of other 
countries we expect that other countries respect the salvadoran 
democracy

children who are accident prone will probably 
change and likely neednt worry about suffering mishaps and 
injuries for the rest of their lives suggests a new study of more 
than 50000 school children 
also the tendency to be accident prone may be preventable since 
it could result from foreseeable stresses growth spurts family 
disagreements school pressures that are a typical part of growing 
up the study suggested 
that is very good and optimistic news for parents for 
teachers for injury control specialists and for pediatricians 
says dr mark widome chairman of the committee on accident and 
poison prevention for the american academy of pediatrics 
it means that we can look at psychological and environmental 
influences that can warn us of increased risk and even things we can 
change to decrease the risk he said in a telephone interview 
thursday 
the study looked at 54874 school children ages 6 to 18 over a 
threeyear period in a tucson ariz school district researchers 
recorded 8429 injuries during school hours that were serious enough 
to require a doctors attention to cause school absence or to 
restrict sports participation 
seventeen percent of the injuries occurred to 1 percent of the 
children a significantly higher rate than could be expected from 
chance alone the researchers said in the march issue of the 
american journal of diseases of children 
there were 574 children who suffered two or more injuries in a 
single year but only 15 youngsters suffered one or more injuries in 
all three years the researchers said 
most sustained only two injuries and the vast majority of 
injuries were clustered within a short time said the researchers 
dr w thomas boyce of the university of california at san francisco 
and sue sobolewski of the tucson unified school district 
injuries were most likely to recur among junior high school boys 
children engaged in athletic activities and youngsters attending 
schools with longer hours or those that had alternative programs 
such as open classrooms or magnet curriculums the 
researchers said 
only an extraordinarily small group of children perhaps as 
few as three in 10000 seem to maintain an inordinate risk of 
injury over an extended period of years the researchers said 
the study didnt cover why some children seemed to have clusters 
of injuries but the researchers theorized that stresses such as 
family or social problems or the onset of adolescence could cause 
the temporary accident proneness more study could lead to ways to 
prevent accidents in such children they said 
the study supports the widely held belief that there is not a 
stable inborn personality trait called accidentproneness that 
accidentproneness is probably a state rather than a trait he 
said from hershey pa where he an associate professor at 
pennsylvania state university college of medicine 
states are something you have for a period of time such as 
when youre upset youre having trouble in school youre going 
through puberty he said a trait is something you have all your 
life 
widome said that for most children there are relatively brief 
and transient periods when theyre at increased risk for injuries

roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo said the leftist government should have declared a general 
amnesty for political prisoners rather than just releasing 1894 
former national guardsmen 
meanwhile in washington congressional and administration sources 
said thursday that president bush and lawmakers had agreed on a plan 
to extend aid to the nicaraguan rebels known as contras through 
february 1990 the aid was to expire this month 
critics have said extending aid would violate a regional peace 
plan that calls for democratic reforms in nicaragua in exchange for 
the dismantling of contra forces that have fled to honduras 
however the us plan includes a pledge to back the february 
peace accord and eventual reintegration of the rebels into 
nicaraguan political life the sources in washington said 
through most of the reagan administration the united states gave 
arms to the rebels in february 1988 congress stopped military aid 
but continued sending humanitarian assistance 
about 11000 contras now live in camps in neighboring honduras 
in remarks during a homily for holy thursday services in managua 
the cardinal said the contras should release any political prisoners 
they hold now that the sandinista government has freed the guardsmen 
he also said it would have been best if the government had 
decreed a general amnesty bringing joy to the prisoners and their 
families and thereby contributing to national reconciliation 
on march 17 the sandinistas freed 1894 former national guard 
members who had been jailed since the july 1979 sandinista 
revolution 
the guard members served under former president anastasio somoza 
who fled nicaragua two days before the sandinistas marched into the 
capital 
however the government denied freedom to 39 other former 
guardsmen who served under somoza saying they were guilty of 
heinous crimes against the nicaraguan people

female leader has presented the military with a medal of 
democracy 
she said thursday that the award recognizes the militarys 
decision to step out of politics after 11 years of direct 
involvement 
we are proud of our armed forces who gave national interests 
precedence over personal considerations the prime minister said 
a plane crash killed military strongman mohammad ziaul haq last 
august paving the way for the first free elections since 1977 that 
year a coup engineered by zia ousted bhuttos father zulfikar ali 
bhutto who was tried for state crimes and hanged in 1979 
several top generals and the us ambassador died when zias 
hercules aircraft went down outside the city of bahawalpur 
investigators say it was probably sabotage but no definite cause 
or suspect has ever been found 
in a nationally televised speech ms bhutto also promised not to 
break faith with the expectations of the people who propelled her to 
power we are determined to face every challenge with courage 
bravery and determination she said 
in 1940 seven years before pakistan was carved from the western 
edge of india the nations founding father mohammad ali jinnah 
promised his followers that the days of the british raj were 
numbered and formally declared independence pakistanis celebrated 
that promise thursday in what is called pakistan day a national 
holiday 
pakistan was created to give moslems who felt maltreated by 
indias majority hindu population their own state 
reminiscent of colonial pomp pakistans president ghulam ishaq 
khan arrived at thursdays ceremonies in a gilded carriage 
it passed in front of tanks armored personnel carriers 
antiaircraft weapons longrange missiles and heavy artillery all 
on display for the ceremonies 
in her speech bhutto referred to the years of military rule 
before her rise to power as an era of darkness everywhere 
there was a sense of want everywhere clouds of pessimism and 
helplessness were in all directions and there was tension on our 
eastern and western frontiers 
bhuttos leftofcenter pakistan peoples party won the largest 
bloc of votes in general elections last november 
the task before her government is formidable with a bankrupt 
economy ethnic unrest and an afghan civil war that has sent more 
than 3 million refugees fleeing to pakistan 
on wednesday ms bhutto expanded her 23member cabinet to 41 
including her mother nusrat bhutto 
the elder bhutto cochairman of the peoples party won her 
first election last november she was named minister without

keep the lobster in omaha at one point a man dressed as a lobster 
stood on a downtown street corner and asked for donations and a 
radio station held a 28hour fundraising broadcast 
clyde was unveiled in his 240gallon 6300 saltwater tank 
thursday the zoo opens its 1989 season today 
everything appears to be fine aquarium supervisor kathy 
vires said he eats hes active he keeps his tail tucked those 
are all signs of a healthy lobster 
zoo employees sometimes find him standing on his tail with his 
claws open and extending above the top of his tank she said 
zoo director lee simmons said the zoo would like to establish a 
larger coldwater exhibit but for now clyde is the only coldwater

a man with an insatiable appetite for 
cocaine killed two women with a semiautomatic gun and wounded two 
deputies and a hostage before killing himself during 10 hours of 
rape and terror authorities said 
eugene thompson jr 20 of littleton was armed with a mac11 
assault pistol when he broke into a womans suburban denver house 
early thursday and began his crime spree 
the rampage during which he raped two women ended in a 
gunbattle at a townhouse as 100 officers searched housetohouse for 
him 
thompson opened fire on the two officers who burst into the 
townhouse hitting one in the chest and neck and the other in the 
leg authorities said he then shot 18yearold jake carper four 
times in the back went upstairs and shot himself in the head 
a madman it appears is what we have said douglas county 
sheriff steve zotos we were hoping it wouldnt end this way but 
i dont know of any other way it could have ended there is just no 
reason to this whole thing 
thompson died at a hospital three hours after he shot himself 
carper who lives in the townhouse remained in critical 
condition 
arapahoe county deputy arthur l hilton 37 was in serious 
condition with wounds to the chest deputy daniel thomas 36 was 
released after treatment 
thompson a suspect in at least 140 thefts and burglaries was 
wanted on arrest warrants that were issued monday for his failure to 
appear in golden district court for probation revocation 
authorities said 
he had been enrolled in a cocaine residence treatment program as 
part of his probation for thefts but was kicked out after being 
caught stealing said eugene strauber regional vice president of 
the cenikor foundation cocaine residence treatment program in the 
denver suburb of lakewood 
he had an appetite for drugs mostly for cocaine that he 
couldnt keep up with said lakewood police detective george 
mcglynn and thats what led to this 
it wasnt known if thompson was on drugs during his rampage an 
autopsy was pending but douglas county sheriffs lt bill walker 
said we know he had been using cocaine heavily in recent weeks 
the trouble began around 5 am when thompson broke into 
47yearold beverly swartzs house in littleton authorities said 
she called for help but hung up before she could give her address 
authorities traced the call but when they arrived she and her car 
were gone her husband ralph summoned from work arrived at the 
house and was talking with investigators when the telephone rang 
it was his father oscar swartz calling for help 
thompson had driven the woman to her inlaws home outside 
littleton broke in at gunpoint and tied up the three beverly 
oscar and his 68yearold wife janice 
he raped the younger woman downstairs then executed her 
sheriff zotos said then he executed the older one upstairs 
thompson then stole a car and drove about 10 miles to douglas 
county south of denver where he broke into a house held a man 
woman and child at gunpoint and raped the woman zotos said 
about 30 minutes after leaving the house he crashed a stolen car 
into a fence and fled setting off the manhunt 
during their search police warned schools to lock their doors 
and told residents to stay inside about 25000 school children were 
kept in their classes 
what do you do if the crazy guy busts in the school and i 
dont know how to answer it its a shame its got to a point in our 
society where weve got to worry about this said bob dye dry 
creek elementary school principal 
officers tracked thompson to littleton where he broke into 
carpers house and shot him and the officers 
all carper said was jesus christ jesus christ he shot me 
and then went upstairs and shot himself arapahoe county sheriff 
pat sullivan said 
the mac11 is a semiautomatic weapon that can be purchased 
overthecounter sullivan said there was evidence the weapon had 
been modified to be fully automatic he said the gun fires 32 rounds 
and only five were left when the gun was finally recovered 
a day before his deputies were wounded sullivan lashed out at 
the sales of semiautomatic weapons in a ninepage position paper for 
the state legislature 
everything i say in this position paper is true our officers 
are outgunned by these weapons of war these guns are designed to 
kill and maim people he said

a sheriff who had written a position paper against 
semiautomatic weapons found his fears borne out hours later when a 
man went on a rampage with an assault gun killing two people and 
wounding three including two deputies 
in the paper arapahoe county sheriff pat sullivan said laws 
should be tightened to control who can buy such weapons and if they 
cant be controlled he urged the colorado legislature to ban their 
sale 
on thursday 20yearold eugene thompson jr used a mac11 
semiautomatic pistol to kill two women and shot the others 
including two of sullivans deputies before killing himself 
authorities said 
everything i say in this position paper is true our officers 
are outgunned by these weapons of war these guns are designed to 
kill and maim people he said 
sullivan said the mac11 can hold 32 rounds and fire 10 times 
faster than the standard 38caliber pistol issued to all sheriffs 
i am a western coloradan who enjoys big game hunting and i 
dont want to see anything that would hurt sport hunting sullivan 
said in the position paper he wrote wednesday but we have to do 
something about these weapons of war 
in the paper sullivan cited the january shootings in stockton 
calif in which five school children were killed and 29 pupils and 
a teacher were wounded by a man carrying a semiautomatic gun known 
as the 56s a copy of the chinesemade akm47 
this tragic event has stimulated city county state and 
federal legislative efforts to control or ban these weapons of 
war sullivan said 
the california assembly has approved a ban on 40 types of 
assaulttype weapons and similar bills are pending in other states 
the bush administration temporarily has banned the import of 
semiautomatic assault rifles the mac11 used by thompson would not 
have been affected because it is american made 
sullivan said that although the constitution gives citizens the 
right to import manufacture sell and possess semiautomatic 
weapons there is also a burden to place some reasonable controls 
on these weapons of war without abridging the sportsmans right to 
legitimate sporting rifles 
ted strickland president of the state senate said things might 
not be so easy 
what happens in the land of the fruits and nuts is not 
necessarily applicable here strickland a republican said he 
said the tragedy undoubtedly would trigger emotional reponses on 
both sides 
but as with previous guncontrol measures he said there will 
be an awful lot of heat generated not much light and very few minds 
changed

the ailing ferdinand marcos received a bedside 
visit from four of his former cabinet ministers who are under 
subpoena to testify against the former philippine president facing 
federal racketeering charges 
it was a sad reunion because of his condition marcos aide 
arturo aruiza said thursday at st francis medical center they 
introduced themselves wished him well and encouraged him to fight 
these ailments so he might someday return home mostly they just 
gave our president words of encouragement 
marcos 71 has been hospitalized since jan 15 with heart and 
lung problems he remained in guarded condition thursday night 
the former ministers were handed subpoenas wednesday when they 
arrived at honolulu international airport and a fifth member of the 
delegation former education minister jaime laya was arrested by 
fbi agents on a material witness warrant 
laya once head of the philippines central bank was released on 
bail after relinquishing his passport and being ordered to appear 
may 8 in us district court in new york 
the visitors blas ople former minister of labor estelito 
mendoza former minister of justice conrado estrella former 
minister of agrarian reform and sylvia montes former minister of 
social services also were ordered to appear in court with laya 
marcos and his wife imelda are charged with plundering more 
than 100 million from their country to buy art and real estate in 
manhattan mrs marcos is free on 5 million bail after pleading 
innocent marcos physical condition has prevented him from being 
arraigned 
material arrest warrants or subpoenas were also issued for at 
least five others including five of the six former cabinet 
ministers who had been scheduled to arrive in honolulu thursday or 
today said ralph girardi assistant fbi agentincharge of honolulu 
after what happened yesterday wednesday we dont have any

from visiting her husband 
these men come here to do a kindly act and theyre going to be 
arrested mrs marcos said if mrs aquino is so popular why 
cant they let a sick man go home and why are they stopping

at least 11 people were 
nailed to crosses and thousands of filipinos beat their backs bloody 
today as the only christian nation in asia commemorated the 
crucifixion and death of jesus christ 
about 5000 people including foreign tourists and us 
servicemen from nearby clark air base gathered on a rice field to 
watch men dressed as roman centurions hammer nails into the palms 
and feet of mario castro and six other christs 
the crucifixions have been an annual ritual for decades in this 
village 40 miles north of manila they have become tourist 
attractions in recent years complete with stalls selling food soft 
drinks straw hats fans and other souvenirs 
at the village entrance the department of tourism posted a sign 
saying fiesta islands the theme of its current campaign to 
attract foreign tourists to the economically pressed country 
this year the spectacle attracted seven christs all 
voluntarily performing the ritual of having themselves nailed for 
reasons ranging from atonement for sins and thanksgiving for favors 
to requests for a bright future 
in kapitangan in neighboring bulacan province luciana reyes 30 
had her palms and feet nailed to a wooden cross for the 13th 
straight year another woman was also to have been crucified but 
she screamed in pain when the nails pierced her palms and the ritual 
was discontinued 
in manila about 3000 union members and residents of city slums 
held their own calvary of the poor a fourhour series of 
demonstrations with a march from the senate toward the presidential 
palace 
they were protesting policies of president corazon aquinos 
government which they say favor wealthy businessmen and 
multinational companies 
at least two more crucifixions were reported in ilocos norte 
province and one in bataan but details were not available because 
of poor communication lines 
to prevent infection alcohol is poured on the crucifixion wounds 
and sterile gauze is applied 
the nails are stainless steel extremely sharp and slender and 
are kept in alcohol through years of practice the centurions 
who hammer the nails have learned where to drive the nails to avoid 
hitting bones to ensure the smallest possible wound only one 
hammer blow is delivered to each nail 
todays rituals in san pedro cutud began with castro a 
38yearold bus driver and veteran of 10 crucifixions carrying a 
wooden cross over a 1mile route from the entrance to the village 
to his makeshift golgotha in the middle of the rice field 
behind him were men dressed as ancient roman soldiers including 
two centurions on horseback other costumed new testament characters 
such as pontius pilate and about 50 hooded male zealots who drew 
blood by continually whipping their naked backs 
the crowds many of whom carried cameras yelled and pushed for 
vantage positions during the twohour crucifixions some women 
shrieked and others giggled as they dodged sprays of blood from the 
penitents bambootipped whips 
first to be nailed was castro who was stripped of his white 
longsleeved gown and left covered only with a section of white 
cloth around his waist he was followed seconds later by two other 
men 
then their arms and waists bound to the crosses with pieces of 
cloth the three men were hoisted up for a few minutes they were 
taken down and replaced on the crosses by the others including gary 
briones 21 an auto mechanic from manila 
he told reporters afterward that it was his first crucifixion and 
he decided to do it so that i will have a bright future 
my god all this for a show exclaimed one american as the 
selfflagellants passed in front of him 
pamela foster a teenaged tourist from england who came with her 
parents thought the entire spectacle kind of stupid christ had 
to go through all this and bore all the sufferings so that we 
wouldnt have to go through all this again but they got it all 
wrong 
hundreds of other flagellants could be seen in san pedro cutud 
in kapitangan and many other places throughout the country 
including vacant lots in manila the roman catholic church 
officially frowns on the practice in this premonately christian 
country but is helpless to stop 
most filipinos commemorate christs suffering in less spectacular 
ways such as offering simple prayers in church some walk on their 
knees in churches or barefoot under a hot tropical sun over steaming 
asphalt or concrete streets

two scientists say they have produced 
controlled nuclear fusion through basic chemistry a claim that has 
evoked skepticism from other researchers 
but some also expressed hope that a longsought source of clean 
abundant energy may be on the horizon 
martin fleischmann of the university of southampton in england 
and b stanley pons chairman of the university of utah chemistry 
department said their electrochemical process has produced a 
surplus of energy for periods of up to 100 hours 
they cautioned that more research is needed to determine whether 
the process will work on a large scale 
what we have done is opened the door of a new research area 
fleischmann told a news conference thursday our indications are 
that the discovery will be relatively easy to make into a usable 
technology for generating heat and power 
hoping that will be the case the university of utah has applied 
for patents 
edward teller director emeritus of the lawrence livermore 
laboratory and the father of the hydrogen bomb said he 
initially was skeptical feeling that it could never happen but 
i am extremely happy now because i see a very good chance that i 
was completely wrong 
robert sherman of the los alamos national laboratory a fusion 
researcher for 14 years said based on the sketchy information i 
have theres nothing to indicate theyve really accomplished 
anything 
in fusion reactions the nuclei of two heavy hydrogen atoms are 
combined to become the nucleus of a helium atom the process 
releases a tremendous amount of energy 
fusion occurs in the sun and in hydrogen bombs but pons said the 
new process can be carried out in simple glass flasks at room 
temperature 
heavy water water containing heavy hydrogen or deuterium 
circulates between a negatively charged palladium metal rod and a 
positively charged platinum cylinder 
the electrical current drives deuterium nuclei deuterons into 
the lattice structure of the palladium pons says the lattice 
structure holds the deuterons close together long enough for fusion 
to occur 
the two scientists say the heat generated in the experiment shows 
that fusion has occurred 
we took so much heat out it cannot be accounted for in 
conventional chemical reactions fleischmann said 
the two said they have not measured the neutrons produced and 
that makes sherman and some of his colleagues skeptical 
we dont see that the process gets the nuclei close enough to 
each other to interact sherman said if theyre going to have 
fusion theyve got to show me they have neutrons of the right 
energy and the right time 
he said he and others have used palladium for years to purify 
hydrogen and nobody has seen such a reaction 
teller said his experience with palladium makes him think the 
process could work and if so it will be very significant for 
our knowledge of the solid state of metals and it may be very 
important for our energy production 
pons said he and fleischmann developed the technique after 5 
years of research they now are seeking a grant from the federal 
department of energy to continue their research 
for more than 30 years physicists worldwide have tried to produce 
controlled fusion but at a cost of millions of dollars and with 
huge machines and lasers 
meanwhile other scientists said the experiment will have to be 
duplicated independently before the findings of pons and fleischmann 
can be accepted 
people are pushing coldtemperature nuclear fusion quite 
vigorously these days like any science this claim has to be 
reproducable if it is indeed there it is quite a discovery said 
chan choi a fusion researcher at purdue universitys school of 
nuclear engineering

communist party leader karoly grosz of hungary met 
today in the kremlin with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for 
talks that were expected to address hungarys move toward a 
multiparty political system 
the soviet new agency tass said the focus of the meeting was an 
exchange of expertise and information about pressing issues of 
socialist construction in both countries and the development of 
cooperation in all areas 
gorbachev and grosz also were discussing foreign policy 
questions tass said 
grosz arrived thursday in the soviet union for a 24hour working 
visit 
the talks are the first between gorbachev and grosz since 
hungarian officials declared their support last month for a 
multiparty system but hungarian premier miklos nemeth said after 
visiting moscow this month that gorbachev approved hungarys reforms 
and does not oppose a multiparty system there 
but soviet officials are less positive about a multiparty system 
in their own country the soviet communist partys central 
commmittee launched an investigation of former moscow party chief 
boris n yeltsin earlier this month after he was accused of 
advocating a multiparty system 
yeltsin denies advocating the system although he says the issue 
must be discussed openly

a judges experiment at a sink in his chambers 
led him to acquit a man of all charges in the drowning of his 
2yearold daughter in a bathtub that had been plugged with a tennis 
ball 
common pleas judge raymond a novak took the tennis ball with him 
when he adjourned to his chambers thursday to decide whether ernest 
walker 31 of pittsburgh was guilty or innocent of involuntary 
manslaughter and endangering the welfare of lorrene walker who died 
july 5 
novak said he put the ball in the sink and ran water over it he 
said the ball first went into the drain and later bobbed up but

after years of bitter controversy a gleaming and 
renovated louvre museum crowned by a tall glass pyramid at its 
entrance is scheduled to open next week 
for months many frenchmen and art lovers worldwide have been 
holding their breath waiting for a look at the hightech 
ultramodern facilities designed to turn a onceexhausting tour of 
the louvres dark and dingy galeries into sunny joy 
the sixyear 850million overhaul will turn the louvre into the 
worlds largest museum once the last of its 14 new galleries opens 
in 1993 
the pyramid entrance will be inaugurated next wednesday by 
president francois mitterrand and will open to the public on 
thursday 
visitors who once wandered in search of the museums main 
entrance wont have any trouble finding the new one it soars 
dramatically between the louvres two main wings is set off by 
three smaller pyramids and fountains illuminated at night 
a graceful spiral staircase takes visitors down to a spacious 
underground lobby where they will find ticket windows bookshops 
restaurants boutiques and a 400seat auditorium 
from below the view is breathtaking the ornate architecture of 
the louvres twin towers looms against the everchanging grays of 
the paris sky 
visitors will also find video screens indicating in several 
languages which galeries are closed as well as the best routes for 
finding key items like the mona lisa and winged victory 
with about 650000 square feet of new space dozens of important 
works have been dusted off and put on display for the first time in 
decades 
aficionados of 16th and 17th century french painters will 
probably love the newly restored galleries on the third floor of the 
cour carre overlooking the pyramid 
works to be shown there include the history of alexander a 
huge fourpanel 17th century wall mural by charles lebrun not seen 
in public since 1963 the 18th century the meal at simons by 
pierre subleyras never displayed at the louvre will also grace the 
walls 
the guards will be dressed in chic new navyblue outfits designed 
by yves saint laurent 
the brainchild of french president francois mitterrand the 
louvre project was plunged in controversy from the start problems 
arose when mitterrand picked celebrated american architect im pei 
to design the project bypassing the traditional architectural 
competition 
peis design a 70foot pyramid of special thick tinted glass 
soaring between the louvres main wings was cause for further 
outrage critics lambasted the clash of new and old complaining 
that the pyramid would turn the louvre into a subway entrance or 
disneyland annex 
turning a centuriesold palace into a spaceage museum was no 
easy task before the pyramid went up teams of archeologists worked 
day and night excavating centuries of ruins under the courtyard 
they unearthed thousands of artifacts as ancient as items from 
the 13th century some of things they found animal bones 
porcelain dinnerware cooking utensils vases and pitchers 200 
silver coins dating from the french revolution and even common 
latrines will be put on display 
they will be used to tell the louvres history 
the museum was built in 1200 by king philippe auguste as a walled 
fortress to help protect paris from english invaders 
in the 1600s the austere castle was made more livable but did 
not become a royal residence until king louis xiii made it bigger to 
accommodate his everexpanding court 
a century later after louis xiv deserted the louvre for more 
sumptous quarters at versailles the louvre declined it was 
gradually taken over by artists colonies and turned into a museum 
in 1793

students hurling firebombs clashed with riot police to protest 
government plans to arm police with semiautomatic weapons 
the united national democratic movement of korea which 
represents 200 dissident groups said roh must resign immediately 
because of his march 20 decision to indefinitely postpone a

step down immediately alliance chairman lee buyoung told a news 
conference

powerful semiautomatic m16 rifles to police for selfdefense 
against protesters who attack police stations and government 
buildings with firebombs and explosives 
lee charged the decision to distribute 13000 m16s to police was 
a desperate attempt by the government to cling to power he said 
antigovernment forces would not abandon their drive to oust roh 
the arming of the police with m16s is an open threat to the 
people the decision must be rescinded immediately the democratic 
forces would never cease their fight against the dictatorship lee 
said 
about 1000 radical students hurling firebombs and rocks battled 
riot police in separate clashes at sunkyunkwan and hongil 
universities in seoul to protest the decision to issue m16s 
students hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police who fired tear 
gas at protesters 
down with roh taewoo who issued shooting orders students 
chanted down with roh taewoo who deceived the people 
about 500 students armed with firebombs and rocks clashed with 
police at dankuk university near teajon in central south korea

president bush says the nations capital 
obviously needs help from the federal government in its fight 
against growing drugrelated violence 
i hope that we can find ways to supplement the police activity 
in the area because this city has become a highprofile city in 
terms of violent crime bush said in an interview published today 
in the washington times 
bush said he would let mayor marion barry evaluate the crisis and 
arrive at his own proposals to rid the city of its distinction as 
murder capital of the united states most of the 120 killings this 
year have been linked to the drug trade 
the president said the city needs help and thats one of the 
reasons that federal drug czar william bennett has targeted this 
city he said he is awaiting bennetts recommendations 
asked about the sharp rise in the use of semiautomatic weapons in 
drugrelated crimes bush said the entire administration is trying 
develop a more definite policy than just holding up those 
imports of the weapons 
the government last week suspended indefinitely imports of 
semiautomatic assault rifles 
bush noted that one policeman was killed and another was wounded 
in a shootout in suburban alexandria va wednesday night with a 
gunman who had taken five hostages after demanding crack cocaine 
the gunman identified as an escapee from a washington halfway 
house died in the battle with police which took place a few blocks 
from the home of the presidents son marvin 
i want to find a way to help protect the lives of the policemen 
that are laying their lives on the line for all of us as one did 
last night bush said 
i would like to add at that point in the enforcement side in 
the penalty side that weve condoned for too long those things 
which we should have condemned in drug use in tolerance for the 
drug habit in the media of glorifying the drugs the entertainment 
media 
and so everybody has to think anew including the president of 
the united states we are in that serious a situation

a poll published today said 56 percent of 
israelis oppose any peace talks with the plo arab sources said 
palestinian moderates have been threatened with death if they 
continue talking with israelis 
the poll by the independent polling group modain ezrachi 
published in the daily maariv newspaper contrasted with findings of 
a survey published in december by dahaf institute which is also 
independent 
the earlier poll said 54 percent of israelis favored talks with 
the palestine liberation organization if it dropped terrorist 
operations against israel 
the new poll of 1251 randomly selected israelis dropped any 
reference to ending terrorism and found 56 percent said no when 
asked do you believe there is room for negotiations with the plo 
and if so towards what end 
rachel israeli of modain ezrachi said the reason for the swing of 
opinion was because the new survey simply asked about talks without 
the question of terrorism many people do not believe the plo has 
stopped their terror activities she said 
in the new poll 8 percent favored talks with the plo on an 
independent state in the occupied lands 17 percent endorsed talks 
aimed at establishing a state in jordan 12 percent endorsed talks 
on autonomy for palestinians and 7 percent said israel should talk 
to the plo on other issues 
the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent 
plo chief yasser arafat declared in december that his group was 
renouncing terrorism and recognizing israels right to exist the 
statements led the united states to begin a dialogue with the plo 
israel refuses to talk to the plo saying it is a terrorist 
organization 
in the west bank town of nablus palestinian sources said at 
least seven palestinian moderates have been threatened with death if 
they continue exploratory talks with israelis 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said that on 
march 17 two masked arab youths claiming to represent the 
syrianbased popular front for the liberation of palestine visited 
the moderates and gave what they called a last warning 
the moderates most of them arafat supporters were told to halt 
meetings with israelis and foreign delegations 
the popular front a marxist plo faction is opposed to 
concessions arafat has made in a bid to start peace negotiations 
prime minister yitzhak shamir was quoted today as saying in an 
interview with the maariv newspaper that he still believes there are 
nonplo palestinians available for negotiations with israel 
there can be leaders in the occupied territories who are not 
connected with the plo there are among them wise people 
intellectuals but i am not going to reveal their names because it 
may bring them harm said shamir 
shamir vowed to continue a secret dialogue with palestinians 
before his trip to washington in early april he was quoted as 
saying he would present to the bush administration things which 
perhaps have not been heard from me before he gave no details 
also today two palestinians died of wounds sustained earlier 
raising to 407 the number killed since the palestinian uprising 
against israeli rule in the occupied lands began in december 1987 
eighteen israelis have been killed

teachers wont file midterm grades with the 
nations secondlargest school district unless their contract 
demands are met and will strike may 1 if threatened with loss of 
paychecks a union leader said 
withholding grades from the district puts the pressure on 
united teacherslos angeles president wayne johnson said thursday 
it means if we do want to take action at the end of the year it 
will be very effective 
if teachers keep their grade reports from the school district 
students would be given their grades on unionsupplied report cards 
johnson said 
associate superintendent gabriel cortina said thursday the 
district doesnt plan to withhold paychecks which it threatened to 
do last month when teachers attempted to withhold final grades for 
the fall semester 
but he said some pay will be deducted from paychecks of teachers 
who dont turn in the midterm grades which are due april 7 
we have maintained that if teachers do not perform the 
assignment of preparing the report cards they will be docked he 
said 
teachers on feb 7 voted almost 9to1 to authorize preparations 
for a strike a second strike vote is scheduled april 19 
los angeles last teachers strike was in 1970 
union leaders said they decided to urge teachers to withhold 
midterm grades because they believe the district is planning to 
close the schools for the summer two weeks early in order to foil a 
union threat to strike in june the midterm grades would then be 
used as final grades for students johnson said 
both cortina and bill honig state superintendent of public 
instruction denied there is such a plan 
nobodys talked to me about it honig said and theres no 
way they district officials could do that it would cost them a 
fortune 
the teachers and administrators have been bargaining for more 
than a year over a new contract for the districts 32000 teachers 
and have deadlocked over the issue of pay 
the teachers want a 21 percent pay increase over two years while 
the district has offered a 20 percent pay hike over three years

president bush praised us talks with the 
palestine liberation organization in an interview published today 
and said he would try to convince israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir something good might come out of this kind of discussion 
i will tell him that the talks that we are having with the 
plo representatives there in tunisia are good things and well tell 
him why i think they are good things bush said in the interview 
with the washington times 
bush is scheduled to meet with shamir who refuses to speak with 
plo representatives in washington on april 6 
asked whether he would urge shamir to join the talks with the 
plo bush told the newspaper i dont know what ill say to him 
about that 
but ill say to him that we have got to move the peace process 
forward we may by then be ready with some specific ideas 
shamir in an interview broadcast today on the nbc today 
program on the 10th anniversary of the camp david accords which 
brought peace between israel and egypt reiterated his stand against 
such talks with the plo 
its not a question of talks he said for us its a 
question of life a question of existence the state of israel will 
not be able to exist together with a palestinian state here in this 
small country 
shamir called for palestinians on the west bank to forsake the 
idea of a separate state 
i am convinced that the majority of the palestinian arabs will 
come to this conviction that they have to live in peace with us and 
that the only way to live together with us is to negotiate to talk 
in order to achieve some peaceful solutions and the time will come 
for it he said we are ready 
but former israeli defense minister ezer weizman now the 
countrys science minister said on abcs good morning america 
he is convinced that we have to talk to plo chairman yasser 
arafat 
reminded that the israeli electorate has rejected such 
negotiations weizman said that with correct leadership and an 
honest way of putting an issue you can change the views and 
opinions of the electorate 
former president carter who brought about the camp david 
accords said on the abc program that there should be negotiations 
with arafat ultimately 
but he added i think the first step will have to be direct 
talks between the israelis and palestinian leaders chosen in the 
west bank and gaza who have the full support and public endorsement 
of the plo including arafat 
in tunis on wednesday us and plo representatives held their 
first meeting since bush became president 
arafat said thursday that the 4hour meeting between us 
ambassador robert h pelletreau and yasser abedrabbo of the plo 
executive committee was positive 
there is a mutual interest and intention to lead this dialogue 
to success arafat said 
bush took that view in the interview saying that in his meeting 
with shamir i will endeavor to convince the prime minister that 
something good might come out of this kind of discussion 
the tunis meeting was the second formal meeting since talks began 
in december after arafat publicly renounced terrorism and 
recognized israels right to exist there was no indication whether 
a third meeting was scheduled but the plo chiefs mood suggested 
the dialogue will continue

bombing of pan am flight 103 a us agency warned that people posing 
as police had questioned twa staff members in west germany about 
transporting explosives 
the independent said the warning by the federal aviation 
administration was the fourth involving a potential terrorist attack 
before the dec 21 bombing that killed 270 people 
the flight which orignated in frankfurt west germany and 
changed planes at londons heathrow airport was blown up over 
scotland killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground 
investigators say the new yorkbound plane was destroyed by a bomb 
hidden in a radiocassette player 
it said the faa alerted airports airlines and governments after 
people posing as police twice asked american employees of twa at the 
frankfurt airport how us carriers transported explosives 
detonators and pistols 
the newspaper said the dec 7 faa bulletin was disclosed in 
washington by a house of representatives transportation 
subcommittee which has been holding hearings on the lockerbie 
bombing 
rep cardiss collins dill chairwoman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on transportation on sunday released an 
analysis of 33 faa bulletins on airline security including one on 
the twa incident the bulletins were issued from jan 1 1988 to 
feb 16 1989 
the independents frontpage report was accompanied by a 
reproduction of part of the faa bulletin it read faa bulletin 
21 two attempts to test frankfurt security 
the bulletin continued in an faa bulletin dated dec 7 1988 
the faa described two incidents that may indicate attempts to test 
security procedures of a us carrier operating from frankfurt 
international airport 
on at least two occasions individuals claiming phony law 
enforcement status sought information from twa on procedures for 
transporting pistols explosives and a detonator in one incident 
the man asked his questions at the twa ticket counter apparently 
no attempt was made to detain and question him 
the faa noted that the incidents occurred within a few days of 
each other there is a possibility they are related the bulletin 
said 
the paper quoted the british department of transport which 
received other faa alerts before the bombing as refusing to say if 
it had received the dec 7 warning 
the west germans said they had not been sent a copy the 
paper said 
faa officials were not immediately available for comment 
the newspaper said the warning followed one the faa issued after 
the us embassy in helsinki finland was told on dec 5 that an 
attempt would be made to bomb a pan am flight from frankfurt to the 
united states in the next two weeks 
antiterrorist officers found a radiocassette bomb in an alleged 
terrorist hideout at the end of october the newspaper said the 
department of transport issued two warnings on the bomb but did not 
mail them until the second week of january

president bush nailed down the first plank of 
his emerging foreign policy by achieving a rare agreement with 
congress to extend aid to the contra rebels and support central 
american peace efforts 
congressional and administration sources said the accord in the 
works for the past month came together after a series of meetings 
thursday between secretary of state james a baker iii and democrats 
and republicans on both sides of the capitol 
bush was to announce the twopage policy agreement in a white 
house appearance today with congressional leaders press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said the president met with baker this morning 
before the congressional group to finalize the language 
we anticipate it will be finally approved at this meeting 
with the bipartisan congressional leaders fitzwater said they 
have been working on this and there are some changes 
as of thursday night the accord called for congress to extend 
aid to the antisandinista contra rebels now scheduled to end after 
this month through feb 28 1990 in exchange the administration 
pledges to support peace efforts of the five central american 
presidents and the eventual reintegration of the rebels into 
nicaraguan political life 
contra supporters say the continued presence of the 11000 
fighters along the nicaraguan border with honduras will maintain 
pressure on the leftist sandinista government to restore political 
freedoms and hold free elections early next year 
while the agreement mentioned no specific figure for continued 
aid to the rebels money was to flow at the current rate of about 4 
million a month putting the aid package at roughly 40 million 
the presidents of honduras el salvador costa rica guatemala 
and nicaragua agreed in february to renew their peace efforts and 
pledged to come up with a plan by midmay to disband the contra 
force and for the rebels to be reintegrated into nicaragua as 
political freedoms are reestablished 
all new aid to the contras must remain consistent with that 
agreement the accord stipulates 
for the president the agreement marked a significant step toward 
his promise of a bipartisan foreign policy and was a welcome 
accomplishment in the face of growing criticism that his 
administration has been slow to get off the ground reviews of 
policy on arms control soviet relations and the middle east remain 
uncompleted 
the accord also represented an attempt to make a clean break from 
the past polarization over nicaragua which plagued president 
reagans relations with capitol hill throughout his two terms 
we are trusting the administration and they are trusting us 
said rep david obey dwis i do think the administration is 
legitimate on this 
a key to the agreement was the insertion by obey of a provision 
that will allow any one of four congressional committees involved in 
foreign affairs to cut off the rebels aid after november if they 
believe the presence of the contras is harming regional peace 
efforts 
another provision stipulates that aid will end automatically 
should the contras engage in military attacks or crossborder 
incursions or commit human rights violations the package also says 
the aid money can be used for regional relocation of the rebels 
baker won praise from lawmakers for his patience and 
forthrightness during lengthy meetings with all sides on the 
divisive issue and for his nonideological approach most described 
baker as someone who came to congress not to sell a policy but to 
find one 
theres no question that he wanted to find the center of 
gravity and rest his policy on it said rep john spratt dsc 
a moderate democrat who has been part of a group of swing voters 
on contra aid in the past he has been trying to build a policy 
based on political reality 
in bakers early forays to the capitol he presented lawmakers 
with a secret 10page policy statement that included a timetable for 
democratization steps in nicaragua along with rewards and 
punishments the united states could mete out at each juncture 
in the end he was able to secure agreement only on a twopage 
statement of broad goals which alluded to the need for carrots and 
sticks to move the sandinista government toward democracy but which 
eliminated most specifics 
much of the twopage us policy statement which had been 
stamped secret and kept under close wraps by baker consisted of 
broad and general policy pronouncements reaffirming democratic goals 
for the region missing from the document were the kinds of harsh

americans personal income increased a strong 1 
percent in february while spending rose at half that pace as people 
diverted more of their earnings into savings the government 
reported today 
the commerce department said income rose to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 432 trillion last month following a robust revised 
gain of 17 percent in january 
consumer spending meanwhile rose 05 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 338 trillion in february after increasing 
a revised 04 percent in january 
most of the gain in personal consumption expenditures which 
include virtually all consumer spending except interest payments on 
debt came in increased spending for services analysts said that 
was partly a reflection of an upturn in heating bills last month 
after januarys mild weather 
spending on services rose 1 percent last month while purchases 
of nondurable goods edged up 01 percent and spending on durable 
goods declined 03 percent held back in part by slow car sales 
most analysts expect gains in income and spending to slow this 
year in response to a campaign by the federal reserve board to nudge 
up interest rates and relieve inflationary pressures on the economy 
other government reports for february have suggested an economic 
slowdown already may be setting in with declines recorded in retail 
sales housing construction factory operating rates and orders for 
durable goods 
last months changes in income and spending bolstered the 
personal savings rate savings as a percentage of aftertax income 
to 59 percent from 54 percent in january februarys rate 
matched the savings level set in april 1986 and hasnt been 
surpassed since may 1985 when the rate was 64 percent 
februarys increase in personal income included a large increase 
in farm subsidy payments excluding that effect income rose 07 
percent last month 
disposable or aftertax income increased 11 percent in 
february after a 17 percent gain a month earlier 
wages and salaries a key component of personal income rose 06 
percent to 257 trillion in february following a 11 percent gain

a couple who take in former psychiatric 
patients as boarders successfully challenged a town zoning rule 
limiting the number of unrelated people living in the same house 
the new york state court of appeals the states top court on 
thursday threw out a long island towns zoning law that restricted 
the number of unrelated people living together because the town did 
not also restrict the number of related people who could live 
together 
im glad its all over its been a long drawnout thing 
said rose ann baer of brookhaven who challenged the zoning ruling 
along with her husband steve 
the baers who have a suffolk county license to run a rooming 
house were told in 1984 that they were in violation of town rules 
nonetheless because four women lived in the home along with the 
couples two children 
the towns zoning law said no more than four unrelated people 
could live under the same roof in a singlefamily district 
two women currently live in the home with the baers ms baer 
said 
her lawyer jane reinhardt said she was pleased with the 
fourparagraph decision but disappointed with its brevity 
i wish they had said some kind of socially conscious thing 
about the need to help the elderly and disabled reinhardt said 
edwin crawford counsel for the state association of towns said 
the decision should make communities look more carefully at their 
zoning laws he predicted the decision wouldnt lead to a large 
number of group or student homes opening in residential areas 
this does not totally abrogate the ability of local governments 
to use their zoning regulations to preserve the character of 
singlefamily neighborhoods crawford said it will just take 
some careful draftsmanship 
brookhavens town attorney david fishbein did not return a 
telephone call seeking comment

hundreds of christians from around the world 
today walked along the via dolorosa in jerusalems old city praying 
and singing as they retraced christs path to his crucifixion on 
good friday 
the procession to the church of the holy sepulchre where 
christians believe christ died on the cross was led by 20 roman 
catholic franciscan monks in black robes tied with white rope belts 
the crowd seemed smaller than in recent years pilgrims were seen 
dragging only about a half dozen large wooden crosses along the 
narrow cobbled street in the walled old city 
because of the 15month palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation in the territories hundreds of police border guards and 
army soldiers were on duty clustered in groups of six or eight on 
the via dolorosa 
no major violence was reported 
in the philippines at least 11 people were nailed to crosses and 
thousands of filipinos drew blood by beating themselves on the back 
today to symbolize the suffering of christ 
the crucifixions have been an annual ritual for decades in san 
pedro cutud 40 miles north of manila and this year drew 5000 
people the rituals have become tourist attractions in recent years 
complete with stalls selling food soft drinks straw hats fans and 
other souvenirs 
pope john paul ii marked good friday by hearing the confessions 
of six italians and a west german religion teacher in the vatican 
the roman catholic leader 10 years ago began hearing confessions in 
st peters basilica on good friday to emphasize the importance of 
the sacrament 
in jerusalem 600 pilgrims marched behind the monks the marchers 
included groups carrying canadian and australian flags as well as 
the french fleurdelis a guitarist led a group of spaniards 
john eberlein 56 of manassas va said he was deeply moved to 
see christians gathered together from around the world 
you just feel you are part of a tremendous movement this 
christian religion no matter what denomination it might be he 
said to see all colors here all believing the same thing you 
believe its just very exhilarating spiritually moving 
eberlein was with a group of 11 catholics who came from the us 
east coast to walk the via dolorosa and attend the mass for christs 
resurrection on easter sunday 
a group of american christians from california performed a 
pageant along the route 
ralph beltran of los angeles portraying christ was dressed in a 
white robe and wore a crown of thorns he carried a large wooden 
cross and companions dressed as roman guards ritually flogged him 
joanne petranela of brea calif dressed as mary magdalene ran 
among astonished onlookers shouting its all my fault 
a german pilgrim from munich who identified himself only as 
helmut termed it a disgrace to christianity 
according to christian tradition the via dolorosa or street of 
sorrows marks the path where jesus was forced to carry the cross on 
which he was crucified franciscans began the tradition of walking 
the street in the 14th century 
israeli troops moved into the old city and arab east jerusalem 
then jordanian territory in the 1967 middle east war 
since then israel annexed arab east jerusalem and joined it into 
the israeli capital but most foreign countries including the 
united states consider east jerusalem disputed territory and keep 
their embassies in the israeli coastal city of tel aviv 
the old city contains sites holy to the worlds three great 
monotheistic religions judaism christianity and islam jerusalem 
is a major point of friction between jews and arabs 
israel also seized the west bank and gaza strip in the 1967 war 
the palestinian uprising has demanded an end to that occupation 
more than 400 palestinians and 18 israelis have been killed

high school enrollment in china has dropped more 
than 25 percent in the past 10 years officials said today and 
chinese leader deng xiaoping acknowledged that beijings education 
policies are in crisis 
elementary school enrollment has also fallen more than 14 percent 
since 1978 when china embarked on an ambitious program to develop 
its economy 
our biggest mistake over the last 10 years is that education 
has not developed sufficiently the peoples daily quoted deng as 
saying 
minister of education li tieying said the educational system 
declined because china failed to make education a priority and 
because students are not convinced that an education will improve 
their standard of living 
he also said at a news conference that chinas new agricultural 
policies encourage families to remove children from school li said 
however the state doesnt have the money to improve the education 
system 
he called for an education tax and said tuition should be raised 
and schools should set up their own businesses to make money 
china which used to pride itself on its free education has 
begun forcing schools to set up small factories restaurants or 
hotels to pay for themselves 
in some areas schools charge tuition ranging from 27 a year to 
810 about twice the salary of an average chinese urban worker 
to pay for books and other materials 
the news conference came during a meeting of chinas legislature 
the national peoples congress which is studying a proposal to 
raise the education budget by 15 percent to the equivalent of 10 
billion 
last year china spent about 11 a person for education one of 
the lowest figures in the world 
consequently in 1988 more than 60 percent of junior high schools 
and 90 percent of elementary schools lacked sufficient facilities 
and goods li said he said teachers in china make less than the 
average worker in a staterun factory and most dont qualify for the 
job 
the low priority given to education has meant only about 
onethird of chinas pupils finish primary school of those less 
than 10 percent go on to high school or college the average chinese 
spends five years in school despite a law mandating nine years of 
education 
as a result there are 220 million illiterates in china most of 
them in the countryside li said part of the problem he said is 
that recent agricultural policies giving land back to the peasants 
have meant millions of children have abandoned school to till family 
fields 
in addition there are few financial incentives for chinese to 
get an education li said highlyeducated chinese are underpaid 
starting salaries for collegeeducated chinese men and women hover 
around 29 a month a hairdresser can make 10 times that much 
an increasing number of graduate students are leaving school to 
seek higher wages outside of academia and research li said 
when asked what should china do about the problem li declined to 
be specific he said china would implement laws to help education 
and that a commission was working on a reform program

a government commission has concluded that 
thousands of people buried in a mass grave outside kiev were killed 
during stalins repressions not by nazi soldiers tass reported 
today 
the commissions conclusion supports the testimony of elderly 
witnesses in the nearby village of bykovnia who said they saw 
trucks dripping blood rumbling to the site in the 1930s before the 
nazis occupied the area 
unofficial estimates say the grave contains 200000 to 300000 
bodies 
villagers in bykovnia broke five decades of silence to accuse 
josef stalins secret police after the ukrainian government erected 
a monument in may 1988 blaming nazi occupiers for the crime the 
villagers in december forced ukrainian authorities to establish the 
commission saying three previous investigations had covered up the 
truth by blaming nazi troops 
today report by tass the official soviet news agency did not 
mention the earlier investigations 
viktor kulik head of the investigating commission told tass 
that panelists found family names engraved on some objects in the 
grave 
examination of the archives later confirmed that the victims 
were peoples enemies charged in the 1930s with 
counterrevolutionary and nationalist activity espionage and 
conspiracy tass said 
official confirmation has been given to the version that in the 
darnitsa forest near the village of bykovnia outside the ukrainian 
capital of kiev are buried victims of the repressions of the 
1930s tass said 
western historians estimate 20 million soviets were killed under 
stalin particularly during the great purge of the late 1930s but 
soviet officials ignored the dark side of stalin for most of the 
past 50 years the examination of stalins crimes began briefly 
under nikita khrushchev and was revived in 1987 under president 
mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness 
earlier commissions blamed nazis for the bykovnia killings even 
though villagers insisted the bodies already were there when the 
germans occupied kiev in september 1941 several villagers told the 
associated press they dug up the graves on orders of the germans 
a local man mikola lysenko discovered the bones and skulls in 
1987 after grave robbers uncovered them and set out on a personal 
crusade for the truth 
he located witnesses in bykovnia and won support from the 
ukrainian writers union and the newly formed memorial society 
which is dedicated to baring the truth of stalins crimes 
lysenko was unavailable for comment today as he does not have a 
telephone

striking flight attendants today ended their 
walkout against continental airlines saying their protests had 
accomplished the unions goal of publicizing its grievances the 
fiveday walkout had had little effect on service 
the airline which has a largely ununionized work force since 
texas air corp head frank lorenzo took continental into bankruptcy 
proceedings in 1983 said that only a few attendants had taken part 
and that they had lost their jobs but have the right to fill future 
job openings 
the union of flight attendants said its executive board ended the 
strike at 9 am union officials were notifying attendants to 
report for their work assignments 
this strike accomplished the objectives we set out to 
achieve carla winkler union president said in a statement 
we have been able to bring to the publics attention the 
disparate treatment between the wages and working conditions of 
continental flight attendants and flight attendants at other 
carriers in the industry 
when the strike began some of those on the picket line said it 
was intended to last only 96 hours a figure winkler refused to 
confirm 
union leaders had said that the strike was largely unrelated to 
the machinists union walkout against sister eastern airlines 
another brach of texas air that strike which began march 4 
virtually shut down the airline when most eastern pilots opted not 
to cross machinists picket lines 
at continental officials said 180 attendants refused to report 
for work during the job action and were replaced the union said all 
week that the number of strike participants was more like 1000 and 
claimed that some flights were canceled but offered no proof 
the houstonbased airline lists its flight attendant work force 
at 6440 
we feel really good that we enjoyed the support of so many of 
our flight attendants airline spokesman dave messing said today 
not a single cancellation occurred as a result of the union 
activity 
it the strike just didnt have the support needed to cause 
disruptions 
messing said the 180 strikers had been permanently replaced but 
were subject to recall when job openings became available and would 
have seniority over new applicants

a close adviser to georgias democratic 
governor said today he was one of the 21 investors who put up 5000 
each to promote a 1984 book by rep newt gingrich the newly elected 
house republican whip 
joel cowan a peachtree city ga real estate developer who is 
treasurer of the georgia democratic party and the honorary chief of 
staff to gov joe frank harris said in a telephone interview that 
he invested in the book promotion deal because he thought gingrich 
had a message for the public 
cowans participation in the book promotion deal was first 
disclosed in todays wall street journal gingrich earlier this week 
promised to list all 21 investors once he has contacted them 
personally 
the journal said cowans company cowan and associates received 
a 204480 grant from the department of housing and urban 
development last year but cowan denied today that his company ever 
received such a grant 
unless there is just a total lapse of memory and organization 
on my part i didnt get it cowan said and if im right 
clearly somebody used my name to get a grant im going to get to 
the bottom of it 
cowan said he has never supported gingrich politically and and 
has never contributed to any of his congressional campaigns he said 
he made a 500 contribution last year to gingrichs democratic 
opponent david worley 
cowan said he has had very little contact with gingrich over the 
years he said he once wrote him recommending an appointment to the 
air force academy and once visited him in washington when he was 
making calls on all members of the georgia delegation for harris 
shortly after his election in 1982 
cowan said he became interested in gingrichs book window of 
opportunity in 1983 when the congressman mentioned the project 
during a speech to the aspen group a mostly republican group of 
people involved in real estate 
cowan said he invited gingrich to speak at that meeting because 
i thought he had a message at the time he was speaking out on 
supplyside economics and he was an outspoken conservative voice 
cowan said the members of the group who attended the aspen 
meeting split the cost of gingrichs travel and lodging expenses 
the partnership created to promote gingrichs book was to have 
received half of the publishers profits in exchange for their 
investment but there were not enough sales to produce profits and 
cowan said all he got for his 5000 was six copies of the book and 
a tax writeoff

here is a transcript of statements friday by 
president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii on aid to 
the contras in nicaragua 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in my inaugural address i advocated a bipartisan foreign policy 
and today we the executive and the congress republicans and 
democrats will be speaking one voice on an extremely important 
foreign policy issue central america 
weve signed today in the cabinet room a bipartisan accord on 
central america which sets out the broad outlines of us policy 
toward the region 
were seeking the same goals as those of the people of central 
america democracy security and peace 
in order to meet the challenge of realizing those goals we must 
work together with latin american democratic leaders with the 
support of our european friends 
under the esquipulas accord insurgent forces have the right to 
reintegrate into their homeland under safe democratic conditions 
with full civil and political rights and that is the desire of the 
nicaraguan resistance 
to achieve our objectives the bipartisan leadership of congress 
has agreed to support my request for continued humanitarian 
assistance at current levels through the elections in nicaragua 
scheduled for feb 28 1990 
we do not claim the right to order the politics of nicaragua 
that is for the nicaraguan people to decide 
the esquipulas accord requires a free open political process in 
which all groups can participate the playing field must be level 
the burden of proof is on the sandinista government to comply 
with the promises that it has made since 1979 
and if they comply we have an opportunity to start a new day in 
central america 
the soviet union also has an obligation and an opportunity to 
demonstrate its new thinking 
in other regional conflicts its adopted a welcome new approach 
but in central america what weve seen to date is only old thinking 
the soviet union has no legitimate security interests in central 
america 
the united states has many 
we reject any doctrine of equivalence in the region 
the soviet union and cuba have an obligation to stop violating 
the provisions of esquipulas 
some see violence and despair in central america but i have a 
different view of its future 
i can see a democratic central america in which all nations in 
the region live in peace where resources are devoted to social ends 
instead of military defense 
i hope the esquipulas accord and the bipartisan accord that weve 
signed here will someday be seen as the first step toward that 
future

ladies and gentlemen i think if you examine american foreign 
policy throughout the postwar era one truth certainly shines 
through 
from president trumans support for nato to president reagans 
inf agreement every important achievement has enjoyed sustained 
bipartisan support 
a bipartisan foreign policy is based on honest and honorable 
discussion and debate 
its not based on suppressing legitimate differences 
in the end it is also i think based on a recognition that we 
are after all one people 
we are one nation 
and we must have one consistent foreign policy 
today weve taken the first important steps toward building a 
successful bipartisan policy in central america 
if asked to summarize that policy in one word i would say 
democracy 
together we want the people of nicaragua as well as all others 
in central america to be able to participate freely and fully in 
democracy 
and now together the executive branch and the congress will 
work to ensure that the promises of democracy in nicaragua become 
democracy in fact 
i want to salute the speaker the other leaders here and many 
many others in the senate and the house whose dedication and hard 
work and perseverance made this agreement possible 
they have performed as leaders in the very best sense of that 
term

a nuclear regulatory commission lawyer in 1986 
warned officials against paying informants without congressional 
approval according to an internal document but two years later the 
agency paid a witness 4000 for information against the nrcs no 2 
investigator 
in a sixpage memo dated sept 2 1986 assistant general counsel 
hudson b ragan told nrc investigations director ben b hayes that 
informant payments would not be on sound legal ground noting 
that federal law and legislative history are all silent on the use 
of such an investigative technique by the commission 
ragan recommended that the commission either write such a 
provision into the next years nrc budget or seek informal approval 
from congress 
but in an interview thursday ragan said he believes such 
payments can be made without congressional approval in special 
circumstances where officials can prove the information is essential 
to health and safety 
lawmakers and congressional aides who watch the nrc say they have 
never heard of the commission paying informants and were shocked 
earlier this week when rep sam gejdenson dconn obtained an nrc 
contract detailing a 4000 payment to douglas s ellison a former 
technician at the nine mile point plant in upstate new york 
gejdenson accused the commission of trying to undermine the 
office of investigations by paying ellison who had accused the 
offices deputy director roger a fortuna of misconduct 
in the 1986 memo ragan gave commission officials a detailed 
analysis of administrative precedent in other agencies showing that 
in all but one other case the us comptroller general strongly 
admonished agencies either to seek specific legislative authority 
or to make sure congress did not object 
he also pointed to specific congressional authorizations of 
informant payments in other agencies as a precedent 
these enactments create the implication that such expenditures 
should not be incurred except by express authority or by expressly 
informing congress that such expenditures will be incurred ragan 
wrote 
but in a telephone interview from the nrcs rockville md 
headquarters ragan said such congressional approval would be 
necessary only if the commission wanted to create a regular program 
to pay informants 
the main thrust of the memorandum is you just dont go 
engaging in this kind of activity without advising congress or 
getting special authority unless you have special circumstances 
ragan said 
generally speaking any agency that can show a substantial need 
for obtaining information that is not otherwise available to them 
can use their appropriations to obtain that information he said 
our type of cases have been based upon a specific need of 
health and safety he added the instances that we have paid 
informants to the best of my knowledge are very few and far 
between and we dont think we have to establish such a program 
ragan said he believes there have been only two or three 
instances of nrc payments to informants in the past 10 years 
ellison contends that fortuna passed along confidential 
information provided by ellison to stephen comley a massachusetts 
antinuclear activist 
nrc officials who are trying to fire fortuna for his refusal to 
testify on the ellison allegations say they will not discuss the 
case because it is still pending 
one nrc official close to the fortuna investigation who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity said ellison was not an informer but a 
consultant 
but ellison said in an interview earlier this week that he was 
paid to testify and provide the commission with tapes of 
conservations he secretly recorded 
the nrc official argued that ellisons explanation and 
interpretations of the tapes constituted consulting work

chanting antiabortion protesters gathered at 
a health clinic today and prochoice demonstrators followed as a 
group called operation rescue went into the second day of its holy 
week crusade against abortion 
police said about 150 abortion foes showed up at a clinic in long 
beach early this morning a day after 373 operation rescue members 
were arrested while defying a court order and blockading a clinic in 
suburban cypress 
there were no immediate arrests in long beach said lt columbus 
lowe 
a caravan of operation rescue members earlier passed by a clinic 
on long beach boulevard where prochoice demonstrators were already 
waiting 
prochoice forces have been stationed at mobilization centers 
from which they can be dispatched to counter operation rescue 
protests 
operation rescue opened its southern california campaign of civil 
disobedience on thursday in orange county about 500 protesters sang 
hymns and prayed at the family planning associates medical clinic in 
cypress about 20 miles southeast of los angeles 
elsewhere today more than 200 antiabortion protesters in 
albany ny staged a good friday demonstration at a planned 
parenthood clinic with police reporting 80 to 100 arrests by 
midmorning fifty protesters were charged with trespassing in 
syracuse for entering a planned parenthood center while another 100 
protested outside 
police arrested 124 protesters four busloads who gathered in 
rain and gusting winds outside a downtown philadelphia clinic three 
days after a federal judge barred such protests in the area at a 
second downtown site 500 demonstrators assembled but left when they 
learned patients had entered through a back door abortion rights 
advocates staged a counterdemonstration 
some 100 demonstrators in the detroit suburb of farmington hills 
similarly dispersed when they found a clinic closed said police 
inspector richard niemisto in cincinnati 30 to 35 demonstrators in 
front of two womens clinics were orderly and there were no arrests 
southern california was targeted as the center of most preeaster 
national week of rescue because of its high abortion rate and many 
clinics organizers said 
operation rescue has staged many similar protests throughout the 
country most notably during the democratic national convention in 
atlanta last summer 
leaders of the group had vowed to risk arrest by defying a 
federal court order obtained by the american civil liberties union 
that prohibited protesters from blocking entrances or gathering 
within 15 feet of certain clinics 
among those arrested was randall terry the zealous 29yearold 
leader of operation rescue terry and many of his followers refused 
to talk to reporters 
led by feminist attorney gloria allred shouting in a bullhorn 
advocates of a womans right to an abortion applauded and gleefully 
chanted read him his rights take him away every time a 
protester was arrested 
those arrested were booked for investigation of failing to 
disperse a misdemeanor under terrys order they fell limp during 
arrests forcing four police officers to drag each one off to a bus 
that took them to city hall 
los angeles officials who had expected protests by as many 2500 
people followed developments during the day from a city hall 
command center but los angeles clinics were spared 
police in suburban inglewood had set up a temporary jail site at 
the hollywood park race track but it was unneeded 
operation rescue began its blockades outside womens clinics in 
1987 and since then more than 21000 of its antiabortion 
protesters have been arrested nationwide 
in the most recent figures available california recorded 304130 
abortions in 1985 with some 100360 performed at about 75 clinics in 
the los angeles area 
some 15 million abortions have been performed annually in the 
united states since the us supreme court decision of 1973 that 
made abortion legal for women in all states

first lady raisa gorbachev said friday that 
candidates in this weekends parliamentary elections such as 
communist firebrand boris n yeltsin should be allowed to state 
their views freely 
she declined however to say if shell vote for him 
as she guided a group of soviet and american students on a tour 
of the kremlin the wife of president mikhail s gorbachev offered a 
rare glimpse of her views on domestic politics when asked twice by 
reporters to comment on yeltsins campaign for a seat in the new 
congress of peoples deputies 
everything is normal said mrs gorbachev every candidate 
has a right to his program to stating it to its reasoning and the 
people have a right to express their attitude to it 
although mrs gorbachev often answers reporters questions when 
she is visiting foreign countries with her husband it was unusual 
for her to comment on domestic politics 
communist party leaders have criticized yeltsin ousted as moscow 
party boss by gorbachev in 1987 and last week launched an 
investigation into whether his views clash with the official party 
line 
at campaign appearances the 58yearold yeltsin has railed 
against the privileges of the soviet elite complaining that more 
radical economic reforms are needed to put food on empty store 
shelves 
in sundays elections yeltsin is running against yevgeny brakov 
director of the huge moscow zil limousine plant for the countrys 
most visible parliamentary seat the one representing all of moscow 
brakov generally conforms to the party line 
mrs gorbachev was asked whether she will vote for yeltsin whom 
her husband brought into the soviet leadership in 1985 or for 
brakov 
why namely for brakov or yeltsin we have many candidates 
running today mrs gorbachev said as she stood among the soviet 
and american students 
pressed to name the candidate of her choice she said well 
elections are a secret matter and i think it would not be polite 
not modest for me to state a preference 
sundays elections are the first national balloting involving 
more than one candidate in the soviet union and mrs gorbachev said 
the campaign has gone well 
for us it has great significance because it shows the 
practical implementation of all the steps taken so far in the field 
of political reforms and so completely unusual social activity has 
developed during the elections and thats excellent mrs 
gorbachev said 
yeltsin was fired as moscow party chief in november 1987 for 
complaining that gorbachevs reforms were proceeding too slowly and 
warning that a cult was developing around the soviet leader 
yeltsin who is still a member of the partys policymaking 
central committee has alleged in the campaign that the party is 
using unethical tactics to make sure he is not elected 
mrs gorbachev met with 70 soviet and 26 american students 
holding what is billed as a youth summit to discuss ecology 
human rights drugs and alcohol abuse and sovietamerican relations 
the americans ranging in age from 9 to 19 are affiliated with 
youth ambassadors of america a group based in bellingham wash 
during the 45minute kremlin tour mrs gorbachev displayed her 
knowledge of english asking a 10yearold fazel hussain of tampa 
fla whats your name and reading english words on souvenirs 
she was given by the americans 
she told reporters she had studied german in high school and has 
been studying english on her own 
i read a little better i speak only rarely only when there 
are meetings she said

rebels fighting somalias governmment claimed 
friday they hold almost a third of the strategically important 
country on the horn of africa and are closing on two major northern 
cities 
abdirahman ahmed ali the rebel somali national movements 
executive committee member responsible for foreign relations also 
claimed libya has provided nerve gas to the somali government and 
trained soldiers to use it ali said the gas was now in the port of 
berbera 
the reports could not be independently confirmed 
for some time we have been controlling 85 percent of the 
northern region which is about onethird of somalia and in the 
past four weeks we have been closing on the main cities in the 
north ali said in london where he is based 
rebels were fighting government troops on the outskirts of 
hargeisa and burao in northwest somalia and expect to take control 
of both cities very soon he said 
last week he said rebels captured the town of erigazo near the 
red sea and the town of odweine between hargeisa and burao 
we have also cleared a large costal area between hargeisa and 
the red sea ali said 
the movement is fighting to oust army gen mohamed siad barre 
who has ruled somalia since a 1969 coup and reestablish democracy 
the east african country of 53 million was once allied with the 
soviet union but switched allegiance to the west in 1977 
ali quoted arab newspapers in abu dhabi as saying barre had 
called in arab ambassadors in mogadishu this week and appealed for 
militry support he said libya was the only arab country that had 
provided the somali government with some arms tanks ammunition and 
nerve gas 
we know the nerve gas is now in berbera the main port on the 
gulf of aden he said it arrived there four weeks ago 
transported from mogadishu and 18 somalis who have been trained in 
libya for use of nerve gas have now come back to berbera we know 
because we have our own people there 
ali said that on wednesday government soldiers in kismaayo 
about 300 miles south of mogadishu broke into an army and police 
armory took all the ammunition and rifles and went into the bush 
apparently defecting so another front is going to start there 
soon he said 
the rebel successes he said were the result of demoralization 
in the army and an economic crisis 
somalia has accused neighboring ethiopia of arming the rebels in 
violation of a 1987 pact between the two countries that ended their 
11year war and stipulated they would not arm each others 
insurgents 
in september amnesty international said the barre government had 
executed up to 1000 civilians while trying to end the insurgency in 
the north in response the us congress froze 55 million in aid 
to the impoverished nation 
ali said the rebels were very concerned that two us 
military cargo planes were transporting arms and personnel for the 
government from mogadishu to berbera and that the americans also 
were helping the somali army with communications equipment and 
training 
we dont want the united states to be caught in civil war 
and we hope they keep out of this conflict he said 
the rebels have been fighting barre for seven years 
northern somalia is a former british protectorate that merged 
with the south a former italian colony in 1960

the coast guard said today it has found no 
sign of a sport fishing boat that radioed a distress call off the 
virginia coast and indicated 10 people aboard were abandoning ship 
officials said they feared the boat had sunk but they couldnt rule 
out a hoax 
the helicopter is having a tough time due to the fog said 
petty officer 1st class rick woods visibility was almost zero 
last night and its real low this morning 
petty officer 1st class rick barrett said today that an 
84squaremile area was being searched by the coast guard cutters 
point huron point highland and point arena two navy ships and a 
coast guard helicopter 
he said winds were blowing at 15 mph and seas were running 4 to 6 
feet 
coast guard officials have been unable to find any registration 
records for a 52foot vessel called the blue goose and were 
considering the possibility that the distress call was a hoax 
we dont know that this is a hoax but there have been hoaxes 
before petty officer 2nd class steve blando said late this 
morning 
the boat radioed late thursday that it was taking on water and 
that the passengers had donned life jackets and were abandoning the 
vessel said coast guard petty officer 1st class vernon covington 
he said officials told them to try to stay together but did not 
receive acknowledgement of that transmission 
the helicopter from elizabeth city nc arrived to help in the 
search but returned to its base shortly afterward because of 60 mph 
winds and zero visibility officials said 
seas were running 6 to 8 feet and the water temperature was 42 
degrees raising concerns that anyone overboard might suffer 
hypothermia covington said 
he said a computer check found 37 boats on the east coast with 
the name blue goose but that none fit the description of the missing 
vessel he speculated that the boat may be one of the many pleasure 
craft that travel to and from florida this time of year 
the blue goose was described as a hatterastype fishing vessel 
which has a large deck area to the rear a high cabin and sleeping 
accommodations for six to eight people

defense secretary dick cheney said today all 
of our options are open on basing mx and midgetman nuclear 
missiles and said he was not happy with the air force chief of 
staff for discussing compromise proposals 
asked about recent visits to congressional leaders by gen larry 
d welch the air forces chief of staff to discuss a compromise 
cheney said general welch was freelancing 
cheney marking completion of his first week on the job by 
holding his first pentagon news conference declared that all of 
our options are open on the issue of how to modernize americas 
landbased nuclear arsenal 
the fourstar general was not speaking for the department 
cheney said he was obviously up there on his own hook so to 
speak 
no im not happy with it frankly i think its inappropriate 
for a uniformed officer to be in a position where he is in fact 
negotiating an arrangement i will make known to him my displeasure 
everybodys entitled to one mistake 
an air force spokesman later said welch would have no comment on 
cheneys remarks 
the bush administration like the reagan administration before 
it is struggling to develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear 
missile to americas arsenal the idea is to make it more difficult 
for the soviet union to target us forces and thus deter russia 
from ever considering a firststrike attack 
the air force and pentagon have told congress they would like to 
buy 50 more huge mx missiles and place them on railcar launchers 
congressional democrats however would prefer to see the 
development of a small onewarhead midgetman missile that could be 
deployed on a truck launcher 
welch and adm william j crowe the chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff have in recent days been searching for a compromise 
according to some congressmen welch has suggested an approach in 
which 50 mx missiles already deployed in silos would be shifted to 
rail launchers while the number of midgetman missiles to be built 
would be scaled back from 500 to 300 
i have as yet made no decision with respect to the question of 
icbm modernization cheney said today 
all of our options are open the president has not yet made any 
decision on it to say that a compromise is near i think would be 
premature

oliver norths lawyers today sought to force 
former president reagan to testify when the defense opens its case 
next friday at the irancontra trial following disclosures about 
reagans acts on behalf of the nicaraguan rebels 
the importance of mr reagans testimony to the defense of this 
case is clear both from the record in the trial to date and from 
reagans efforts to quash a subpoena said defense attorney brendan 
sullivan 
in a twosentence motion sullivan asked that us district judge 
gerhard a gesell enter an order enforcing an earlier subpoena 
for reagans appearance at the trial of the former white house 
national security aide 
gesell ruled jan 30 that the former president shall remain 
subject to call in connection with a subpoena issued by norths 
lawyers and served on reagan on dec 30 
defense lawyers have brought out at norths trial that reagan was 
much more involved in secretly assisting the contra rebels than has 
previously been known publicly 
sullivan brought out that reagan personally approved based on a 
recommendation by north and others on the national security council 
staff a secret 1985 deal to give honduras 110 million in covert 
aid as an inducement to support the contras 
the defense also brought out that reagan apparently approved a 
plan from north and others in the government to airdrop intelligence 
data and recoilless rifles to the contras for the purpose of 
destroying ships carrying arms to the nicaraguan government 
reagans actions came at a time when congress had banned us 
military aid to the contras 
reagan told the tower commission which investigated the 
irancontra affair on jan 26 1987 that he did not know that the 
nsc staff was engaged in helping the contras 
reagan and thenvice president bush were served with subpoenas 
from norths lawyers and reagan and bush both sought to quash the 
subpoenas 
in a jan 13 court filing on their behalf attorney general dick 
thornburgh said the subpoenas raise profound constitutional 
concerns 
the concerns are in connection with executive privilege but 
also regarding the authority of the courts to compel appearances by 
a former or sitting president said thornburgh 
the spectacle of a former or sitting president being subjected 
to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in the 
way they deal with the president now and in the future said 
thornburgh 
in his jan 30 ruling gesell said north had failed to 
demonstrate that bush has any specific information that would 
make his testimony relevant and material to the charges against 
north the judge quashed the subpoena against the new president 
gesell said he would await developments in the trial with regard 
to the subpoena for reagan 
on thursday at norths trial an nsc aide to north said he 
assumed that profits from a 270 percent price markup on weapons 
secretly sold to iran were funneled to the contras 
marine lt col robert earl testified that north brought him into 
the iran armsforhostage deal in april 1986 
at some point in my briefing it was mentioned that part of 
the monies hat the ayatollah was providing would be going to support 
the contras in nicaragua earl testified 
as the nsc aide prepared for a may 1986 shipment of hawk missile 
spare parts i remember lt col north asking for some help in 
determining how much to charge the iranians 
earl a former rhodes scholar looked at the markup on a previous 
arms shipment and based on that charged the iranians 370 for 
each dollar in cost to the us government 
north is charged with lying to the attorney general on nov 23 
1986 by denying that the nsc was involved in the diversion of funds 
to the contras and by saying israel determined the amount of the 
diversion

the zambian government normally in the 
forefront of a campaign for an economic blockade of south africa is 
defending its airline for selling south african beer on its flights 
logistical problems forced zambia airways to buy beer from 
south africa said nephas tembo minister of state for transport 
in the past the airline bought beer from the netherlands but 
deliveries frequently were delayed he said 
south africa was the cheapest alternate source of the quality 
beer that the airline needed to maintain its competitive standards 
tembo added 
zambia one of africas most indebted nations brews its own beer 
but shortages are common and production is hindered by a lack of 
hard currency for imported ingredients

premier turgut ozal said he may quit if 
opposition parties make strong gains in sundays nationwide local 
elections 
if many want to see suleyman bey back in power or erdal bey in 
power we will say ok come take over ozal said friday 
referring to former premier suleyman demirel and opposition leader 
erdal inonu 
i am not glued to the premiers chair let whoever wants come 
run the country he said at a news conference 
turks on sunday will elect mayors provincial assembly members 
city councilors neighborhood representatives and village headmen 
voting does not directly affect the national government and 
ozals mandate extends to 1992 but opposition parties say ozal 
should call early elections if the governing motherland party 
receives less than onethird of votes nationwide 
this is not a general election and i would like to continue 
until 1992 ozal said but if matters come to a point where we 
cannot rule comfortably i will say do whatever you like 
ozals record is a major election issue during his five years in 
power the nation of 52 million people has enjoyed economic growth 
and built power plants roads and an improved communications 
network trade has been liberalized and it has applied for 
membership in the european economic community 
but inflation which reached 75 percent last year has hurt many 
wage earners and prompted a drop in support for ozal 
public opinion polls indicate the main opposition social democrat 
populist party will win mayoral posts in the capital ankara and 
turkeys third largest city izmir the motherland party is expected 
to maintain control in istanbul the second city where popular mayor 
bedrettin dalan is seeking a second fiveyear term 
ozal said he doubted the accuracy of the polls and doubted his 
party would lose he declined to say exactly what vote result would 
make him consider quitting 
respected columnist guneri civaoglu of the daily sabah said ozal 
may call general elections in six months if his party suffers a 
crushing defeat sunday 
the popularity of the centerright motherland party has declined 
steadily since it won 1983 general elections that restored civilian 
rule the party at that time garnered 45 percent of the vote 
in general elections in november 1987 the party won 36 percent 
of the vote but 65 percent of seats in the 450member legislature 
through electoral laws that favor the largest party 
ozal threatened to quit before a national referendum in november 
on advancing the date of local polls although he lost the 
referendum he stayed on saying the 35 percent of votes he won 
indicated he still had wide support

daredevil game in highway traffic israel radio reported 
baruch oren died last week after jumping in front of a speeding 
car along the busy tel avivhaifa highway and trying to force it to 
stop at the last moment the radio said 
the game is a new fad among elementary and high school 
students who also have been known to throw balls and school bags on 
roads and try to snatch them from in front of speeding cars high 
school students feel such reckless deeds toughen them before army 
service the radio said 
its a thrill said one of orens classmates who was 
interviewed on the radio it makes kids feel strong and the girls 
think theyre heroes 
on friday education minister yitzhak navon met school principals 
across the country after an investigation revealed oren died while 
playing the game 
he ordered each school to open a road safety seminar monday for 
parents and children to stress dangers of the game 
i dont know of a school in the country where the game is not 
played said yaffa saguy principal of ein hayam school where oren 
was a student in northern haifa city

prime minister margaret thatcher says she believes 
there are chances of things improving enormously in south africa 
if the government releases jailed nationalist leader nelson mandela 
until that happens there is little hope for fruitful 
negotiations on the nations future mrs thatcher said in an 
interview with the bbcs africa service to be broadcast saturday 
she is visiting africa next week but south africa is not on the 
itinerary that includes morocco nigeria malawi and zimbabwe 
i have made it quite clear that i could not go until something 
quite positive happens and mr mandela is released mrs thatcher 
said 
i think that there are chances of things improving enormously 
in south africa once mr mandela is released it opens the way for 
negotiations to start but i could not go just at the moment until 
there are more signs of that happening 
asked what was the next likely stage of developments in south 
africa she replied i have indicated that if mr mandela is 
released i think that negotiations would become possible with some 
of the other many leaders of black south africans obviously they 
are not a homogenous people any more than we are in europe 
she doubted it would be possible for tribal leaders to negotiate 
until mandela was released 
at the same time she said she could not consider meeting with 
the african national congress that mandela leads until the guerrilla 
organization renounced violence 
i think the government of south africa would like a 
renunciation of violence we did not quite get that and i do not 
talk to those who in fact pursue their ends by violent means 
she continued look we are trying to get a way through by 
saying that mr mandela should be released and should be free this 
is part of the bargain he should be free in fact to put his own 
view but not free to exercise violence 
one tries to get a lawabiding country violence is anarchy 
the rule of the gun and rule by force is not something ive had any 
sympathy with at all 
asked if she believed in one man one vote in south africa mrs 
thatcher said i think you will have to have one person one vote 
that does not necessarily mean a unitary state 
they will have to work it out 
mrs thatchers comments do not represent a new approach shes 
said this for a long time now an aide said 
mrs thatcher argues a moderate stance toward south africa can 
achieve more than advocating sanctions which she argues would hurt 
the countrys black majority more than the whiterun government and 
would devastate economies of nearby blackruled states that depend 
on south africas transport network to import and export goods

could help determine if humans can reproduce in space 
vellinger sent 32 eggs into space 16 that were two days old and 
16 that were nine days old thirtytwo others were kept on earth as 
control or comparison groups 
half of each group was sacrificed after discovery landed so the 
chicken embryos could be studied leaving eight eggs expected to 
hatch sometime saturday at the sponsoring kentucky fried chicken

canada will review a report that blamed a buildup 
of ice rather than an explosion or fire for a 1985 jetliner crash in 
newfoundland in which 256 american soldiers and civilians were 
killed a newspaper said friday 
a transport ministry spokesman rene mercier dismissed the 
report in the globe and mail as speculation but he said transport 
minister benoit bouchard would make an announcement on the issue 
next week mercier would not elaborate 
the newspaper said bouchard would announce the review next week 
as part of a sweeping program to reassure canadians about aviation 
safety 
in december the canadian aviation safety board concluded the 
crash at gander newfoundland probably was caused by ice on the 
wings of the arrow air charter dc8 
that conclusion was approved by five of the boards nine members 
but the other four members issued a report saying an inflight fire 
or explosion was the most likely cause of the dec 12 1985 disaster 
the globes report from ottawa said it was not clear whether the 
inquiry would reopen the entire investigation of the crash or only 
review the evidence compiled during the safety boards investigation 
the crash was the worst aviation disaster ever in canada all 
aboard were killed including the 248 troops heading home to fort 
campbell ky after peacekeeping duties in the middle east and 
eight american crew members 
bouchard had announced early this month that he accepted the 
boards majority conclusion and said a judicial review would not be 
necessary 
however an internal ministry report that appeared in the ottawa 
citizen rejected the majority conclusion and said the investigation 
had focused on a preconceived icing theory 
the globe and mail also said friday the program to be announced 
by bouchard would include a promise to terminate the safety board 
quickly and replace it with a new agency to review all types of 
transportation accidents 
it long has been believed that the government would replace the 
safety board with a more comprehensive agency along the lines of the 
us national transportation safety board 
the board had been formed in 1984 so that an independent agency 
would investigate air accidents rather than transport canada 
the globe and mails report said bouchard also would appoint a 
task force to examine the ministrys internal operations and its 
efforts to cope with air congestion and the strained air traffic 
control system 
on march 10 an air ontario fokker f28 jet crashed near dryden 
ontario killing 24 people in the first fatal crash of a regularly 
scheduled commercial flight in canada in 10 years

the head of the environmental protection agency 
ordered a review today of a controversial proposed dam and reservoir 
in colorado a move said by agency officials to be a first step in 
killing the project 
epa administrator william k reilly said he was concerned about 
the two forks dam project southeast of denver because as it was 
approved earlier this month by the corps of engineers it could 
result in very serious adverse environmental impact 
the action amounted to a veto of a permit issued by the corps 
said jim scherer the epas regional administrator in denver who 
had leaned in favor of allowing the dam to be built 
one senior agency source called reillys announcement the first 
step in a process that is expected to scuttle the controversial 
dam this is the door through which you have to travel to get to a 
veto of the entire project said the official speaking on the 
condition that he not be identified further 
the two forks dam project on the south platte river southwest of 
denver has been the center of a bitter fight between 
environmentalists and denver area officials who say it is needed to 
meet the regions future water needs 
epa administrator william k reilly ordered the agencys regional 
office in denver to begin a review of potentially unacceptable 
adverse enviromental effects the 500 million dam project might 
pose 
i am not convinced that the two forks dam project as proposed 
will avoid environmental harm to the extent practicable or that the 
proposed permit conditions will minimize or compensate for damage to 
fisheries wildlife habitat and recreation areas reilly said in a 
statement 
sen james exon dneb who has fought the two forks project 
because of concern that it will harm wetlands in western nebraska 
said in a telephone interview that reillys decision is expected to 
kill the proposal 
those of us who have been fighting this proeject have won 
said exon the epa director has done everything that we asked him 
to do theres nothing more that he could have done i think 
this is the practical end to this project 
reilly said the proposal as outlined by the corps of engineers 
permit issued earlier this month does not resolve the critical 
environmental issues that have surrounded the controversial 
project 
environmentalists have said that epas decision on the dam will 
be a barometer of how the bush administration intends to deal with 
environmental and conservation issues 
city officials in denver argue that the dam is needed to meet the 
water needs of the metropolitan area in the late 1990s and beyond 
but environmentalists have said the 615foothigh dam and reservoir 
would be devastating to wildlife habitat up and down the river 
environmentalists have been urging reilly to intervene in the 
decision on the dam because the agencys regional administrator jim 
scherer has indicated he favors the project if certain assurances 
are included to protect the environment 
opponents of the dam said the provisions included in the 
tentative construction permit approved by the corps of engineers 
earlier this month do not satisfy the environmental concerns 
you can hardly think of anything worse environmentally than 
this project said daniel luecke an attorney for the 
environmental defense fund in denver its an enormous project 
its the most destructive way of supplying water to the city of 
denver 
environmental concerns centered on the fact that the dam and 
reservoir would flood a vast area where the south platte and its 
north fork meet about 25 miles southwest of denver it would flood 
about 20 miles of the scenic cheesman canyon which has some of the 
best trout fishing in the state and is home for a variety of 
wildlife 
the project also has been attacked by nebraska officials who fear 
that the dam will reduce the flow of water into the big bend region 
of western nebraska and the wetlands that have been a favorite 
resting spot for whooping crane and numerous other birds 
the project was proposed by the denver water board and a 
consortium of 41 denver area water providers and municipalities 
proponents have said the dam is crucial to the regions growth 
they argue that the population of the denver area will grow from 15 
million people to 25 million people by the year 2035 and that such 
growth will outstrip the areas water supply if the dam is not built

lt gov lloyd omdahl sent senators home

rejection of a proposal to change the states name from north dakota 
to simply dakota 
the senate was on the 11th order 
as floyd stromme rose to speak 
he favored a change to dakota 
a tear rolled down his cheek 
soon rhetoric ran amuck 
as the cameras ground away 
steve yockim quoted shakespeare 
and gerald waldera waxed away 
tim mathern talked of friendship 
rolland redlin voiced support 
the democrats hadnt caucused 
but majority leader william heigaard proved a sport 
then the grand forks delegation 
gave the negative retort 
and when the vote was taken 
dakota was still somewhat north 
but it wasnt a decision on dakota 
that wrenched each senate gut 
the vote was to save wayne stenehjem 
and the sex of raymon holmbergs mutt 
stenehjem had spoken against the resolution saying his 
constituents suggested he should change his own name if he voted to 
change north dakotas 
and holmberg remarked that fixing your name is something like

the nuclear regulatory commission said 
friday it was ready to license the operation of the 54 billion 
shoreham nuclear power plant although the state already has agreed 
to dismantle it 
william russell regional administrator for the commission said 
a twoweek plant inspection had turned up six items that needed to 
be corrected before the license could be issued 
russell said at a news conference that 17 nrc officials who 
inspected shoreham gave the plant high marks in most areas and said 
it could be ready to operate as early as next month the inspection 
was a final step before a decision on whether to grant an operating 
license to the long island lighting co 
gov mario m cuomo and william catacosinos the chairman of the 
utility signed an agreement last month under which the state would 
buy the plant for 1 and dismantle it and the utility would be 
granted rate increases to make up some of its losses 
but the utility has said it would continue to take steps to 
obtain a full operating license until its full board approves the 
agreement 
cuomo and other officials have argued that shoreham should not be 
allowed to open because the area around the plant could not be 
safely evacuated during a nuclear emergency

cities is estimated at 42 percent above the french national

no crook gets the better of dick tracy 
but someone has stolen valuable original panels of the famous 
syndicated cartoon strip from the museum of cartoon art 
a number of tracy panels were willed to the museum by the creator 
of the jutjawed champion of law and order chester gould who died 
in 1985 
museum director barbara hammond said friday that because of press 
reports and rumors within the cartoon art community she was 
confirming that gould strips are missing but she declined to say 
how many or what they depicted nor would she say how many panels 
gould had left the museum or how they had been displayed 
to say more would jeopardize the investigation and the museums 
position in recovering any art work mrs hammond said 
the westchester county district attorneys office confirmed the 
museum filed a complaint tuesday but declined to give details 
those things go for a minimum of 1200 to 1500 apiece 
said dick locher who has been drawing the strip for tribune media 
services in chicago for the past five years 
his collaborator max allen collins of muscatine iowa who has 
been writing the strips story line since 1977 said that what gould 
left the museum were highly prized strips that obviously had been 
set aside by the creator 
collins was quoted in the greenwich conn time as saying he 
believed some of the missing panels depicted important developments 
in the history of the strip 
hallmarks of the strip which originated in 1931 have been 
tracys twoway wrist radio and its bizarrely named and drawn 
characters like the villains pruneface flattop and mumbles 
tracys girl friend tess trueheart and such friendlies as bo 
plenty and gravel gertie

not only was 1988 the citys most murderous year 
it was also a recordbreaking 12 months for aggravated assult 
larceny and car theft according to figures released friday 
the reason for the crime wave can be summed up in a word crack 
its sweeping the country assistant chief raymond kelly said 
of the highly addictive cocaine derivative its been here since 
1986 thats when the figures started going up dramatically 
murders and nonnegligent manslaughters increased 134 percent in 
a year from 1672 to 1896 the old record was 1826 people set in 
1981 
in 1988 368 percent of all the murders committed in the city 
were drugrelated which means nearly two people a day lost their 
lives because of drugs kelly said and those are only the ones we 
are definitely sure of im sure theres more 
drugs also play a significant role in auto thefts which 
skyrocketed 254 percent from 1987 to 1988 theyre stealing cars 
reducing them to parts selling them and using a portion of the 
money to buy crack kelly said 
the only decline in crime came in the number of reported rapes 
which dropped 27 percent from 3507 in 1987 to 3412 in 1988 kelly

the body of cave explorer william floyd 
collins was laid to rest for the fifth time friday 64 years after 
his entrapment and death in a cave 
hopefully this will be for the last time said collins 
nephew eugene collins of horse cave 
collins was pronounced dead feb 16 1925 18 days after he 
entered sand cave in western kentucky 
after his death his body was recovered from the cave and buried 
later exhumed for public display stolen and dumped along the green 
river and then put back on display 
the cave where collins died is now part of mammoth cave national 
park about 30 miles north of bowling green relatives and the 
national park service worked out arrangements to reinter the body 
the story of floyd collins reminds us all we are fragile 
beings the rev gary talley told an estimated 50 friends and 
relatives gathered at mammoth cave baptist church cemetery in the 
park 
both the poor and the privileged shared their concern and 
compassion for the plight of one of their own kind said talley 
minister at cave spring baptist church which several of collins 
relatives attend 
collins was 37 when he entered sand cave on jan 30 1925 he was 
trying to find a new entrance to crystal cave the cavern he 
discovered under his fathers farm in edmonson county in 1917 
caves in the area were privately operated then and competition 
for tourists dollars ran high 
collins was on his way out of the cave when he was trapped in a 
small passageway by rocks that fell onto his foot and ankle 
more than 30 news organizations sent reporters to cover the story 
of relatives friends and strangers working to free collins 
the rescue efforts were hampered by the carnival atmosphere 
swirling around the cave entrance mammoth cave national park 
superintendent dave mihalic said friday 
he said collins probably remained alive most of the time he was 
trapped but died of exposure before he could be rescued 
his body was removed from the cave and buried near an entrance to 
crystal cave later when the property was sold his body was 
disinterred placed in a different casket and displayed in a large 
cavern in crystal cave 
four years later it was stolen and later found at the edge of 
the green river people speculated that competitors jealous of the 
attention his body created at crystal cave had stolen it but no 
one was ever arrested said park historian bob ward 
eventually the body was returned to crystal cave where it 
remained in a black casket chained to a concrete base 
at one point collins casket was included on tours of the cave 
until around 1948 visitors were allowed to view the body through a 
window in the casket lid 
the park service bought the cave in 1961 and closed it 
for family members today is a kind of a final end to what they 
had considered a sore spot in their lives mihalic said 
its a final chapter a closing of some sort

the federal trade commission said friday it had 
reached tentative agreement with pepsico inc and general cinema 
corp on conditions for pepsis proposed 175 billion purchase of 
17 softdrink bottlers from general cinema 
the agreement a draft consent order calls for general cinema to 
retain distribution of competing brands in the staunton va and 
fort lauderdale fla areas both companies will maintain existing 
assets and operations in those two locations while the commission 
considers the order and decides whether to challenge the acquisition 
in court 
under the draft order the competing brands will be bottled by 
pepsi for general cinema at cost for five years in the two cities 
general cinema will not be required to rely on pepsi to supply 
products for distribution according to an announcement from the 
commission 
without such provisions pepsico would have been both a bottler 
of those competing brands as well as a supplier of pepsi brand 
products distributed by pepsiowned bottlers the ftc said 
a companion complaint which the draft consent order would 
settle said the acquisition would eliminate direct competition in 
branded soft drinks as well as all soft drinks between the acquired 
bottler and other bottlers in the staunton and broward county fla 
markets and would increase the likelihood of collusion in the 
markets which are already highly concentrated and difficult to 
enter 
in staunton the other brands are those of the dr pepper and 
barqs companies and in fort lauderdale they are those of sevenup 
barqs and sunkist 
the other 15 bottlers being acquired are essentially bottlers 
of pepsi products said ronald b rowe of the commissions bureau 
of competition 
the draft consent order would require commission approval of any 
transfer of the staunton and fort lauderdale distribution operations 
by general cinema during the next 10 years pepsico would have to 
obtain commission approval for any acquisition in those two markets 
for five years and would have to notify the commission for 10 years 
of any bottler acquisition anywhere that would result in pepsico 
becoming a distributor of more than an insubstantial amount of 
other brands wherever pepsi supplies concentrate for pepsi brands 
the order remains open for public comment for 60 days it is not 
an admission of any allegations in the companion complaint but if 
adopted by the commission its terms carry the force of law and 
violations may result in civil fines of 10000 
pepsico based in purchase ny is one of the nations largest 
softdrink and snackfood concerns with sales of about 115 billion 
in 1987 
general cinema based in chestnut hill mass had revenue of 
about 720 million from bottling operations in the fiscal year that 
ended last oct 31 and also owns 1359 movie screens in 318 
theaters a 60 percent interest in the neiman marcus group of retail 
stores and 18 percent of cadbury schweppes plc the british candy 
and softdrink firm

president bushs compromise policy toward 
central america was a tacit admission that his predecessors 
military approach has failed and a signal that congress in turn is 
willing to give bush latitude in the region it was reluctant to 
provide ronald reagan 
but because the new bipartisan approach leans heavily on how 
nicaraguas sandinista government behaves over the coming months it 
represents a respite rather than a final settlement of the 
longrunning policy dispute between congress and the white house 
for now both sides on capitol hill are willing to read the 
somewhat vague and artfully drawn twopage policy agreement in their 
own ways 
democrats stress language supporting regional peace efforts and 
provisions permitting aid to the contra rebels to be used to 
relocate them into nicaragua and reintegrate them into the 
political process there republicans emphasize that such 
resettlement is strictly voluntary and that the agreement does not 
bar future military aid to the rebels should sandinista promises be 
unfulfilled 
the agreement means the united states still supports the 
contras as a viable force said senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan whose most conservative colleagues were restless about the 
policy accord signed by bush and congressional leaders 
dole said he hoped the peace process would work and that the 
nicaraguan government would open its political system to opponents 
but if not if the sandinistas continue to do what they have been 
doing saying one thing and doing another youre going to see at 
least an effort for military aid in the congress 
but democrats pointed out that bushs new secretary of state 
james a baker iii had specifically deemphasized that kind of 
thinking during hours of talks with key lawmakers over the past 
month at the very outset of those conversations they noted baker 
said military aid the issue that bedeviled president reagans 
relations with congress would play no role in the discussions 
announcing the new policy at the white house on friday baker 
said we all have to admit that the policy basically failed to 
some extent because we were not united 
that conclusion is underscored by an unreleased draft report from 
the general accounting office which concludes that reagans 
singleminded reliance on military solutions both in nicaragua and 
other countries in the region slowed progress toward economic 
reforms and development which it says are the regions real 
problems 
us policies toward the region since 1980 appear to have been 
driven largely by a need to counter the threat of soviet bloc 
expansionism says the report being prepared for senate foreign 
relations committee democrats 
the new accord between congress and the white house puts that 
goal on a diplomatic track it notes that continued communist 
support for violence and subversion in the region violate the 
five nations peace agreements but it calls on the soviets and 
cubans to themselves come into compliance with the peace process by 
ending their military backing for the sandinistas and the rebels 
fighting el salvadors government 
congress next step will be to pass soon after it returns from 
its easter break next month legislation providing the 45 million 
or so needed to continue humanitarian aid to the contras through 
february 1990 after nicaraguas scheduled national elections 
because of bakers efforts to reach bipartisan accord on the 
underlying policy that step is expected to be far easier than past 
aid renewals 
more significant in the long run than the agreement to give the 
new administration an extension of contra aid is congress 
willingness to restore to bush the latitude to conduct policy in 
central america that it had revoked from reagan 
the congress recognizes the need for consistency and continuity 
in policy and the responsibility of the executive to administer and 
carry out that policy the programs based upon it and to conduct 
american diplomacy in the region the document stated 
reagans covert war against the sandinistas which led to the 
irancontra affair also prompted a plethora of restrictions on 
money spent in the region 
for bush lawmakers are willing simply to say that they support 
the use of rewards and punishments to encourage the sandinistas 
along the road to democratization and for now will let the 
administration decide which actions to take and when to take them

an oil tanker ran aground today about 25 
miles outside this port spilling an estimated 200000 barrels of 
crude oil into prince william sound the coast guard said 
cmdr stephen mccall commander of the port at the southern end 
of the alaska oil pipeline said the exxon valdez was heading 
outbound from the alyeska marine terminal with 126 million barrels 
of oil aboard when it ran hard aground at bligh reef 
petty officer john gonzales estimated that by midmorning an oil 
slick streched southward five miles into the sound from the site of 
the tanker toward an open body of water 
at present we dont see it approaching any land he said 
there were no reports of injuries officials said the crew 
remained aboard the tanker 
the ship is hard aground its not moving at this time 
mccall said 
there definitely are holes in the hull he said three tanks 
on the right side of the tanker have holes he said and we think 
the centerline tanks also have holes 
gonzales said estimates put the leak at 200000 barrels or 84 
million gallons and said the tanker continued to leak at about 
20000 gallons an hour 
employees of the alyeska pipeline service co which runs the 
800mile transalaska pipeline for a consortium of oil companies 
were on their way to try to contain the oil with booms he said 
two coast guard investigators went aboard the tanker to begin 
looking into the cause 
officials think the vessel may have gone aground as the captain 
tried to maneuver around icebergs from the columbia glacier 
gonzales said there is a hole or gash in the vessel below the water 
line he said and divers planned to go down and assess the damage 
in more detail 
he said the new estimate of leakage came from looking at 
videotapes taken of the scene by pilots flying over earlier the 
size of the spill was put at 150000 barrels 
the coast guard had no immediate detail on of damage to the 
shoreline or marine environment 
the 987foot tanker which has a capacity of 13 million barrel 
in about 15 large tanks left valdez at 10 pm ast on thursday and 
ran ground about 1230 am today 430 am est officials said 
the tanker is owned by exxon shipping co based in houston 
valdez the nations northernmost icefree port is a town of 
3100 about 125 miles east of anchorage it looks out onto the 
islanddotted prince william sound which is near a number of 
recreation areas fishing as well as tourism is an important 
industry but the main seasons for various types of fishing are 
still weeks away 
the coast guard was responding to two concerns pollution and 
the safety of the ship mccall said 
it appears that the rate of release of the oil has been greatly 
reduced it probably lost the largest portion of that oil when it 
ran aground but its still leaking 
a concern we have too is the structural integrity of the 
ship mccall said were concerned about what further damage 
would be done if attempts were made to remove it the vessel early 
weve got the pollution to go after and the offloading 
another tanker the exxon baton rouge is not far from the 
stricken tanker and officials hoped oil could be transferred from 
the valdez to the baton rouge mccall said 
the worst oil spill in terms of financial loss claims was the 66 
milliongallon spill from the tanker amoco cadiz off the coast of 
brittany in france in march 1978 according to the guinness book of 
world records losses were put at 17 billion

attorney general dick thornburghs choice to 
head the civil rights division resigned from that division in the 
early 1960s shortly after he flunked the district of columbia bar 
exam a justice department spokeswoman said friday 
however spokeswoman deborah burstionwade said she could not 
confirm that william lucas had been forced to resign because of the 
failed bar exam as hearst news service reported 
burstionwade said she did not have records from the personnel 
office pertaining to whether lucas was forced to leave the division 
and had been unable to reach lucas to ask him about it 
he passed the michigan bar exam in 1971 she said adding that he 
would not have to pass the district of columbia bar if he became 
assistant attorney general in charge of the civil rights division 
civil rights groups have expressed concern that lucas a black 
democratturnedrepublican who ran unsuccessfully for governor of 
michigan in 1986 might be the wrong person to head the civil rights 
division 
lucas was offered a job in the justice departments criminal 
division in april 1962 and the former new york city police officer 
took the position after he completed law school at fordham 
university he was hired as an attorney contingent on his passing 
the district of columbia bar exam within nine months burstionwade 
said 
in august 1963 he became a legal assistant in the departments 
civil rights division and in november 1963 was given a onemonth 
extension to await the results of the bar exam she said adding 
that such extensions are standard procedure 
he did not pass the exam and in december 1963 became an 
investigator for the us commission on civil rights she said 
lucas remained with the commission on civil rights for six weeks 
leaving in january 1964 to join the fbi burstionwade said he was 
assigned first to the cincinnati field office and in 1965 to the 
detroit office where he remained until june 1968 when he resigned 
although thornburgh announced a month ago that lucas was his 
choice to head the division the white house still has not nominated 
him formally 
burstionwade said part of the reason for the delay was that 
lucas was just interviewed last week by the fbi people who had 
been interviewed by the fbi several weeks earlier also have not yet 
been formally nominated by the white house she said 
lucas who is in private legal practice in detroit has said on 
resumes that he served as an assistant us attorney or as an 
investigator and attorney in the us justice department despite 
the fact that he did not actually serve as an attorney since he had 
not passed the bar 
lucas said recently that he was classified as an attorney 
and believed that he was an attorney with the justice 
department but he also has said that discrepancies on his resumes 
were due to carelessness

powerful and biggest tamil rebel group said friday india dismissed 
the charge as propaganda 
in new delhi the leader of the tamils semiautonomous government 
warned there will be a blood bath unless authorities in colombo give 
his officials more power 
an indian high commission official in sri lanka said the rebel 
charges were their usual propaganda he said 76 militants and 26 
soldiers have been killed in operations this month in northern 
mullaitivu district 
sri lankan officials said the dead include nine soldiers and six 
militants who were killed in handtohand fighting thursday and two 
soldiers killed when rebels blew up their jeep 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam today accused the indian 
army of committing the crime of genocide against the tamil people in 
its desperate drive to crush the armed resistance of the tamil tiger 
guerrillas in the northeastern region of sri lanka a rebel 
statement said 
it said indian troops have killed more than 300 civilians in 
mullaitivu since march 2 when the soldiers started searching the 
area for rebels 
it was not possible to investigate the rebel charges 
independently 
mullaitivu is 175 miles northeast of colombo and the tamil 
tigers are believed to be based in the districts marshy jungles 
at least 40000 indian soldiers are in sri lanka to put down the 
tamil insurrection the troops initially were deployed to supervise 
a rebel arms surrender agreed in an indiansponsored peace accord 
july 1987 
the rebels reneged two months later nevertheless the government 
set up a northeastern provincial government to give tamils limited 
autonomy 
in new delhi the new governments chief minister vardarajan 
perumal appealed to the indian government to intercede to save the 
accord which he said is jeopardized by the colombo governments 
intransigent and adamant attitude 
perumal said his government has no control over education 
administrative services law and order and allotment and 
distribution of land 
if there is no reasonable solution everything will collapse 
perumal told a news conference 
how far the sri lankan government will devolve power will 
determine the unity and integrity of sri lanka he said we will 
ask then we will request and then we will appeal if there is no 
response we will take 
perumal said indian leaders had made no commitments 
the indian government says it will do the maximum but they are 
requesting us to be patient he said we feel that if the 
provincial council fails there will be no solution except a blood 
bath 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and say 
the majority sinhalese discriminate against them in and jobs and 
education 
at least 8500 people including 800 indian soldiers have been 
killed since 1983 when tamil militants started a campaign for a 
separate state india got involved because of the sympathies of its 
own 60 million tamils

billie hurst worked as a librarian at 
southwest missouri state university for 30 years yet she never got 
around to cashing paychecks totaling more than 100000 
the 72yearold woman got the money anyway friday when state 
treasurer wendell bailey presented an 8810085 check to miss 
hursts cousin and guardian frances jane gleghorn after a special 
act of the legislature made that possible 
baileys office said it already had reissued checks amounting to 
2002453 for uncashed checks not more than 5 years old bringing 
the total reimbursement to 10812533 
miss hurst occasionally cashed a paycheck mrs gleghorn said 
but coworkers tried for years to get her to cash the rest of the 
checks 
i really dont know why she didnt cash the checks thats what 
everybody asks mrs gleghorn said i know she was reminded 
several times they should be cashed but she just didnt go ahead 
and do it 
mrs gleghorn said many of the uncashed checks probably were 
destroyed when the rundown house miss hurst lived in for many years 
was demolished for safety reasons 
miss hurst retired in 1986 and now lives in a springfield 
retirement center mrs gleghorn appointed miss hursts guardian in 
august said her cousin has suffered from memory problems for 
several years 
mrs gleghorn asked state rep dan woodall and state sen dennis 
smith for help in getting the money working with state officials 
mrs gleghorn verified records of miss hursts paychecks between 
1963 and 1983 except for a twoyear period 
since the state treasurer is not obligated to honor an uncashed 
check more than five years old the legislature had to enact a 
special appropriations measure so miss hurst could be paid and gov 
john ashcroft signed it into law 
im relieved its over mrs gleghorn said should she need 
extra care in the future its good to know theres some money 
there

gen michel aoun rejected a truce in his 
christian armys fight with druse militiamen and syrian soldiers 
and declared friday he will settle for nothing less than syrian 
withdrawal from lebanon 
the 17dayold artillery and rocket battle in which syrian 
troops joined the druse this week resumed in the afternoon after a 
14hour lull 
hundreds of rounds fell on both sides of the line that divides 
beirut between christians and moslems and on druse and christian 
towns in the mountains overlooking the capital police said 
rocket volleys and popping flares lighted the night sky and 
rumbling explosions shook the city 
police had no immediate report on casualties but have given the 
total in previous action as 81 people killed and 253 wounded most 
of them civilians 
it is the worst fighting since 1985 in lebanons 14yearold 
civil war and magnifies a political crisis that arose last fall 
creating sectarian army commands and competing christian and moslem 
governments 
aoun said he would continue the battle even if beirut is 
demolished 
this city has been wiped out by seven or eight earthquakes in 
ancient history he said we will build a ninth beirut if it is 
destroyed in this confrontation 
a us embassy spokesman said the united states was withdrawing 
a military technical assistance team at the defense ministry as 
part of the embassys policy of reducing american personnel due to 
the current situation 
he said one member of the threeman team already was abroad on 
vacation the americans came to lebanon in 1983 to train army 
personnel in the use of usmade equipment 
in washington the state department issued a statement saying 
everyone with influence ought to act in a responsible manner and 
exercise restraint it did not name syria but officials said the 
us embassy in damascus had spoken with syrian authorities about 
the need for a ceasefire 
aoun told a news conference the americans were being pulled out 
shortly before the end of their term and their withdrawal will 
not have any effect on the army 
he leads the interim christian government in addition to 
commanding the 20000 christians in the lebanese army who are much 
better equipped than the 22000 moslems led by maj gen sami 
khatib 
khatibs men have helped blockade the 310squaremile christian 
enclave north and east of beirut but appear to have stayed out of 
the fighting which began two days after aoun blockaded illegal 
ports operated by moslem militias 
the christian commander held a news conference at the 
presidential palace in suburban baabda after meeting with kuwaits 
ambassador to syria ahmed jassem who told reporters they 
discussed a ceasefire and a solution to the present 
confrontation 
jassem saw aoun again after a session in moslem west beirut with 
salim hoss the sunni moslem premier of the syrianbacked moslem 
government then returned to syria without comment 
aoun said his confrontation with the syrians and walid 
jumblatts druse militia was a nationalist march to liberate 
lebanon 
it is the responsibility of the whole people he said the 
life of the lebanese should no more be in the hands of a syrian 
soldier who can pull the trigger any minute 
syria is a terrorist country he said and we cant figure 
out how a terrorist country can have a peacekeeping role 
neighboring syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league and hafez assad the 
syrian president has become this countrys main power broker in 
the chaos of civil war 
aoun said he is pursuing a nationalist cause not a christian 
cause in fighting the syrians and their allies 
the syrians are slaughtering us he said of lebanon they 
are trying to eliminate our country reduce it to ashes 
asked whether the current violence would would block efforts by 
an arab league mediation committee to settle the crisis he 
replied it shouldnt 
jassem was sent to beirut thursday by the sixman arab league 
committee which arab foreign ministers formed at an emergency 
meeting in january sheik sabah ahmad sabah kuwaits foreign 
minister is the chairman 
the crisis was born when president amin gemayels sixyear term 
ended sept 22 and parliament could not agree on a successor 
gemayel named aoun to lead an interim government but moslems 
with syrias support swore allegiance to hoss who had been 
premier under gemayel the army commands split as a result of the 
sectarian division in government 
an unwritten covenant dating to independence from france in 1943 
requires the president to be a christian the premier a sunni 
moslem and the parliament speaker a shiite moslem

a georgia democratic party official said 
friday he invested 5000 to help promote rep newt gingrichs book 
in 1984 because he thought the newly elected house gop whip had a 
message that ought to get out 
but joel cowan a peachtree city ga real estate developer who 
serves as treasurer of the state democratic party and honorary 
chief of staff to democratic gov joe frank harris said he has 
never supported gingrich politically and has never contributed to 
his congressional campaigns 
in fact cowan said in a telephone interview he contributed 
500 last year to gingrichs democratic opponent david worley 
cowans investment in a partnership set up to promote gingrichs 
book window of opportunity was disclosed friday by the wall 
street journal in a article that also said cowans company had 
received a 204480 grant in 1988 from the department of housing 
and urban development 
cowan denied having received such a grant and hud officials 
after searching department records friday said they could find no 
evidence of a grant award last year to cowans company cowan and 
associates 
but beth almond in the economics and analysis branch of huds 
atlanta regional office said cowan and associates was given 
preliminary approval by hud in 1978 for a 60unit low income 
housing project for the elderly in peachtree city 
the letter of approval said hud would pay rent subsidies to the 
tenants once the project was completed and the farmers home 
administration would guarantee the financing for the units 
ms almond said a 1980 letter involving the same project listed 
the total annual rent subsidy pledged by hud for the 60 units at 
204480 but she said that letter was addressed to someone other 
than cowan and associates and would appear to indicate cowan 
had dropped out of the project 
cowan was one of 21 investors who put up 5000 each to promote 
gingrichs book in exchange for a promise of half the publishers 
profits but there were not enough sales to produce profits and 
cowan said all he got for his 5000 was six copies of the book and 
a tax writeoff 
gingrich has promised to disclose the names of all 21 once he 
can contact them and obtain their permission thus far he has 
identified only three including james tidwell of douglasville 
ga james richards of carrollton and former georgia rep howard 
bo callaway 
cowan said he became interested in gingrichs book in 1983 when 
gingrich mentioned the project during a speech to the aspen group 
a mostly republican group of real estate professionals 
cowan said he invited gingrich to speak at that meeting because 
i thought he had a message at the time he was speaking out on 
supply side economics and he was an outspoken conservative voice 
cowan said the members of the group who attended the aspen 
meeting split the cost of gingrichs travel and lodging expenses

a survey released friday indicated majority 
support for yitzhak shamirs refusal to deal with the plo but 
president bush said he would try to persuade the prime minister 
something good might come from talks 
shamir and bush are to confer in washington on april 6 
israel radio and arab sources said two palestinians died of 
wounds suffered earlier and arab reports said israeli soldiers 
wounded 25 palestinians during protests in nine towns and refugee 
camps in the west bank and gaza strip 
one of the wounded was said to be a 4monthold girl hit in the 
head by a rubber bullet 
the two deaths raised to 407 the number of palestinians killed 
since an uprising began in the occupied territories more than 15 
months ago eighteen israelis have been slain 
seven moderate palestinian leaders in nablus the west banks 
largest city have been threatened with death if they continue 
meeting with israeli officials about peace arab sources reported 
fridays survey by the independent modain ezrahi organization 
said 56 percent of 1251 israeli jews chosen at random said no 
when asked do you believe there is room for negotiating with the 
plo and if so toward what end the surveys margin of error was 
given as plus or minus 2 percent 
a survey conducted in december indicated 54 percent of israelis 
favored talks with the palestine liberation organization on 
condition it ceased attacking israeli targets 
plo chairman yasser arafat renounced terrorism in december and 
recognized israels right to exist the united states initiated 
contacts after arafats public declaration and the second formal 
meeting was held wednesday in tunis 
rachel israeli of modain ezrachi attributed the change in 
response between december and march to the fact that organization 
asked only about talks without mentioning an end to terrorism or 
any other condition 
many people do not believe the plo has stopped their terror 
activities she said 
bush was quoted in an interview published friday in the 
washington times as saying of his forthcoming meeting with shamir 
i will tell him that the talks that we are having with the 
plo representatives there in tunis are good things and would try 
to persuade the israeli leader something good might come out of 
this kind of discussion 
asked whether he would urge shamir to join the talks the paper 
said bush replied i dont know what ill say to him about that 
but ill say to him that we have got to move the peace process 
forward we may by then be ready with some specific ideas 
israeli news reports have said bush planned to propose a first 
stage of negotiations with palestinians in the occupied 
territories with the plo joining talks later on the final status 
of the territories 
arab sources speaking privately said the death threats 
involved two masked arab youths from a dissident plo faction who 
visited the palestinian moderates march 17 
they identified the faction as the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine led by dr george habash and based in 
syria 
the jerusalem post said the men were threatened at knifepoint 
it said supporters of arafat were among them including dr hatem 
abu ghazaleh a former member of the nablus city council 
abu ghazaleh was reached by telephone and denied receiving 
threats 
a leaflet circulated in arab east jerusalem urged palestinians 
to freeze contacts with israeli officials to prevent shamir from 
pursuing plans to circumvent the plo in peace talks israel 
television reported 
in an interview with the daily maariv shamir was quoted as 
saying he would pursue secret talks with nonplo palestinians 
there are among them wise people intellectuals shamir 
said i am not going to reveal their names because it may bring 
them harm 
hadashot another daily said he might have the shin bet secret 
police investigate a leak last week of a secret military report 
that concluded there were no nonplo palestinians with whom israel 
could negotiate peace a shamir aide denied the report 
marwan abu taman 19 of tulkarem in the west bank died friday 
of chest wounds suffered in a confrontation with soldiers two days 
earlier arab reports said israel radio said mohammed aziz nasser 
23 died at a hospital in arab east jerusalem the day after an 
explosive device went off in his hands

a militant moslem group has acquired two 
usmade stinger surfacetoair missiles originally intended for 
afghan guerrillas ashshiraa magazine reported friday 
the weekly quoted an unidentified source close to the group as 
saying the shoulderheld missiles have reached lebanon through an 
embassy that provided part of the large sum paid 
the magazine did not identify the group or the embassy 
it also did not specify whether the fundamentalists were shiite 
or sunni moslem sunni factions have been inactive in lebanon for 
some time however and the magazine implied the militants belonged 
to a proiranian shiite group 
the missiles were shipped by the united states to seven afghan 
guerrilla factions based in pakistan the magazine said the 
phrasing of the report indicated the moslem afghan guerrillas sold 
the stingers to the lebanese group 
the stinger is the us armed forces most potent antiaircraft 
weapon the afghan insurgents used the missiles to shoot down 
soviet fighterbombers helicopters and transport planes in the 
nineyear war against soviet intervention in afghanistan 
ashshiraa said the lebanese group was trying to smuggle the 
stingers out of the country but did not elaborate 
the report followed warnings of possible attacks on american 
jetliners as part of irans confrontation with western nations over 
salman rushdies book the satanic verses many moslems say the 
novel defames islam 
britains domestic news agency press association quoted an 
unidentified spokesman for the us federal aviation association as 
saying us airlines and airports around the world have been put on 
alert for possible terrorist action 
ashshiraa gained international fame in november 1986 when it 
broke the story of secret us arms sales to iran in return for 
american hostages held in lebanon by proiranian shiite factions 
but the magazines recent reports on the 15 foreign captives 
held mainly by proiranian factions have been inaccurate

energy secretary james d watkins said friday 
he is directing his departments scientists to devote more 
attention to new methods of nuclear waste cleanup to support a plan 
to establish cleanup priorities and schedules over the next five 
years 
watkins wrote members of congress that he hopes to have the 
cleanup plan in place by august 
during the next five years immediate problems will be 
corrected and detailed longterm cleanup plans will be drawn up 
for each site said spokesman phil keif 
the department produces nuclear weapons in at least 16 
laboraties and factories in 12 states waste both nuclear and 
chemical generated since the formation of the world war ii 
manhattan project in 1942 has resulted in massive contamination of 
some areas around the facilities 
the laboratories include some of the national laboratories run 
by the department where some of the nations best scientists have 
conducted basic research in a wide range of scientific disciplines 
it is these scientists that watkins will call on for more 
environmental work possibly designating facilities to be in charge 
of particular techniques or fields 
watkins told a senate committee earlier this month that he 
doubts the accuracy of common cleanup cost estimates of 60 billion 
to 100 billion i dont believe we need all those gold 
watches or frills he said then 
in his letter to congress watkins said the fiveyear plan will 
be composed of site plans that will ensure compliance with all 
applicable state and federal requirements will characterize and 
assess the extent of contamination where it exists and assess 
potential risk the highest priorities will be placed on facilities 
where contamination has occured that may potentially affect public 
heatlh and the environment 
in addition the department will assess current technology 
development activities and provide a basis for future research 
development and demonstration of new and innovative environmental 
technologies 
he said he intended to establish with congress and the states 
agreedupon milestones to address the development of new 
technologies as well as our environmental cleanup 
responsibilities

joel steinberg today received a maximum sentence 
of 8 to 25 years in prison for killing 6yearold lisa steinberg 
his illegally adopted daughter 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax saying steinberg 
showed extreme callousness and no remorse after the slaying 
also recommended against parole steinberg would normally be 
eligible for parole in less than seven years because he has already 
been jailed for nearly 17 months since his arrest 
steinberg 47 was convicted of firstdegree manslaughter jan 
30 for the november 1987 beating death hundreds of letter writers 
had urged that he get the maximum punishment 
the death resulted from steinbergs life of violence 
selfishness and selfgratification at the expense of other 
people assistant district attorney john mccusker told the court 
mr steinberg has shown not one ounce of remorse for killing 
elizabeth 
an emotional steinberg who did not testify at his trial 
addressed the court before his sentencing saying i understand 
the meaning of remorse i have remorse about losing my life 
he insisted he had not abused his daughter at no point did i 
ever neglect her did i ever strike her in any way he said 
steinberg who smiled chuckled and fidgeted while his lawyers 
offered lengthy presentencing motions wanted the judge to feel 
he is worthy of redemption defense attorney perry reich said 
earlier 
but assistant district attorney peter casolaro in a presentence 
report released this morning called steinberg an insensitive 
remorseless killer who should receive the maximum sentence 
without chance of parole 
in the year and half since lisas death he has yet to 
express any remorse for killing her casolaro wrote in an 18page 
presentencing memorandum 
society needs to be protected from such a selfcentered 
insensitive remorseless killer the memo continued the only 
appropriate sentence is the maximum sentence with a 
recommendation against any parole 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said rothwax had 
gotten hundreds of letters from adoptive parents childless couples 
and people abused as children urging him to throw the book at 
steinberg 
the sources said letters from alaska to florida also came from 
child advocacy groups and domestic violence projects including a 
georgia organization responsible for writing more than 100 letters 
not one of the letters recommended mercy for steinberg the 
sources said and some demanded the death penalty which new york 
lacks 
rothwax asked to make the letters public said he had destroyed 
any letters involving the case 
but a family advocacy group family dynamics inc showed 
reporters its letter to the judge which said the maximum sentence 
will communicate that unspeakable crimes against children shall 
not be condoned 
a disbarred lawyer steinberg had received the child shortly 
after birth from an unwed teenager and raised her as his own 
rather than arranging for the babys adoption as he had promised 
charges against hedda nussbaum steinbergs longtime livein 
companion were dropped when prosecutors determined she was too 
physically and mentally incapacitated to be responsible for the 
girls death 
ms nussbaum 46 testified under immunity as the star 
prosecution witness in steinbergs trial during which defense 
attorneys contended she was responsible for lisas fatal beating 
the steinberg case focused national attention on domestic 
violence and the question of who should report cases of suspected 
child abuse

jurors who sentenced randall dale adams to die 12 
years ago say they are convinced they erred in declaring him 
guilty but blame a prosecutor for swaying their minds by 
suppressing evidence 
adams 40 was greeted by yellow ribbons and rousing cheers when 
he returned thursday to columbus ohio after the dallas county 
district attorney dropped the case against him 
he was freed on bond tuesday after the texas court of criminal 
appeals ordered a new trial his case garnered wide attention after 
the thin blue line a documentary film raised doubts about his 
guilt 
if he had gone to the death chamber and all this had come out 
later that would have been a horrible thing to have on my 
conscience said bette jane fain jury forewoman at adams 1977 
trial 
adams came within three days of execution in 1980 for the 
shooting death of dallas officer robert wood before his sentence 
was commuted to life in prison 
based on everything that i have seen and read and on this 
mans reactions i just dont believe the man is guilty ms 
fain 66 told the dallas morning news 
dallas county district attorney john vance said thursday he 
would not seek a new trial and filed a motion to dismiss the 
capital murder charge against adams 
the appeals court in ordering a new trial for adams ruled 
prosecutor doug mulder had allowed a key witness to commit perjury 
and had suppressed evidence that the witness original description 
of the killer did not match adams 
it makes you wonder sometimes about the judicial system 
said juror elliott rammey if somebody as powerful as the das 
office can manipulate witnesses it seems to me theres something 
wrong 
hopefully well all learn something from it rammey 47 
said 
mulder has denied any misconduct and said he believes adams is 
guilty he did not immediately return a telephone call friday by 
the associated press 
if anything was kept from us i blame doug mulder juror 
doris hooper 74 said what happened is not the jurys fault

the environmental protection agency raised 
serious concerns friday about a controversial proposed dam and 
reservoir in colorado threatening to scuttle the 500 million 
project if no additional safeguards are provided 
epa administrator william k reilly said the two forks dam 
project near denver could result in very serious adverse 
environmental impact and ordered the regional office to 
immediately examine alternative water sources with city 
officials 
sen j james exon dneb said reillys decision is expected 
to kill the proposal those of us who have been fighting this 
project have won i think this is the practical end to this 
project said exon in a telephone interview 
reilly announced he had begun procedures which amount to 
overruling a construction permit issued earlier this month by the 
corps of engineers and which could lead to a veto of the project if 
compromises are not worked out 
this is the door through which you have to travel to get to a 
veto of the project said a senior epa official speaking on the 
condition that he not be identified by name 
the two forks dam project on the south platte river southwest of 
denver has been the center of a bitter fight between 
environmentalists and denver area officials who say the dam is 
essential to the regions future water needs 
environmentalists have said epas decision on the dam will be an 
early signal of how the bush administration intends to deal with 
environmental and conservation issues 
this action demonstrates the president is serious about 
establishing himself as an environmental president said peter 
berle president of the national audubon society 
environmental concerns centered on the fact that the 615foot 
dam and reservoir would flood a vast area where the south platte 
and its north fork meet about 25 miles southwest of denver it 
would put under 500 feet of water a 20mile area including the 
scenic cheesman canyon which has some of the best trout fishing in 
the state and is home for a variety of wildlife 
the project also has been attacked by nebraska officials who 
fear that the dam will reduce the flow of water into the big bend 
wetland region of western nebraska a favorite resting spot for 
whooping crane and numerous other birds 
reilly said the permit as approved by the corps of engineers 
could have very serious adverse environmental impacts and may 
not provide adequate safeguards 
i am not convinced that the two forks dam project as 
proposed will avoid environmental harm to the extent practicable or 
that the proposed permit conditions will minimize or compensate for 
damage to fisheries wildlife habitat and recreation areas 
reilly said in a statement 
environmentalists have been urging reilly to intervene because 
the agencys regional administrator jim scherer had indicated he 
favors the project if certain assurances are included to protect 
the environment 
at a news conference in denver scherer said he was 
disappointed that the decision could not be made at the regional 
level scherer said conditions had been put into the permit 
that satisfied a number of concerns i have had 
but reilly overruled the regional administrator saying that the 
project as proposed does not meet the requirements of the clean 
water act and directed scherer to initiate the veto process for the 
existing permit 
the epa and corps of engineers as well as project applicants 
have 15 days to try to work out safeguards that might satisfy 
reilly if they fail to do so the process would continue possibly 
over several months leading to a likely veto of the project 
officials said

high school enrollment has fallen more than 25 
percent since 1978 when china embarked on ambitious economic 
development and senior leader deng xiaoping says there is a crisis 
in education 
elementary school enrollment has declined more than 14 percent 
in the same period 
education minister li tieying told a news conference friday the 
government cannot devote enough money to the problems and advocated 
an education tax he implied other funds should be raised through 
tuition and schools starting their own businesses to make money 
deng was quoted in the peoples daily as saying our biggest 
mistake over the last 10 years is that education has not developed 
sufficiently 
he said the mistake surpassed errors that have created an 
inflation rate of 36 percent the highest since the communist party 
gained power in 1949 
china used to take pride in free education but has begun 
forcing schools to set up factories to pay expenses some now 
charge tuition to pay for books and other materials 
lis news conference coincided with a session of the national 
peoples congress which is studying a proposal to raise the 
education budget by 15 percent to 10 billion 
last year china spent 11 a student among the worlds lowest 
about onethird of all pupils now finish primary school and 
fewer than 10 percent of those attend high school or college 
despite a law requiring nine years of education the average 
chinese spends five years in school 
several problems have combined to create the education crisis 
agriculture policies giving land back to the peasants caused 
many to put their children to work li said 85 percent of 
elementary pupils and 265 percent of high school students left 
school last year and 220 million chinese are illiterate most of 
them in rural areas 
educated chinese are poorly paid starting salaries for chinese 
men and women with college diplomas are about 29 a month 
onetenth of what a hairdresser can earn 
this is not the kind of incentive that makes people want to 
get an education li said 
statistics released friday said 654 million youngsters were 
attending high school in 1978 but the figure last year was 476 
million 
on the bright side the number of students in college increased 
from 856000 to 27 million and the number of colleges doubled to 
1075 according to the statistics 
an increasing number of graduate students are leaving school 
however to seek higher wages outside teaching and research 
the physical plant also has suffered li said more than 60 
percent of the junior high schools and 90 percent of elementary 
schools lacked sufficient facilities and supplies last year 
many teachers are not qualified he said but was not specific 
li said teachers are paid less than the average worker in a 
staterun factory 
he said the responsibility rests with the state council or 
cabinet and the central committee of the communist party 
li has led the state education commission for one year premier 
li peng was education minister in 198588 when the commission was 
given responsibility for elementary and secondary schools as well 
as higher education

not be to included in the task forces review 
there is simply no point in continuing work on this sale until 
we have more information on the environmental impacts of offshore

a union representing 3000 education 
department workers has filed a court challenge to the departments 
plans to begin a random drugtesting program next month 
the suit filed in us district court here thursday is the 
latest of more than a halfdozen attempts by the american 
federation of government employees to block drugtesting programs 
in federal departments and agencies the cases filed previously are 
pending at various levels of the federal court system 
we are confident the courts will not sanction programs that 
randomly select government workers and require them to submit to 
humiliating urinalysis testing without any history or reasonable 
suspicion of drug abuse problems said afge president john n 
sturdivant 
a union spokeswoman said the education department on feb 21 
distributed to employees a notice that the testing program would 
begin on or after april 21 federal agencies as part of their 
compliance with an executive order issued by thenpresident reagan 
requiring them to draft drugtesting programs routinely give 
employees 60 days notice before begining testing 
education department spokesman jim bradshaw said the department 
had no comment on the unions suit

pressing a 5foot cross to his forehead pope john 
paul ii led a torchlit good friday procession at the colosseum to 
symbolically relive jesus final agonies before his crucifixion 
before the hourlong stations of the cross procession began 
in the windy night the pope addressed the crowd of faithful who 
followed him 
jesus is near to those who suffer and fall to the ailing near 
desperation because of a relapse to the prisoner who for loyalty 
to conscience languishes in jail and weakened by persecution 
feels himself vacillating in his certainty the pope said his 
thin silver hair blown by the chilly wind 
in a comment taken as a reference to drug abuse the pope said 
that jesus supports the slaves of vice who after having abandoned 
the habit fall again he sustains those who having been dogged by 
tragedies have doubts about god 
then the pope flanked by two young men holding long lit 
candles started the slow walk from the colosseum to the edge of 
the ancient roman forum to evoke the tortures jesus suffered as he 
made his way to his appointment with death on calvary hill in 
jerusalem 
john paul wore a crimson goldembroidered robe over a white 
cassock the simple black cross he carried was slender and made of 
lightweight wood weighing about one pound 
nuns children foreign tourists in rome for the easter holiday 
and elderly italian women were among the many in the crowd who held 
prayer books and small torches during the ceremony 
italian television carried the ceremony live and said it was 
being shown to hundreds of millions of people around the world 
although it did not name the countries 
the procession known as the via crucis latin for way of the 
cross was long a papal tradition until a nearly 100yearlong 
interruption following the creation of the modern italian state 
pope paul vi in 1964 revived it as a highlight of the vaticans 
observance of good friday the most solemn and sad day in the roman 
catholic churchs liturgy 
at times throughout the procession the pope closed his eyes 
tightly as he prayed and reflected appearing to be feeling the 
pain suffered by jesus 
my god my god why have you abandoned me a lecturer read 
reciting the 14 stations of the cross and the pope seemed 
particulary moved by this passage from the new testament about 
jesus final moments on the cross 
the flames of the torches were whipped by blasts of the 
tramontana a cold wind that blows down from the northern alps over 
the italian peninsula clearing the sky but making the crowd shiver 
and button up their coats and jackets 
among the stations are jesus encounter with veronica who wipes 
his sweaty face with her veil and the three times jesus stumbles 
and falls under the weight of the cross 
the title of each station was read in seven languages italian 
french english german spanish portuguese and last of all 
polish the popes native tongue 
the pope spoke in italian during the ceremony 
earlier in the day the pope heard the confessions of six 
italians and a west german religion teacher in st peters basilica 
in keeping with a good friday tradition he began 10 years ago 
he heard confessions from two italian military students a 
laborer a transport worker a 40yearold woman and her 
12yearold son and the frankfurt religion teacher 
john paul began hearing confessions in the basilica on good 
friday to emphasize the importance of the sacrament 
no mass is said on good friday the only day in the church year 
without its celebration easter will be ushered in on saturday 
night in a candlelit vigil service in st peters basilica the 
pope also says a midmorning mass for the public on sunday

west virginias state senators were 
notified friday to be prepared to sit as a jury for an expected 
impeachment trial against the state treasurer at the end of may 
it would appear likely that the house of delegates will next 
week send us a message containing the articles of impeachment 
against state treasurer a james manchin senate president larry 
tucker wrote in a memorandum to his 33 colleagues 
i would anticipate a starting date for the impeachment trial 
being toward the end of may and i also anticipate it lasting three 
to four weeks tucker wrote 
tucker said he believes twothirds or more of the 100member 
house will vote to impeach manchin 61 a twoterm treasurer 
tangled in allegations that a fund under his supervision lost 279 
million in 1987 and that he failed to perform the proper 
supervisory functions over the fund 
manchin has distanced himself from the losses he testified 
before the house judiciary committee last week that he never 
discussed specific investment practices with his staff didnt 
understand investment documents when they crossed his desk and 
didnt learn of the losses until late november or early december 
1988 
the judiciary committee voted 196 wednesday to recommend that 
manchin be impeached for maladministration incompetence neglect 
of duty and high crimes and misdemeanors for his role in the loss 
house judiciary chairman john hatcher said his committee on 
monday will take up the formal articles of impeachment drafted 
along the lines suggested by wednesdays vote and vote on the 
final document the resolution then goes to the house 
only a simple majority is needed to recommend impeachment which 
is in effect an indictment of the treasurer that would go to the 
senate which would sit as a jury it would take a twothirds vote 
by the senate 23 of 34 members to convict 
if convicted manchin would be forced from office and would lose 
his pension estimated at the end of 1988 by the public employees 
retirement system to be at least 2128 a month the agencys 
acting director george crum said friday 
the timetable for when the resolution will be presented to the 
house has not been resolved hatcher said but the 60day 
legislative session ends april 8 
the last time a west virginia state treasurer was impeached was 
1876 
manchins attorney frank cleckley has hinted without 
elaboration that he may file a lawsuit challenging the impeachment 
proceedings against his client

roman catholic church leaders marked 
good friday by calling for reconciliation among nicaraguans and 
criticizing both the usbacked rebels and the sandinista 
government 
at a good friday procession attended by an estimated 30000 
people monsignor bismarck carballo the church spokesman told the 
crowd this is the year all nicaraguans hope will bring national 
reconciliation 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo who led the procession 
commemorating christs tortured journey to cavalry cried out 
long live catholic nicaragua long live the pope and people 
cheered 
they cheered again when he shouted one church referring to 
the socalled popular church of dissident catholics who support the 
leftwing sandinistas 
thursday night during a ceremony recalling christs washing the 
feet of his disciples obando y bravo said it would have been 
beautiful if the rebel command had released all its prisoners 
of war so they could reunite with their families 
and it would have been a good thing if the government of 
nicaragua had declared a general amnesty to bring happiness to 
prisoners and their families and to contribute to national 
reconciliation 
obando y bravo urged faithful catholics to take part in politics 
to provide an example of responsibility and service for the 
common good 
the cardinal has been a frequent critic of the sandinistas 
accusing them of trying to impose a leftist government in 
predominantly catholic nicaragua against the will of the people 
some former national guard members who were among the 1894 
freed last week by the government joined in the good friday 
procession and a few wore their old uniforms 
thousands of national guardsmen were imprisoned after the 
sandinistas gained power in 1979 ousting the rightwing regime of 
president anastasio somoza 
the government said only 39 exguardsmen remain in jail and 
they are very dangerous and undisciplined 
last weeks ceremonial release of nearly 1900 guardsmen was 
part of the revived central american peace accord the presidents of 
nicaragua el salvador honduras costa rica and guatemala signed 
in february it includes plans to disband the nicaraguan rebel 
army believed to have about 11000 members 
government sources claim the rebels known as contras are 
holding at least 1000 prosandinistas prisoners including 
soldiers and civilians the contras acknowledged last year that 
they held some prisoners but gave no figures

a contra spokesman lauded the bush 
administrations newly announced humanitarian aid plan friday as a 
very significant step that will keep their fighters alive while 
diplomatic peace efforts are pursued 
the contras had expected they would get some continued aid said 
nicaraguan resistance spokesman bosco matamoros 
the most positive aspect of the 45 million aid plan announced 
at the white house was that it represents for the first time a 
national policy on a bipartisan consensus said matamoros 
in addition he said we have resolved a fundamental problem 
which is the integrity of our combatants who are encamped on the 
honduran side of the nicaraguan border they have been existing on 
27 million worth of us nonlethal aid which runs out march 31 
contra leader adolfo calero perhaps the most well known 
resistance figure in the united states because of his longtime us 
travels for his cause was in guatemala and could not be reached 
friday by phone said a man who answered the phone at his miami 
home 
another top contra leader alfredo cesar was in miami but could 
not be reached for comment at his home there 
during the reagan administration the contras were taken care of 
through a covert white house plan even when congress halted 
military aid but dissension on capitol hill and within the 
administration weakened their cause contra leaders have said 
its a very significant step taken by the united states 
matamoros said the united states now enters with the central 
american countries and other latin american countries in this 
concert which enhances the possibility of arriving to a process 
of democratization in nicaragua 
as to the plans provision of money for voluntary repatriation 
on the part of the 11000member contra army matamoros said 
its very clear that if there is democracy we are willing return 
to our country 
but he said most of the rebels will likely wait to see how 
nicaraguas ruling sandinista government lives up to its pledge for 
democratic reforms and free elections early next year 
the contras also want to participate in a reconciliation 
dialogue with the sandinistas and the internal political 
opposition matamoros said previous efforts were fruitless

a government commission has found that thousands 
of skulls and bones buried in a mass grave outside kiev were those 
of victims killed during stalins repressions not by nazi 
soldiers tass reported friday 
the conclusion supports the testimony of elderly witnesses in 
the nearby village of bykovnia who said they saw trucks that 
dripped blood rumbling to darnitsa forest in the 1930s before the 
nazis occupied the area 
earlier government estimates said the site contains from 6000 
to 68000 bodies but unofficial estimates said bodies of up to 
300000 people were stacked in the grave 
the villagers broke five decades of terrified silence to accuse 
josef stalins secret police after the ukrainian government erected 
a monument in may 1988 blaming nazi occupiers for the crime the 
villagers forced ukrainian authorities in december to establish the 
commission saying three previous investigations had covered up the 
truth by blaming nazi troops 
the report from tass the official soviet news agency did not 
mention the earlier investigations 
viktor kulik head of the investigating commission told tass 
that investigators found family names engraved on some objects in 
the grave 
examination of the archives later confirmed that the victims 
were peoples enemies charged in the 1930s with 
counterrevolutionary and nationalist activity espionage and 
conspiracy tass said 
official confirmation has been given to the version that in 
the darnitsa forest near the village of bykovnia outside the 
ukrainian capital of kiev are buried victims of the repressions of 
the 1930s tass said 
western historians estimate 20 million soviets were killed under 
stalin particularly during the great purge of the late 1930s but 
soviet officials ignored the dark side of stalin for most of the 
past 50 years 
the examination of stalins crimes begun briefly under nikita s 
khrushchev was revived in 1987 under president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
western historians also blame the soviets for the massacre of 
4250 polish officers unearthed in 1943 in a mass grave 310 miles 
away in the katyn forest earlier this year polish authorities 
said stalins forces killed the officials although official soviet 
commissions have blamed the nazis 
a joint polishsoviet commission is examining katyn and other 
blank spots in soviet history 
earlier commissions on bykovnia had blamed the nazis for the 
killings even though villagers insisted the bodies were already 
there when the germans occupied kiev in september 1941 
several of the villagers told the associated press they 
personally dug up the graves on orders of the germans one of them 
just days after the germans arrived 
one man mikola lysenko discovered the bones and skulls in 1987 
after grave robbers had uncovered them and set out on a personal 
crusade to uncover the truth 
he located witnesses in bykovnia and won support from the 
ukrainian writers union and the newly formed memorial society 
which is dedicated to baring the truth of stalins crimes 
lysenko was unavailable for comment friday as he does not have a 
telephone 
another resident petro z kukovenko said he summoned the 
courage to speak after a soviet commission reburied the bones and 
erected the memorial blaming the nazis in an interview last month 
kukovenko said a german officer forced him and four other men to 
exhume the site four days after nazi troops occupied the area in 
1941 
when they the soviets put up this monument i became ashamed 
that they were blaming this on the wrong people said kukovenko

the leftist sandinista government on 
friday condemned the bipartisan plan president bush announced in 
washington to renew humanitarian aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
foreign ministry secretarygeneral alejandro bendana called the 
plan drafted by the bush administration and congressional leaders 
confusing and unclear and said it goes against a regional pact 
that calls for dismantling the rebel force by midmay 
humanitarian aid to a standing military force is a 
contradiction in terms bendana said at a news conference where 
journalists had been told president daniel ortega was to speak 
ortegas absence was not explained 
bendana and manuel espinoza presidential information minister 
read a communique from the nicaraguan government which said in part 
that the us government drafted the plan in order to save face 
while it proceeds to dismantle its failed policy against 
nicaraguas sovereignty and integrity 
answering journalists questions later bendana said of the plan 
we want to believe this is indeed a positive step because 
there are other steps ahead where the united states can show its 
support of the peace accord that ortega and the presidents of el 
salvador honduras guatemala and costa rica reached in el salvador 
on feb 14 
in the el salvador accord the five presidents agreed to draft a 
program by midmay to dismantle the contras as the nicaraguan 
rebel force is known and help them return to civilian life 
ortega also agreed to electoral and other reforms to guarantee 
fair general elections which he moved up by 10 months to feb 25 
1990 
in speaking of other steps ahead bendana said he was 
referring to support needed from the united states to have a un 
peacekeeping force sent to central america and independent 
observers to the nicaraguan elections both part of the el salvador 
pact 
the united states as one of the five permanent members of the 
un security council can veto the measure 
bendana called the vote an acid test of us intentions 
toward nicaragua 
congress voted in february 1988 to cut off military aid to the 
contras which the united states began arming in 1981 and continue 
only food shelter medical and other nonlethal assistance 
the bipartisan agreement announced in washington on friday calls 
for 45 million in new aid through february 1990 for the estimated 
11000 contras living in honduran jungle camps near the nicaraguan 
border with an equal number of relatives 
the expressed intent of the aid renewal is to put pressure on 
the sandinistas to comply with the el salvador pact the current 
271 million aid package to the rebels runs out march 31 
the new aid is expected to be approved by congress soon after it 
returns from its easter break next month 
there is an inconsistency in these two documents the el 
salvador pact and the us bilateral contra aid plan bendana 
said either you approve the dismantling of the contras or you 
dont 
he said that regardless of the us contra aid plan the central 
american presidents will meet their midmay deadline for the contra 
dismantling plan 
since the el salvador accord the nicaraguan government has

hundreds of christian pilgrims wept prayed and 
sang hymns along the via dolorosa in jerusalems old city in a good 
friday procession that retraced christs path to his crucifixion 
about a dozen devotees carried heavy wooden crosses to symbolize 
christs walk of agony and many knelt for communal prayers at the 
14 stations that mark the route 
a costumed american group complete with a thorncrowned christ 
figure performed along the way a minor scuffle broke out when 
roman catholic and protestant groups crossed paths each demanding 
right of way 
the turnout was considerably lower than in past years 
reflecting fears over the 15month palstinian revolt that has torn 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip and spilled into arab 
east jerusalem no major violence was reported 
in the philippines at least 11 people were nailed to crosses 
and thousands of filipinos drew blood by beating themselves on the 
back to symbolize the suffering of christ about 5000 people 
attended in ritual in san pedro citud 40 miles north of manila 
pope john paul ii heard confessions from worshipers in the 
vaticans st peters basilica before carrying a 5foot wooden 
cross in a good friday procession to symbolically relive jesus 
final agonies before his crucifixion 
before the hourlong procession the pope told the crowd 
jesus is near to those who suffer and fall 
in a comment taken as a reference to drug abuse he said jesus 
supports the slaves of vice who after having abandoned the habit 
fall again he sustains those who having been dogged by tragedies 
have doubts about god 
in jerusalem scores of city police and paramilitary border 
forces armed with automatic rifles tear gas grenades and riot 
batons were moved into the old city to ensure security for 
worshipers 
the old city contains sites holy to judaism christianity and 
islam and is part of territory seized by israel in the 1967 middle 
east war 
the procession swept through the via dolorosa or street of 
sorrows to the church of the holy sepulchre where tradition holds 
christ was buried after dying at the hands of the roman rulers of 
the holy land 
the main procession was led by 20 roman catholic franciscan 
monks about 600 worshipers followed a fraction of the crowd that 
traditionally participates 
a scuffle broke out when the procession crossed the path of a 
protestant group moving in another direction police stepped in to 
stop fistfights then quickly set up a barricade 
a guitarist accompanied spanish devotees whose songs echoed in 
the narrow alleys palestinian arabs sang hymns in arabic a 
contrast to the islamic call to prayer that rang out from the old 
citys mosques 
you just feel you are part of a tremendous movement this 
christian religion no matter what denomination it might be said 
john eberlein of manassas va who came with 10 other roman 
catholics to see all colors here all believing the same thing 
you believe its just very exhilerating spiritually moving 
a california group provided the street theater ralph beltran of 
los angeles portrayed christ his head crowned with thorns his 
companions dressed as roman guards pretended to flog him as he 
dragged a wooden cross through the streets 
joanne petranela of brea calif costumed as mary magdalene 
ran among astonished onlookers shouting its all my fault 
a german pilgrim from munich who identified himself only as 
helmut termed the show a disgrace to christianity 
even though this years turnout was smaller the crowds still 
proved too much for gillian prentice of melbourne australia 
it is difficult to move around easily and it would be nicer 
if it was a little quieter she said you need peace and quiet 
to pray i may come back tomorrow

in these antigovernment activities kyaw sann said 
students took a leading role in street demonstrations last year

international business machines corp has 
advised its employees against flying us carriers on some routes 
until the end of next month because of the government warning about 
a possible hijacking in europe 
on the basis of the faa federal aviation administration 
alert ibm notified its employees to avoid traveling on us air 
carriers from europe and the middle east until the end of april 
ibm spokeswoman colette abissi said friday 
she said the notification was issued thursday through the 
companys internal security channels ibm employs 163904 people 
outside the united states 
it is strictly up to employees to decide what travel 
arrangements to make she said 
the faa confirmed thursday it had issued a security bulletin to 
airports and carriers march 16 about the possibility of a 
hijacking of a us airliner in western europe 
the warning did not mention any specific airline or airport that 
might be threatened nor did it cite any time for the warning the 
faa said 
the white house has sought to calm anxiety about the bulletin 
which leaked in a frontpage newspaper story in london 
bush administration officials said the bulletin was similar to 
many other terrorist alerts and travelers should be confident 
that all reasonable precautions are being taken 
security also was strengthened this week at los angeles 
international airport because of the warning although it specified 
europe airport officials said 
we have the ability to react to any type of situation said 
airport manager stephen yee 
meanwhile a spot check of travel agents did not find that 
travelers were reacting by altering their reservations 
h wayne berens president of revere travel inc in trenton 
nj said he was unaware of any customers seeking to change their 
travel plans 
herbert teison editor and publisher of two travel newsletters 
including travel smart for business said my feeling is that the 
majority of people will not pay attention to it if they already 
are booked on a us airline 
if reservations are already made they will let them sit 
said teison but in making reservations they will lean toward 
making them on a foreign carrier

european airport officials indicated severe delays 
were averted friday because travelers aware of reports that a 
hijacking might be attempted checked in early and faced extra 
luggage searches calmly 
the federal aviation administration warned us airlines of a 
possible hijack by palestinian terrorists in europe this weekend a 
london newspaper disclosed the warning thursday angering the 
american government which feared its sources might be compromised 
international business machines corp which employs 163904 
people outside the united states advised them not to fly us 
airlines on european and middle eastern routes until the end of 
april 
police at leonardo da vinci airport in rome said the faa warning 
prompted increased security and that more staff members were 
checking bags and working in the metaldetecting section 
no takeoff delays were reported and reservations agents at us 
airline counters said the number of cancellations was not unusual 
security experts in italy also were wary because of the 
approaching anniversary of the us bombing of libya on april 15 
1986 
on april 14 last year a bomb exploded a uso in naples killing 
an american woman and four other people the japanese red army was 
blamed 
ansa the italian news agency quoted libyan ambassador 
abdulrahman shalgam as telling reporters friday that allegations of 
libyan involvement in attacks allegedly planned were an 
absurdity 
at londons heathrow airport passengers found themselves in 
long lines as bags were carefully searched and their owners 
questioned 
some passengers traveling on american lines faced double checks 
by the airport staff and the airlines airlines tightened security 
after the bombing dec 21 of pan am flight 103 in which 270 people 
were killed 
most travelers appeared to have arrived early as suggested and 
delays generally were limited to a little more than an hour 
i think most people have been well informed and are taking 
advice about arriving early and not carrying electrical 
equipment said bob hearn manager of customer services at 
british airways terminal 4 
investigators say the flight 103 bomb was in a radiocassette 
player british airports now insist that small electronic and 
electrical goods be inspected and carried in hand baggage 
at gatwick the other london airport officials reported delays 
up to four hours but said most flights took off on time 
one traveler said on british broadcasting corp television we 
just keep our fingers crossed thats all you can do 
the situation was complicated by a 90minute fault in an air 
traffic control computer in the morning which delayed flights at 
airports in central england 
in frankfurt west germany an airport spokeswoman said 
increased security was in effect and some flights were held up but 
the delays were not of a substantial nature 
athens airport officials said security always is tight and a 
spokeswoman said we had normal delays which had nothing to do 
with extra security 
a lisbon airport official said security checks were slightly 
more rigorous than normal particularly on us airlines but 
flights were not delayed 
airport authorities in amsterdam said security measures had been 
quietly beefed up but caused no delays or cancellations 
french police in charge of air transport reported nothing 
unusual at the paris airports

a black republican group is refusing to attend 
next months africanamerican summit led by a group of 
prominent blacks because of the possible participation of nation of 
islam leader louis farrakhan 
in a letter friday to former presidential candidate jesse 
jackson fred brown chairman of the national black republican 
council said he and the 150 members of his group would not take 
part because the philosophies of farrakhan and black militants 
angela davis and stokely carmichael are offensive to us 
browns organization is an arm of the republican national 
committee 
jackson is an honorary chairman of the africanamerican summit 
which is scheduled for april 2123 in new orleans other honorary 
chairmen include coretta scott king naacp head benjamin hooks 
national urban league president john jacob dorothy height of the 
national council of negro women and joseph lowery of the southern 
christian leadership conference 
richard hatcher former mayor of gary ind is the general 
chairman of the bipartisan summit which has the stated purpose of 
developing an africanamerican agenda for the next four years 
the coordinator of the summit kay hixson confirmed that 
farrakhan had been asked to participate as a panelist on black 
families but said she did not know about any participation by 
davis or carmichael she said the summit organizers have not 
received a response from farrakhan 
a spokesman for jackson said he was on the board of the summit 
but was not involved in organizing it or inviting people 
he has nothing to do with the planning of it said spokesman 
eric easter who added however that the idea for the summit was 
raised at a black leadership meeting jackson held in chicago in 
december 
fred brown in the leter to jackson with a copy to hatcher said 
that the gop group cannot serve on nor participate in the 
africanamerican summit as long as these individuals are associated 
with the cause 
browns letter says that jackson on jan 27 informed the summit 
steering committee that he also could not be associated with this 
undertaking if these same individuals were allowed to be official 
summit speakers 
the committee voted to exclude farrakhan and tabled the issue of 
davis and carmichael the letter said 
subsequently according to browns letter some individuals 
have fought diligently to have them included in the summit 
i feel that the move to revisit the question of participation 
of these three individuals has been a breach of faith not on your 
part but on the part of others brown wrote jackson 
jacksons relationship with farrakhan became an issue in his 
1984 campaign for the democratic presidential nomination because 
farrakhan referred to judaism as a dirty religion jackson 
dissociated himself from farrakhans remarks but did not rebuke 
him farrakhan played no role in jacksons 1988 campaign 
hixson said farrakhan was selected as a panelist because he 
does play a prominent role in black family issues 
angela davis a communist party black radical and stokely 
carmichael former head of the student nonviolent coordinating 
committee were leaders in the militant black power movement on the 
1960s 
republican national committee communications director mark 
goodin said rnc officials were unfamiliar with the summit or the 
controversy and had no comment on browns action except to say 
that from all weve heard his reasoning is sound

a pakistani living in sweden said 
friday he has gone into hiding after receiving death threats for 
planning to translate salman rushdies book the satanic verses 
police speculated that a malaysian slain in stockholm early 
wednesday was mistaken for the pakistani poet yousaf jhelumi the 
malaysian was knifed from behind for no apparent reason close to 
jhelumis apartment in a northern stockholm suburb 
jhelumi 36 a moslem told swedish television he received death 
threats after announcing plans last month to translate the 
satanic verses into his mother tongue urdu 
urdu is the chief language of pakistan where the book has been 
banned and violently denounced 
jhelumi closed his small shop after receiving the threats and 
has since moved from hotel to hotel he said 
i want to make it clear to moslems in pakistan and india that 
nothing in the book goes against islam jhelumi said he was 
interviewed in a hotel room at an unidentified location 
he said he would only start translating the book if he got 
police protection 
rushdies book has been banned in many moslem countries and the 
indianborn british author has been condemned to death by iranian 
leaders who say the satanic verses blasphemes islam 
the book includes a brothel scene in which the prostitutes take 
the names of mohammeds wives and it suggests mohammed wrote the 
holy koran instead of receiving it from allah 
jhelumi said he considered the book an attack against the 
conservative mullahs who wanted to see the world as oldfashioned 
as it was during the time of mohammed 
the fanatics can wring my neck but they cant wring 
history he said 
jhelumi said he has been denounced in pakistan and his relatives 
there have been threatened with being socially ostracized

a judge set a 100000 bond friday for 
timothy jacobs one of two indian activists acquitted of federal 
charges and later charged by the state for holding up to 20 
hostages at a newspaper last year 
jacobs 20 was returned from madison county ny thursday 
night to face 14 seconddegree kidnapping charges he dropped his 
fight against extradition wednesday after a new york appeals court 
refused to block the order sending him home 
superior court judge anthony brannon set bond for jacobs and 
appointed him a lawyer during a hearing at the courthouse barely a 
block from the robesonian newspaper where jacobs and eddie hatcher 
held hostages for 10 hours on feb 1 1988 
both were found innocent of federal hostagetaking and firearms 
violations after a threeweek trial in raleigh last october but 
they were indicted by a robeson county grand jury last december on 
state kidnapping charges 
jacobs fled soon afterward to the onondaga indian reservation 
south of syracuse ny but was captured dec 13 after a 
highspeed chase hatcher was arrested in north carolina but fled 
the state after the national council of churches posted a 25000 
bond for him he first went to new york then to an indian 
reservation in idaho 
hatcher tried earlier this month to seek political asylum at the 
soviet consulate in san francisco but the soviets rejected his 
plea and turned him out of their building allowing federal agents 
to arrest him he is being held in a jail in oakland calif 
jacobs family said they would find the money to get him 
released 
the money is no problem said eleanor jacobs timothys 
mother timmy was hoping to be home for easter but with the 
holiday today and the short amount of notice we had we just didnt 
have everything ready 
a bond can be secured with cash or a deed to property jacobs 
parents own their own home in robeson county 
the two tuscarora indians said they took over the newspaper to 
draw attention to their charges of official corruption and 
drugdealing by robeson county officials a state task force formed 
as a result of the takeover found no evidence to support those 
allegations 
jacobs said before his court appearance he would plead guilty to 
one of the kidnapping counts provided he received probation with 
no prison sentence he said he would not testify against hatcher 
31 
district attorney richard townsend who made no comments 
opposing bond for jacobs said he would not accept that kind of 
plea bargain 
i dont think were interested in that at this point 
townsend said we feel all of the charges need to be disposed of 
it might be something we would discuss at a later time but not 
now 
townsend said he hoped to try jacobs and hatcher at the same 
time 
a decision is expected monday whether to return hatcher to north 
carolina to face a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid 
prosecution or to drop the federal charge and begin extradition 
proceedings on the state charges in california 
hatcher said this week that jacobs was abandoning the cause 
by dropping his extradition battle in new york mrs jacobs said 
friday she had hoped her son would continue that fight but she 
understood why he dropped it 
he said he just got tired of fighting and wanted to get it 
over with she said i can understand that

dick cheney who found winning congressional 
confirmation as defense secretary easy had less luck finding his 
car 
he told reporters on friday how in his first day on the job 
last saturday he had set out from his office to get his car 
what he got was lost in the basement of the worlds largest 
office building 
asked how he was finding the pentagon building which covers 29 
acres cheney recounted 
on saturday i guess it was i was scheduled for a meeting 
with the president over in the residence at the white house 
i went out and got on the elevator in the secretarys suite 
and went down to get in the car and when i went down in the 
elevator the doors opened and i stepped out the doors the doors 
closed behind me and there was no car there 
i was in the basement of the pentagon it was a bit 
disconcerting because i turned around to look for a button to push 
to get the elevator 
the fact is of course they dont want strangers wandering 
into the secretarys suite by being able to punch in in the 
basement so i was lost in the basement of the pentagon i wandered 
around for a few minutes worried that i was going to miss the 
meeting with the president 
i finally found the stairs up to the river entrance and the 
car was parked outside at that time at the river entrance 
of course people were running around out there wondering what 
happened to the secretary but i sort of tightened my tie and 
walked out like i knew exactly where i was and arrived outside and 
nobody had the nerve to ask me where the hell id been all that 
time 
have you got a new chauffeur a reporter asked 
the chauffeurs all right cheney replied im worried 
about the guy who runs the elevator

a fifthgraders science fair project on 
aids won her an a but was sequestered in the principals office 
when school officials feared exposing students to a discussion 
about the deadly disease 
james baldree principal at waveland elementary school kept 
angela eades project from appearing at the schools science fair 
and a regional competition earlier this week 
he also refused to allow anyone to look at it including 
teachers and parents 
students are required to verbally defend their projects for 
the judges and we felt it would be a severe imposition to expect 
judges to have to question a 10yearold girl about such a 
project he said 
angelas project a pegboard with aids spelled in red letters 
across it and pasted with magazine articles earned her a blue 
ribbon and an a grade but baldree said two teachers decided 
the project did not meet science fair rules 
the rules disallow projects on vertebrate animals and on 
physical matters relating to humans but there was also worry about 
the displays sensitive subject matter he said 
other fair participants usually listen in when the judges ask 
questions students all the way down to kindergarten and we 
didnt think it would be right to expose children of those young 
ages to that kind of discussion 
baldree described the project as sexually explicit the articles 
included information on how acquired immune deficiency syndrome is 
most often spread through sexual contact needles or syringes 
shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from 
pregnant women to their offspring 
angela said she had planned a project on the human heart i 
was looking through some books and found a lot of information on 
aids its a disease anybody can get so i decided that would be a 
better project she said 
teona eades angelas mother said she wasnt aware the project 
did not meet the rules until a coordinator told her it was 
unacceptable 
we have no problem with the school officials actions they 
had to follow the rules mrs eades said but if those rules 
are going to shield our children from reality thats not very 
scientific 
angela said she thought fourth and fifthgraders should have 
been able to see the project because we are already talking about 
aids she said her project could have helped educate other 
students about the disease

the food and drug administration on friday 
cleared the way for more chilean fruit apples peaches and plums 
to be sold to us markets after they are inspected for evidence 
of cyanide poisoning 
import restrictions were lifted on pears and nectarines from 
chile on tuesday and on grapes and berries last friday allowing 
the fruit to be released for sale after 5 percent of each shipment 
is inspected and found free from cyanide 
grapes which constitute 70 percent of the fruit chile sends to 
the united states began appearing on produce shelves of us 
stores this week after a twoweek absence due to the 
cyanidepoisoning scare 
more than 1 million cases of grapes and various types of berries 
have been inspected at us docks and airports and sent to 
retailers since the hold on those fruits was lifted the fda said 
food graders should begin inspecting chilean apples peaches and 
plums by the weekend an fda spokesman said 
the public should be reassured that the government has kept 
everyone informed and has moved promptly both to protect the public 
health and to restore to the marketplace a healthy component of the 
balanced diet that we recommend said fda commissioner frank 
young 
chile also exports melons to the united states at this time of 
year but fda spokesman william grigg said it is not clear 
whether they will be returned to the us market or not this 
season 
chilean fruit was removed from store shelves and unsold supplies 
were held in warehouses at ports and on ships after the fda found 
traces of cyanide in two seedless red grapes the fda began looking 
for evidence of cyanide tampering after two telephone calls to the 
us embassy in the chilean capital of santiago threatened to 
inject the poison into fruit exports 
an estimated 50 million to 75 million worth of chilean fruit 
that could not be readily inspected had to be destroyed meanwhile 
the fda conducted tests on the different fruits to identify the 
detectable damage caused by cyanide injections so inspectors would 
know what to look for 
evidence of cyanide poisoning includes discoloration and 
deterioration of the fruit the fda said and the agency advised 
consumers to examine fruit as a precaution including the area at 
the stem for discolorations and punctures 
inspectors have found no further cyanide contamination in any of 
the fruit from chile despite a third telephone threat that was 
received last friday shortly before the fda announced its 
steppedup inspection plan to return chilean fruit to us stores

hungarian communist party leader karoly grosz said 
friday he and president mikhail s gorbachev reached complete 
agreement in talks on hungarys drive for a multiparty system and 
increasing calls for neutrality 
there were no issues in our threehour discussion where we had 
differences in our views grosz told a moscow news conference 
reforms began earlier in hungary than in the soviet union and 
have progressed further making it both a laboratory for economic 
and social experiments in the east bloc and a source of worry for 
moscow over whether budapest is going too far 
grosz arrived thursday on his first visit to moscow since 
hungarian party leaders last month declared their support for a 
multiparty system 
grosz said he explained the decision to gorbachev and added 
this is strictly up to the hungarian people and the hungarian 
leadership 
it is natural that the political structure of a country 
develop in its own particular way he said 
grosz said that neither a oneparty system prevalent in eastern 
europe nor a multiparty system either ensures or precludes 
democracy 
the soviet union where the communist party remains intolerant 
of any challenge is seeking to implement reforms based on its own 
history grosz said 
hungarian premier miklos nemeth said after visiting moscow early 
this month that gorbachev approved hungarys reforms and does not 
oppose introduction of a multiparty system there 
despite sanctioning competition grosz said he does not 
anticipate becoming leader of an opposition party the hungarian 
communist party he said is sure to win a leading role im not 
thinking of being an opposition leader im thinking of being the 
leader of the winning party 
asked about growing demands in hungary for neutrality grosz 
said we are continually working for elimination of the two 
military blocs on the european continent if that happens there 
will be no question about the neutrality of hungary 
we met complete unanimity of views with gorbachev he said 
the hungarian news agency mti said gorbachev told grosz that 
present world circumstances do not give any warsaw pact members a 
chance to be neutral 
the two leaders also expressed their support for a continuing 
reevaluation of the soviet invasion that crushed the hungarian 
uprising of 1956 grosz said 
in order for the two sides to form an accurate record 
historians on both sides must gain access to documents of the 
period he said gorbachevs support is necessary to ensure that 
the historians who are looking into this matter get a look at 
authentic documents grosz said 
the tass new agency said the focus of the meeting was an 
exchange of expertise and information about pressing issues of 
socialist construction in both countries and the development of 
cooperation in all areas

the national organization for women said friday 
its message favoring abortion rights was refused by more than two 
dozen radio stations in five northeastern cities 
it never occurred to us that we wouldnt be able to place paid 
ads on a subject thats on everyones lips it is the issue of the 
day in terms of womens rights molly yard the president of now 
said at a news conference 
now budgeted about 40000 to place the 60second spot on 35 
stations in boston new york philadelphia baltimore and 
washington eight stations agreed to carry the spot and 26 
declined one station had not decided ms yard said 
the spot was aimed at promoting an april 9 march in washington 
supporting the right to abortion ms yard said organizers expected 
as many as 250000 people to attend 
nows advertisement was produced to sound like a newscast with 
an announcer setting a scene followed by clips of president bush 
and vice president daniel quayle voicing their opposition to 
abortion 
in the ad actress susan sarandon concludes with the warning 
that a womans right to choose now hangs in the balance 
ms yard said the radio stations had refused to run the 
advertisement because of its controversial content 
its like the stupid decision thats made on condoms they 
wont talk about condoms they wont show them on tv and now 
theyre not going to talk about abortion she said 
however executives at several radio stations that declined to 
accept the advertising spot said they were bothered not by its 
content but because of the format 
we wont take anything if theyre trying to simulate a 
newscast you cant fake a newscast said warren maurer general 
manager of winsam an allnews station in new york 
jeff messerman national sales manager for wxksfm a boston 
station playing contemporary hit music said the station refused to 
air the ad because of its newscast format and sound effects 
it has exploding bombs sirens just things you dont want to 
have on copy we thought that this was a spot that was going to 
cause people to tune out he said

continental airlines has moved swiftly to capture 
some of the business abandoned by strikebound sister carrier 
eastern airlines but it disputes union claims that its moves are 
part of a master plan to grow at easterns expense 
amid its own labor problems flight attendants on friday ended 
a fourday walkout that had little impact on service continental 
has added flights on routes vacated by eastern taken over eastern 
gates at some airports and waged an aggressive ad campaign to 
attract more east coast passengers 
industry observers say the houstonbased airline has gained 
passengers and revenue but no more so than other competitors since 
eastern virtually shut down after the march 4 strike by its 
machinists union and subsequent walkouts by pilots and flight 
attendants 
every carrier that still flies will be doing better now than 
they were before the strike with the exception of some of the 
commuter lines who may have been feeding into eastern flights 
said george james president of airline economics inc in 
washington dc 
so continental will certainly see benefits but i think that 
there are a number of carriers who will have far greater benefits 
than continental james said 
eastern is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy court 
protection from creditors 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland in new york extended an 
order friday forcing rival airlines to honor agreements governing 
ticket baggage and cargo transfers essential to keeping 
strikecrippled eastern airlines airborne he also barred the 
striking machinists from picketing on eastern property at logan 
international airport in boston 
separately a federal appeals court in miami told a lower court 
to reconsider the airlines request that it force eastern pilots 
back to work 
easterns unions have claimed that the parent of the two 
airlines texas air corp has been trying to funnel eastern assets 
to continental a largely nonunion carrier the machinists and air 
line pilots association have asked the federal bankruptcy court to 
appoint a trustee to govern easterns daily operations and business 
transactions removing company management from that role 
the unions also allege that texas air chairman frank lorenzo is 
using continental as a profitgenerating tool against the striking 
workers 
but continental officials say they like other airlines 
simply are responding to consumer demand created by the strike 
continental has added eight flights out of its newark hub nine 
additional flights on miami routes abandoned by eastern and a new 
clevelandmiami route 
the carrier also took over eight eastern landing slots at new 
yorks laguardia airport and eight at washingtons national 
airport under what continental describes as a 60day lease 
these added flights are simply to help us address demand in 
the marketplace and this really is no different from what other 
carriers out there are doing said continental spokesman ned 
walker 
charles bryan president of easterns machinists union said 
lorenzo is using continental like a war machine to offset the 
eastern strike increasing revenues and expanding continental 
permanently into easterns markets 
robert joedicke an airline analyst for shearson lehman hutton 
inc in new york said continentals ability to offset easterns 
losses for texas air was limited 
there are some shortterm advantages to continental as they 
pick up some additional flights and passengers just as there are 
to other airlines joedicke said 
but the advantage through continental from a texas air point 
of view will come nowhere near making up for what is being lost at 
eastern as a result of the strike and the bankruptcy filing 
eastern is averaging just over 100 flights daily compared with 
1040 daily before the strike 
continental officials had no available figures on profits since 
the eastern strike began 
when they release their march traffic results well be able to 
make some judgments said julius maldutis an airline analyst for 
salomon brothers inc in new york 
other analysts said that while there are some clear winners in 
the eastern strike continental appears to be a lesser player 
some are obviously seeing benefits not the least of which is 
delta air lines operations in atlanta james said 
delta and eastern have had about 90 percent of the market 
there with delta holding about 55 or 60 percent so with eastern 
down delta does not face a large amount of competition he said 
also james said pan am has doubled its operations on the 
lucrative new yorkwashingtonboston shuttle during peak periods 
united airlines trans world airlines and usair have capitalized on 
flights between the midwest and the east coast

a federal bankruptcy judge on friday extended an

us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland also barred striking 
machinists from picketing on eastern property at logan 
international airport in boston 
separately a federal appeals court in miami told a lower court 
to reconsider the airlines request that it force eastern pilots 
back to work 
earlier continental airlines flight attendants terminated a 
fourday strike that had little apparent effect on easterns sister 
carrier 
the developments came on the 21st day of a walkout by the 
8500member machinists union being honored by pilots and flight 
attendants eastern is operating a limited schedule on its 
northeast shuttle and on latin and south american routes 
in new york eastern attorneys said in bankruptcy court that the 
airline was negotiating with rivals to maintain interline 
agreements that allow passengers and bags to make connecting 
flights on different carriers 
eastern said that without cooperation among carriers its few 
services would be crippled the pacts do not govern agreements with 
other airlines honoring eastern tickets purchased before the strike 
lifland granted a twoweek extension to an order that 
competitors honor the agreements 
weve had very substantial discussions and negotiations with 
the major carriers said easterns vice president for marketing 
george j brennan theyre all willing to resolve this 
lifland also barred picketing on a 150yardlong sidewalk in 
front of easterns terminal at logan international airport after 
the airline complained machinists were trespassing on private 
property 
in houston union of flight attendants spokeswoman myra clayton 
said the union was notifying flight attendants at easterns sister 
airline continental to return to work 
continental said no flights were disrupted or canceled because 
of the walkout it said 200 flight attendants took part the union 
reported more than 1200 strikers 
the union which represents more than 6000 flight attendants 
called the walkout monday to protest what it said were substandard 
wages and working conditions at the carrier 
in miami the 11th us circuit court of appeals told a lower 
court judge that he had the authority to rule whether the walkout 
by easterns 3600 pilots constitutes a primary or secondary strike 
eastern earlier this month asked the judges to overturn a lower 
court ruling permitting the air line pilots association to honor 
striking machinists picket lines under the railway labor act of 
1926 
a claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used as a pretext to 
shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the 
railway labor act the appeals court said 
it said us district judge edward b davis has the authority to 
rule on what kind of strike the pilots are engaged in 
the alpa said it is buying advertising this weekend in major 
newspapers in miami atlanta washington boston and new york to 
publicize its position and deter other pilots from going to work 
for eastern 
the advertisement describes the alleged pitfalls of working for 
frank lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air corp 
including limited career opportunities and low pay scales and 
says pilots choose your career opportunities wisely

the coast guard suspended its search for a 
52foot sport fishing boat friday night after almost 24 hours of 
battling rough seas and poor visibility with no success a 
spokesman said 
we havent got any new information petty officer 1st class 
rick woods said as of about six oclock the units that are out 
there will finish their search patterns and come back in 
woods said the area had been thoroughly and unsuccessfully 
searched by three coast guard cutters two navy ships and a coast 
guard helicopter 
he did not know whether the search would be resumed 
the coast guard received a distress call thursday night saying 
the blue goose with 10 people aboard was sinking off the virginia 
coast 
about an hour later the boat radioed that it was taking on 
water about five miles off virginia beach and that the occupants 
had donned life jackets and were abandoning the vessel the coast 
guard advised the people to stay together but received no 
acknowledgement of that transmission 
driving rain 50knot winds and seas of 6 to 8 feet were 
reported about the time the distress call was received 
an allnight search turned up no sign of the boat or its 
passengers water temperatures were in the 40s which could cause 
hypothermia in anyone who was overboard said petty officer 1st 
class vernon covington 
the coast guard searched boat registrations in every east coast 
state and found no record of a vessel named the blue goose that 
matches the description of the fishing vessel petty officer 1st 
class rick barrett said 
if its not a documented vessel and all we have is the name 
its hard for us to track down the information he said 
coast guard spokesmen said the distress call sounded legitimate 
and they had no reason to believe the call was a hoax 
we dont know that this is a hoax but there have been hoaxes 
before said petty officer 2nd class steve blando

health officials said friday they will 
begin vaccinating up to 4000 people after an infant became the 
sixth person to die in an outbreak of meningococcal disease 
yakima county health officials also conferred with the federal 
centers for disease control in atlanta on how to deal with about 
400 participants from seven states at a basketball tournament 
underway in nearby wapato 
teams at the allindian tournament which began wednesday are 
from kansas oregon washington idaho montana california and 
oklahoma 
health officials want to ensure they do not carry the disease 
back to their states options include quarantining participants 
vaccinating them or sending them home with no treatment said dr 
bob atwood county health director 
dr jay wenger of cdc said a quarantine was unlikely because the 
risk of participants contracting the disease is very low 
it was a discouraging day for health officials who on wednesday 
said they felt they were through the worst of the nations largest 
current outbreak of meningococcal disease 
the meningococcus germ is carried in the nose and throat and 
passed through sneezing and other secretions from the nose and 
mouth it is not considered highly contagious 
in the yakima outbreak the germ is causing bacterial 
meningitis an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal 
cord and meningococcemia in which it travels through the blood 
stream and attacks organs 
adults who become infected usually do not become sick but can 
carry the disease to children symptoms are similar to the common 
cold and include fever nausea headache and a rash 
an unidentified infant died thursday in the latest case making 
it the 18th since jan 10 of the six deaths four were infants 
the state had only four deaths from meningococcal disease in all of 
1988 
this suggests there is a high rate of carriers in the 
county atwood told an emergency meeting of the county health 
board 
that is troubling because the basketball tournament has drawn 
large crowds who have mingled with the outoftown visitors 
making it impossible to do conventional contacttracing techniques 
to identify those most at risk of exposure he said 
as a result health officials planned to vaccinate everyone 
between ages 1 to 25 in the wapato area on friday and saturday a 
total of about 4000 people atwood said 
the vaccine does not work on people under age 1 and people over 
25 who are exposed rarely become ill atwood said 
most of the deaths in the outbreak have involved hispanics or 
native americans and the common denominator is lowincome families 
living in crowded conditions officials said

japans defense chief said friday that a new round 
of talks in washington between japanese and us officials on the 
fsx fighter project started with disagreement 
the contents of the talks were very tough kichiro tazawa 
directorgeneral of the defense agency said at a news conference 
agency deputy director seiki nishihiro and us officials 
including secretary of state james a baker iii met thursday to 
discuss the joint development of japans next generation jet 
fighter plane 
president bush said this week he endorsed joint production of 
the fsx fighter but with some changes to protect us technology 
his decision followed criticism that the plan amounted to a 
giveaway of up to 8 billion worth of american technology 
tazawa said however that washington should stick to the terms 
of the original agreement signed in november under the agreement 
mitsubishi heavy industries ltd japans major defense contractor 
and us aircraft maker general dynamics corp would develop the 
new fighter 
nishihiro scheduled to remain in washington until sunday will 
continue to hold meetings with us officials tazawa said 
japan originally planned to develop the fighter independently 
but negotiated a joint development agreement after washington put 
pressure on tokyo to buy usbuilt planes 
american critics however have warned that us technology for 
the plane could help japan compete against american companies in 
the manufacture of civilian aircraft a hightechnology field in 
which japan now lags but has targeted for development 
under the development agreement reached after several years of 
negotiations mitsubishi would be responsible for developing the 
new fighter by using technology developed domestically and from the 
f16 developed by the st louisbased general dynamics 
general dynamics would receive 35 percent to 40 percent of the 
contract in the developmental stage 
initially 130 planes would be built with a possible followup 
order for about 100 more each fsx would cost about 40 million 
japanese officials say

americans personal income shot up 1 percent 
last month while consumer spending advanced at a more restrained 
pace boosting the savings rate to its highest level in nearly 
three years the government said friday 
personal income bolstered by strong growth in employment and 
wages has posted two straight solid gains rising to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 432 trillion last month after surging 17 
percent in january the commerce department reported 
but when it comes to spending that money consumers have been 
showing more restraint personal consumption expenditures rose 05 
percent in february to an annual rate of 338 trillion after 
advancing 04 percent in january 
the consumer is still getting a lot of dollars placed in his 
wallet said robert dederick chief economist at northern trust 
co in chicago but when it came to spending consumers suddenly 
have decided this income is not going to be disbursed as lavishly 
as it has been 
the uneven advances in income and spending resulted in a healthy 
jump in the personal savings rate savings as a percentage of 
aftertax income to 59 percent from 54 percent in the previous 
month 
februarys rate matched the savings level set in april 1986 and 
hasnt been surpassed since may 1985 when the rate was 64 
percent the rate has been on the increase since it hit a 40year 
low of 32 percent in 1987 
analysts said the latest report on personal income and spending 
demonstrated that the economy continued to show strength last month 
even as some signs of a slowdown emerge 
most analysts expect the economy to cool this year as the 
federal reserve board continues to push up interest rates in an 
effort to restrain growth and keep inflation in check 
there are already a few signs that higher interest rates are 
cooling off the overall economy which means fewer jobs being 
generated in the months ahead and smaller income gains said 
sandra shaber of the futures group in washington we will 
continue to see consumer spending expanding but at a more modest 
rate 
last months gain in income included a large increase in farm 
subsidy payments but excluding that effect income still rose a 
healthy 07 percent last month 
wages and salaries a key component of personal income rose 06 
percent to 257 trillion last month following a 11 percent gain 
in january 
on the spending side most of the modest gain came in a 1 
percent rise in spending for services which analysts said was 
largely a reflection of an upturn in heating bills last month after 
januarys mild weather 
purchases of nondurable goods edged up 01 percent and spending 
on durable goods declined 03 percent the decline in durable goods 
big ticket items expected to last three or more years 
primarily was due to lackluster car sales which have been held 
back by higher interest rates and reduced demand after earlier 
strong sales 
william dunkelberg dean of the school of business and 
management at temple university said the slower gain in spending 
should be interpreted as a return to normal spending behavior 
from earlier unsustainably high levels fueled by strong employment 
analysts said the rise in the savings rate reflected the big 
drop in auto sales and recent increases in farm income because 
farmers generally dont alter their spending patterns based on when 
they receive income and subsidies 
farm income subject to wide swings was up 32 percent in 
february after shooting up 103 percent in january 
ms shaber said the savings rate also might be going up in part 
because consumers are retrenching somewhat as they become a 
little bit more concerned about the possibility of an economic 
downturn 
consumers are more likely to feel the pinch of higher interest 
rates this year as their adjustablerate mortgages rachet upward 
and slower income growth fails to ease the bite of other higher 
financing costs she said

a 50foot boat carrying about 100 haitians was 
intercepted friday just outside us territorial waters and the 
refugees will be returned to their homeland the coast guard 
reported 
officers determined that the haitians wooden sailboat was 
intercepted 32 miles from shore just outside the 3mile limit 
said petty officer luis diaz 
real close diaz said they did two readings and confirmed 
that is the correct position perhaps they were just a breath away 
from making it into the three miles 
if the haitians had been inside the limit they would have been 
brought ashore for detention and processing and their claims for 
asylum would have been considered by immigration and naturalization 
service workers 
diaz said the haitians were spotted early friday by the crew of 
a tanker about three miles east of fort lauderdale 
medical personnel were sent to the sailboat as a precaution and 
the unsuccessful immigrants also were given water diaz said two 
of the wouldbe immigrants were taken to memorial hospital in 
hollywood 
theyre suffering from exposure and dehydrated hospital 
spokeswoman linda hamlin said late friday afternoon adding it was 
too soon to say if they would be admitted 
a coast guard cutter was dispatched to return the haitians to 
their homeland 
leaders of miamis haitian community meanwhile attacked what 
they call a racist immigration policy while cubans and nicaraguans 
are received with open arms they say haitians arent even allowed 
into the country 
its clear theyre playing games with the black refugees 
said gerard jeanjuste director of miamis haitian refugee center 
we would like to see something done about it 
an ins official denied there was any discrimination in the 
interdiction policy 
its just that more haitians are coming in boats than any 
other ethnic group said ins district director perry rivkind 
theres nothing really one can do

a drug addict who cut a bloody path through a 
denver suburb with a submachine gun heated up debate over 
semiautomatic weapons friday in a state where residents jealously 
guard their firearms and their freedom 
denver city councilman cathy reynolds said she intends to 
introduce a resolution monday declaring the councils intention to 
pass a law restricting or prohibiting the sale of such weapons 
theyre weapons of war even if its only a small war like we 
saw yesterday said reynolds who expects strong opposition to 
the measure 
eugene thompson jr described by authorities as a 20yearold 
man with an insatiable appetite for cocaine killed two women with 
a semiautomatic machine pistol raped another woman and wounded 
two deputies and a hostage before fatally wounding himself in a 
10hour reign of terror thursday 
thompson used a semiautomatic mac11 submachine gun which can 
hold 32 bullets only five bullets were left when the manhunt for 
him ended 
last week following a trend of nationwide outrage over 
semiautomatic weapons state senate president ted strickland 
sponsored a bill that would ban the sale transfer and receipt of 
semiautomatic assault rifles 
the republican legislator said thursdays tragedy would stir 
emotions on both sides but he doesnt expect the measure to be 
very popular among colorados residents who tend to love their 
firearms and their freedom 
there will be an awful lot of heat generated not much light 
and very few minds changed he said 
authorities said friday that the gunman a drug addict with a 
long criminal record used a gun stolen during a march 19 
burglaryinvestigators said they also had arrested a suspected 
accomplice donald andrews on charges of taking part in 71 
burglaries with thompson 
andrews was being questioned friday to learn whether thompson 
had said anything prior to his rampage according to lt bill 
walker of the douglas county sheriffs department 
thompson had been a suspect in at least 140 thefts and 
burglaries and had been sought on arrest warrants issued monday 
for failure to appear in golden district court for probation 
revocation authorities said 
his 18yearold hostage jake carper remained in critical but 
stable condition friday following surgery at swedish medical 
center officials said 
arapahoe county deputy daniel thomas 36 and deputy arthur l 
hilton 37 were released from swedish medical center after being 
treated for gunshot wounds and shrapnel wounds from flying glass 
in addition to thompson the dead included beverly j swartz 
48 and janice irene swartz 68 autopsies friday showed that 
beverly was shot in the head and janice was shot in the head chest 
and ankle after they were bound with rope shots were also fired at 
oscar swartz the husband of janice swartz but he played dead and 
survived authorities said 
arapahoe county sheriff pat sullivan who took part in a 
dramatic rescue of two of his wounded deputies by driving his car 
through a fence held up the mac11 after the shootings and 
demanded that such weapons of war be regulated or banned 
for comparison sullivan also held up the bloody 38caliber 
revolver used by one of his wounded deputies 
our officers are outgunned these guns are designed to 
kill and maim people said sullivan who had come out against 
semiautomatic weapon sales before the rampage 
the california assembly already has approved a ban on 40 types 
of assaulttype weapons and similar action is pending in other 
states california took the action after a man with an ak47 
assault rifle killed five schoolchildren and wounded 29 others

a federal order friday that could sink a 500 
million proposed dam and reservoir drew angry charges of 
interference from some colorado officials but environmentalists 
praised it as wise and courageous 
denver mayor federico pena and other members of the denver water 
board themain sponsors of the two forks dam were dismayed after 
hearing of the decision by environmental protection agency 
administrator william k reilly 
we feel mr reilly has interjected himself in this process 
outside the purview of the epas own regulations said denver 
water board president monte pascoe 
pascoe said the project addressed environmental and other 
concerns and has emerged far and away as the biggest longterm 
water supply plan for the denver metropolitan area 
the eightyearold project on the south platte river southwest 
of denver has been the center of a bitter fight between 
environmentalists and denver area officials who say the region 
needs the dam for its future water needs 
reilly began procedures tantamount to overruling a construction 
permit issued earlier this month by the corps of engineers which 
could lead to a veto of the project if compromises are not worked 
out 
gov roy romer called reillys position a basic disagreement 
between federal agencies about how the decision should be made 
that disagreement is fertile ground for delay and 
indecision the governor said he said he would prefer to see a 
permit for two forks issued with a 25year shelf life and 
added he would be willing to take action to compensate for damage 
to the environment and wildlife 
pena said the impact of a final rejection of two forks in my 
opinion will have stronger environmental consequences that is the 
message not communicated to the epa office 
us sen tim wirth and environmentalist organizations however 
praised reillys action 
i think we should view epas decision as a commitment by the 
bush administration to conserving one of americas most beautiful 
canyons and conserving water resources wirth said 
but todays decision does not mean that we should stop looking 
for ways to provide more water for metropolitan denver he added 
dr jay d hair president of the national wildlife federation 
headquartered in washington dc said i commend the epa 
administrator for a courageous position it is economically a 
bad project and environmentally its been a disaster 
audubon society president peter a berle said the decision was 
the first major environmental test for president bush and he passed 
it with flying colors

sent to parliament for examination

can appoint a special judicial panel to investigate wrongdoings 
perpetrated by acting or former ministers

opposition parties to call for papandreous resignation

million in the bank of crete last summer

for depositing large amounts of money in the bank at lower than 
normal interest rates when it was suffering from a cashflow problem

the state supreme court on thursday 
rejected a triple murderers plea for a stay of his execution by 
injection or hanging 
the high court said the motion for a stay based mostly on 
charles rodman campbells absence during jury selection for his 1982 
murder trial was not worthy of further consideration 
campbell attorney robert gombiner conceded that campbell had 
signed a waiver of his right be present at jury selection but 
argued that by court rule a defendant in a capital case can never 
waive his right to be present at jury selection 
campbell is scheduled to die at 1201 am next thursday for the 
1982 knife slayings of renae wicklund 31 her 8yearold daughter 
shannah and barbara hendrickson 51 
in a neatly printed brief submitted to the court wednesday 
campbell also asserted that death by hanging is so psychologically 
distressing and frightening to petitioner that the fear of being 
hung will force petitioner to violate his religious beliefs against 
killing and suicide forcing petitioner to actively take part in 
his own demise in order to escape death by hanging 
campbells lead lawyer al lyon said late thursday he will seek a 
stay of execution from us district court in seattle within the 
next few days seeking a stay of execution 
at the time of the murders campbell was living at a work release 
center serving a sentence for assault and sodomy ms wicklund was 
the victim in those crimes and testified against campbell at the 
earlier trial

he would work to keep international trade open but will not 
confuse involvement with interference 
speaking to a national association of manufacturers luncheon 
bush praised industrys recent gains in productivity and exporting 
nobody is secondguessing american manufacturing any more clearly 
you all are playing a winning game he said 
bush was applauded vigorously when he said he would keep on 
fighting for his proposal to reduce the capitalgains tax rate to 
a maximum of 15 percent about half the current top rate 
the proposal part of his fiscal 1990 budget package has been 
cooly received by the democraticcontrolled congress 
the president contends that lowering the tax on capital gains 
proceeds from the sale of stock homes buildings realestate and 
other assets would spur new business investment and bring as much 
as 48 billion in new tax revenue to the government for 1990 
this is a case where less means more bush said 
he said a lower capitalgains rate would enhance us 
competitiveness abroad 
bush told the manufacturers your presence here today 
demonstrates that you are fighting to win the international struggle 
for continued growth 
im not saying youre going to have to do it alone he added 
there is a role for government sometimes political leadership is 
needed for example to keep international trade free and fair 
however i will tell you that this government will not confuse 
involvement with interference 
bush sounded again the antidrug theme he has been stressing in 
recent speeches saying drug and alchohol abuse are cutting into 
business productivity 
were determined to keep drugs out of the workplace bush 
said he praised a recent supreme court ruling on drugtesting 
saying it would give his administrations antidrug efforts a much 
better chance of success 
the court on tuesday upheld the constitutionality of drug testing 
programs for law enforcement and public safety workers 
employers can teach their people to recognize the signs of 
substance abuse in their coworkers and understand how drug abuse 
hurts the nonusers on the line bush said

after sitting silently in a courtroom where he 
is on trial on 12 irancontra charges former national security 
council aide oliver north returned to the lecture circuit thursday 
to tell a conservative audience that he is still very wary of 
the reforms of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
i may be a lonely voice but i will urge all of you to watch 
very closely what mr gorbachev does north told a dinner audience 
at a conference sponsored by the world media association 
north who is charged with lying to congress about his alleged 
fundraising for nicaraguan contras at a time support for the rebel 
forces had been outlawed said gorbachev is continuing to arm 
nicaragua and cuba to the point where america could well be forced 
in the future to move forces from europe and elsewhere around the 
world to defend our own southern border 
in his trial in us district court here north has mostly sat 
silently and listened as witnesses give varying portrayals of his 
conduct as a member of the national security council staff in the 
reagan white house 
in his speech he said he found himself out of work and in this 
new venue given a chance to speak without a subpoena 
he said in the past eight years freedom fighter movements 
truly have raised up new aspirations for the freedom of millions 
in nicaragua and elsewhere 
as for soviet reforms he said there has been no reduction 
but rather an increase in support for radical communist regimes like 
that in libya in cuba angola and nicaragua 
despite the vast publicity i must tell you that i personally 
am still very wary north said today inside the soviet union 
it is in vogue to criticize former dictators but not the current 
dictator 
earlier black veterans of the civil rights movement describing 
themselves as conservatives criticized news coverage of racial 
issues portraying the media as distractive or even hostile 
james meredith who in 1961 was the first black student to enroll 
in the university of mississippi said a very small band of 
conspirators bent on dominating world affairs have maneuvered and 
swayed all the media in the western christian world 
this group which i will refer to as the liberal elite has 
determined that the subjugation of the black race is critical to the 
success of its scheme to control the world meredith said 
roy innis a director of the committee on racial equality said 
the media has exhibited a schizoid and dichotomous behavior on 
race relations in america and also in the rest of the world 
on one hand that behavior has at times in terms of race 
relations has been beneficial but at most times in particular at 
this time it has been invidious he said 
innis praised aspects of media coverage of the civil rights 
movement in the 1960s saying without the media friendly i dont 
think much of the gains we made could have been made 
at the same time he said the media depicted whites in the south 
as bad guys and those in the north as good guys and ignored 
the decency and commmitment for change that was being expressed by 
many white southerners in order to project this simplistic vision of 
good guy bad guy 
jim martin identified as a a founding member of the student 
nonviolent coordinating committee told the group the media and 
the civil rights movement and its leaders and organizations are in 
fact allies in a war and that is the war to detract the 
people from fundamental issues of justice common sense and 
political reality 
now i am not going to attribute all of these sinister motives 
to a cabal of media professionals and civil rights leaders he 
said its just a crazy coincidence of timing that goes back many 
many years 
james bevell a former strategist for the rev martin luther 
king however suggested that unfavorable images of some black 
political leaders in the news media are the fault of the blacks and 
not the media 
responding to a question about coverage of district of columbia 
mayor marion barry and other black political figures bevell said 
there is not an elected black official in america today that has 
constitutional consciousness 
the media is not attacking black people he said the 
black guys are not qualified and will not say to the white guys who 
know constitutional principles i would like to serve as an 
apprentice and so they play like they know government 
john nettles national vice chairman of the southern christian 
leadership conference was moderator of the panel 
the discussion took place at the 10th world media conference of 
the world media association sponsored by the washington times corp 
and news world communications inc the association which describes 
itself as an organization devoted to journalistic ethics was 
founded by the rev sun myung moon of the unification church

about two years dillon said 
the fbi is investigating whether the march 10 bombing of sharon 
rogers van was in retaliation for the vincennes mistaken 
destruction of an iranian jetliner in the persian gulf last july

mrs rogers has been in protected seclusion since the attack 
which left her uninjured rogers was in command when the vincennes 
left last week on a training mission off southern california 
the new commander of the vincennes will be capt rb lynch 
dillon said he said he didnt know what rogers next duty 
assignment would be 
however the san diego tribune citing an unidentified navy 
source said rogers would take command of a shore installation in 
the point loma area of san diego rogers is eligibile for promotion 
to rear admiral the source said

teaching job at la jolla country day school after the bombing has 
written parents of her former pupils to say she wasnt a security 
risk

officials found that no evidence exists of a direct or implied 
threat against me or the school the los angeles times and the

that finding mrs rogers wrote left her prepared to resume a 
full classroom schedule until administrators notified her last 
thursday that my services had been terminated 
one school official told the times that mrs rogers was not 
allowed to return to her fourthgrade classroom partly because 
administrators feared parents would pull their children out of the 
exclusive private school if she remained on the faculty 
school spokesman jim stewart again maintained that mrs rogers 
was not fired were just not renewing her contract he said 
wednesday no matter what kind of furor she expresses shes not

drug trafficking in his neighborhood provoked vandalism against his 
business and home physical attacks and finally authorities 
suspect his slaying 
homicide detectives have been working roundtheclock since 
lawrence of west perrine was killed monday in a spray of up to 30 
bullets in front of his grocery store lees grocery 
he was a fine man said sandra alvarez a staff member of 
perrines community action agency which had lawrence on its board 
the lack of his leadership will be felt for a long time she 
said the entire community is in a state of shock 
late last week three days before the monday killing metrodade 
police director fred taylor met with lawrence ministers and other 
concerned citizens to discuss how to squelch the rampant drug 
problem in west perrine south of miami 
you dont know how bad i feel taylor said wednesday they 
were going to assist us by identifying some of the individuals we 
just cant live in this kind of society 
detectives thursday were still looking for two men in their 
mid20s but had made no arrests they have yet to establish a 
motive but they believe lawrence was slain by professional killers 
his family and neighbors however said they think the murder was 
arranged by drug dealers 
last week lawrence filed a complaint with police about a death 
threat a friend had told lawrence that a drug dealer was 
threatening to kill him 
taylor said a detective was investigating the threat and 
officers were told to patrol the store 
we cant assign a policeman around the clock to stay with 
somebody unless we have some specifics taylor said i dont 
know what we could have done

antidrug stance visiting schools and organizing residents to fight 
against dealers

a film produced by former beatle john lennon is 
making its debut nearly two decades after it captured ann arbors 
counterculture during a huge 1971 rally to support a jailed 
activist 
screenings of the film ten for two have been held up by 
lennons own reluctance to release it during his lifetime and by 
uncertainty over who owns the rights 
the movie documents a benefit concert held at the university of 
michigans crisler arena for john sinclair a radical activist who 
was serving a 10year prison sentence for possession of two 
marijuana cigarettes he was released shortly after the december 
1971 concert having served 2 years 
lennon who faced his own problems with drug charges in the 
united states apparently was unwilling to release the film that 
features radical speakers folk protest songwriters and fellow rock 
musicians such as stevie wonder and bob seger 
this film was not released because of john lennons immigration 
problems the films director steve gephardt said the 
immigration people said if you let this out lennon might as well 
book a boat home 
ownership rights of the film which runs about 80 minutes still 
havent been settled but it will be shown anyway april 1 in royal 
oak a detroit suburb and april 2 in ann arbor 
i dont think theres anything in writing anywhere about the 
rights said david clements of mediavision a nonprofit film 
company based in hazel park thats putting on the two showings he 
said there are no current plans for other showings 
the film apparently has been seen only rarely at a handful of 
private parties and a brief showing in england 
lennon and his wife yoko ono perform three songs in the film 
including one composition lennon dedicated to sinclair and one song 
ono said she wrote for the women of ann arbor lennon played an 
acoustic guitar and ono played a drum 
others appearing in the film are radicals bobby seale and jerry 
rubin as well as wonder seger folksinger phil ochs and the rock 
group commander cody and his lost planet airmen 
clements said ono has not responded to queries about the film 
this is one of the ways to see if shell cooperate positively to 
get it the film into public hands clements said 
sinclair who now edits the detroit council of arts city arts 
quarterly said after seeing the film wednesday that it depressed 
him 
the people you see in this movie are responsible for all the 
changes we had during the 1960s and 70s he said 
lennon died in 1980 shot to death near his new york city home by 
a deranged admirer 
at the time of sinclairs arrest possession of marijuana was a 
felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison he was arrested at 
age 25 in detroit while living as a poet and revolutionary who 
founded the white panthers he received the maximum sentence 
lobbying efforts to free sinclair eventually paid off even 
before the concert was held the day before the concert the 
michigan legislature voted to reduce the penalty for possession of 
small amounts of marijuana to a misdemeanor punishable by up to a 
year in prison 
because he already had served 2 years sinclair was released 
from prison three days after the concert

colombias justice minister on thursday shrugged off 
us charges against leaders of the infamous medellin cartel saying 
the country faced a much bigger crisis than pursuing reputed cocaine 
kingpins 
for the american government drug trafficking is the biggest 
problem said guillermo plazas alcid for us it is one of many 
including terrorism and subversion 
thirty people including reputed cartel leaders were indicted in 
jacksonville on wednesday accused of smuggling 1 billion in 
cocaine into the united state through the bahamas and other points 
plazas who had no visible security guards told a luncheon 
gathering of 130 members of the colombian american chamber of 
commerce that the south american nation was doing its best to 
confront the drug issue but extraditing cartel leaders for 
prosecution in the united states was not an option 
the extradition treaty between the two countries was invalidated 
by colombias supreme court after the capture of cartel coleader 
carlos lehder rivas convicted last year and sentenced to life in 
prison for cocaine trafficking to the united states 
since then the extradition issue has been on hold asked what 
effect wednesdays sweeping drugtrafficking indictment might have 
plazas simply replied the extradition treaty cant be applied 
among those indicted was pablo escobar gaviria an alleged leader 
of the cartel accused of plotting the assassination of colombian 
justice minister rodrigo lara bonilla in 1984 and the 1986 slaying 
of drug informant barry seal 
plazas discussed for nearly an hour the reform and strengthening 
of colombias judicial system in response to drug trafficking 
guerrilla activity common delinquency and the weakening of the 
public and private sectors 
if we are not at the edge of the abyss then were getting to 
the point of almost no return plazas said this is like a 
gigantic nuclear mushroom cloud penetrating the whole society 
plazas said colombia as a producing nation should not bear sole 
reponsibility for the drug problem and insisted it was a worldwide 
issue that needed to be addressed on that scale 
colombia is not responsible for drug trafficking it is a 
victim he said we are all victims 
he referred to the united states swift reaction to tainted 
chilean fruit saying this country had the power to respond with 
equal vigor to drug trafficking 
us prosecutors said they were confident many of the 30 
defendants named in the jacksonville indictment would eventually 
face prosecution in addition to escobar the indictment charging 
bribery murder and conspiracy to import 44000 pounds of cocaine 
named alleged cartel leaders jose rodriguez gacha gonzalo mejia and 
brothers jorge and fabio ochoa vasquez 
also indicted was everette bannister an associate of bahamian 
prime minister lynden o pindling who was charged with receiving 
bribes to protect cartel smuggling operations in the island nation 
the bahamian government thursday issued a statement strongly 
denying pindling was in any way linked to drug traffickers 
the legal difficulties of bannister a private bahamian 
citizen have nothing to do with the government of the bahamas its 
institutions or its people said margaret mcdonald the bahamian 
ambassador to the united states 
others indicted in the jacksonville case were alleged pilots 
managers of cocaine operations and distributors of the drug

a federal court extended a ban thursday on us 
forest service plans to sell nearly 1 billion board feet of ancient 
timber from nine national forests in two states where the northern 
spotted owl lives 
environmentalists hailed the ruling but a timber industry lawyer 
said it could mean the loss of 11000 to 14000 jobs in washington 
and oregon 
us district court judge william s dwyer also set a trial for 
june 13 on challenges by the sierra club legal defense fund and the 
washington contract loggers association to the agencys spotted owl 
management plans 
wildlife biologists are still trying to determine whether the 
owl which is believed to inhabit only ancient forests is really 
threatened with extinction 
roughly 2400 owls are thought to inhabit the woods of the 
northwest 
its obvious that once the habitat is destroyed it cannot be 
replaced in any time frame that our generation can deal with 
dwyer said that of course demonstrates a form of irreparable 
harm 
if timber interests prevail at trial the trees in question 
have been growing for hundreds of years and they will still be 
available for logging he added 
but he said the prospects that the environmentalists would 
prevail were sufficiently strong to justify a preliminary 
injunction in effect extending by 60 days a temporary restraining 
order he issued friday 
todays injunction is not just a victory for the ancient 
forestdependent spotted owl but is also important to the increasing 
number of people in the recreation tourism retirement and fishing 
industries whose future livelihood is tied in large part to the 
ancient forests protection said wendell wood of the oregon 
natural resources council 
mark rutzick a lawyer for the loggers said the 60day 
injunction against sales would mean a oneyear delay in actually 
logging the more than 18000 affected acres of spotted owl habitat 
roughly 29 square miles 
the more than 900000 board feet of timber to be logged from 
those areas amounted to a oneyear supply of logs for 20 to 30 
mills rutzick said 
rutzick said that because of the ruling i think it is very 
possible that 20 domestic sawmills in washington and oregon will 
close within the next 12 months 
he said that would idle 3000 to to 4000 mill workers and 8000 
to 10000 others in timberdependent work ranging from shopkeepers 
to gasoline station attendants

irans interior minister on thursday 
assured ayatollah ruhollah khomeini that the children of islam 
will implement his decree and kill british writer salman rushdie 
ali akbar mohtashemi a radical and staunch follower of khomeini 
spoke at a gathering at khomeinis residence in the northern tehran 
suburb of jamaran to mark the birthday of imam mahdi the socalled 
hidden imam who shiite moslems believe will return as an islamic 
messiah 
the speech was broadcast on official tehran radio monitored in 
nicosia 
during the speech crowds in the background could be heard 
chanting you are our soul khomeini you are the idol smasher 
khomeini and slogans condemning the united states and israel 
last month khomeini urged moslems in a fatwa or religious edict 
to kill rushdie for allegedly blaspheming islam in his novel the 
satanic verses the novel includes a brothel scene in which 
prostitutes take the name of mohammeds wives and suggests that 
mohammed wrote the koran instead of receiving it from god 
the 41yearold author has been in hiding since khomeinis death 
threat feb 14 
the oppressors and global arrogance must know that the children 
of islam will carry out the sentence against those who have risen to 
battle against islam and this mercenary agent will see the 
consequences of his deed and the execution order will be carried 
out at the hands of the children of islam mohtashemi said 
britain and its 11 partners in the economic community withdrew 
their ambassadors from tehran to protest khomeinis death sentence 
iran later severed relations with britain accusing prime minister 
margaret thatcher of conspiring against islam 
eec nations agreed this week to allow each country to decide on 
its own if it wanted to send its ambassador back to iran britain 
however said it will not restore relations with iran until khomeini 
revokes the death sentence

for 1 anita bakers recent giving you the best i got 
album on an audio cassette 
for 8 a hollywood movie on video cassette titles ranging 
from casablanca to rain man 
for 33 the latest computer software such as the popular 
dbase iv program 
total bill for one of each 48 in new york as much as 783 
the items in new york would be genuine in bangkok theyre 
counterfeits the result of wholesale piracy of foreign intellectual 
property including patents copyrights and trademarks 
thailand is by no means alone outright counterfeits and various 
shades of imitations are churned out in many countries including 
the united states depriving creators and legitimate businesses of 
what the genevabased world economic form estimates is 70 billion a 
year 
but thailand lately has been in washingtons unwanted spotlight 
because other asian governments are more effectively cracking down 
on counterfeiters in indonesia hong kong singapore south korea 
and taiwan 
although japan and west european countries are also unhappy about 
violations of intellectual property rights washington has taken the 
toughest action 
in january the us government began to deny duty free benefits 
on about 165 million worth of thai imports to the united states 
thailand faces further more serious penalties under provisions of 
the us trade act if improvements arent forthcoming 
the issue is economically important to both countries 
the united states is thailands most important export market the 
thais last year had a 14 billion trade surplus on exports worth 
34 billion to the united states serious retaliatory measures by 
washington could hurt the vibrant thai economy 
the united states in turn is trying to cope with massive trade 
deficits us officials say billions of revenue dollars are lost 
yearly to the piracy of american intellectual property worldwide 
the united states is in turbulent economic times and forced to 
take stronger stands on economic issues that surprises allies like 
thailand said joseph e hart president of the american chamber 
of commerce in bangkok some thais understand this but others see 
it as america bullying an old friend 
both sides generally agree that with the exception of 
pharmaceutical products and computer software thai laws now offer 
considerable protection 
but us officials and businessmen charge that enforcement of 
these laws is poor and penalties for violations are minimal for 
example one shopowner found guilty of selling wallets and luggage 
labeled as louis vuitton in january was fined 40 
on silom road the main business thoroughfare products of 
thailands low wage highly skilled pirates are on open display in 
sidewalk stalls 
the merchandise includes often superb imitations of gucci 
handbags levi jeans and childrens clothing adorned with walt 
disneys mickey mouse and other trademark cartoon characters 
a handsomely faked rolex watch the submariner model sells 
for about 35 as compared to more than 1200 for a genuine model 
the issue has sparked debate in parliament and the press with 
opponents of protection arguing that countries such as thailand can 
ill afford to pay standard world market prices for such vital tools 
for development as computer software medicine and textbooks 
the extreme antiprotection view was mirrored in a newspaper 
article attributed to a university professor who otherwise was left 
unidentified 
mozart beethoven and tchaikovsky did not care what would 
happen to their works and did not guard them covetously and 
selfishly newton did not sell his apple theory 
but other thais are concerned about piracy 
i think the fact that we are joining the economic big leagues 
means we have to pay more attention to intellectual property 
rights parliament member surin pitsuwan said in an interview 
protection contributes to a safe and secure atmosphere for 
investment research and technology transfer 
hart of the chamber of commerce noted that big legitimate thai 
businesses recently have begun to speak up for protection 
indicating they dont want thailands booming export trade battered 
by us retaliation for the sake of a few counterfeiters 
surin stressed the need for an information campaign to get the 
public to understand the longterm benefits of offering protection 
to intellectual property 
but its difficult when the market forces are so strong he 
said how can we stop it easily when the first thing visiting us 
congressmen do after the formal agenda is to go out and buy as many 
alligatorlabel shirts as they can get

from senegal to sicily and morocco to malaysia 
throngs of agitated people have besieged us embassies and 
consulates in recent weeks not in anger but in eagerness 
people anxious to gain information about a new program that will 
grant 20000 immigrant visas into the united states in 1991 and 1992 
have kept embassy telephones ringing off the hook and snarled 
embassy entry ways 
in cairo the embassy was forced to shut down its entire 
complex and call the local police recently to deal with a crowd of 
2000 people demanding details 
in bucharest romania people began forming lines at 6 am 
and police finally organized the crowds into groups of 20 persons 
for entry into the embassy 
the rush was touched off late last month when the state 
department announced that citizens from 162 countries will be 
eligible for the special visa lottery some 20000 entrants will be 
chosen at random by computer and applicants only have until friday 
to apply 
normally immigrants have to prove they have a close relative in 
the united states or a scarce profession in order to enter the 
country said frances jones an official with the state departments 
consular affairs office 
the enthusiastic response is understandable she says because 
suddenly theres an opportunity for anyone to come to the 
united states but only if they meet the other basic requirements 
as well such as good health and no criminal contacts 
the last lottery a more restrictive program in 1986 brought 
10000 people into the country 14 million applicants lost out 
rep howard l berman dcalif the prime sponsor of the law 
that established the program said it was designed to encourage 
diversity in the nations immigration program and to give 
opportunity to those who have no family contacts to come to 
america 
immigration is good for america it is a tremendous source of 
economic innovation and growth berman said 
it appears there will be no problem attracting applicants within 
hours of the announcement us posts abroad were nearly under siege 
the marine on weekend duty in kuala lumpur was among the 
first to feel the enthusiastic response he spent his shift 
informing callers theyd have to wait until monday morning for 
information ms jones said the malaysian embassy reported 
in the first week the embassy handed out more than 3000 
information sheets about the program and handled more than 1000 
phone calls in desperation the embassy installed a fiveminute 
telephone recording with information that logged about 100 calls a 
day 
elsewhere around the world ms jones said embassies reported 
similar situations 
in dakar senegal a special telephone hotline was set up and 
the telephone has never stopped ringing the embassy reported 
in rabat morocco embassy officials put information on bulletin 
boards so people waiting in lines could obtain background about the 
program but that didnt stop others from waiting in long lines 
trying to get help with their applications in casablanca the post 
handed out 5000 information sheets in three days 
in amman jordan the switchboard operator fielded thousands of 
calls in the days after the program was announced 
in dacca bangladesh the embassy reported interest from all 
segments of society from university professors to rickshaw 
drivers along with heavy demand for information 
but the fact that no application form was available appeared to 
confuse some as well as the request that the information required 
such as name residence and address be typed in the roman 
alphabet on a sheet of paper 
more than one application arrived using roman numerals the 
embassy reported 
the embassy in dublin ireland reported an extraordinary 
response that increased the workload of an already 
hardpressed consular unit 
from the embassy in suva fiji officials reported being 
besieged with telephone calls requests for information and 
letters more than 1000 information sheets were handed out 
tongans rotumans vanuatuans and others in the south pacific 
are eager to participate in the program the embassy reported 
tonga and vanuatu are independent nations while rotuma is an island 
grouping that is part of fiji 
in contrast however the residents of northern italy and denmark 
seem uninterested in moving to the united states 
the post in copenhagen said the announcement did not attract 
media attention or evoke any great public interest 
and even though some 162 requests came to the post in palermo 
sicily no inquiries were received in the first weeks of the 
program in genoa milan and rome ms jones reported

some doctors have taken on a new partner a quest 
for profit that influences the way they treat their patients among 
those criticized for an overriding emphasis on the financial bottom 
line are some of the walkin clinics that have sprouted around the 
nation offering treatment at any hour without an appointment and 
earning revenues in the billions of dollars in this first article 
in a continuing series the business of medicine science writer 
daniel q haney and national writer fred bayles look at allegations 
that these clinics sometimes do unnecessary tests to pile up profits 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
each month doctors at many of the nations 4000 
walkin clinics receive report cards from their employers instead 
of rating the quality of their care these printouts rank the size 
of their bills 
to some health experts and doctors in the 25billionayear 
walkin industry these productivity sheets are just one example 
of the lures and prods used by many storefront clinics to raise 
profits through unnecessary charges 
doctors complain they are enticed with bonuses inspired with pep 
talks chastened with reprimands and even threatened with dismissal 
all to keep them churning out lucrative but questionable xrays 
tests and prescriptions to raise patients bills 
you could see people walk in with a simple head cold the 
doctors would order a chest xray sinus xray a few lab tests and 
pretty soon youve turned a head cold into a 150 extravaganza

justify extraneous tests if you can order a battery of tests and 
do xrays patients think theyve gotten good medicine and youve 
made more money off of them 
some say the oftenanonymous brand of medicine practiced by the 
socalled docinthebox clinics noappointmentneeded 
nomedicalhistoryknown leads to overuse of testing to reassure 
patients and protect doctors from malpractice claims 
you dont get sued for taking an xray you get sued for not 
taking it said dr robert gordon a partner in four new england 
walkin clinics 
clinic executives deny they encourage needless tests one study 
backs them up though a medical authority says the survey didnt 
check the right tests 
over the past decade walkin clinics mostly owned by individual 
doctors small local chains or hospitals have sprung up on main 
streets and in shopping malls across the country open at night and 
on weekends they recorded 50 million patient visits last year 
earning an estimated 25 billion 
we have all heard anecdotal stories about clinics that put the 
dollar sign ahead of the patient said dr john j ring chairman 
of the board of the american medical association its very 
definitely unethical to order or charge for a test or procedure that 
the physician knows is unnecessary 
clinic officials say productivity sheets and other inducements 
simply remind payroll doctors that medicine is a business as well as 
a profession 
people find it hard to believe that doctors work on a 
percentage but thats the way it works in the emergency room and 
private practices said dr stephen dickey owner of the doctors 
walkin clinic chain in the tampa fla area 
many doctors like walkin medicine because they can practice the 
way they want they side with dr martin iser who works at a 
weymouth mass branch of health stop the nations biggest chain 
with 112 clinics in boston chicago atlanta and st louis 
ive never felt any pressure by the company to order tests that 
would be considered medically unnecessary iser said 
nonetheless internal documents from health stop demonstrate the 
companys emphasis on testing levels 
one memo from the director of operations asked nurses to help 
prevent underutilization of ancillaries meaning diagnostic 
procedures it said they should obtain the necessary lab and 
xray tests before the doctors see the patients doctors reluctant 
to allow this were to be reported 
another memo which began by noting that average revenue per 
patient had dropped urged nursing supervisors to keep patient 
waiting time to a minimum to give patients followup appointments 
and to be more aggressive assisting doctors with billings 
offer suggestions regarding routine medical protocols for lab 
and xray utilization at health stop it said 
health stop doctors are paid about 35 an hour or 21 percent of 
their gross charges whichever is higher many clinics offer doctors 
a percentage of everything they bring in 
at health stop and doctors walkin the doctors are sent monthly 
computer printouts ranking them according to their average fees per 
patient 
the monthly report shows that if you wanted to make more money 
you could there are definitely some doctors who order more tests 
because of it said dr michelle maffeo a bostonarea health stop 
physician who also said she herself was never pressured 
there is always in the back of your mind the realization that 
the more tests you order the more finances you can generate for 
yourself said dr andrew garlisi of tampa a former doctors 
walkin physician it wasnt the primary motivating factor but as 
human beings its hard to ignore 
dickey owner of doctors walkin denied the firm encouraged 
physicians to run up the bill i want them to treat patients 
appropriately he said we are just trying to practice basic 
medicine to take care of sick people in a humane way 
a productivity sheet from doctors walkin showed the topranked 
physician charged 58 per patient the lastplace doctor had average 
charges of 31 these sheets also showed how many patients the 
doctors saw per hour and the total value of medicines their patients 
bought at the clinic 
a health stop monthly report from 1987 showed the average number 
of xrays tests and procedures per patient for each doctor the 
doctors total bills ranged on average from 76 to 44 the chains 
average was 62 
the physician with the lowest charges was dr thomas mcgrath one 
of two health stop doctors who assert they were fired in 1987 for 
doing too few tests and xrays neither doctor had written proof of 
this 
mcgrath now a physician at the university of connecticut student 
infirmary said he rarely used diagnostic machines 
if somebody came in with a sore throat they didnt need a 
blood count they health stop officials wanted routine tests done 
for routine problems he said 
the other dismissed doctor was randall s bock who now operates 
his own walkin clinic in revere mass he said he resisted ordering 
tests when his stethoscope and a physical exam provided all the 
information he needed

while owners of walkin medical chains deny pumping up patient 
charges some former employees assert they were pressured and 
enticed to inflate the bills 
among the most frequently cited examples 
some chains encourage doctors to routinely perform simple 
diagnostic tests such as strep screens on all people with sore 
throats when there is little indication patients have diseases they 
are being tested for the tests typically cost about 20 
chest xrays to check for pneumonia are routinely given to 
people with coughs and bronchitis even though most have simple 
colds costs vary across the country but are often in the 50 range 
many chains give doctors bonuses for amassing big patient 
bills one doctor said his chain gave physicians 40 percent of every 
bill that went over 60 
doctors are often encouraged to prescribe antibiotics to 
patients who dont need them so customers will feel they have 
gotten their moneys worth when the clinics sell the drugs they 
also prescribe this of course further raises profits at one 
walkin chain one of every four patients bought medicines and paid 
an average of 860 per prescription

polaroid outfoxed shamrock perelman took 
coleman pennwalt escaped centaur salomon brothers and kelly 
cornered envirodyne black amp decker rescued emhart and bass spooked 
time 
the spree of corporate takeover maneuvering sounded like a 
financial clone of college basketballs march madness and was about 
the only thing that captivated wall streets attention this past 
week besides brokers bets on the nationally televised ncaa 
tournament 
one notable element of the latest merger deals was their 
staccato pace three were announced the same day resurrecting 
memories of the frenzy of huge deals that had become almost routine 
in the past few years but until now seemed to have waned in 
1989 
stock speculators and others who follow buyouts said the rash of 
announcements was more than coincidence 
for one thing more than five months have elapsed since the 
granddaddy 2453 billion rjr nabisco inc takeover brawl which 
chilled many other deals rumored and real 
that megadeal raised fears that congress would crack down on one 
of investment bankings most lucrative businesses partly because 
of the enormous amount of debt used to finance many mergers and 
because of questions over how it could be repaid 
the rjr deal now has been digested with little outwardly 
dramatic impact in addition washington lawmakers appear unwilling 
or unable to more tightly regulate or constrict takeovers 
moreover rising interest rates appear to be playing a role by 
convincing some takeover investors to make their move now before 
the cost of credit gets too expensive 
but perhaps the most significant takeover news of the week was 
the evident success of an antitakeover strategy 
instant camera giant polaroid corp hounded for months by the 
shamrock holdings inc investment concern won a court battle 
upholding the legitimacy of a stock repurchase that seemed to 
squelch shamrocks 32 billion bid shamrock declined to admit 
defeat but planned to sell its polaroid stock 
in another successful escape chemical concern pennwalt corp 
embraced a friendly 105 billion acquisition by frances societe 
nationale elf aquitaine foiling an unwanted takeover by the 
centaur partners investment concern 
centaur dropped its bid but still walks away with big profits a 
demonstration that even in failure in the takeover business theres 
success it paid about 60ashare for a stake in pennwalt and can 
sell out to elf aquitaine for 132 a share 
a third corporate rescue concerned emhart corp target of an 
unwanted takeover threat from the investment partnership topper 
lp toolmaker black amp decker corp agreed to buy emhart for 28 
billion but topper sought to stop the deal in court 
elsewhere billionaire takeover investor ronald perelman decided 
to add camping gear to his collection of perfume licorice extract 
and savings and loan businesses wichita kanbased coleman co 
accepted a 545 million buyout offer from macandrews amp forbes 
holdings inc which is controlled by perelman and spurned a rival 
managementled offer 
another savvy takeover strategist donald kelly teamed with 
salomon inc to acquire plastics maker envirodyne industries inc 
for 736 million it marked kellys first takeover foray since he 
helped investment concern kohlberg kravis roberts amp co acquire 
beatrice cos three years ago 
in the rumor realm word leaked that billionaire investor robert 
bass had purchased stock in time inc with the possible aim of 
buying the publishing giant stock in time which earlier this 
month agreed to merge with warner communications partly as an 
antitakeover move soared on the bass story 
finally one friendly deal turned sour 
manhattan developer donald trump demanded at least a third off 
the 365 million price he had agreed to pay for the eastern 
airlines shuttle because the carrier has since been crippled by a 
strike and has sought refuge in bankruptcy court in response 
eastern made the shuttle available to all bidders 
in other business and economic news this past week 
a jury convicted an assistant bond trader at drexel burnham 
lambert inc of perjury and other charges making her the first 
employee of the securities firm to be found guilty as a result of a 
massive federal fraud inquiry another jury deadlocked in 
deliberating stock manipulation charges against gaf corp and a top 
company officer resulting in the second mistrial in that case 
one week after news about inflation frightened the financial 
markets new evidence emerged that the economy is slowing the 
government said durable goods orders fell in february the second 
straight monthly drop consumer prices rose only moderately and 
more americans diverted their income into savings the big three 
automakers meanwhile reported soft sales for midmarch 
the house passed a minimum wage bill raising the prospect of a 
110anhour rise in compensation for the nations lowest paid 
workers the passage came during the same week a house panel 
released report that showed a widening gap between rich and poor 
from 1973 through 1987

embattled eastern airlines has been granted its 
request for a courtappointed examiner in its bankruptcy 
proceedings but the airline appears to be getting a more powerful 
examiner than it wanted 
in a surprising ruling thursday us bankruptcy court judge 
burton lifland said he would appoint an examiner with unusually 
broad powers to oversee strikebound eastern during its chapter 11 
reorganization 
lifland granted easterns request that an examiner be appointed 
to review all transactions between miamibased eastern and 
affiliated airlines but he decided to give the examiner a broader 
mandate than requested by the airline saying it was in the publics 
interest to do so 
among other things the asyet unnamed examiner would mediate 
differences among eastern employees creditors and other parties to 
achieve a consensus on a bankruptcy reorganization plan lifland 
said he described that role as banging heads together by an 
independent entity 
the judge also refused a union request to order eastern to 
release about 24 million in prestrike paychecks and benefits 
frozen when the airline sought protection from creditors on march 9 
five days after the beginning of a strike by its machinists union 
easterns pilots and flight attendants have refused to cross the 
machininists picket lines 
the unions have asked the bankruptcy court to appoint a trustee 
who actually would run the airline during its reorganization 
bumping texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo from that function 
an april 7 hearing has been scheduled on the trustee request but 
an attorney for the air line pilots association indicated the union 
might be willing to drop the request because the powers of the new 
examiner would be so sweeping 
its rather an extraordinary appointment bruce simon who 
represented alpa during thursdays hearing told reporters outside 
the courtroom he described the new examiner to be appointed by the 
judge as a supermediator and a superexaminer 
simon said he would be prepared to examine the trustee issue with 
harvey miller easterns lead bankruptcy attorney well look at 
the order well make a judgment he said 
another participant in the hearing who asked not to be 
identified also said the scope of the new examiners mandate was 
virtually unprecedented in a bankruptcy proceeding 
were extremely pleased with the ruling today eastern 
president phil bakes said in an interview we wish we had thought 
of it he said referring to the judges broadening of the 
examiners functions 
eastern has said it made the request for an examiner to dispel 
arguments by its unions that transactions between eastern its 
parent texas air and its affiliiated acarrier continental airlines 
were not made in the companys best interests 
easterns unions claim texas air has been stripping the airline 
of its assets while trying to bolster continental 
what im hearing is a reflection of parochial interests what 
im not hearing is the public interest here lifland told miller 
and simon after their presentations in front of a packed courtroom 
the sooner we get into the gut issues here the better off we 
are 
regarding the request to free the paychecks lifland said such a 
move would be of no demonstrable benefit to easterns estate and 
would consume about 10 percent of the companys cash on hand 
simon acknowledged that liflands decision on the checks was a 
setback to easterns employees

car and light truck sales rose 5 percent in 
midmarch but an industry analyst said the improvement doesnt 
indicate a turnaround in a slow sales start for 1989 
the eight usbased auto companies reported thursday that 
vehicles they made sold at an average daily rate of 39225 during 
the march 1120 period this year compared with a 37344perday 
rate during the same time last year 
but that didnt impress analyst ron glantz of montgomery 
securities inc of san francisco 
its very disappointing when you consider that the industry 
made the incentives more generous he said 
during early march the big three automakers which accounted for 
903 percent of all the cars sold by the eight companies during the 
second 10day selling period of the month boosted or extended 
existing incentives 
in midmarch last year similar incentives were in place 
what i think is happening is that consumers are reacting to 
increased interest rates not automobile rates though glantz 
said adding that holders of adjustable rate mortgages may have 
recently received notice of higher payments because of increases in 
lending rates nationwide 
another analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york 
was more bullish on the industry 
i think a lot of people have been shopping just kind of 
looking for what to buy brady said why buy when theres a 
chance of snow or rotten weather get past easter sunday and you 
should see sales smooth out at a higher level 
all youre seeing is that the market is being jerked back and 
forth by incentives or lack thereof he said 
midmarch sales were bolstered by light trucks which were 
leaving dealer lots in numbers 89 percent higher than last year 
car sales went up 28 percent compared with the same period last 
year 
automakers have been looking for a sales resurgence in march and 
april after a sluggish start early this year typically us 
consumers head to automobile showrooms during the early spring to 
get ready for summertime driving 
for the year cars and light trucks are selling at a pace 54 
percent behind last years tempo the automakers sold an average of 
34475 vehicles a day through march 20 this year compared with a 
daily rate of 36451 during the same period last year 
car sales were off 82 percent and truck sales were 03 percent 
lower so far this year than they were during the jan 1march 20 
period last year 
chrysler corp said it sold 162 percent fewer cars during 
midmarch this year compared with last year with sales averaging 
3228 a day this year compared with a 3850 caraday clip last 
year 
ford motor cos midmarch car sales were up 61 percent this 
year and general motors corps were 02 percent ahead of last 
years sales rate 
yeartodate car sales for each of the big three were running 
behind last years pace with chrysler down 207 percent gm 127 
percent lower and ford off 21 percent 
it was a different story for the big three on the truck side as 
ford showed a 106 percent increase chrysler was up 67 percent and 
gms truck sales were 55 percent higher in midmarch this year 
compared with the same period last year

major chocolate companies moving into the 
easter specialty candy market are getting a sweet reward in the form 
of higher sales 
the national confectioners association is projecting a 2 percent 
increase in sales of easter chocolate and candy this year up to 
815 million 
seasonal chocolates are really big business said joan 
steuer president of chocolate marketing of los angeles there are 
predictions that the market will top out how much more chocolate 
can people take but i believe that theres a world of 
opportunity 
while seasonal confections were once supplied mostly by specialty 
makers of chocolate bunnies and marshmallow eggs candy giants such 
as hershey foods corp and mampmmars are trying to get a bigger bite 
of the profitable easter candy market with holiday versions of their 
regular products 
hershey has packaged its chocolate kisses in easter and 
christmas colors for years its recent acquisition of cadburys 
which makes several popular chocolate easter egg items will 
increase its seasonal sales considerably company spokesman carl 
andrews said 
the company found that theres quite a market for special 
packaging for existing products said analyst r bentley offutt of 
offutt securities inc in maryland 
i cant tell you exactly what the incremental gain in sales has 
been but i do think it has surpassed their expectations by a large 
margin he said 
mars which together with hershey controls most of the chocolate 
market introduced red and green mampm type candies at christmas three 
years ago and last year added pastel versions at easter 
the sales results were very very successful said mars 
spokesman hans fiuczynski the seasonal market certainly has been 
growing 
analysts and industry specialists said the chocolate giants 
foray into the holiday market is not hurting the smaller specialty 
confectioners 
the big guys are starting to pay attention to the season 
said jan kitt associate publisher of the confection magazine based 
in orlando fla 
its healthy for the market and provides a greater choice but 
i dont believe its taking sales away from the traditional sellers 
its expanded the market 
the specialty producers have been expanding their sales at the 
same time as the mass marketers ms steuer said 
a lot of the importers are going to mass marketing outlets 
she said the mass companies are going upscale and the upscale 
companies are going into mass marketing 
there is plenty of room for both in the easter market ms steuer 
said 
its really a matter of incremental business and expanding the 
market she said i dont think anyone is pushing anybody out 
were going back to more traditional thinking in terms of 
holidays said dick oconnell president of the chocolate 
manufacturers association based in mclean va more attention is 
being paid to chocolate bunnies and fancy easter eggs and jelly 
beans all the things that go with easter 
easters been doing very well

when a delaware supreme court removed all obstacles 
to polaroid corps buyback of 16 million shares of its common 
stock it apparently dealt a fatal blow to shamrock holdings incs 
8monthold takeover attempt 
the court on thursday rejected shamrocks request for an 
extension of a oneweek injunction against the buyback plan an 
effort by the instant camera giant to stymie shamrocks 32 billion 
takeover bid 
in response shamrock and its affiliates announced plans to 
tender to polaroid all 496 million polaroid shares purchased during 
the takeover effort 
but michael sitrick spokesman for the burbank califbased 
company refused to say whether shamrock would abandon its bid for 
polaroid 
earlier this week another shamrock spokesman said the company 
would not give up its battle for polaroid even if the court ruled in 
favor of the buyback 
it would seem theyre on the verge of giving up said eugene 
glazer an analyst with dean witter reynolds in new york 
its somewhat of a fatal shot almost a shot right to the head 
of shamrock said alex henderson an analyst with prudentialbache 
securities in new york their shamrocks sellback plan is 
symbolically the same thing as throwing in the towel 
however henderson said shamrock is unlikely to go away and 
may still stage a proxy fight although as a result of the buyback 
plan and individual stock ownership polaroid will own enough shares 
to stop shamrock 
shamrock controlled by the family of roy e disney nephew of 
the late walt disney planned to wage a proxy fight for control of 
polaroids board of directors at its asyet unscheduled annual 
meeting 
they could continue to pursue a bid said glazer but with 
those defenses seeming so strong and supported by the delaware 
courts their ability to get 50 percent of the shares to vote for 
them seems very remote 
glazer said the courts endorsement of polaroids actions to ward 
off a takeover could send a signal to other delawarebased companies 
that defensive strategies will be backed 
polaroid has been resisting shamrocks takeover attempt since 
july when the company made a friendly but unsolicited offer of 40 
a share in january shamrock increased the bid to 45 
polaroid based in cambridge has approximately 11000 employees 
worldwide and sells instant film packs cameras videotapes and 
other products

top executives of international business machines 
corp tried to allay fears of a high technology slowdown and its 
impact on the economy concerns raised when earnings forecasts were 
cut for big blue and digital equipment corp the nations 
largest computer makers 
during a meeting of securities analysts thursday in boston the 
men who run ibm predicted strong worldwide growth in demand for 
computers despite a cooling domestic market 
they promised to deliver kinder gentler computers in the 
short term predicting it would be easier for individuals and more 
efficient for companies to use 
in the long term they said businesses would find more and more 
uses for computers demanding ever larger amounts of memory capacity 
for paperless offices in which products would be designed 
entirely on computers 
far less than 2 percent of the data that mankind has generated 
is coded and stored in any kind of a computer format so there is 
still tremendous potential for growth said carl conti an ibm 
senior vice president 
ibm chairman and chief executive officer john f akers predicted 
the computer industry would continue to grow at two to three times 
the rate of the worlds economy as a whole 
but akers said in an interview after his speech to the 150 
analysts that the us budget deficit is a wild card that could 
change ibms hand 
our financial position as a country is way out of balance he 
said its either going to come into balance or theres going 
to continue to be a lot of economic fragility 
the stock prices of ibm and its chief competitor digital 
equipment plummeted during the past week when the companies 
signaled their earnings in the current quarter would fall below many 
analysts estimates 
ibm the industry leader and the most highly capitalized company 
in the nation has blamed its lower earnings forecast on a microchip 
manufacturing problem that has slowed delivery of its 
topoftheline mainframe 3090s computers 
production of the chips which pack up to 2300 memory circuits 
on a fingernailsized slice of silicon has proved more difficult 
than the company expected only 2 or 3 of every 10 chips it turns 
out are free of flaws and can be used 
digital the second largest computer maker said it has seen a 
softening of demand for computers in the united states at the low 
end of the market more and more powerful personal computers and 
workstations have cut into sales of the larger and more expensive 
minicomputers and mainframes 
at the meeting thursday ibm executives said they have solved the 
chip problem and will catch up with the backlog in orders by the end 
of the year they denied that the problem has hurt demand for the 
mainframes 
because of the manufacturing delays wall street analysts 
forecast ibm will earn 1025 to 1075 a share this year down from 
previous estimates of 11 to 1125 per share 
several analysts questioned the ibm executives closely about the 
companys continuing reliance on sales of computer hardware for 
approximately 70 percent of its revenue while software and computer 
services are the fastest growing segments of the market 
george conrades a senior vice president said ibm realized it 
needed to emphasize software development and would begin wrapping 
our hardware like a burrito in software and support services 
while the ibm executives declined to make specific estimates for 
sales or earnings growth this year they said they expected rapid 
increases in the far east slower growth in europe and minor growth

new york stock exchange officials say they may 
look at a 24hour electronic stocktrading system being developed 
by a competitor but they appear to be in no hurry to link up with 
it 
were not sure theres interest in that right now said 
spokesman richard torrenzano were not sure that theres nough 
demand to make the new york stock exchange go to 24hour trading 
nevertheless chicago board options exchange president charles 
henry indicated the new york stock exchange may be invited join the 
computerized ordermatching network for stocks and stock options 
being developed by the options exchange the cincinnati stock 
exchange and londonbased reuters holdings plc 
we certainly have not discussed excluding other exchanges 
henry said thursday in a telephone interview after the project was 
announced 
the network would be similar to electronic trading systems being 
developed by chicagos futures exchanges theoretically giving 
investors around the world 24hour access to international financial 
markets 
but torrenzano said the demand for roundtheclock stock trading 
is probably limited to only about 100 worldclass stocks such as 
ibm and general motors some of which are already accessible 24 
hours a day because they are listed on overseas exchanges as well on 
us boards 
officials said they could not estimate a startup date for the 
system which will require approval from the securities and exchange 
commission 
the chicago board options exchange owns the majority of 
memberships on the cincinnati stock exchange which lists the 300 
largestvolume issues traded on the new york stock exchange 
the cincinnati exchange is the only fully computerized securities 
market in the united states using a computer to match buy and sell 
orders it averaged 1 million trades per day last year compared with 
about 170 million trades per day on the new york stock exchange by 
far the nations largest securities market 
henry said the decision to develop an electronic trading system 
was a reaction to the increasingly international nature of investing 
take an ibm he said its traded by investors in europe 
in tokyo in singapore in the united states 
were seeing globalization enter into the stock and securities 
markets as it has in other markets henry said we want to be at 
the forefront by opening up access to our marketplace 
the chicago board options exchange is the worlds largest market 
for stock options and stockindex options a stock option is a right 
to buy or sell 100 shares of a given stock at a specified price by a 
future date stockindex options involve baskets of stocks such as 
those represented by the standard amp poors 100 and 500 indexes 
investors use stock options to reduce their risks in the stock 
market or to speculate on price movements 
londonbased reuters a leading vendor of financial information 
would supply the technology for the system through its instinet 
corp subsidiary 
reuters and the chicago mercantile exchange are developing a 
similar system called globex for 24hour trading of futures 
contracts a future is a binding contract to buy or sell a commodity 
or financial instrument at a specified price on a future date 
globex is expected to become operational this fall as is aurora 
a competing system being developed by the chicago board of trade 
the worlds largest futures market 
globex already has received commitments from three other futures 
exchanges the new york mercantile exchange the sydney futures 
exchange of australia and the french futures exchange known as 
matif to offer some of their products for trading on the system

a colorado court is trying to determine whether a 
mortar additive made by michiganbased dow chemical co caused walls 
to crumble 
a bank hospitals and now a hotel in denver are among dozens of 
plaintiffs that have sought damages in lawsuits spanning the last 
decade stemming from use of the additive sarabond they claim the 
substance corrodes metal supports letting bricks fall or entire 
walls sag 
but dow says brickwork can deteriorate for many reasons and 
argues that its corporate wealth 1668 billion in 1988 revenue 
makes the midlandbased chemical giant an easy deep pockets 
target for lawsuits 
trial opened monday in a suit brought by the executive tower inn 
in denver the hotel is seeking 190 million in actual and punitive 
damages from dow 
the suit is one of 28 pending cases involving sarabond which was 
sold by dow from 1965 to 1976 and used in structures ranging from 
hospitals to the eisenhower memorial tunnel in the rocky mountains 
west of denver additional suits have been settled out of court 
we do remain convinced that sarabond is not deficient we are 
back in the courtroom this week defending our position dow 
spokeswoman terri mcneill said 
two previous suits have gone to trial and juries found dow liable 
in both although one is under appeal 
a 1979 complaint by central national bank in cleveland resulted 
in a 28 million damage award and later was settled for 13 million 
a johnson circuit court jury in franklin ind on may 3 1988 
awarded st vincents hospital in indianapolis 17 million in 
actual damages and 5 million in punitive damages that judgment is 
being appealed 
meanwhile new court actions continue to crop up 
bronson methodist hospital in kalamazoo filed suit last month 
claiming sarabondmortared brickwork on a serviceelevator tower 
built in the early 1970s was deteriorating bronson is asking 
damages in excess of 10000 
attorney bill dorigan of minneapolis who represents the 
executive tower inn bronson hospital and other sarabond plaintiffs 
has said the mortar additive releases chloride similar to road 
deicing salt 
metal supports tying the mortared brickwork to the building walls 
or frame corrode bricks or sections of wall crack and loosen and 
in some cases bricks have fallen dorigan said 
he said he knew of no resulting injuries and structural damage 
to buildings has not been involved 
dow sold the sarabond business in 1976 to masonry systems 
international and in the early 1980s the product ceased to be 
marketed mcneill said dow sold the business because sarabond was 
unprofitable 
dow maintains the mortar additive did not cause the problems that 
led to the lawsuits mcneill said 
the company used sarabond in its own midland headquarters 
buildings as recently as 1981 with no problems she said 
dorigan disputed that in an interview prior to the executive 
tower inn trial he said he visited the dow headquarters twice 
after obtaining court orders in two previous lawsuits and found 
rusted metal and cracked bricks both times 
dorigan said more than 20 other suits have been filed that never 
came to trial dow wouldnt comment on the number of suits settled 
or the total amount of the settlements mcneill said 
there have been settlements over the years she said they 
are not an admission of liability where we can resolve suits 
amicably we do our best to accomplish that

a federal appeals court in manhattan has ruled 
that the us environmental protection agency has to announce what 
its going to do about changing air quality standards even if its 
nothing 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in a 2to1 decision has 
ruled that federal district courts can compel the epa to make some 
formal decision on whether or not to revise air quality standards 
the decision reversed a lower court ruling that threw out a 
lawsuit by seven states and four environmental groups against the 
epa and its administrator lee m thomas 
filed in december 1985 the lawsuit sought to compel thomas to 
update the epas ambient air quality standards for sulphur oxides 
which cause acid rain 
those sulphur oxide standards which havent been revised since 
the early 1970s are used to set legal emission levels for 
pollutants the epa identifies as hazardous 
while the epa has revised the criteria for determining air 
quality standards it has taken no public action on the standards 
themselves neither revising the existing standards nor formally 
declining to revise them noted the 2nd circuit opinion written by 
circuit judge ralph k winter 
judge ellsworth a van graafeiland concurred but judge j daniel 
mahoney dissented the ruling was made wednesday and announced 
thursday 
the lawsuit was brought by new york vermont connecticut new 
hampshire massachusetts rhode island and minnesota as well as the 
environmental defense fund the natural resources council the 
sierra club and the national parks and conservation association 
last april us district judge david n edelstein ruled that for 
technical reasons he did not have the authority to consider the 
lawsuit 
but the appeals court said that interpretation would leave a 
bureaucratic twilight zone in which epa action or inaction would 
not be subject to court review 
the 2nd circuit panel ruled that while its up to thomas to 
decide what specific changes to make in the air quality standards 
the epa administrator has a duty to make some formal decision on 
the need to update national air standards 
the 2nd circuit noted that shortly after edelsteins decision 
the epa announced that it was premature and unwise to change air 
quality standards to address the acid rain problem 
the appeals court said edelstein should issue an order directing 
the epa to continue its public decision making process 
this victory could not have come at a better time said new 
york attorney general robert abrams in a statement issued by his 
office it shows that the epa has had the power and the duty to 
act against acid rain all along but that it has refused leading to 
needless destruction of forests and waters throughout the 
northeast 
abrams added if the bush administration accepts this 
decision without further appeal and updates the standards it will 
advance the cause of acid rain reduction 
massachusetts first assistant attorney general gerald fitzgerald 
said in a statement the epa for too long has taken a noaction 
approach to air pollution and acid rain it is unfortunate that it 
takes litigation and a court judgement to force epa to face up to 
its responsibilities under the clean air act now that the court has 
ruled we trust epa will stop pondering the acid rain problem and do 
something about it

centaur partners has finally admitted defeat 
in its monthslong wrangle to take over pennwalt corp leaving the 
principal investors richer but also saying they feel disappointed 
centaur dropped its 110pershare bid thursday three days after 
pennwalt announced a 132pershare offer from the french 
governmentcontrolled oil and chemical concern societe nationale elf 
aquitaine 
based on the number of pennwalts outstanding shares 8 million 
elf aquitaines offer amounts to more than 1 billion 
centaurs announcement that it would end its takeover bid 
coincided with elf aquitaines formal commencement of the offer 
three days after pennwalts board of directors voted unanimously to 
accept the elf aquitaine deal 
we are realistic enough to know when to stop fighting said 
abbey j butler one of the main centaur investors 
we wanted to buy the company said melvyn j estrin butlers 
partner but at this point the way we see it this price is 
higher than we were prepared to go we are happy with it it 
maximizes the value to all shareholders 
it is estimated that centaur which owns about 13 percent of 
pennwalts stock stands to make 60 million the group began buying 
stock in the chemical company in june when the price was 65 a 
share 
pennwalts chairman edwin e tuttle maintained throughout the 
takeover bid that centaur never actually wanted to acquire the 
company but merely wanted to drive up the stock prices 
pennwalts managers proved to be formidable opponents butler 
said 
i think mr tuttle demonstrated his determination to oppose us 
and he preferred fighting rather than sitting down and talking he 
said 
butler and estrin said they plan to make a bid for another 
company 
we will look to find other situations that we can buy that are 
substantially undervalued he said 
pennwalt had fought centaur since the investment group first made 
its plans known last june 
pennwalt went to court to stop centaur from calling a 
shareholders meeting where the investment group hoped to replace 
the directors paving the way for the takeover bid to succeed 
pennwalts stock closed at 13025 thursday in consolidated 
trading on the new york stock exchange the stocks price jumped 
1312 about 11 percent to 13012 when elf aquitaines offer 
was made public monday

upjohn co unaware of any efforts to 
accumulate stock or gain control nevertheless has strengthened 
existing antitakeover measures chairman theodore cooper says 
the pharmaceutical companys board of directors adopted three 
changes to a shareholders rights policy adopted in 1986 
the amendments are intended to reflect developments in case law 
and make the plan a more effective deterrent to the abusive takeover 
tactics that can be used to deprive shareholders of the full value 
of their investment cooper said thursday 
shareholders now can acquire stock at halfprice if any party 
acquires 20 percent of upjohns outstanding shares previously an 
acquirer also had to take other action such as a merger or sale of 
assets 
the market value of upjohns outstanding stock totals about 6 
billion meaning an investment of more than 1 billion would be 
needed to gain a 20 percent stake 
making it easier for current shareholders to obtain additional 
stock in the event of a takeover bid would increase the number of 
shares outstanding diluting a wouldbe acquirers stake spokesman 
rd larue said 
another amendment would let the board accept upjohn shares rather 
than cash for such transactions extending the plan to stockholders 
lacking ready cash 
a third change would let the board carry out the transactions for 
up to 30 days after anyone obtained 20 percent or more of the 
companys stock rather than only prior to that time 
upjohn a worldwide manufacturer and marketer of human and animal 
health care products and services had 1988 revenue of 275 billion

a company that admitted selling defective heart 
pacemakers has agreed to pay 5 million to settle claims that it 
defrauded the government the justice department says 
the cordis corp in miami is satisfied with the agreement said 
chick mcdowell vice president for corporate relations who noted 
that the company already has spent 4 million in legal fees and 
associated costs 
what we did is we paid 1 million yesterday with the signing 
and the balance of 4 million will be paid in three equal annual 
installments at 7 percent interest mcdowell said thursday 
the agreement announced thursday by the justice department was 
simply to reimburse the government for pacemakers purchased directly 
by the veterans administration or that were subject to reimbursement 
through medicare and medicaid programs it would not provide 
payments to anyone who had a faulty pacemaker implanted or the 
survivors of anyone who died because of it said justice spokeswoman 
amy brown 
the food and drug administration has alleged that the devices 
could stop without warning and said that between december 1983 and 
october 1985 the company shipped 2200 pacemakers subject to 
potential failure and 6000 batteries even though it knew they were 
subject to corrosion 
the settlement did not indicate how many pacemakers the 
reimbursement covered 
mcdowell said there havent been any suits brought by those 
people who bought the pacemakers themselves or who had them 
implanted by the va 
ms brown said the settlement would not preclude such individuals 
from suing the company 
john r bolton assistant attorney general in charge of the 
departments civil division said the settlement is believed to be 
one of the largest medicare recoveries ever 
the outofcourt settlemet of civil claims is unconnected with 
criminal charges against cordis which sold off its pacemaker 
business two years ago to telectronics an australian medical device 
manufacturer 
in the criminal case us district judge stanley marcus in miami 
last october rejected a pleabargain arrangement between cordis and 
federal prosecutors under which the company would have pleaded 
guilty to 23 counts of selling defective pacemakers and would have 
paid 123000 in criminal fines and 141000 in costs the judge 
said the payment was too low 
a new agreement is to be presented next week to marcus mcdowell 
said under that plan cordis would plead guilty to 12 felony and 13 
misdemeanor counts and pay the government more than 700000 in 
fines and costs of the investigation he said 
the agreement would not affect a separate indictment of four 
former cordis officers who have all pleaded innocent 
the company reported net losses of 561 million in 1987 but 
underwent a major restructuring since selling the pacemaker 
operation net earnings for 1988 totaled 24 million on sales of 
132 million

five million japanese women have entered the work 
force in the past 13 years but many suffer from sex discrimination 
despite government efforts to protect them an official report said 
today 
prime minister noboru takeshitas office said the number of women 
in the work force has increased from 12 million in 1975 to 17 
million in 1988 roughly 40 percent of the total work force 
however an official for the takeshitas office kiyoko fujii 
said few women get responsible positions in management or as 
specialists despite japans 1981 equal opportunity employment law 
for example only 29 women are representatives in the 764member 
parliament she said 
more than 63 percent of all working women who responded to a 
government survey in 1987 complained of unequal treatment said a 
report by takeshitas office 
although many private companies have begun providing equal 
opportunities for female jobseekers women face discrimination in 
promotions pay and working conditions ms fujii said 
she also charged that general position examinations for 
promotions may discriminate against women the test does not violate 
the 1981 law because it involves promotion not hiring she said 
lack of child care facilities at work sites is also a big 
obstacle for mothers who want to keep working many companies 
dont allow mothers to bring their children to work she said 
in a 30minute video at a government news conference today 
several career women with responsible positions were introduced 
japanese society is still ruled by men and the roles of each 
sex are stubbornly fixed more women should take part in 
decisionmaking processes in society especially in politics to 
share responsibilities equally with men feminist yoko nuita said

a suspended navy official faces up to 25 
years in prison for bribery in the pentagon purchasing scandal and 
a company that profited from his inside information will pay more 
than 43 million in fines 
stuart e berlin admitted on thursday that he accepted a bribe to 
provide inside information on a 24 million contract eventually 
awarded to teledyne electronics of newbury park calif a division 
of teledyne industries inc 
teledyne industries inc pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud 
the united states and two counts of making false statements to the 
government and agreed to pay 15 million in penalties 2 million 
in civil claims and 786000 to reimburse the government for the 
cost of the investigation 
in addition teledyne agreed to give up its negotiated 135 
percent profit on the contract that could result in a savings to the 
government of 4 million over the next three years the justice 
department said 
berlin 51 pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the united 
states to commit bribery wire fraud and filing false statements 
as well as receiving a bribe as a government official and wire fraud 
us district judge claude hylton set sentencing for june 2 when 
berlin could face up to 25 years in prison and fines of up to 
750000 berlin made no comment as he left the courtroom 
as part of his plea agreement berlin also will cooperate with 
prosecutors in the continuing ill wind investigation including 
the trial of his former codefendants in the indictment 
those defendants in the trial scheduled to begin april 3 are 
defense consultants fred h lackner and william l parkin as well 
as three teledyne officials george h kaub eugene r sullivan and 
dale schnittjer parkin was hospitalized last friday after 
reportedly taking an overdose of pills 
with thursdays action the more than 2yearold investigation 
has resulted in a dozen guilty pleas that have been publicly 
revealed said assistant us attorney joseph j aronica 
he refused to say whether other people or companies under 
investigation already have agreed to plead guilty 
aronica also would not disclose how extensively berlins 
testimony might be used against other defendants saying only the 
total investigation is moving along very quickly 
as part of the plea agreements prosecutors dismissed counts of 
bribery and wire fraud against berlin and teledyne racketeering 
charges had been dropped at an earlier court hearing 
teledyne said in a statement that it decided to enter the plea 
arrangement primarily due to the recognition that a former 
employee michael savaides had entered into a corrupt and illegal 
arrangement with william parkin a consultant to teledyne 
electronics and fred lackner with whom the company had no 
relationship 
their purpose was to subvert the lawful operation of the 
governments procurement process the company said savaides has 
pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing 
berlin had been a supervisory electronics engineer and branch 
head of the ship systems engineering section at the space and naval 
warfare systems command in arlington va when the actions occurred 
the justice department said berlin received about 1000 every 
few months from parkin and lackner in exchange for giving them 
classified documents the indictment said the consultants were 
getting their information from berlin 
he was reassigned to a nonprocurement job in june 1988 when the 
investigation became public and he was suspended without pay 
shortly after he was indicted in january 
the navy will review his plea agreement before deciding on 
berlins employment status said lt bruce cole a navy spokesman 
the pentagon meanwhile is reevaluating its suspension in 
january of teledyne electronics from new contracts but had made no 
decision thursday 
the 24 million contract at issue was for handheld electronic 
testing equipment that checks whether radar transponders are working 
before military airplanes are allowed to fly the mark 12 iff 
transponder test set checks the equipment that helps identify 
whether a plane flying nearby is a friend or foe 
the army navy and air force are using the equipment and the 
navy purchased the sets under a master air force contract since 
july 1987 when teledyne was awarded the contract the navy has 
received 105 of the sets and plans to buy 43 more this year 
the pentagons suspension of teledyne electronics did not affect 
the contract already awarded

the american suzuki motor corp has settled 
lawsuits brought by seven states by agreeing to publicize that its 
samurai model may roll over in sharp turns 
the company which is based in brea calif also will pay 
200000 to cover what it cost new york california massachusetts 
minnesota missouri texas and washington to brings suits accusing 
suzuki of false and deceptive advertising the agreement was 
announced thursday 
in the settlement which took effect tuesday the company made no 
admission of guilt or safety problems 
safety of the samurai came into question last june after consumer 
reports magazine gave the fourwheeldrive sport utility vehicle a 
rating of not acceptable it said the samurai was too short 
narrow light and highriding to be safe and that it rolled over in 
a routine obstacleavoidance test 
consumers union publisher of the magazine asked the national 
highway traffic safety administration to recall the more than 
150000 samurais sold in the united states since its introduction in 
november 1985 
the federal safety agency declined to recall the car saying in 
september that the samurai rollover rate was within the range of 
most other light utility vehicles 
n douglas mazza vice president of the car company issued a 
statement that said the agreement with the seven states affirms 
that the samurai is a safe vehicle and strongly supports the federal 
government decision that there is no reason to investigate the 
safety of the samurai 
while suzuki is bound under the settlement to include the 
warning in ads shown or published only in the seven states involved 
in the case the company said it would be included in all national 
advertising 
new york attorney general robert abrams said thursday that the 
states took action because the federal government has once again 
failed to act to protect the consumers of this country 
he said that under the settlement suzukis print ads will have 
to include the statement this vehicle handles differently from 
ordinary passenger cars federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns 
and abrupt maneuvers which can cause vehicles of this type to roll 
over always wear your seatbelt for specific details please read 
your owners manual 
a shorter version of the statement is required for television and 
radio ads abrams said

in spite of the promotional efforts of brokerage 
houses american households continue to withdraw from the stock 
market 
that news is a bit of a surprise to a lot of people who assume 
that the family next door and probably most of the other neighbors 
in fact almost everyone but them has a cache of blue chips or 
growth stocks 
its a common misconception created in part by the strong 
promotional efforts of brokers by repeated media reports and 
stories and by a proliferation of howto books that prescribe 
exotic investing techniques 
the reality is different for six straight years household direct 
ownership of stocks has fallen and by massive amounts since 1982 
those households have been net sellers of more than a half trillion 
dollars of corporate shares 
not all of that amount represents desertions from the market 
because many people today prefer to invest through stock mutual 
funds which act as intermediaries between market and customer 
but even these funds became net sellers last year by about 147 
billion according to federal reserve data although they remain net 
buyers by more than 52 billion since 1983 
because every sell order is matched by a buy order somebody must 
be buying foreign investors 
not last year while they were strong buyers in 1986 and 1987 
adding 178 billion and 155 billion respectively to their 
portfolios they too became sellers in 1988 reducing their holdings 
by 13 billion 
private pension funds no way for the fourth straight year they 
were net sellers reducing their portfolios by 21 billion in 1988 
insurance companies yes and no life insurers reduced holdings 
by 22 billion but fire and casualty insurance companies added 
31 billion to theirs double their net investments for 1987 the 
year of the big crash 
the one big category of institutional buying was state and local 
government retirement funds which increased net holdings by 231 
billion for the year and by 1285 billion for the past six years 
a variety of factors help explain the phenomenon at least 
superficially 
the proliferation of mutual funds has lured away oncedirect 
investors the development of a great variety of lessrisky debt 
instruments especially when interest rates are rising adds to the 
understanding 
some analysts include need as a factor 
a demographic bulge of families in the homebuying years may have 
been cashing in inheritances to buy houses which have soared in 
price in the 1980s and retired parents beneficiaries of big gains 
from postworld war ii investments have come to a time in life when 
redemption seems more sensible 
the decline of household investments in the market therefore 
need not be interpreted as a growing cynicism about stocks 
but it does shatter a widespread and disturbing myth that every 
household but yours has a net egg of shares they can tap whenever 
the need or urge arises 
if they had such a cache theres a good chance theyve already 
dipped into it the statistics at least seem to suggest that

a green flag sent about 100 europeans 
thundering down the road in their vintage mustangs friday for a 
sevenweek tour of the united states to celebrate the 25th birthday 
of the classic ford sportscar

germany 
it provides an excellent excuse for everybody to do what 
theyve always wanted to do said manners who has been planning 
the tour for three years 
the cars will cover 200 miles a day or less manners said a 
large number of american mustang enthusiasts are expected to join in 
along the way

in springtime consumers thoughts turn to 
sprucing up themselves and their surroundings that often means 
pulling out the plastic 
but this spring many credit cardholders who dont pay their 
balances each month will shell out more in interest than they would 
have a year ago because rates have been creeping up on cards since 
last summer 
among the big creditcard issuers chase manhattan corp this 
month nudged up interest rates for new subscribers to 198 percent 
annually from 175 percent the interest rate for about onethird of 
existing subscribers also is rising for the rest rates will remain 
unchanged the bank says 
chase which handles more creditcard accounts than anyone in the 
business besides citicorp had been offering the lowest average 
rate of all major issuers 
the interest rate was also raised by baltimorebased mnc 
financial corp parent of maryland national bank which ranks among 
the top ten biggest issuers in the country interest rates on about 
a quarter of its accounts went up to 189 percent annually from 179 
percent 
industry leader citicorp with about 23 million accounts 
nationally says it hasnt changed rates for the past couple of 
yearsbank officials declined to answer queries on whether any 
increases are in the works 
citicorps rates have been at the high end among the big issuers 
at 198 percent for holders of most regular not gold cards 
people who track developments in the business say the latest 
increases are part of a trend that started months ago coinciding 
with the direction taken by borrowing costs throughout the economy 
some yearly fees on credit cards have gone up a bit too but only 
slightly 
in a number of instances the rate increases are imposed 
selectivel on cardholders with histories of late payments analysts 
say 
some issuers have vowed to hold out as long as possible before 
hoisting interest rates 
rocky mountain bankcard and united bank of denver colorados two 
largest creditcard issuers are among those that intend to stick 
with the status quo for now but bankers at the two institutions say 
they cant hold out forever if credit costs keep rising 
were not going to stand here and lose money says mac 
ruxton senior vice president in charge of credit card operations 
for united bank 
united bank which handles 225000 accounts is holding the line 
at 188 percent interest and keeping its fee at 15 
rocky mountain bankcard colorados largest issuer and no10 
nationwide will hold rates at the current 186 percentlevel with 
a fee of 12 according to executive vice president denny dumler 
john pollock editor and publisher of the newsletter bank credit 
card observer says weve been noticing theres been a gradual 
rise since july in both interest rates and annual fees 
a survey of 200 banks around the country pollocks newsletter 
conducts every two months supports the point the average annual 
rate on cards was 1724 percent in the julyaugust poll and 1761 
percent in the janfeb poll 
annual average fees during the same respective survey periods 
were 1674 and 1729 
in the battle for market share competing issuers are 
concentrating on fostering customer loyalty and paying relatively 
less attention to interest rate levels 
some analysts say annual interest rates on credit cards would 
have to pass the 20 percent threshold before customers would squawk 
and to the roughly 40 percent of cardholders who pay up each month 
the rate is irrelevant 
theres an overwhelming attention to customer service which 
suggests that bankers have concluded that very few customers will 
switch cards within a fairly wide range of interest rates 
pollock said 
citicorp for instance has emphasized enhancements in recent 
years to woo customers it offers cardholders fringe benefits 
ranging from lostluggage insurance to tollfree telephone 
information numbers 
they are a good example of the power of customer service and 
enhancements and the willingness to accept cardholders with a wide 
range of credit histories says pollock 
the battle now for customer loyalty is not whether you can get 
consumers to accept your card but to encourage card use 
he says 
wallets and purses are saturated with plastic right now

a lot of coffee traders are getting the jitters these days and 
its not because theyre drinking too much java 
the nervousness reflects a growing fear that international 
tensions will destroy the markets 26yearold pricesupport system 
and allow freemarket forces to prevail with lower prices the 
likely result 
concerns about that prospect took center stage at new yorks 
coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange during the past week and are likely 
to intensify as representatives from the worlds largest 
coffeeproducing and coffeeconsuming nations prepare for a 2week 
conference in london 
the april 419 meeting is the last regularly scheduled gathering 
of the international coffee organization council before sept 30 
when the organizations 6year pricesupport agreement expires 
delegates of the 74nation group last met in february and made 
negligible progress on addressing consumernation demands aimed at 
increasing the availability of mild coffees the type preferred by 
growing numbers of coffee drinkers 
mild coffees are grown mainly in central and south america while 
the lessflavorful robusta coffees are produced primarily in africa 
the failure of the february session prompted heavy selling of 
coffee futures in new york dropping the price for may delivery 
below 123 a pound on feb 21 just 7 weeks after the contract had 
traded at a 2year of nearly 160 a pound 
a weak recovery pushed the may contract back up above 135 by 
march 17 but prices tumbled again in the past week as premeeting 
jitters gripped the market coffee for may delivery plunged below 
127 by wednesday and finished the week thursday at 12859 a 
pound the market was closed on friday 
i think perhaps the market was overcome by pessimism 
surrounding the ico conference in london said arthur stevenson 
an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york it 
does not look like the two sides have really come a long way in 
terms of bridging their differences 
the united nations helped create the international coffee 
organization in 1963 after coffeeproducing nations had tried and 
failed for many years to control coffee prices through selfimposed 
export quotas and stockpiling 
the international coffee organizations pricecontrol system also 
hinges on export quotas designed to keep prices within a range 
currently 120 to 140 a pound the organizations consumer 
members agree to observe the price floor and to limit their 
purchases of coffee from nonico producers 
the main issue facing delegates to next months meeting is a 
demand by consumer nations of which the united states is the 
largest that the quota system be revamped to increase the 
proportion of mild coffees to lessflavorful robusta coffees in the 
overall export mix 
the producer nations of which brazil is the largest object to 
that demand on the grounds that growers of robusta coffees need 
protection in the face of steadily declining coffee consumption 
according to the international coffee organization per capita 
coffee consumption in the united states fell to 167 cups a day in 
1988 from 312 cups a day in 1962 the percentage of coffee drinkers 
in the us population dropped to 50 percent from nearly 75 percent 
during the same period 
so fiercely have the two sides clung to their positions that both 
the united states and brazil have threatened in previous meetings to 
drop out of the international coffee organization at the end of the 
current agreement analysts say the organization could not survive 
without the participation of both countries 
with an agreement on quotas we hold these price levels 
said bert ruiz a coffee broker with balfour maclaine corp 
without an agreement were going downtown 
here are some commodity price trends for the past week which had 
only four trading days due to the easter holiday 
grain futures prices declined while soybean futures rose slightly 
on the chicago board of trade 
wheat for delivery in may settled thursday at 428 a bushel 
down from 440 on the previous friday may corn fell to 277 a 
bushel from 282 may oats dropped to 205 a bushel from 212 
may soybeans rose to 784 a bushel from 783 
cattle futures advanced while pork futures retreated on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
april live cattle rallied to 7820 cents a pound from 7805 
cents april feeder cattle rose to 8102 cents a pound from 8042 
cents april live hogs dipped to 4270 cents a pound from 4365 
cents may frozen pork bellies slipped to 3815 cents a pound from

exotic birds a space camp and azaleas are some of 
the attractions tempting travelers this year as cities throughout 
japan join this countrys latest fad the exposition boom 
on saturday the port of yokohama opens its 775 million 
centennial exposition the yokohama exotic showcase featuring a 
space camp for kids french and american art collectons and a 
hightech train 
yokohama is one of 15 japanese cities investing millions of 
dollars on expositions they hope will attract more japanese and 
foreign visitors and give them a more cosmopolitan image 
throughout the spring and summer yokohama will be competing for 
visitors with the himeji shirotopia exposition 1989 in southern 
japan fukuokas asianpacific exposition called yokatopia 
yamagatas omiyage souvenir world and nagoyas design expo 89 
among others 
the asianpacific expo in fukuoka on the southwestern island of 
kyushu is typical of japanese expositions in that it offers a bit of 
something for everyone including many attractions only loosely 
related to its theme of the quest for new communication in our 
world 
visitors to the seaside expo site can see micronesian villages 
and exotic asian birds watch a threedimensional movie ride a 
ferris wheel and sample foods from other asian nations 
organizers said they expect more than 6 million visitors to 
yokatopia which opened march 17 and runs until sept 3 
at himejis exposition which started march 18 visitors can see 
a 3d documentary or wander through a historic commercial 
district near the majestic white castle that dominates the city 
the expositions have the added benefit of giving some cities a 
facelift fukuoka for example has spent millions of dollars to 
improve transportation facilities organizers said 
yokohama plans to use revenues from its anticipated 18 million 
visitors to help fund a waterfront development project 
a tally of organizers estimates shows attendance at expositions 
this year could be more than 36 million 
but the many expositions connected with centennial celebrations 
of japanese cities has raised the risk that some will suffer from 
the competition particularly the smaller ones featuring such 
attractions as azalea displays souvenirs and food 
last year of the 14 expositions staged throughout japan at 
least two lost a lot of money the sapporo world food festival on 
the northern island of hokkaido reportedly lost more than 62 
million and another festival near the seto bridge in southwestern 
japan lost 651000 
expositions arent cheap tickets for this years events cost 
between 9 and 21 for adults and 5 to 10 for students prices 
that make family visits expensive

the internal revenue service bowing to 
pressure from farm state lawmakers announced friday that it will 
allow small wholesalers and some retailers to make sales of diesel 
fuel without the payment of tax 
in issuing its notice the irs agreed to lower the standards for 
wholesaler distributors ad some retailers to qualify for an 
exemption from the 151centagallon tax for sales to farmers 
fishermen and others who buy diesel for offroad use 
for example one new standard will allow distributors to 
automatically qualify for an exemption if at least 70 percent of 
their bulk sales of diesel are to users who do not have to pay the 
tax such as farmers 
a key change will define bulk sales as those of at least 25 
gallons involving storage tanks of 50 gallons or more 
that means under certain circumstances small retailers can 
qualify for a taxexemption if 50 percent of their diesel sales are 
for bulk amounts of at least 25 gallons 
before the change diesel distributors generally had to charge 
the tax unless at least 30 percent of bulk sales were in amounts of 
at least 250 gallons the policy drew many complaints 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan who had urged a change 
for smaller operations said the old standards were simply too 
high for distributors in rural areas whose customers often live 
2030 miles away and drive trucks with fuel storage tank capacities 
of less than 100 gallons 
the diesel fuel tax dispute stems from a 1987 law by congress 
that shifted collection of the tax from retail outlets to 
wholesalers and producers that revision caused a storm of protest 
because it forced farmers and other offroad users of diesel to pay 
the tax and then apply for a refund 
last year congress tried to end the controversy by allowing 
diesel purchased for offroad use from wholesalers to escape the 
tax however purchases from retailers continued to be subject to 
the tax the latest irs action sought to resolve continuing 
complaints by modifying regulatory definitions to cover smaller 
sales including by retailers operating as bulk distributors

shamrock holdings inc may have lost its battle to 
acquire polaroid corp but it is likely to walk away with a 40 
million profit before expenses analysts estimated friday 
polaroid has yet to claim victory and shamrock has not conceded 
defeat but wall street analysts said the eightmonth fight for 
control of the instant photography company was essentially over 
shamrock which offered 45 a share for polaroid stock was 
stymied thursday by a delaware court decision clearing the way for 
polaroid to repurchase 16 million shares for 50 each 
polaroid spokesman sam yanes said stockholders had tendered a 
total of 586 million shares to the cambridgebased company by 
thursdays midnight deadline 
since that is roughly four times more shares than polaroid plans 
to buy the company will prorate the number of shares it accepts 
from each stockholder based on preliminary calculations it 
expects to buy 27 percent of the shares tendered by each owner 
yanes said 
shamrock which amassed 495 million polaroid shares during the 
takeover battle tendered all of its shares said michael sitrick 
a spokesman for the burbank califbased radio and television 
concern 
according to filings with the securities and exchange 
commission shamrock paid an average of about 31 a share for its 
stake in polaroid by selling 27 percent of its shares back to 
polaroid at 50 each shamrock can expect to receive approximately 
67 million 
the value of shamrocks remaining shares is uncertain because 
many analysts expect polaroids stock which closed thursday at 
4025 on the new york stock exchange to slip to 38 or 37 a 
share after the buyback said alex henderson an analyst for 
prudentialbache securities inc 
still shamrocks remaining 36 million polaroid shares would 
conservatively be worth more than 130 million yielding a profit 
of approximately 42 million before legal fees and other expenses 
polaroid said the final number of shares tendered under the 
buyback offer and the definitive prorating formula will be 
determined april 4 
shamrock still has appeals pending before the delaware supreme 
court on polaroids employee stock ownership plan and its sale of 
300 million in stock to corporate partners a new york citybased 
investment group that supports polaroids current management 
shamrock has not called off its proxy fight for control over 
polaroids board of directors even though tendering its shares 
under the buyback plan sharply decreases its chance of winning that 
fight

while the headlines focus on inflation worries 
and tighter credit some wall street analysts are sticking with 
their forecasts that interest rates are headed lower soon 
they contend that the economy sent out signals in february that 
it was beginning to slacken even though the producer price index 
of goods traded at the wholesale level jumped 1 percent for the 
second straight month 
and they maintain that more evidence of a slowdown in growth is 
coming soon helping to persuade both bond traders and the federal 
reserve that further increases in interest rates arent needed to 
restrain inflation 
on wednesday the commerce department is scheduled to report the 
index of leading economic indicators for february 
peter greenbaum at smith barney harris upham amp co projects 
that the index which is designed to detect future swings in the 
economy will post a drop of about 05 percent that would mark the 
first decline in five months 
a modest uptrend in inflation rates has taken hold but the 
market may be exaggerating the potential extent of the rise 
smith barney said in its economic commentary for the week ahead 
february economic data have been surprisingly soft the 
markets preoccupation with inflation suggests that this may have 
been overlooked 
will todays inflation fears give way to recession fears over 
the next two quarters 
recession fears might be something less than a balm for the 
stock market but they would logically stand to benefit the market 
for treasury bonds 
if bond traders were expecting the economy to slacken they 
might well bid aggressively for government securities to profit 
from any approaching decline in interest rates 
joseph barthel an analyst at butcher amp singer inc maintains 
that evidence is mounting that during the second quarter an 
important peak in interest rates should occur 
barthel says one significant signal in this direction has been a 
decline since last summer in commodity prices as measured by the 
commodity research bureaus futures index 
many bond market participants watch commodity price indexes 
closely as a guide to what future trends in inflation might look 
like 
past peaks in interest rates have come about 10 months after the 
crb futures index crested barthel says 
about nine months ago we forecasted that the second quarter of 
1989 was likely to produce an important low for bond prices he 
says 
although recent inflation data would seem to argue that 
interest rates must move higher we stand by our earlier forecast 
whether the problem was inflation and interest rate worries or 
increased talk of a recession the stock market showed little zip 
in the past week shortened by one trading day in observance of 
good friday the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4910 
to 224304 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 202 to 16264 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market dropped 
125 to 40094 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was down 349 at 32487 
volume on the big board averaged 14840 million shares a day 
down from 17728 million the week before 
last monday merrill lynch amp co made a modest shift from stocks 
to cash in its guidelines for the allocation of investors assets 
clearly the pressure is on the federal reserve to tighten its 
credit policy said charles clough merrills chief investment 
strategist 
however we believe that most of the upward pressure on rates 
will remain at the short end of the yield curve and that any move 
up from here in longterm treasury bond yields will be limited in 
time and degree 
we believe that this rise in longterm rates will prove to be 
an opportunity to lock in attractive yields

shipments of washington red apples fell 
sharply last week the biggest drop since a nationwide health scare 
over a controversial growth additive began in late february the 
industry reported friday 
shipments also dropped significantly in michigan another major 
apple producing state 
total outofstate shipments from washington fell by 159000 
boxes compared with the week before according to the weekly 
figures compiled by the state agriculture department from 
warehouses 
shipments of red delicious apples the topselling variety fell 
by 178000 42pound boxes but the loss was offset by a jump in 
sales of granny smith apples to fill the void left when granny 
smiths from chile were pulled from markets officials said 
alar is used primarily on red apples although the industry 
contends that only 5 percent of the crop is sprayed with the growth 
regulator 
based on thursdays prices for the top three varieties the 
sales drop will cost washington growers about 13 million for the 
week 
i think its a combination of alar and the general fear a lot 
of people seem to have involving all produce right now said bill 
dewitt of the wenatchee valley traffic association which tracks 
shipments 
the shipment figures are considered an accurate measure of 
consumer sales 
apple warehouses in washington shipped 125 million boxes 
outofstate last week down 113 percent from 141 million boxes 
the previous week and off 199 percent from the 156 million boxes 
the week before that dewitt said 
the warehouses shipped 164 million boxes during the third week 
of march last year he said 
in michigan the fruit and vegetable market news of the us 
department of agriculture and michigan department of agriculture 
said shipments for the week ending march 18 were 110955 bushels 
down 30 percent from the 159149 bushels shipped the week ending 
march 4 a bushel of apples the usda says is from 42 to 50 pounds 
for the week ending march 11 133762 bushels were shipped 
in washington apple exports showed a 57000box drop from 
138000 the week before to 81000 boxes shipped last week dewitt 
said 
much of that is the decision by taiwanese importers the 
industrys largest offshore market to reduce purchases of 
washington apples by around 30000 boxes per week dewitt said 
in addition the industry generally begins to suffer from 
reduced exports at this time of year because of competition from 
newly harvested apples from australia new zealand and chile he 
said 
washington is the nations largest apple producer and generally 
supplies over threequarters of the nations supermarket apples 
this time of year said walt shields of the yakima valley 
growersshippers 
this is the first week weve been down appreciably from a year 
ago shields said 
the second consecutive week of lower sales is bad news for an 
industry that still has 40 percent of the fall crop in special cold 
storage shields said 
those 246 million boxes must be sold by the time of the fall 
harvest he said 
in the past two weeks shipments of washington apples to 
retailers wholesalers institutional buyers exporters and others 
have dropped by a combined 311000 boxes following three 
consecutive weeks of record shipments 
among the major varieties red delicious apples again showed the 
biggest drop 178000 boxes to 701000 shipped 
golden delicious apples dropped 16000 boxes 
but shipments of granny smith apples rose to 220000 boxes to 
fill the void left when granny smiths from chile were banned in the 
wake of a cyanide scare 
granny smith prices are also rising from about 20 per box 
several weeks ago to 26 per box thursday said jeff main of the 
federalstate market news service office in yakima 
the apple industrys troubles began in late february when the 
natural resources defense council a consumer group issued a report 
that eating apples treated with alar increased the cancer risk in 
children 
that report has been disputed by federal regulators and the 
apple industry but nevertheless prompted apple bans in school 
cafeterias cancelation of some foreign orders and reduced retail 
sales

the agriculture department proposed on friday 
a change in federal rules to allow the manufacture of partially 
cooked breakfast strips from poultry meat 
under the proposal the poultry strips would have to be cooked 
further by consumers to kill any food poisoning bacteria that the 
product might contain 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said the change was sought by a 
processor swift echrich inc poultry strips he said would 
provide an alternative to beef strips and pork bacon 
some consumers may be interested in this type of product as a 
lower fat alternative to traditional bacon or because of religious 
or dietary reasons he said 
current rules require that cooking temperatures for processed 
poultry be an internal temperature of 160 degrees fahrenheit or 
155 degrees for cooked cured products to kill salmonella and any 
other harmful organisms that might be present 
those heat levels are too high to successfully process a thin 
breakfast strip crawford said 
under the proposal the strips would be processed at 140 degress 
and then cooled rapidly after production the rapid cooling and the 
curing process should inhibit the growth of food poisoning 
bacteria he said 
additionally the poultry strips would have to carry specific 
labeling instructions to assure that consumers know this product 
must be further cooked before eating crawford said the 
instructions would tell consumers to cook the product until it is 
well done

in an age of space shuttles and 
supersonic jets trolleys are making a comeback in america part of 
a multibillion dollar effort to reduce traffic boost business and 
make cities more civilized 
san jose in the hightech world of silicon valley is the 
latest to install an electric trolley system and endure the 
discomfort of digging up streets to lay track 
similar lightrail systems are rolling through buffalo ny 
sacramento calif portland ore and san diego systems are 
planned in fort worth texas seattle and los angeles 
though they lack the history of streetcars in new orleans 
philadelphia and newark nj the quaint cable cars in san 
francisco or the defunct systems in new york cleveland and 
pittsburgh the new trolleys are quiet and reliable 
san joses system revives an old idea trolleys ran along 126 
miles of track throughout the santa clara valley from the 1880s 
until the late 1930s 
half of santa clara countys new 552 million lightrail line 
began operating 15 months ago in san jose and santa clara the 
other half which will reach bedroom communities and giant 
international business machines corp in south san jose is 
expected to be completed in august 1991 cutting a 20mile swath 
through the county 
so far the sleek steelwheeled white cars which draw 
electrical power from overhead wires via antennalike poles have 
performed well and generally pleased riders ticket machines with 
instructions in english vietnamese and spanish are easy to use 
and the prices are as low as 25 cents during lunchtime and 75 cents 
other hours 
i just ride for the fun of it said art esparza 33 who 
cruises through the city between downtown san jose and the great 
america amusement park in santa clara after getting off his early 
morning job its like a sunday drive 
the problems that have plagued the system however could serve 
as a warning to other cities considering trolleys 
a 140 million cost overrun accidents business disruptions 
traffic jams lawsuits and accusations of mismanagement bribery 
and embezzlement all were part of the trauma of building the 
lightrail line and transit mall 
the transit mall contractor and his wife face federal tax 
evasion charges stemming from alleged misuse of mall funds from a 
297 million contract with the county the defendants have denied 
the charges 
some of the light rails problems were unique to san jose a 
city founded in 1777 but searching for an identity after changing 
from the center of an agricultural community to a part of 
highpowered silicon valley the citys population is closing in 
fast on san franciscos 740000 but san jose still lacks the 
glamor prestige and fame of its neighbor 50 miles north 
downtown san jose deteriorated and the citys cohesiveness 
suffered as it sprawled in different directions with new companies 
and tract homes most fruit orchards vanished and the roads clogged 
with cars 
voters repeatedly told pollsters over the last 10 years that 
traffic was the areas worst problem so light rail supporters sold 
it to the public on the promise it would reduce traffic attract 
shoppers and tourists helping the area gain a reputation as 
progressive livable community with great weather 
the only promise kept so far has been the weather 
the lightrail line is criticized by those disappointed in the 
lack of quick improvement in downtown business and those who would 
rather have used transportation funds for highway improvement 
the bitterest pill of all is the delay of constructing the 
freeways for a year or two after the light rail is finished said 
dave fadness a critic of the line and chairman of the santa clara 
county transportation commission if the general public knew what 
the politicians were doing there would be a real hue and cry 
ernest glave president of the greater san jose business 
association and a jeweler in the city for 41 years also has been a 
persistent critic of the light rail because he thinks it doesnt 
help solve the downtown problems 
weve still got no attraction nothing to draw people to he 
said he argues that the system is increasing traffic congestion 
rather than reducing it and is discouraging shoppers who would 
drive to the city 
some shopkeepers though are doing very well weve been 
swamped said mario chaidez manager of the yearold cobblers 
bench a shoe repair shop at lunchtime weve got people waiting 
on line 
rod diridon a county supervisors whos been dubbed the father 
of the light rail calls the line a resounding success even 
though it cost more than three times the 176 million spent on the 
18mile system that opened in sacramento two years ago 
the 6300 rides per day on the santa clara county system over 
the last six months he notes are more than double the original 
forecast by transit engineers for the first half of the line 
the only complaints are from the people who run red lights and 
run into it diridon said

the government friday proposed fining the 
military aircraft division of lockheed corp 15 million for 
workersafety violations at the california plant where it builds 
the radarevading stealth fighter 
the occupational safety and health administration said it is 
also starting a walltowall inspection of the entire burbank 
calif facility because of the more than 400 violations uncovered 
during a fourmonth investigation of a classified area where the 
fighter is assembled 
under osha procedures lockheed has 15 working days to contest 
the proposed fine lockheed spokeman jim ragsdale said the company 
had no immediate comment on the alleged violations and likely would 
not comment until its management had an opportunity to review the 
citations 
osha cited 251 instances in which it said lockheed aeronautical 
systems co willfully failed to record illnesses and injuries to 
employees and 88 alleged willful violations of federal regulations 
requiring employers to inform workers about the potential dangers 
of chemicals they work with and instruct them on proper safeguards 
in addition the company was cited for another 99 violations of 
various osha standards including alleged mislabeling or failure to 
label chemical containers and alleged failure to include health 
warnings on information the company was required to provide to its 
workers 
other alleged violations included failing to list suspected 
carcinogens on safety sheets provided to workers overexposing 
workers to asbestos and failure to provide workers with gloves 
impervious to a hazardous chemical used on the fighter 
the proposed fine follows a highly publicized osha inspection 
that followed numerous complaints from workers at the plant which 
employs about 14000 people 
in october a month after the inspection began john c 
brizendine the president of the division said we have seen 
nothing to indicate the materials we work with are fundamentally 
unsafe of pose a health hazard provided proper procedures are 
followed 
a month later the government for the first time publicly 
acknowledged the existence of the stealth fighter a singleseat 
dualengine jet that resembles a bat and is formally designated the 
f117a 
the defense department has ordered 59 stealth fihters 52 had 
been delivered as of the november announcement 
the fighter uses socalled stealth technology to help it evade 
enemy radar including radarabsorbing materials and other coatings 
seventyfive employees at the burbank plant have a suit pending 
against lockheed and companies that make and supply the chemicals 
used to help the fighter avoid radar detection more than 100 
workers have filed workers compensation claims alleging they suffer 
from injuries caused by the chemicals 
the suit and the claims allege composite materials used in the 
fighter and chemicals used to mill and clean those materials cause 
rashes nausea dizziness memory loss and concentration problems 
osha spokesman frank kane said the 149 million fine 
represented the ninthlargest in the agencys 17year history and 
the largest ever levied in california the record fine was 51 
million against two companies involved in an april 1987 bridgeport 
conn building collapse

with a few days remaining before he begins work 
as the new head of rjr nabisco inc louis v gerstner was said to 
be absorbed in learning about his new company and analysts 
suggested he would take office ready to sell some of the tobacco 
and food giants assets 
gerstner who takes over as chairman and chief executive officer 
of the atlantabased rjr nabisco april 3 has not said what his 
specific plans are for the company recently acquired by kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co for 2453 billion the largest debtfinanced 
takeover in history 
but analysts say gerstner who is leaving as president of 
american express co to head rjr nabisco probably will decide to 
sell some of the companys brands to raise money to help pay off 
the debt including 3 billion in annual interest payments picked 
up by kkr with the acquisition 
i think thats very much the case said emanuel goldman an 
industry analyst with painewebber group inc in san francisco 
that i think is in the forefront to reduce the debtto sell 
for as much as you can as quickly as you can 
layoffs are possible but not certain goldman said personnel 
moves could come after rjr nabiscos divestiture with the new 
owners of whatever divisions are sold making the decisions he said 
rjr reynolds tobacco usa a subsidiary announced last week that 
about 700 employees will be offered early retirement enhancements 
or cash incentives to leave their jobs voluntarily but the move to 
cut the workforce stemed from the failure of rjrs smokeless 
cigarettes not the kkr takeover 
goldman said the rjr nabisco assets likely for sale including 
del monte foods and planterslife savers are attractive holdings 
look at the cookies the crackers del monte planters life 
savers this is not so bad you have the creme de la creme of some 
of the business he said 
i dont think theyll know what theyll end up selling until 
they see what their actual value is goldman added 
kkr has retained goldman sachs amp co reportedly to study a 
possible sale of the rjr nabisco subsidiary del monte 
on march 13 the day kkr announced his appointment gerstner 
said his new job was the greatest challenge in corporate 
america since then the native of long island ny has 
declined requests for interviews 
pauline a howes a spokeswoman for rjr nabisco in atlanta 
said for the time being hes up to his eyeballs in rjr nabisco 
immersion hes going to take a month or two to get settled and 
learn more about the companys operations 
gerstner at this point wont publicly reveal his vision for 
the company ms howes said 
financial concerns aside asset sales are considered likely 
because the federal trade commission required some as part of the 
regulatory approval process for the takeover 
the ftc responsible for preventing monopolies by enforcing 
antitrust laws said it would not challenge the takeover if kkr 
within a year sells 
the chun king oriental food line of rjr nabisco or the la choy 
line of beatricehuntwesson inc a unit of kkr 
the planters nuts line of rjr nabisco or the fisher nuts line 
of beatrice 
rjr nabiscos del monte ketchup or beatrices hunt ketchup 
the commission said unless those units were divested the 
combined market share could result in unfair consumer pricing 
together rjr nabisco and kkrs prior holdings account for 
oneeighth of the food sold in us supermarkets 
goldman said there is no doubt the ftc directive will be 
followed but he said the specific items named by the government do 
not amount to a major portion of the companys business 
gerstner replaces the aggressive flamboyant ceo f ross 
johnson who left rjr nabisco after losing to kkr in the 
highstakes takeover battle gerstner 47 hugely successful during 
his 11 years at american express has been described as a 
methodical executive unafraid of shaking up a company 
he reportedly will start at rjr nabisco with a 23 million 
annual salary and has received a signing bonus of more than 10 
million 
lawrence adelman a tobacco industry analyst with dean witter 
reynolds in new york said that gerstner is coming into a company 
that already is very well run and he should not face any 
immediate crises 
kohlberg kravis roberts has a lot of experience in the food 
area he added its not new to them though its new to him 
gerstner im sure hell zero in and try to maximize his 
opportunities 
other analysts have said gerstners immediate tasks include 
giving rjr nabisco employees a firm sense of direction in the wake 
of last years bruising takeover fight and reversing the companys 
loss over the last few years of its share of the domestic tobacco 
market 
if rjr nabisco sells some food lines tobacco will become even 
more important because it will command a larger chunk of the 
companys earnings said john g nelson an industry analyst with 
brown brothers harriman in new york currently tobacco accounts 
for about twothirds of rjr nabisco income 
also on the horizon could be a move of the companys 
headquarters from atlanta a relocation to rjr nabiscos former 
home in winstonsalem nc has been rumored for months 
johnson moved rjr nabisco from winstonsalem its home for more 
than 100 years to suburban atlanta in 1987

an eastern airlines flight attendant with 21 
years experience has her own plan to get striking employees back 
to work 
marsha atkins of watkinsville ga is filing a motion asking 
us bankruptcy court to appoint a supplemental trustee to run the 
airline and to allow workers to return immediately at reduced pay 
the motion which her attorney husband samuel atkins sent to the 
court on thursday suggests that thousands of striking eastern 
employees want to return to work as long as its not for texas air 
corp chairman frank lorenzo 
even though theyre frustrated not working theyd rather be 
frustrated than working for lorenzo samuel atkins said in a 
telephone interview friday 
under atkins plan if the court appointed a trustee to run the 
airline instead of lorenzo who runs easterns parent carrier 
workers could return at 75 percent of prestrike pay the remaining 
25 percent of their pay would accrue until eastern reorganized 
under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws 
i was sort of frustrated by nothing happening in the case she 
was too samuel atkins said everyone was trying to do 
something to help the attorneys and the investment bankers but no 
one wants to do anything for the employees they want to go back to 
work 
easterns machinists struck the carrier march 4 and pilots and 
flight attendants are honoring the walkout the airline sought 
chapter 11 protection from creditors on march 9 
easterns pilots and machinists already have asked bankruptcy 
judge burton r lifland to appoint a trustee to run the airlines 
daytoday operations removing company management from that role 
a clerk for lifland said friday that she was unaware of the 
atkins motion 
atkins said his wife was filing as a creditor owed 85821 in 
back pay 
lifland has scheduled an april 7 hearing on the pilots trustee 
request atkins said he hoped to bring a busload of employees from 
georgia to attend the hearing at which he expects his motion to be 
heard 
atkins who lives in a town with a population of 2000 about 60 
miles northeast of atlanta admitted that a motion by one employee 
was a tiny cry in proceedings dominated by powerful union and 
corporate players 
its highly unusual he said this is an unusual case 
anyway we though it was worth a shot it was definitely in the 
public interest

the ferocity of the fsx debate marks it as a turning point in 
american attitudes toward competition with japan reshaped by the 
persistent trade deficit and rivalries in semiconductors 
highdefinition television and superconductivity 
there is no doubt that the fsx issue is important in that its 
the first evidence that some elements of the us government are 
starting to come to grips intellectually with the challenge of 
japan said chalmers johnson a professor of asian studies at the 
university of california at san diego 
for the first time in the postwar world instead of trying make 
the japanese look like us we are behaving ever so slightly like the 
japanese johnson said 
under the agreement signed late last year st louisbased 
general dynamics corp would join forces with japans mitsubishi 
heavy industries to develop and produce the fsx an advanced version 
of the us f16 fighter 
president bush last week said he endorsed the deal but agreed to 
insist on modifications to safeguard us technology and assure 
american industry has a share in the planes production 
some opponents say japan should simply buy f16s which would be 
cheaper for japan and help shrink the us trade deficit japan has 
refused to do that but only because it was not pushed to the limit 
they say 
so far the debate hasnt led to bitter displays of emotion like 
last years fury over toshiba machine cos illegal sales to the 
soviet union which led congressmen to smash toshiba radios outside 
the capitol 
but as with any good rallying issue the fsx reflects bigger 
concerns including the loss of americas hightechnology leadership 
and the dominance of military considerations in american foreign 
policy 
theres a sense of frustration in the country said kevin 
king editor of japan bashing alert which tracks comments about 
japan in 1500 us publications on behalf of dentsu of japan the 
worlds largest advertising agency 
the aerospace is such a sensitive issue because its the last 
industry which we can safely say we still dominate king said 
in washington the seismic change in opinion has split the 
commerce department which promotes us commercial interests apart 
from the state and defense departments which put global security 
issues first 
the commerce departments star is slowly rising although the 
adjustment is still lagging behind events said ernest h preeg 
a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international 
studies in washington 
a leader in the fight against the fsx clyde v prestowitz jr 
gave intellectual respectability to the cause of managed trade last 
year in a book called trading places how we allowed japan to take 
the lead 
prestowitz a former us trade negotiator compared americans to 
lonesome cowboys and japanese to settlers under attack they 
circle the wagons together and take on all comers and win 
the united states cannot be a free trader when japan blocks 
advanced american products from its own market while developing 
competing products of its own as in the case of supercomputers 
some of the new interventionists say 
we must begin to act like we were a developing nation said 
kathryn harrigan a professor of strategic management at columbia 
university our false pride continues to make us ethnocentric 
about where ideas come from 
in contrast to those who fear foreign investment ms harrigan 
said she favors it as long as americans benefit with good jobs 
we want the critical tasks done on american soil so americans 
i dont care who they work for manage to keep themselves on the 
cutting edge she said in time of war we could exercise our 
sovereign control over property 
all this talk of managed trade and industrial policy troubles 
free traders such as edward hudgins director of the center for 
international growth at the heritage foundation in washington 
there is no way we could set up that sort of a management 
system in the united states its a very fierce aggressive 
noholdsbarred competition of special interest groups here we do 
not have a sort of consensus culture as they do in japan hudgins 
said 
but even hudgins sees some japanese things worth emulating he 
favors repealing most antitrust laws eliminating taxes on earned 
interest income to encourage savings and breaking down the 
distinction between commercial and investment banks

if it worked for the chicago bears 
polaroid employees figured it might work for them too 
so one day earlier this month booming over the speakers in the 
lunchroom at polaroids film plant in norwood mass came the 
companys new fight song 
used to have it all it goes but one man has come he 
wants to break up what weve done cut out the heart and take the 
money and run 
while that one man remained nameless in the song his 
identity was no mystery to anyone at the instantcamera giant 
the clear villain of the piece was stanley gold president of 
shamrock holdings inc the burbank calif company that launched a 
hostile takeover bid for polaroid last july 
it appeared this past week the takeover battle might be over 
unable to defeat polaroids defensive strategy in court shamrock 
said it was selling its stock under a polaroid share buyback plan 
but shamrock didnt say it was giving up 
although shamrock is owned by the family of roy e disney nephew 
of the late walt disney it was gold a 46yearold hollywood 
entertainment lawyer turned takeover specialist who came to 
personify the threat to polaroid workers 
as the eightmonthold takeover battle became increasingly 
bitter preoccupying top executives and filling the rankandfile 
with apprehension polaroid workers united passionately in 
opposition to shamrock and gold 
nearly 6000 of the companys 8300 employees in massachusetts 
signed petitions against the takeover the employees committee a 
32member group elected to represent workers was solidly behind 
polaroids current chief executive i macallister booth 
basically it comes down to this said committee chairman 
nicholas r pasquarosa we dont want anything to do with stanley 
gold 
shamrock said the personality of its president is irrelevant 
making it personal thats a public relations maneuver to 
obscure the issues said shamrock spokesman john grimaldi you 
create a straw man so everyone focuses on that instead of on the 
poor management of polaroid 
yet the employee campaign against gold if it was one was so 
homespun it belied a madison avenue effort 
the notexactlycatchy fight song for example was recorded by 
carl saunders a 40yearold polaroid lab technician who played a 
little guitar in the 60s but hasnt done much musically since 
while he got lots of help from his wife cindy their two 
children and friends saunders said polaroid didnt contribute a 
dime 
whats more he admitted he dreamed up the song mainly to give 
his 16yearold daughter kerry a boost toward a singing career 
i just thought it might get her some exposure he said 
employee attitudes have been an important element in the battle 
for polaroid because they were also stockholders controlling 
nearly 14 percent of the companys stock through an employee stock 
ownership plan 
their attitudes were clear throughout its cambridge headquarters 
and manufacturing plants polaroid employees wore or hawked 10 
tshirts they come in a choice of six colors but all bore the same 
message polaroid family says no to stanley 
at the headquarters four beige brick buildings around a 
courtyard called technology square one of the most popular 
gathering places was a bulletin board with the latest news wall 
street takeover battles including polaroids 
librarian richard gurner who posted the clippings each day said 
the most soughtafter books in the corporate library were also about 
high finance reflecting a tremendous thirst in employees to 
understand what was happening to them 
rather than an orchestrated campaign gurner believed the anger 
toward gold results from employees attempts to put the conflict 
into comprehensible terms 
we know its not just one man because the same thing is 
happening to other companies he said but we see our jobs 
threatened the company we have built threatened and he is the one 
we blame
