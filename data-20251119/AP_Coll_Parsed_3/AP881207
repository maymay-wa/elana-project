the moslem half of lebanons divided 
government feuded wednesday over a proposal to take control of the 
nations embattled central bank and block funds for christian 
military forces 
militia head walid jumblatt a druse moslem who also heads 
several government portfolios threatened tuesday to force 
replacement of bank management if it transferred money to christian 
units of the lebanese army the daily annahar newspaper reported 
however an aide to prime minister salim hoss who leads the 
nations moslem cabinet quoted hoss as saying wednesday that the 
bank should be preserved intact for the sake of national unity 
if the central bank collapses the whole country will collapse 
with it said the aide who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a few hours after jumblatts speech a rocketpropelled grenade 
slammed into the central bank building in moslem west beirut it 
caused severe damage but no casualties police said 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack 
lebanons christian leaders also lashed out the bank over the 
weekend a source close to michael aoun leader of the rival 
christian military cabinet said bank officials were pressured by 
prosyrian leaders to block a fund transfer requested by aoun he 
was reported to ask for the money to repair jet fighters controlled 
by christian units of the lebanese army 
the central bank made no comment on the reports 
lebanon has been without a head of state since sept 23 when the 
sixyear term of former president amin gemayel expired sectarian 
skirmishing prevented election of a successor 
gemayel then appointed aoun a maronite christian as prime 
minister of an interim cabinet but prosyrian moslem leaders 
rejected the move and declared sole allegiance to hoss existing 
cabinet 
rivalry between the two cabinets has further divided the army and 
police along sectarian lines with about 40000 troops in lebanon 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon

a winding street lined with small houses and 
bearing roy orbisons name is this towns only monument to the 
legendary singer and songwriter who grew up here 
but the west texas town of 1200 where the high school football 
stadium is the biggest thing in town and the oil field pumpjacks and 
scrub brush stand high on the horizon provided the musical grist 
for the man known for his black garb wraparound sunglasses and 
haunting vocals 
orbison who sang such hits as pretty woman and crying 
died of a heart attack late tuesday in hendersonville tenn he was 
52 
wink residents remember orbison as someone whose extraordinary 
talent surfaced early 
in high school he and some friends formed the wink westerners 
which played country and western music at school dances and later 
had a radio and television show sponsored by a furniture store in 
nearby odessa 
the band formed when orbison was a sophomore made its debut at 
a wink high school assembly and went on to play dance halls and bars 
in surrounding towns such as iraan crane and jal the group changed 
its name to the teen kings after its five members graduated and 
played a newer kind of music rock n roll 
after a trip to nashville and a national tour they came back 
to wink and all of them were driving cadillacs said john paul 
pitts a former wink resident who lived one house away from orbison 
i used to come out of my house and see roy in the back seat of 
his car practicing the guitar because his house was so small 
said pitts who wore orbisons sport coat for his high school 
graduation because he didnt own one 
years before forming the band orbison played his guitar and sang 
outside the local drug store 
people would throw him nickels and quarters said jl dodd 
principal of wink high school who taught orbison in two classes 
orbisons musical ambition was evidenced in the verse beneath his 
senior picture in his 1954 high school yearbook to lead a western 
band is his after school wish and of course to marry a 
beautiful dish 
the orbison family came to the area from vernon during the oil 
boom of the 1940s orbisons father orvie lee worked in the 
permian basin oil fields but found time to teach his son to play the 
guitar at age 6 
orbison last visited west texas for an oil aid concert in midland 
last year to benefit economically stricken oilfield workers 
i never thought that success changed him said bill beckham 
publisher of the wink bulletin and the winkler county news who 
attended high school with orbison wink was always home for roy 
even though he had not been there for many years 
last year the town changed the name of langley way where the 
singer had lived to roy orbison drive the shotgun house his family 
occupied is no longer standing 
wink officials said wednesday they were planning a memorial 
service for orbison but details had not been worked out yet

an oil shale mine in northeastern 
estonia has been ablaze for more than a month and authorities 
believe it will take another week to extinguish a newspaper 
reported 
kodumaa a newspaper published in tallinn the estonian capital 
said tuesday that 500 miners had to be rescued and no injuries were 
reported when the fire broke out nov 3 at the estonia mine near the 
town of kohtlajarve in this tiny republic on the baltic sea 
firefighters sealed sections of the mine with concrete and then 
poured in 21 million gallons of water to contain the blaze whose 
origin was unknown two explosions have rocked the huge mine since 
the fire started 
some 200 firefighters and 200 miners have been fighting the fire 
the newspaper reported 
estonian environmentalists have complained the mine is ruining 
the area and the water used to put out the fire has become 
contaminated with phenol a poisonous substance formed by burning 
shale 
two weeks after the fire started kodumaa said the phenol 
content in nearby rivers exceeded safe levels by several thousand 
times authorities are considering building several huge reservoirs 
to store the contaminated water when it is pumped out of the mine

secular israelis are organizing to stop a 
campaign by the ultraorthodox to close all forms of entertainment 
from soccer stadiums to cafes on the jewish sabbath 
secular jews find the prospect even more offensive because few 
ultraorthodox do army service in a nation that fights to survive 
and has experienced four wars in its 40 years 
some of the alarm appears exaggerated but many israelis feel 
political success by the religious fundamentalists could alter the 
character of the jewish state discouraging immigration and even 
provoking a flight of talented people 
about 70 percent of israels 35 million jews are nonobservant 
despite that majority they were passive in past years when the 
orthodox obtained such concessions as stopping the national airline 
el al from flying on the sabbath sundown friday to sundown 
saturday 
demands by four small religious parties with the balance of power 
in the parliament elected nov 1 however have have prompted the 
first largescale organization of secular jews 
one group is hemdat a privately financed association formed to 
safeguard scientific cultural and religious freedoms 
it formed an emergency committee called freedom to organize 
feminists nonorthodox rabbis army officers and scholars against 
religious legislation proposed by the ultraorthodox 
the orthodox may be strong in the parliament but out in the 
street they are weak said zamira segev a hemdat coordinator 
the moment we organize and we are insistent we will win 
many feel religious coercion contradicts the vision of israels 
socialist pioneers who sought freedom from religious strictures as 
well as national liberation 
one rallying point of the secular is fear that laws closing 
stadiums theaters restaurants bars and other public places on the 
sabbath would encourage emigration 
after the elections a lot of people said thats it im 
leaving segev said i cant believe people will actually go 
but its a burning subject 
educators say the ultraorthodox might divert government funds 
from universities forcing scholars to seek opportunities abroad 
the ultraorthodox consider the universities to be hotbeds of 
secularism and would love to cut them down said lee levine an 
archaeology professor at hebrew university 
exemption of the ultraorthodox from army service creates strong 
feeling 
other israeli men do three years of compulsory service followed 
by up to 62 days a year of reserve duty but ultraorthodox students 
often defer service until age 26 after that they either do not 
serve at all or are not required to do the full three years 
about 10000 people rallied in kings of israel square in tel aviv 
last month to protest such deferments which have totaled about 
19000 in 1988 
i dont understand why i had to fight and lose my legs and 
lose my friends while someone sits in school and prays a veteran 
identified only as maoziya told the applauding protesters 
he lost both legs an arm and an eye during the threeyear 
invasion and occupation of lebanon that ended in june 1985 maoziya 
said he still was doing reserve duty and so could the ultraorthodox 
judaisms more liberal reform and conservative movements are 
active in the effort to stop religious laws 
as a conservative rabbi i am not in favor of operating cinemas 
and ruining the nature of the sabbath but i feel the jewish 
religion can compete on the open market of ideas said rabbi 
philip spectre chairman of the freedom committee it does not 
have to be enforced by legislation 
the orthodox establishment has a monopoly on israels religious 
affairs it has barred liberal rabbis from performing marriages or 
burials and made the liberal movements ineligible for state 
education funds 
four religious political parties won 18 seats in the 120member 
knesset on nov 1 enough to force concessions from prime minister 
yitzhak shamir if he includes them in a rightwing coalition 
topping the orthodox agenda is a law recognizing only conversions 
to judaism performed by orthodox rabbis 
among people who would not longer be considered jewish under such 
a statute is david codding a britishborn immigrant who has lived 
in israel for 17 years served in a combat army unit and raised a 
family here he was converted to judaism by a nonorthodox rabbi 
the implications of that law mean that if god forbid i were 
killed in the service of this country i would not be interred in 
consecrated ground codding wrote in a letter to the jerusalem 
post newspaper 
targets for the ultraorthodox are less lofty but would have 
greater inmmediate effect they want to reverse the victory secular 
jews won in persuading some jerusalem theaters to show movies on 
friday nights 
some religious parties also favor making rulings of the 
rabbinical courts immune to reversal by the supreme court critics 
say that would enable rabbis to annul foreign marriages and 
divorces creating a maze of bigamy unresolved divorce settlements 
and child custody disputes 
ultraorthodox leaders say they are trying to preserve the jewish 
nature of israel not to coerce the secular 
we dont want to impose on the private life of any person 
said rabbi menachem porush a leading member of the ultraorthodox 
party augudat israel 
their opponents worry about a hidden agenda and satirists paint 
scenes of a country where secular books and mixed bathing are 
banned synagogue attendance is mandatory married women must shave 
their heads in accordance with religious rulings on modesty and 
rabbis inspect homes to make sure dietary laws are observed

drawn by the bright and dazzling 
lights of casinos and the bleak squalor of the urban area beyond the 
boardwalk filmmakers and novelists are using atlantic city as a 
popular setting for tales of organized crime drugs prostitution 
gambling and murder 
an ugly mixture of glitter and sleaze is how novelist ovid 
demaris sees the city in his upcoming work ricochet in under 
the boardwalk author bill kents characters are portrayed in a 
universe of dazzle and slime 
tv viewers got glimpses of atlantic city recently with a movie 
based on elmore leonards 1985 novel glitz starring markie 
post and jimmy smits in his book leonard talks about the glittery 
casinos thriving on bus tours that dropped the suckers off for six 
hours to lose their paychecks 
he also describes the citys inlet neighborhood as an area that 
looked as though it had been fought over in a war house to house 
and half the people had packed up and left 
all the attention gets mixed reviews from city fathers who take 
pride in the allure of their town but worry that its being typecast 
we do look like a perfect stage set said john fox a 
spokesman for the atlantic city convention amp visitors bureau we 
have a beautiful stage set along the beachfront with the giant 
casinos but the rundown neighborhoods also seem to be an easy 
target 
mayor james usry accuses some writers of yellow journalism 
when it concerns atlantic city but thats what sells papers and 
books he said 
i dont know of any mafia in atlantic city you know these 
authors could say it took place in mayville ill but what would 
that mean to people atlantic city is one of the most designated 
city names in the country 
louis malles critically acclaimed movie atlantic city 
starring burt lancaster and susan sarandon marked the start of 
atlantic citys revival as a setting for moviedom and novels that 
was nine years ago barely a year after legalized gambling began 
now barely a month passes without atlantic city featured in some 
tv show movie or book 
diane keaton has shot scenes in one casino for a story about 
three nightclub entertainers the comedymagic team of penn amp teller 
was in the resort last spring to film penn amp teller get killed 
atlantic city weekend a romantic adventure was released 
this fall characters in the book by helen mourtos include an 
entrepreneur on the outside of society a casino dealer and a 
mysterious nightclub dancer 
previews described the novel as offering insiders a view of 
life in the world of atlantic citys casinos about the 
temptations beneath the casinos bright lights 
fox doesnt think the visions of a sleazy atlantic city have 
driven away business or visitors 
i cant throw rocks at the movie writers and novelists because 
they happen to choose us as their setting he said i dont 
think anybody except a travel writer goes out of their way to write 
something positive about any particular city 
fox worries more about how trade publications portray the city 
they prefer to look at the business side of things he said 
they are more important to us the marketers 
demaris said it was the lure of gambling the big hotels and 
atlantic citys history as a resort that enticed him to choose it as 
the setting for ricochet a novel that promises to take 
readers straight to the heart of a world of greed political 
corruption organized crime and murder 
could his novel have worked in another city 
no said demaris because casino gambling is a part of it 
i needed that atmosphere and i needed a kind of mafia 
family like you have down there in new york the mafia has gotten 
sort of small it has kind of quieted down 
kent doesnt think that kind of allure is bad for atlantic city 
what makes atlantic city interesting to writers is the 
incredible clash of extremes you can actually see the fortunes of 
people going up and down he said the city is far more than 
multimilliondollar casinos and rundown neighborhoods its 
complicated politically economically and mostly historically

here is the text of soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs remarks upon arrival tuesday at kennedy international 
airport as translated from the russian by viktor sukhudreyev of the 
soviet foreign ministry 
 
first of all i should like on behalf of the soviet people to 
extend my greetings to the united nations and to express my feelings 
of profound respect for the american people and for all new yorkers 
i feel the program of my stay here the stay of my delegation 
has taken shape i think its an interesting program and im 
certainly satisfied with it 
we will be having meetings with the secretary general of the 
united nations perez de cuellar with the president of this current 
session of the united nations general assembly mr caputo and i 
hope those meetings will be useful the soviet union hopes to 
broaden and expand its cooperation within the united nations 
framework with all the states that make up the united nations 
i shall be addressing the united nations general assembly 
tomorrow we certainly have what we could say to this most important 
forum this world community we are living in a world which is going 
through some very crucial changes and all nations have their own 
concerns their own interests we shall be sharing our concerns and 
our interests in analyzing and thinking over the current situation 
we will have a meeting with united states president ronald reagan 
and with his successor george bush we have agreed on such a 
meeting i am indeed truly happy to have this new opportunity to 
meet with them i believe that the very fact that this meeting is 
going to take place says a great deal especially in terms of the 
active state of sovietamerican relations and discussions and that 
is good we have not arranged any formal agenda so either side will 
be free openly and frankly to raise any questions that it wishes 
to 
i believe that we can safely say even now that the conversations 
and the meeting itself will doubtless promote greater dynamism in 
the dialogue and an expansion of cooperation between our two 
countries we believe and we hope that is the belief of the 
american side as well that this meeting will serve the best 
interests of the united states and the soviet union indeed of all 
the world 
within the framework of the program of our visit we will have 
some other meetings with some public and business circles in this 
country with representatives of other countries i trust these will 
be useful and fruitful days we are certainly prepared to make our 
contribution to that end thank you

presidentelect george bush filled his top two 
trade jobs with a close friend and a ford administration veteran 
and tapped longtime officials william webster and thomas pickering 
for positions he once held himself cia director and un 
ambassador 
bush said tuesday he has chosen texas oilman robert mosbacher a 
longtime friend and republican fund raiser as commerce secretary 
and washington attorney carla hills as us trade representative 
the latter move prompted quick democratic criticism that bush had 
selected someone without extensive experience in trade 
rounding out appointments to his economic team bush announced 
selection of stanford university economist michael boskin to head 
the council of economic advisers bush called boskin one of this 
nations preeminent economists 
bush said he was seeking continuity at the cia when he asked 
webster to stay on at the intelligence agency president reagan 
named webster a former fbi director to the cia job last year after 
the death of william casey 
pickering 57 currently is ambassador to israel if confirmed by 
the senate he will replace vernon walters as ambassador to the 
united nations 
pickerings primary experience is in the middle east where he 
also was ambassador to jordan from 1974 to 1978 during president 
jimmy carters administration 
transition officials said no additional appointments were 
expected until bush returns from new york where he was accompanying 
president reagan to a meeting today with soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev 
bush said that his cia director and un ambassador will not have 
cabinet rank but that both would attend cabinet meetings when 
pertinent subjects were discussed 
there is no point in the united nations ambassador sitting 
around as i did for a while talking about agriculture policy 
bush said 
bush was un ambassador under president nixon and was cia 
director during the ford administration 
bushs choice for trade representative hills also served in the 
ford administration as secretary of housing and urban development 
the 54yearold hills is the first woman bush has tapped for a 
highlevel post but the choice drew immediate criticism from sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas this years democratic vice presidential 
candidate 
he called hills a very able person but criticized bushs 
selection of a trade representative with little background in the 
field 
bentsen said that while hills probably will be confirmed by the 
senate i had hoped frankly that wed have someone from the 
business world who had extensive international experience in trade 
that didnt happen 
the two trade jobs will be highly visibly with the federal trade 
deficit totaling 170 billion last year and running at an annual 
rate of 137 billion this year 
mosbacher 61 is a longtime friend of bushs who headed his 
primary campaign fundraising operation he also was chairman of a 
republican party program that raised 24 million in 100000 
contributions for the general election campaign 
mosbacher worth an estimated 200 million from his oil and gas 
holdings and investments is a former chairman of the national 
petroleum council 
the commerce secretary enforces trade policy and seeks more 
markets for us goods as well as serving as a voice for us 
business within the government mosbacher also will oversee agencies 
ranging from the national weather service to the census bureau to 
the national bureau of standards 
the trade representative negotiates trade agreements with other 
countries and investigates complaints of unfair trade practices 
bush had lunch tuesday with rep dan rostenkowski democratic 
chairman of the house ways and means committee afterward 
rostenkowski dill said bush was very firm in the fact that he 
did not want to discuss the increasing of revenue to combat the 
federal deficit 
bush also met tuesday with former transportation secretary 
elizabeth dole whose name had been circulated as a potential un 
ambassador a bush aide said no promises were made to her regarding 
administration jobs

a fatal type of skin cancer is affecting more 
people at a younger age than ever before and the trend may get 
worse if chemical pollution continues to leach natural ozone from 
the atmosphere an expert says 
dr darrell s rigel an assistant clinical professor of 
dermatology at new york university medical school said tuesday that 
melanoma a type of skin cancer that can be fatal if not treated is 
now diagnosed at the rate of one of 128 americans an increase of 
about 1500 percent compared to 1935 
even more disturbing the ages of patients developing melanoma is 
dropping dramatically rigel told the american academy of 
dermatology annual meeting 
five years ago it was unusual to see someone under the age of 
40 with skin cancer said rigel now were commonly seeing 
people in their 20s with skin cancer 
about 25 percent of the estimated 27300 americans diagnosed as 
having melanoma this year will be aged 39 or under he said only a 
few years ago melanoma was conidered a disease of the aged rigel 
said 
not only has the overall rate grown but the age group where it 
has grown the most rapidly is in the youngest group said rigel 
the rate of increase is highest among the youngest people not 
only here but in other countries 
its generally believed that melanoma a skin cancer that will 
spread throughout the body if not excised by surgery early develops 
after 10 to 20 years of heavy or damaging exposure to ultraviolet 
rays of the sun but rigel said the increasing rate of the disease 
among the young suggests that the time it takes to develop the 
disease may be decreasing 
a loss of ozone in atmosphere might be the explanation of why 
people are getting it younger and younger maybe that has been 
brought up as a hyposthesis said rigel for every decrease of 1 
percent in the ozone layer there is a 2 percent increase in the 
incidence of skin cancer 
ozone is a natural gas present in the atmosphere that partially 
blocks ultraviolet solar rays from reaching the earths surface 
studies in recent years have shown that some types of chemical 
pollutants principally the fluorocarbons that are used for 
refrigerants and solvents destroy the atmospheric ozone thus 
allowing more ultraviolet rays to reach earth 
counterbalancing the ozoneloss effect said rigel is a growing 
consciousness about the dangers of excessive exposure to the sun he 
said more people are using solar screens a lotion that is applied 
to the skin to filter out ultraviolet sun rays 
people are so much more sun conscious than they were just five 
years ago he said in an interview the use of sun screen has 
risen very dramatically 
many parents have become aware that sun damage on the skins of 
children under the age of 10 can result in cancer among those 
youngsters before they are 30 said rigel as a result he said 
even children now are using sun screen 
we wont begin to see the effects of that sun screen usage for 
another 10 to 20 years from now he said the hope is that by 
the turn of the century the sun screen use and more common sense 
about avoiding the sun will kick in and cause a decline in skin 
cancers 
if not said rigel he predicts that by the year 2000 melanoma 
may be striking one in every 90 americans 
melanoma first appears as a black brown or mixed colored spot of 
irregular shape on the skins surface left untreated the cancer 
penetrates to the interior of the skin and releases cells that can 
move through the bloodstream and establish colonies in the bone 
brain lung or even heart once this happens the disease cannot be 
cured said rigel 
but if the cancer is detected early when it is still about the 
size of a pencil eraser it can easily be cut from the skin and cure 
is almost certain he said 
rigel said the number of melanoma cases in the united states has 
almost doubled during the last eight years and the number of deaths 
has tripled to about 5800 since 1960 yet the survival rate for 
melanoma patients has risen from 60 percent in the 1960s to about 
83 percent now

after the crowds noise and confusion of the 
liberty weekend extravaganza two years ago residents of governors 
island consoled themselves with one thought nothing like it would 
happen again 
they were wrong in the words of coast guard lt cmdr paul 
milligan the two major individuals in the world are coming here 
to have lunch 
on tuesday the small island in new york harbor which is 
administered by the coast guard and used for a base was abustle 
with preparations for the arrival today of mikhail gorbachev ronald 
reagan and george bush 
even though it sits in the nations busiest harbor and is just a 
brief ferry ride from manhattan governors island is a quiet town 
barred to the public except for one day in the spring and one in the 
fall when visitors are allowed to tour the speed limit on the 
islands roads 15 mph pretty much typifies the pace of life 
enjoyed by its 4000 residents all of them connected to the coast 
guard base 
the 173acre island was the epicenter of the fourday statue of 
liberty relighting celebration in 1986 some island residents who 
survived that experienced an unwanted sense of deja vu this week 
it took people a month to recover from the statue of liberty 
recalled henry apicos principal of the islands elementary school 
the island was turned into a carnival people felt imposed upon 
this time restrictions necessitated by the visit are going to 
create difficulties for some families he said 
on sunday night a fourpage notice was handed out to residents 
to inform them that for much of today there would be no driving on 
the island and no ferry service hours at the coast guard mess hall 
were changed school was called off and the greg smith singers 
performance at st cornelius chapel was canceled 
residents of high security areas have been told to leave 
their homes or stay inside all afternoon they can look out the 
windows but may not open them peek from behind drawn shades or 
stand on their porches 
although areas were set aside for islanders to view the leaders 
they had to arrive early stay late and bring identification 
mostly theyll see a lot of police and security people apicos 
predicted 
on tuesday no parking wednesday signs popped up around the 
island and parked cars were towed from along the motorcade route 
outside the bases gymnasium which was being converted into a giant 
press room for 800 reporters a flatbed truck deposited portable 
toilets to replace bathrooms that had been converted into 
photographers darkrooms 
six coast guard men raked leaves in front of an apartment 
building grousing this is what i went to school for asked one 
at liberty village a new housing complex built on the spot where 
reagan threw the switch to relight the statue of liberty a woman 
and her two children tried to reach their car through a maze of 
yellow mesh fence thrown up for security 
this is because reagan and gorbachev are coming she 
explained were not usually caged up like this 
coast guard personnel have been working around the clock to set 
up press facilities install communications lines and construct 
bleachers milligan said 
liberty weekend was bigger than this but it had a longer 
planning period we learned about this a week ago he said but 
the coast guard is good at crisis management whether its a 
searchandrescue mission or an oil spill or this 
theres been a little grumbling but people realize its only 
an inconvenience milligan said this starts the relationship 
between the us and the soviet union for the next four years 
well all remember this from the smallest child to the 
admiral

from the beginning they were an odd couple she a 
twicedivorced bouffant blond psychologist and he a married minister 
and rising star in the mainstream united methodist church 
friends described her as flashy and flighty he was short 
balding intense and driven and for awhile their liaison was 
unknown 
in a hushed courtroom monday an angry young lawyer struggled to 
convince a judge that walker raileys obsession with lucy papillon 
drove him to a bizarre murder scheme that ran amok 
the lawyer succeeded 
a state judge ruled that railey 41 tried to choke his wife to 
death and is liable to her relatives for some 16 million in actual 
and punitive damages 
the twisted drama was muddled by the fact that railey did not 
contest the civil allegations spurned the court proceedings and 
quite possibly may never pay a dime of the judicially ordered 
damages 
stranger still he does not face criminal charges he has fled 
texas and is believed to be living in san francisco 
police and prosecutors can prove that railey devised a clever but 
phony alibi the night his wife was attacked but have no evidence 
linking him to the crime itself 
peggy railey survived but suffered extensive brain damage and has 
not been able to communicate although her eyes can open and follow 
moving objects or people doctors say she is in a persistent 
vegetative state from which she is not expected to recover 
expressing his frustration over the railey affair criminal 
prosecutor norm kinne once declared 
this guys a liar hes trying to cover his tracks he wasnt 
where he was at the time he says he was now the question is if he 
wasnt there where was he 
the conclusion that everybodys drawn is that he was home 
choking out his wife 
but that doesnt necessarily follow theres no proof he was at 
the scene at the time she was strangled theres no evidence that he 
strangled her or that he knew who strangled her or that he arranged 
or participated in any way 
twenty months after the assault on mrs railey the first public 
testimony in the case occured in a majestic old courtroom across the 
hall from where jack ruby was convicted of killing presidential 
assassin lee harvey oswald 25 years ago 
the symbolic issue was the extent of raileys financial 
liability but the more compelling issue was lucy papillons love 
affair with the exminister of the 6000member first united 
methodist church and what role that romance might have played in 
the attack on mrs railey 
ms papillon 46 unsmiling but composed insisted there was no 
connection between the two but plaintiff attorney bill arnold 
endeavored to show otherwise 
here are excerpts from their brittle exchange including arnolds 
liberal reference to the contents of a sworn deposition taken from 
ms papillon last may but never before revealed 
is it fair to say that from june of 1986 until the attack on 
peggy railey april 21 of 1987 that you met with walker railey at 
your home on an average of three times a week 
yes 
did you have intimate relations regularly on these thrice 
weekly meetings 
yes 
did you and mr railey sometimes drink champagne in the 
afternoons when he was at your home 
occasionally 
did you have intimate relations with walker railey one week 
before the attack on peggy railey 
yes 
pressing that issue later arnold said 
approximately four days before the attack on peggy railey you 
are with him for three or four nights at the doubletree inn here in 
dallas while he has sent peggy and the children to be with her 
parents is that accurate 
she muttered a qualified yes 
arnold recalled asking mrs papillon about her intensifying 
relaionship with railey and wondering if she ever considered in 
the back of your mind that there might be some connection with the 
attack on mrs railey 
your answer was no not once is that still your answer 
yes it is 
arnold read again from ms papillons sworn statement 
railey and his wife did not have an intimate relationship and 
railey did not long for such a relationship before he had me because 
he did not know what he did not have 
i never gave railey an ultimatum about divorce mrs railey was 
not aware of her husbands affair with me 
arnold brought out that railey had discussed divorcing his wife 
to marry her but sought to show that such a scenario would 
jeopardize his chances of becoming a bishop 
another scenario is that peggy mysteriously dies killed by a 
white supremacist because railey had spoken against racism leaving 
him with a sympathetic role free to marry you without loss of 
respect and free to become a bishop 
ms papillon replied with a mumbled affirmative

developers building a group of 
stores on part of the jewish waldheim cemetery have upset jewish 
leaders and relatives of some of the dead buried on three sides of 
the site 
imagine a k mart in the center of arlington national 
cemetery alan pearlman said tuesday his father and grandparents 
are buried in the 80yearold graveyard in this west chicago suburb 
the issue is seen differently by larry hochberg president of 
sportmart inc in suburban niles who is building an outlet for his 
sporting goods a mens store and an electronics store at the site 
near a busy thoroughfare 
obviously we wouldnt want to do anything that was 
objectionable or sacrilegious said hochberg 
im very active in all aspects of the jewish community he 
said the last thing we would want is to do something to cause 
terrible pain 
the development replaces a virtual dumping ground for dirt on 
the cemetery grounds hochberg said and with landscaping and a new 
cemetery entrance his stores will not be intrusive 
that is little consolation to pearlman 42 of palatine who said 
he was shocked and amazed when a workman told him of the project 
three weeks ago 
from what ive always understood this is sacred consecrated 
ground said pearlman who is considering moving his relatives 
remains 
gertrude weinstein president of the des plaines cemetery corp 
that runs the cemetery said a dwindling local jewish population led 
sales of burial plots to plummet 
we have enough land there for the next 1000 years she said 
and joseph spina village president of north riverside said he 
thinks the development will be tasteful 
the shopping area is expected to add 150000 a year in salestax 
revenue to the village treasury officials said 
in may two months after the 45acre cemetery lot was annexed by 
north riverside the villages planning commission held a rezoning 
hearing and decided five acres could be used for the stores 
notification of adjacent landowners was required before the 
hearing 
but there was no notification of families of those buried in the 
cemetery apparently because the plots are rented by longterm 
lease pearlman said 
that bothers rabbi paul greenman a past president of the 
orthodox chicago rabbinical council 
i want to know why the rabbis werent consulted on this and why 
this thing was sprung on the jewish community said greenman 
adding the case would be considered by the council greenman said 
the council will investigate whether the land for the proposed 
shopping center was ever intended for graves and if the development 
would harm existing graves 
hochberg said he did consult with a rabbi he preferred not to 
name and was assured he would not hurt the site 
the development will improve drainage and vandalism protection 
for parts of the cemetery he said noting burial grounds surrounded 
by commercial development are not uncommon in chicago 
but larry gershkowitz of des plaines whose parents are buried in 
the cemetery said that doesnt help 
all i can see is a little old woman going in to see her husband 
or her children and finding a shopping center gershkowitz 
said this is absolutely rediculous

it may be another year before the us cattle 
herd begins expanding and eventually taking the edge off rising 
consumer beef prices according to agriculture department analysts 
meanwhile consumers will see relatively large supplies of 
poultry and pork in the coming year 
beef production in 1989 is expected to decline 7 percent to a 
nineyear low says steve reed of the departments economic research 
service 
reed told usdas annual outlook conference last week that us 
economic growth is expected to continue in 1989 at only a slightly 
slower pace than this year consumer incomes are expected to keep 
rising in real terms with high employment rates he said 
both these factors should provide continued support for meat 
prices he said the risk of renewed inflation remains a 
concern however the rate of inflation is expected to rise only 
slightly above 1988s 33 percent to perhaps 4 percent 
reed said the federal reserve is expected to keep interest rates 
above 1988 levels to help dampen inflation and to attract foreign 
investments into the united states 
it will be important that this favorable economic environment 
be maintained if expected increases in retail beef prices are going 
to be met by little consumer resistance he said the record 
retail beef prices during the summer and fall of 1988 likely will be 
broken by new record price levels in 1989 
meanwhile he said the nations cattle inventory could edge 
still lower by jan 1 1989 from the 99 million head reported at 
the start of this year the fewest since 977 million were counted 
in 1961 
but department experts say the heat and drought of 1988 had 
little direct effect on the cattle numbers other than driving up 
feed costs and forcing some producers to sell off or trim herds 
massive liquidation of cattle herds did not occur however 
despite pessimistic reports at the height of the drought last 
summer tens of thousands of cattle were sold but breeding stock 
often was bought by other producers 
a final report to president reagan on the droughts impact is 
being readied for the white house later this month it is expected 
to confirm what usda and trade analysts have been saying for months 
that only a small percentage of the nations cattle fell victim to 
heat and drought 
reed said a midyear cattle inventory estimated the 1988 calf crop 
to be slightly larger than a year ago even so the 1988 and 1987 
calf crops are the smallest since 1961 
the july 1 inventory report showed that heifers calving and 
entering breeding herds in the first half of this year jumped 10 
percent from a year earlier suggesting that an expansion may be in 
the works 
but reed said a similar restocking rate occurred in 1986 and sent 
a false signal to the industry that the plunge in the cattle 
industry had bottomed out and was starting back up 
this past summers drought was well under way as the breeding 
season began and will likely stall expansion for one more year he 
added 
drought appears to have had a greater impact on dairy producers 
who responded to rising feed costs by cutting herd sizes reed said 
cattle inventories on jan 1 1989 still are expected to 
remain below 100 million head possibly falling below this years 99 
million head he said 
another important factor for livestock producers will be grain 
production prospects in 1989 and how those bear upon feed and other 
costs in the coming year 
ewen m wilson usdas assistant secretary for economics said 
the 1988 drought without question was the most pervasive early 
season drought ever to hit the farm belt during the critical growing 
months total grain production was cut 29 percent including a 
onethird reduction in this years corn crop 
but wilson reminded the conference that while underlying 
fundamentals may have been masked they may not have been changed 
by the 1988 drought and the sharp drawdown in world grain supplies 
and higher commodity prices 
the drought has altered the immediate outlook but in a world 
of subsidized agriculture the longterm tendency to overproduction 
lurks only slightly below the surface 
it would be a mistake he said to ignore longterm fundamentals 
barring another drought the odds are in favor of a rebound in 
production and a rebuilding of stocks wilson said

coal mine owners are generally pleased with a 
supreme court ruling shielding them and their insurance companies 
from paying up to 136 billion in additional black lung benefits 
but an attorney for miners claimed a partial victory 
the justices ruled 90 on tuesday that a group of miners 
estimated to number between 94000 and 155000 is ineligible to seek 
disability benefits for the disease the group consists of those who 
missed deadlines for filing court appeals after they were denied 
benefits 
mark solomons a lawyer representing the mine operators said 
the industry is going to be pleased 
but solomons said a second part of the supreme courts ruling 
will spur additional litigation for a smaller number of miners 
hoping to receive benefits 
in that section the justices voted 54 to permit some miners who 
worked less than 10 years in the mines to seek disability pay for 
black lung disease or pneumoconiosis a respiratory ailment caused 
by prolonged inhaling of coal dust 
between 8000 and 10000 miners with pending claims could be in 
line to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits under 
that part of the high court decision 
the court said even if miners have less than 10 years on the job 
they are presumed to be eligible for benefits if they display 
medical evidence of the disease 
paul smith a lawyer representing miners said the ruling is a 
significant if only partial victory for the workers 
the presumption makes a big difference he said because it 
shifts the burden of proof to the government to deny such claims 
its very difficult to prove you are disabled by black lung 
disease he said 
congress created a special industrysupported fund to pay off 
claims by miners with the disease coal mine operators already owe 
the fund some 3 billion that was lent to it by the federal treasury 
the reagan administration had urged the justices to deny the 
claims of miners who had missed earlier filing deadlines 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said nothing in 
federal law requires the government to reopen settled claims 
there is not even a colorable basis for the contention that 
congress has imposed a duty to reconsider finally determined 
claims he said 
but scalia said congress also never intended to exclude from 
benefit eligibility miners who worked less than 10 years 
we do not sit to determine what congress ought to have done 
given the evidence before it but to apply what congress enacted 
and the exclusion of shortterm miners from the benefits 
finds no support in a 1977 law aimed at making it easier for 
miners to seek benefits scalia said 
the high court overturned a ruling by the 8th us circuit court 
of appeals that had ordered the labor department to take a fresh 
look at claims that were denied in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
the appeals court had directed the department to use the 
liberalized standards adopted by congress in 1977 to determine 
benefit eligibility for a group numbering from 94000 to 155000 
the cases involved potential benefits estimated at 136 billion 
in other cases the court 
threw out an appeal by an unwed california father seeking to 
restore a parental relationship with his 7yearold daughter eight 
days after hearing arguments in edward mcnamaras case the court 
dismissed the appeal for procedural reasons and left unanswered 
whether unwed fathers have the same parental rights as unwed mothers 
ruled unanimously that federal employees holding sensitive 
intelligenceagency jobs are not entitled to administrative hearings 
when fired as security risks the justices reversed a ruling 
requiring a hearing for a national security agency employee who says 
he was dismissed for homosexual activities

it isnt just the western industrial nations 
that face the problems of coping with an aging population the 
census bureau reported tuesday fourfifths of the increase in older 
people is occurring in the third world 
developing countries currently include 58 percent of all people 
aged 55 and over and those nations account for some 80 percent of 
the 12 million people who pass that birthday every month according 
to the new census study aging in the third world 
even so its the richer developed nations where aging has 
attracted the most attention as longerlived populations stress the 
medical and social welfare systems and generate political interest 
and debate 
perhaps the study indicates the developing nations can learn 
from the experience of the countries that faced the problem ahead of 
them 
aging in most developing countries has not yet emerged as a 
dominant social phenomenon the by population researcher kevin 
kinsella observes 
but over the next 30 years he points out the balance is 
expected to shift markedly with some 72 percent of older people 
expected to be living in developing nations in the year 2020 
compared to 58 percent today 
those countries have the opportunity to learn from the efforts 
and mistakes made by the industrialized nations of europe and north 
america kinsella reports 
these nations have time to assess demographic projections 
consider structural changes in social institutions such as marriage 
and the family compare and evaluate programmatic responses already 
attempted and in short debate issues before they are branded as 
crises kinsella concluded 
with improved medical care extending lifespans the industrial 
nations of europe and north america have already experienced a sharp 
growth in the proportion of elderly in their populations and the 
needs of these groups for medical and social services 
in many cases however countries have not aged gracefully 
kinsella reports commenting that belated recognition of the problem 
has led to inappropriate and insufficient response on the part of 
governments 
kinsellas study defines older people as those 55 and above 
terming those 65 and over as elderly and referring to the group 
75 and over as the oldest old he notes however that those are 
arbitrary labels and that biological physical and psychological 
aging differ from person to person 
here are some highlights of the study 
the caribbean is the oldest developing area with 117 
percent of its population aged 55 and over asia is next at 104 
percent followed by latin america at 94 percent and africa 70 
percent 
in most developing areas the oldest old those 75 and over are 
increasing faster than the older population in general 
rural areas tend to have higher proportions of older people than 
urban areas 
women outlive men in virtually all areas of the world 
regardless the overall life expectancy thus older women outnumber 
older men and widowhood is a fact of life for most women 
the nature of disease in developing countries is shifting from 
communicable to chronic as populations age the number of disabled 
persons in the third world is likely to grow rapidly and changing 
disease patterns may require a reevaluation of health services 
the relative balance between societys two dependent groups the 
old and young is shifting as declines in fertility reduce the 
number of children while longer lives increase the older segment

national security demands will require startup 
of one of the nuclear weapons production reactors at the 
governments savannah river plant before longterm safety 
improvements are completed according to a department of energy 
report 
the departments three reactors at the plant near aiken sc 
have been shut down due to safety concerns and maintenance needs 
they are the nations only source for tritium a radioactive isotope 
of hydrogen used in modern nuclear warheads 
because tritium decays at a rate of 55 percent a year it needs 
to be regularly replenished 
the report released tuesday deals with the k reactor at savannah 
river energy secretary john s herrington said last week the 
department hoped to restart the reactor this spring or summer 
but the report outlines more than 160 separate tasks for 
restarting the reactor calling for a complete overhaul of training 
safety management operating and inspection procedures 
the measures are judged to require a longerterm improvement 
program that would take several years it said 
the pentagon said tuesday that some weapons in the us nuclear 
arsenal may have to be cannibalized unless at least one of the 
tritiumproducing reactors at savannah river is restarted by the end 
of this summer 
were up against the wall if at least one of those reactors is 
not started by late this summer said defense department spokesman 
lt col richard l oborn he added that ultimately you would have 
to cannibalize weapons you have to get tritium somewhere 
oborn said the pentagon had considered other options such as 
purchasing tritium from britain or france producing tritium in 
small energy department reactors or setting a new policy that would 
allow an increase in tritium decay in existing weapons 
but he said the only viable alternative is to start the 
savannah river reactors 
the washington post reported today that the reagan administration 
has rejected an energy department appeal for additional money to 
repair damaged reactors at the savannah river plant citing reports 
from administration sources it said the department will divert 200 
million from other programs to do the repair work 
rep john spratt dsc a member of the house armed services 
committee said he was planning an inspection trip dec 1516 to 
savannah river im particularly interested in the tritium 
production cycle said spratt whose committee authorizes funding 
for the energy department weapons facilities 
i think theres been a significant change of attitudes at doe 
and theyve put new effort into trying to address the problems they 
have he said 
in another development the department issued a separate report 
providing a preliminary ranking of 155 environmental problems at 16 
sites involved with nuclear weapons production 
this is an important step in categorizing environmental 
problems in our defense complex herrington said in releasing the 
report it will provide the department with the information 
necessary to allocate funds for environmental cleanup in a 
systematic and responsible manner 
the 232page report lists each environmental problem found 
provides a public risk assessment for each and describes what 
action if any is under way to resolve the problem 
the two most serious problems cited dealt with groundwater 
contamination at rocky flats outside denver and the pantex plant 
near amarillo texas they warranted action by the department before 
completion of the survey because of the potential threat they posed 
the report said 
twentysix of the problems ranked fell into a secondary category 
of potentia l public hazards the majority of those problems 
involved wastewater management and liquid discharges

presidentelect george bush is backing away 
from his declaration that the cold war is not over and says he is 
optimistic about reforms adopted by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
bush was flying to new york to join president reagan and 
gorbachev in a twohour meeting on governors island today at a news 
conference tuesday bush emphasized that he would participate as 
vice president not as presidentelect and that reagan would be 
in charge 
the soviets know how our system works and they know that i 
become president on jan 20 bush said 
gorbachev arrived in new york on tuesday just minutes after bush 
completed his news conference in washington the soviet leader said 
he hoped todays talks would lead to an expansion of cooperation 
between moscow and washington 
we have not arranged any formal agenda so either side will be 
free openly and frankly to raise any questions that it wishes to 
gorbachev said with the us government in transition the 
administration has said it does not plan to offer or negotiate any 
new agreements with the soviets 
it is only prudent to review foreign policy and to review 
national security policy and certainly to review our relationship 
with them bush said having said that i will make clear to the 
president gorbachev that we want to go forward but im not going 
to be pressed into going beyond that prudent approach 
with his national security team still being assembled bush said 
he did not want to go charging off without the benefit of those to 
whom im going to look for advice 
during the presidential campaign bush struck a cautious stance 
toward the soviet union complimenting the kremlin on its reforms 
but saying it would be judged by its actions over time 
in a speech last june bush declared weve got to remember the 
cold war is not over we must be bold enough to seize the 
opportunity of change but at the same time as one pundit titled his 
column be prepared for the protracted conflict 
asked tuesday if he still felt the soviets and americans are 
engaged in a cold war bush said im not going to respond in 
terms of those words you have to define for me what you mean by 
cold war 
do we have any differences with the soviets absolutely are 
they regional yeah are they on human rights yes do we have some 
differences on how we ought to approach the arms control agenda 
certainly 
but do i see am i optimistic about what i see in the soviet 
union absolutely bush said 
and you just take a look at the human rights question there 
have been some good forward steps there and i want to see more 
i think we come into a great period of opportunity in terms of 
reduction of regional tensions he added but theres an awful 
lot that the soviets can do to make me feel im right in that i 
think that the arms control agenda is one where we have a chance for 
real progress

scientists studying the greenhouse effect 
causing global warming may be underestimating the warming effect of 
many other processes such as the release of methane gas from arctic 
tundra a government analyst said 
daniel lashof a scientist in the environmental protection 
agencys office of policy analysis reported on studies of effects 
neglected in most computerized climate models at a conference 
tuesday organized by the climate institute 
the institute a nonprofit body supported by government 
foundation and corporate grants tries to call attention to issues 
affecting the climate such as the greenhouse effect or the expected 
warming of the earth caused by the accumulation in the atmosphere of 
gases that trap heat that normally would escape into space 
the most important of these gases is carbon dioxide formed in the 
burning of fossil fuels 
such a warming could cause sea levels to rise and flood coastal 
areas and lead to stronger hurricanes drastic shifts in rainfall 
the northward migration of agricultural zones and more frequent 
droughts 
a widely used prediction is for an eventual warming of between 
27 degrees fahrenheit and 81 degrees sometime in the middle of the 
next century 
lashof used a computer model that yielded a prediction of 27 
degrees to 99 degrees before he incorporated additional 
biogeochemical processes that increased warming might stimulate 
the central prediction from this model was for a warming of 63 
degrees 
the augmented model yielded a central prediction for 175degree 
warming 112 degrees more than the original model the range was 
from 4 degrees to what lashof called unknown territory where he 
declined to report a prediction 
three quite speculative processes accounted for 85 percent of 
the 112degree increase in lashofs central prediction 
the release of large quantities of methane also a heattrapping 
gas from warming arctic tundra 
decreased reflection of sunshine back into space from changes in 
the vegetative cover of the earth 
a sharp decline in the oceans ability to absorb carbon dioxide 
other minor processes included such effects as increase methane 
emissions from rice paddies and swamps as temperature rises more 
fossil fuel use to generate electricity to meet higher demand for 
air conditioning changes in ocean currents and changes in ocean 
chemistry 
one of the additional effects lashof studied would slow rather 
than speed the warming trend he described it as enhanced growth of 
vegetation resulting from more atmospheric carbon dioxide this 
would evaporate more moisture and cool the atmosphere slightly he 
said

the labor department is advising employers who 
plan plant closings or large layoffs in february to heed the terms 
of new legislation and begin providing 60 days advance notice now 
the law formally the worker adjustment and retraining 
notification or warn act does not take effect until feb 4 
but the labor department said in an interim interpretive rule 
that courts might later decide that employers planning layoffs on 
that date or immediately afterwards should have given the notices 60 
days beforehand or as early as dec 6 
unions which won the legislation last summer after a 15year 
fight in the congress favor an interpretation that any worker 
losing a job to a plant closing or layoff of 50 people or more as of 
feb 4 is required to be informed in writing 60 days beforehand 
however some business groups have interpreted the law as not 
requiring the notices to begin until feb 4 for closings or 
layoffs planned for april 5 or afterwards 
a third interpretation is that for the first 60 days after the 
law takes effect the length of the advance notices is limited to 
the number of days between feb 4 and when the plant closing or 
layoffs actually occur 
for example under this interpretation a layoff occurring march 
6 1989 would require only 30 days advance notice to the affected 
workers and local government officials 
the labor department said in a federal register notice that all 
three interpretations have merit 
but until final regulations are issued or more likely the 
question is resolved in court it said employers are best advised 
to proceed conservatively and to provide notice as early as dec 
6 in view of this possible liability 
no notice is required for layoffs or plant closings that occur 
between now and feb 4 
the law was passed by congress in july and enacted aug 4 without 
the signature of president reagan who called it a step in the 
wrong direction congress directed that the law take effect six 
months after enactment 
the legislation was in response to estimates from the bureau of 
labor statistics that an average 22 million workers a year lost 
their jobs to plant closings and mass layoffs during the first half 
of the decade 
government studies showed that more than half of those workers 
received less than two weeks advance notice and that only 18 percent 
of employers provided three weeks or more notice 
the labor department has been advising business groups since 
october that they should look upon dec 6 as the day to start 
providing the notices so have major business groups which opposed 
the law including the us chamber of commerce and national 
association of manufacturers 
sue meisinger a vice president for the american society of 
personnel administration said the effective date that notices are 
required is one of several ambiguities in the law 
youre going to find out how the ambiguities work out only 
after litigation she said there are a lot of issues to be 
played out over time a lot of employers are going to find out how 
the law works only after they get slapped with a civil complaint 
because the law does not empower any agency to enforce it 
failure to comply with it can be addressed only through federal 
civil suits filed by affected employees unions or local governments 
the courts can order up to 60 days in back pay and benefits plus 
attorneys fees to affected workers and fines of up to 30000 
payable to local governments not notified as required by the law 
the law forbids companies with 100 or more fulltime workers at 
any one location from ordering a plant closed or a mass layoff 
involving 50 or more people until 60 days after they have provided 
written notice to the affected employees union representatives and 
local government officials 
exempted from coverage are companies with fewer than 100 
fulltime workers temporary layoffs of less than six months and 
layoffs caused by natural disasters such as last summers drought 
employers also do not have to provide advance notice if the 
layoffs were caused by strikes or lockouts or unforeseeable business 
circumstances such as the unexpected cancellation of a major 
contract

the boards of several large corporations and is active in legal 
associations 
mrs hills was ambitious and hardworking even as a young girl

hills insisted on spending two hours every evening with her family 
when the children were young 
she said it was a challenge to juggle demands of both career and 
family i used to say that sometimes i feel like a long piece of 
salami with a slice here for one and a slice here for another and 
there isnt enough to go around she said 
shes combined being a wife and mother with fantastic 
contributions to society a former roommate beatrice herrick 
said several years ago

as the trade representative mrs hills will be confronted by 
numerous challenges involving complex international negotiations

on the surface the biography of robert mosbacher 
sr reads just like george bushs born to a wealthy northeastern 
family attended prep school and ventured off to texas to make 
millions in the oil business 
both also have been successful in mixing their money and oil with 
politics but until now mosbacher has been content to stay in the 
background raising the money to finance the political career of his 
friend of more than 30 years 
on tuesday bush announced he was bringing his acquaintance from 
texas days into the government as secretary of commerce in the bush 
administration 
a friend of long standing a very successful leader in the 
business community bush termed him at a news conference 
mosbacher 61 has raised campaign funds for bush in every 
political race he has entered since his second unsuccessful campaign 
for the senate in 1970 
mosbacher served as bushs finance chairman during the 
presidential campaign and raised nearly 20 million to help the vice 
president secure the nomination he also was chairman of the 
republican partys team 100 program that raised 24 million from 
individuals and corporations in 100000 donations he and his 
companies directly contributed 47600 to the republican national 
committee 
like bush mosbacher came to texas to learn about the oil 
business and invest family money bush learned the ways of the oil 
patch and helped establish tiny zapata petroleum co which later 
became pennzoil co mosbacher established mosbacher petroleum co 
in houston 
mosbacher split from his father and older brother explaining i 
may not be a very much of a leader but im a lousy follower bush 
also struck out on his own as a young man 
mosbachers father emil began as a runner for the american 
stock exchange and soon began trading on the exchange himself by 
age 21 he was a millionaire the elder mosbacher also managed to 
liquidate before the market crash of 1929 
in an effort to teach his sons to be stern the father sent 
robert and older brother emil jr to strict prep schools robert 
attended the choate school in wallingford conn and got them 
interested in sailing to instill competition 
in 1948 at age 21 with an economic degree from washington and lee 
university a pregnant wife and about 500000 from his father 
robert left the family home in suburban white plains ny and 
headed to texas 
forty years later with interests also in real estate and 
ranching mosbacher is worth an estimated 200 million he lives 
near houstons exclusive river oaks neighborhood with his third 
wife socialite georgette mosbacher who recently purchased la 
prairie skin care company for 35 million 
the couple have been married three years she was once married to 
george barrie former owner of faberge and is a former vice 
president of brut productions a faberge division 
mosbacher 61 becomes the third texan named to bushs cabinet 
bush previously named his campaign chairman james a baker iii of 
houston as secretary of state and retained lauro cavazos of lubbock 
as secretary of education former texas sen john tower also is 
being considered for secretary of defense

was the finance cochairman of the national republican party 
in 1964 he headed a committee oil men for bush during bushs 
unsuccessful bid for the senate and served on bushs finance 
committee during his second unsuccessful race for the senate in 1970 
it was mosbacher and baker who persuaded bush to withdraw from 
the 1980 presidential race so he could be considered for the vice 
presidential nomination by ronald reagan 
bush has described mosbacher as a close confidant ad a 
friend 
mosbachers fundraising abilities have brought him into the 
elite of the republican party he took over fords campaign when the 
coffers were almost empty after david w packard resigned following 
three unsuccessful months he immediately asked for help from his 
own list of 1700 people in the end mosbacher raised over 14 
million about 25 million more than president carter raised 
among the tasks facing the new secretary will be the 
implementation of the new freetrade agreement between the united 
states and canada assuming the canadians ratify it 
even though most of mosbachers life has been centered on the oil 
and gas business fellow independent oilman michel halbouty of 
houston is confident he will do a good job 
he has a very good business mind he knows the relationship of 
foreign trade and domestic trade hes traveled the world and has a 
broad viewpoint of other countries halbouty said of mosbacher 
whom he has known for 35 years 
you can bring a problem to him and hell listen he can get 
along with just anybody he has a strong affinity to people

economist michael j boskin selected by 
george bush on tuesday to head the presidents council of economic 
advisers was a key architect of bushs flexible freeze approach 
to deficit reduction 
boskin 43 a highly regarded stanford university professor 
helped develop the plan while serving as a top bush campaign adviser 
on economic matters 
the political beauty of the flexiblefreeze plan is that it 
doesnt commit bush to any specific budget cuts instead it calls 
for the growth in overall government spending to be held to the rate 
of inflation 
critics of the plan have charged that it is unworkable and would 
force draconian reductions in some areas of domestic spending to 
make up for faster growth in such programs as social security which 
bush has vowed to leave untouched 
but in a washington speech tuesday boskin defended the flexible 
freeze and predicted it would be able to balance the budget around 
1993 depending on how fast the economy grows in the next few years 
i think you will see the bush administration take strong action 
on the budget deficit quickly after the inauguration and i think it 
will be on the spending side of the budget consistent with the 
flexible freeze boskin said at a policy conference sponsored by 
the american enterprise institute 
i can assure you that people who are very careful with numbers 
myself included have gone over this and it is eminently doable 
he said so the accusations that this doesnt add up are kind of 
silly and not based on economic reality 
boskin has washington experience working as a consultant to the 
defense treasury labor and old health education and welfare 
departments as well as serving on a host of task forces 
a native of new york boskin moved to los angeles with his family 
when he was 6 his father was working as a construction contractor 
his mother as a bookkeeper and then an accountant he studied 
economics at the university of california at berkeley where he was 
named the outstanding graduate of the class of 1967 
boskin wrote his doctoral dissertation on the effects of welfare 
and other incomemaintenance programs on the size of the labor force 
he is described today as a hardline republican but at berkeley 
in the tumultuous 60s boskin was known as quite liberal 
i was sympathetic with the goals freedom of speech civil 
rights and i still am he said earlier this year but i was 
not sympathetic with the methods such as student sitins and 
strikes 
he went from berkeley to stanford where he has been ever since 
except for a year of teaching at harvard a decade ago and brief 
periodic consulting jobs for congress 
besides his unpaid campaign work for bush this year boskin has 
been busy writing two books on economics teaching a graduate course 
in fiscal policy and an introductory economics course and acting as 
west coast director of the national bureau of economic research a 
think tank 
while he acknowledges that growth in wages has fallen behind the 
pace of the 1950s and 60s he contends it is a byproduct of rapid 
job growth and says overall living standards have not declined 
we have the beginning of some major transformations in the role 
of government in the economy weve had success in reducing marginal 
tax rates we have to build on what we have boskin said 
boskin was sharply critical of president reagans early policies 
in his book entitled reagan and the economy the successes 
failures and unfinished agenda 
but like bush who eight years ago branded reagans campaign 
promises voodoo economics boskin joined the team and now saves 
his barbs for the democrats like bush boskin opposes a general tax 
increase under any circumstances 
im concerned that a big tax increase could lead to a sharp 
slowdown in the economy or that a major new round of spending could 
create major new future problems he said 
boskin is among those who persuaded bush to advocate cutting the 
capitalgains tax rate he also played a key role in bushs call for 
individual savings accounts a plan ridiculed by the democrats 
and some economists during the campaign the savings plan would 
offer taxdeferred interest to low and middleincome americans on 
longterm savings deposits

william webster who was second choice as fbi 
director a decade ago and again as cia director in 1987 has led 
both agencies out of the shadow of scandal 
presidentelect george bush asked webster on tuesday to continue 
to head the nations top foreign intelligence agency 
webster 64 pledged at his confirmation hearings last year to 
keep members of congressional oversight committees fully informed of 
cia activities his predecessor the late william casey had been 
criticized for hiding details of the irancontra affair from 
congress

build and lead our national intelligence community bush said in 
announcing websters reappointment bush who led the cia himself 
for a year under president ford said websters appointment was 
openended 
webster announced before his confirmation that to avoid the 
appearance of being a political animal he had asked to have the 
cia directors post removed from the presidents cabinet casey had 
been the first cia director to serve at the cabinet level the cia 
job is to remain a noncabinet position under bush 
webster a former federal judge from st louis who had headed the 
fbi for nine years was picked by president reagan for the cia job 
after deputy cia director robert m gates had his nomination 
withdrawn because of senate questions about his role in the 
irancontra affair 
webster agreed during confirmation hearings to review gates 
testimony to congress on the affair but deterimined he did nothing 
that should prevent him from continuing as deputy gates also is to 
remain in the no 2 cia post in the bush administration agency 
spokesman bill baker said 
webster a republican was nominated in 1978 by democratic 
president carter to head the fbi whose two previous directors had 
been embroiled in political controversy he was nominated after 
frank m johnson jr another federal judge withdrew his name 
because of ill health 
the fbis image had been sullied by revelations of personal 
vendettas the bureau carried out for the late j edgar hoover 
illegal surveillance of vietnam war protesters and actions by acting 
director l patrick gray iii to hamper investigations into the 
unfolding watergate scandal in the early 1970s 
in nine years asfbi director webster was popular with congress 
his confirmation to become the 14th head of the cia passed 
unanimously in the senate intelligence committee and was approved 
941 by the full senate 
in 18 months at the cia helm webster has improved the agencys 
relations with congress he has pledged to disclose to congressional 
leaders in all but the most pressing circumstances covert foreign 
intelligence activities within 48 hours after the president approves 
them 
sen david boren dokla the intelligence committee chairman 
praised websters reappointment saying the director had helped 
restore public confidence in the cia during a very troubling 
period 
last march webster told a congressional committee he had 
reorganized the spy agency to improve counterintelligence and 
strengthen security at us embassies 
webster who grew up in the st louis suburb of webster groves 
mo received a bachelors degree from amherst college and a law 
degree in 1949 from washington university in st louis 
he served briefly as us attorney for eastern missouri and was 
appointed to the us district court bench by president nixon in 
1971 and to the 8th us circuit court of appeals in 1973

thomas pickering selected by presidentelect 
george bush as ambassador to the united nations is a veteran of 29 
years service in the foreign service with ambassadorships in el 
salvador israel jordan and nigeria 
pickering 57 is currently ambassador to israel where he can 
indulge his interest in archaeology and is trying to add hebrew to 
the languages in which he is already proficient french spanish 
arabic and swahili 
if confirmed by the senate pickering will replace vernon 
walters who spent 3 years at the united nations after serving as 
ambassador at large during president reagans first term in office 
pickerings primary experience is in the middle east where he 
also was ambassador to jordan from 1974 to 1978 during president 
jimmy carters administration 
jordans king hussein called pickering the best american 
ambassador ive ever dealt with 
his service earlier in this decade in nigeria and knowledge of 
swahili will help him in his dealings with africa the largest 
regional bloc at the united nations 
but pickering may be best known for the attention surrounding his 
choice as ambassador to el salvador in 1983 
secretary of state george p shultz was not keen on a potential 
candidate for the salvador post being recommended by national 
security council aides 
to head off that choice shultz was determined to come up with an 
alternate candidate he reviewed the departments list of its 
highestranked career diplomats 
near the top was pickering shultz selected him sensing that an 
experienced hand was needed in el salvador at a time when the 
country was undergoing a difficult transition to democratic rule 
with both an active rebel movement and rightwing death squads 
proliferating 
led by sen jesse helms rnc conservatives fought pickerings 
assignment as ambassador to el salvador objecting to his previous 
ties to carter administration policies 
helms and other conservatives objected to carters policies 
toward third world countries including treaties that the critics 
felt did not adequately protect us interests agreements that set 
standards for deep sea mining barred the use of the moon for 
military purposes and set fishing agreements with canada and latin 
american countries 
pickering cut short his tour of duty in nigeria and accepted the 
assignment in el salvador where he remained until he was sent to 
israel in 1985 
in wartorn el salvador pickering took a low key approach to the 
job but ran into controversy anyway 
helms wanted pickering dismissed from that job claiming 
pickering had interfered with elections in the latin american 
nation to the detriment of rightwing candidates an allegation 
pickering denied 
ultimately when pickering was named to the israel 
ambassadorship helms voted for him saying his objections in the el 
salvador matter had been related to us policy rather than to 
pickerings capabilities 
pickering was ambassador to nigeria in 1981 to 1983 and 
assistant secretary of state for oceans and international 
environmental and scientific affairs in 1978 to 1981 
he was ambassador to jordan from 1974 to 1978 and previously 
served in a variety of state department and other foreign service 
posts 
he was deputy chief of mission in dar es salaam the capital of 
tanzania from 1967 to 1969 and was principal officer in zanzibar 
now part of tanzania from 1965 to 1967

the portrayal of alcoholic beverages in 
national advertising likely contributes to underage drinking and 
government limits on such ads eventually may be needed according to 
a group studying alcohol use by minors 
the national commission against drunken driving suggested in a 
report released tuesday that if the alcohol and advertising 
industries do not impose reforms legislation should be enacted to 
regulate alcohol beverage advertising 
the panel did not say what kind of regulation it envisioned or 
how much time the industry should be given to make changes in its 
alcohol advertising 
the report is part of a continuing examination by the commission 
of efforts to curb drunken driving the commission was formed five 
years ago to continue where a presidential commission on drunken 
driving left off 
during a series of public hearings around the country repeated 
testimony from teenagers indicated a link between advertisements 
and a widespread view among young people that alcohol is a normal 
part of a social event the report said 
with near unanimity the youths themselves declared that 
advertising encourages adolescents to drink the commission said 
vj adduci commission chairman said at a news conference the 
panel was not suggesting the need for immediate government 
intervention in alcoholic beverage advertising but wanted to send a 
message to the industries involved to take a look at your 
advertising and act like a parent when putting together ads 
widely watched by youngsters too young to legally purchase alcoholic 
drinks 
bob hallahan a spokesman for the national association of 
broadcasters said his group agreed with adducis comments hes 
not looking for any legislation but with working with the 
industry said hallahan he noted that his organization which 
opposes advertising curbs also is represented on the commission 
a spokeswoman for the association of national advertisers said 
the group would have no comment because it had not seen the 
commission report officials of the beer institute could not be 
reached for comment tuesday 
the commission report summarizing the results of its five public 
hearings said that despite grassroots efforts against drunken 
driving laws in every state against minors purchasing alcoholic 
beverages and many antidrunken driving programs young people 
continue to drink and drive with alarming frequency 
as a result young people continue to be involved in 
alcoholrelated crashes at disproportionately high rates the 
commission said a young person under the legal drinking age 
remains nearly twice as likely to die in an alcoholrelated crash as 
an adult over 21 
the report noted that between 1982 and 1987 the number of 
alcoholrelated fatalities among people under 21 declined by 219 
percent but drinking and driving continues to be the number one 
killer of teenagers 
last year the alcoholrelated highway fatality rate was 19 per 
100000 for those under 21 years of age compared to 11 per 100000 
for those 21 years or older the report said it said while youth 
under 21 years of age account for only 8 percent of the total 
driving population they account for 17 percent of the drivers 
involved in alcoholrelated fatal highway crashes 
the report included these other conclusions based on testimony 
at the public hearings 
drinking is endemic among american youths and alcoholic 
beverages remain easily accessible to youth under 21 
peer pressure encourages young people to drink and leads many 
adolescents to consider alcohol a necessary accompaniment to social 
events 
advertising normalizes alcohol consumption and makes it more 
difficult to raise concerns about alcohol abuse 
in a letter to president reagan accompanying the release of the 
report adduci the commission chairman wrote 
it is not enough to lament the thousands of young lives that 
are lost each year on american highways we must end the senseless 
behavior that makes alcoholrelated crashes the american way to die 
for youth of driving age

alexandria va ap political extremist lyndon h larouches 
fundraisers warned of soviet missiles aids international bankers 
and illicit drugs to persuade a skeptical texas retiree to make 
25000 in loans that were never repaid 
the highpressure telephone tactics used on max harrell of 
pasadena texas were disclosed tuesday at larouches mail and tax 
fraud conspiracy trial in us district court 
harrell said he taped the conversations with fundraisers rebecca 
jones and paul greenberg because he had never received the promised 
quarterly interest payments on his first 10000 loan in april 1986 
i was a bit nervous about getting these loans repaid he told 
government prosecutors 
the lawyers quoted greenberg as telling harrell during one phone 
call that all those dollars and cents you are hanging onto wont 
matter a whit if the world collapsed 
the transcript of another recorded conversation between harrell 
and ms jones quoted the fundraiser as saying 
in the scope of human history what youre going to be 
remembered for is not whether you got 10 or 15 percent right in 
scope of human history what youre going to be remembered for is 
that you had the foresight and the courage to back a fight to save 
not only this nation but western civilization 
when harrell balked at making another loan to the larouche 
organization ms jones warned that the russians are churning out 
three icbms every 48 hours and said money was needed to see the 
international bankers defeated 
she also cited the aids epidemic and larouches war against 
drugs money for us is simply the means to do what weve got to do 
politically and the point right now is if we can escalate now we 
can turn the corner she said 
harrell complained that he was doing a perpetual give as it is 
with these loans but ms jones assured him that the loans 
youre gonna get back 
yeah she said youre taking a risk but ive never said 
anything other than that so its not like im trying to screw you 
out of your money 
harrell said he agreed reluctantly to extend two additional loans 
because even though retired he could afford it 
but he told questioners that he had received not a penny of 
repayment 
harry chusid an accountant and auditor for the internal revenue 
service testified tuesday that his search of computer files at 
larouche headquarters in leesburg va indicated that 333 million 
had been borrowed from individual supporters from 1983 until 
larouches offices were raided by federal agents in october 1986 
chusid said 37 million in interest and principal had been 
repaid during the same period 
larouche a perennial minorparty presidential candidate and six 
associates including greenberg are charged with mail fraud and 
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than 30 million in loans with 
no intention of repaying them 
larouche is charged separately with conspiracy to defraud the irs 
by having all his personal expenses paid by various corporations he 
controls and failing to file federal income tax returns since 1978 
larouche denies any wrongdoing if convicted on all 13 counts 
against him he faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and 
fines totaling 325 million 
wayne hintz a former larouche finance officer testified tuesday 
that he resigned in june 1986 when he came to the conclusion that 
the growing number of loans to the larouche organization werent 
going to be repaid 
but hintz said he was unaware of any official policy against 
honoring the terms of the loans which he said had swollen from 10 
million to about 40 million during 1985 alone

mikhail gorbachev wanted to take a bite out of 
the big apple his aides said and todays meanderings seemed 
certain to give him a pungent taste seeds and all 
the soviet leader is seeing the city at its best with crisp fall 
air bright christmas lights and for him at least wide open 
streets its a great time to be a tourist especially with a 45car 
motorcade and full police escort 
hes likely to remember the glint of light off the statue of 
liberty the daylong dusk of wall street the stomachplunging 
elevator ride to the top of the world trade center and the 
breathtaking view from the top of the 110story skyscraper 
but new york is never pristine and theres been no frantic 
effort to change that no one has been filling in potholes painting 
over graffiti or sedating city denizens 
gorbachevs new york slide show could include hulking tenements 
on the lower east side tawdry porn shops in times square and maybe 
just maybe some of the citys legions of homeless people 
ironically he may have avoided an encounter with the homeless by 
passing up a visit to glittering trump tower robert hayes a 
spokesman for the coalition for the homeless said there had been 
plans to mount a demonstration until his group learned that 
gorbachev apparently had declined tycoon donald trumps invitation 
hayes accused police on the east side where the united nations 
and the soviet mission are located of persuading homeless people 
to migrate to the west side out of gorbachevs sight 
according to hayes one officer reportedly told a homeless man 
go west young man 
but a police spokesman detective joseph mcconville said he was 
unaware of such tactics why would we do that he asked 
todays itinerary included the united nations where few new 
yorkers go and governors island where few new yorkers are 
permitted its a coast guard base particularly at a lunch with 
president reagan and presidentelect george bush 
other snapshots from the gorbachev camera during his twoday 
visit could include carnegie halls understated facade and that 
bright red restaurant next door the russian tea room where the 
spirit of the imperial romanovs is alive and well 
theres the brooklyn bridge and the manhattan bridge the fdr 
drive and broadway central park and battery park and tiny gen 
douglas macarthur park 
and then theres the metropolitan museum one of the spots 
gorbachev was reportedly eager to see the description in the 
american institute of architects guide to new york could stand as a 
description for the city gorbachev is getting to know 
it is a rich and exciting melange the guidebook says of the 
metropolitans exterior exciting grand controversial often 
elegant sometimes banal mandatory contribution on entry

dan quayle is seeking insights on the vice 
presidency from walter mondale a democrat who held the job for four 
years under president jimmy carter 
the vice presidentelect was meeting over breakfast this morning 
at his office with mondale for the second in a series of discussions 
with men who have held the job 
quayle met with former president richard nixon last week nixon 
served as vice president to dwight eisenhower and he will see 
former president gerald ford next week said press spokesman jeff 
nesbit ford was nixons second vice president 
the purpose of the meeting with mondale who along with carter 
was much maligned by quayle during the campaign is to discuss the 
office of the vice presidency whats possible whats not 
said nesbit 
mondale a former senator from minnesota ran unsuccessfully for 
president against president reagan in 1984 losing in a landslide 
that saw mondale win only the district of columbia and his home 
state 
among the topics will be the vice presidents role as president 
of the senate quayle is interested in exploring ways to develop and 
expand the position 
quayle also has selected veteran time magazine correspondent 
david beckwith to be his press secretary when he takes office as 
vice president 
beckwith who has been with time since 1969 recently covered the 
bush campaign for 15 months he was considered for an appointment as 
bushs white house press secretary but that job went to current 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater who had worked in that 
capacity for bush before reagan tapped him 
the reporter said he is looking at the position with quayle as 
a great opportunity for me 
noting the barrage of negative press that has rained down on the 
indiana senator since bush selected him beckwith said some of that 
negativity is unjustified 
ive talked to him a lot over the last couple weeks i realize 
hes a lot better than his press notices would make him appear 
beckwith said 
beckwith a chicago native also formerly worked for the 
minneapolis star and the houston chronicle he has a law degree from 
the university of texas a masters in journalism from columbia 
university and an undergraduate degree from carleton college in

there is no scientific evidence to support the 
common belief that childrens homework done while watching 
television is of poorer quality than homework done with the box 
turned off two psychologists have asserted 
the surprising findings are contained in a paper the impact on 
childrens education influence on cognitive development 
distributed by the us department of educations office of 
educational research and improvement 
the authors university of massachusetts psychology professor 
daniel r anderson and graduate student patricia a collins did not 
conduct original research or studies with children they said the 
research literature behind many common assertions about televisions 
impact on children is sparse 
but their reading of the available studies led them to the 
following conclusions 
there is no evidence that television has a mesmerizing effect 
on childrens attention caused by color movement and visual 
changes 
contrary to popular assertions children are cognitively 
active during television viewing and attempt to form a coherent 
connected understanding of television programs 
there is no evidence that children generally get 
overstimulated by television 
television viewing generally displaces not reading but movie 
attendance radio listening comic book reading and participation in 
organized sports 
there is no evidence that homework done during television 
viewing is of lower quality than homework done in silence 
there is little evidence to show that television viewing reduces 
childrens attention span and some indicating it may actually 
increase their ability to focus attention 
there is no evidence that television makes children 
cognitively passive 
there is some weak evidence that television availability 
reduces reading achievement but if so this appears to occur 
during the early elementary school years and is probably temporary 
in sum the authors said the research literature provides 
little support for most of the common beliefs about the influence of 
television 
american children send an average of 12 to 25 hours a week 
watching television 
lest parents despair of ever weaning their offspring from the 
tube they can point to tests that show those who spent the most 
hours each day in front of the television generally performed well 
below average 
according to a national assessment of educational progress 
reading test given in 1984 9yearolds who watched six hours or 
more of television a day scored sharply lower than those who watched 
less but there was little difference between those who watched less 
than two hours of television per day and those who watched three to 
five hours 
among 13 and 17yearolds tested reading scores went up as 
television watching went down with those who watched two hours or 
less scoring higher than those who watched three to five hours and 
the latter outscoring those who watched six hours or more 
chester e finn jr until recently the assistant secretary of 
education for research and improvement said in an interview 
weve known for a long time that some tv is good for some kids 
for the most disadvantaged kids some tv actually appears to 
increase their cultural literacy 
finn who read a draft of the andersoncollins study last summer 
said this tends to exonerate television more than common sense 
and my own intuition and other research ive read over the years 
would seem to warrant

president raul alfonsin says the 
third military uprising in 20 months had its origins with soldiers 
low pay poor equipment and resentment of their censure by society 
for harshly repressing guerrilla activities in the 1970s 
in his longest remarks on the fourday insurrection that ended 
sunday and a rare speech on the military the man whose election in 
1983 ended eight years of military rule defended his lengthy 
resolution of the crisis 
the convincing and persuading took so long precisely because no 
condition was accepted alfonsin was quoted as telling leaders of 
the coninagro farm cooperatives tuesday in a speech at the state 
bank of the nation 
a dialogue of more than two hours is better than a battle 
even if it lasted just five minutes which could have cost argentine 
lives alfonsin said we should thank god that all this could be 
solved without having to lament the deaths of hundreds of argentines 
 
three people died in the uprising the bloodiest of the three 
revolts sparked by the military since april 1987 three soldiers 
were wounded by a rebel mine blast in last januarys uprising 
meanwhile the 6th mechanized infantry regiment at mercedes 
remained in rebel hands tuesday although maj hugo avete said he 
was simply was awaiting his replacement by a new commander which 
was expected later today the government news agency telam reported 
the base 62 miles west of the capital is in the process of 
being normalized defense ministry spokesman faustino altamirano 
said 
rebel commander col mohamed ali seineldin remained in detention 
at a military garrison in buenos aires the approximately 500 troops 
who had rallied to his side at the campo de mayo army base in 
suburban buenos aires have returned to their units altamirano said 
an investigation will take place to clear up who was 
responsible for what and they will be punished altamirano said 
sixtythree coast guardsmen who sided with seineldin were 
imprisoned at the campo de mayo federal judge alberto piotti was to 
begin interrogating them thursday 
alfonsin noted that it is up to the courts not him to resolve 
one of the rebels key demands an end to the prosecution of 
officers for human rights abuses committed during the 197683 
military dictatorship 
at least 8900 suspected leftists were arrested by security 
forces and vanished according to a commission appointed by 
alfonsin the disappeared are presumed executed 
rebels also demanded a shakeup in the army command including 
according to local news agencies that cite military and rebel 
sources the removal of army chief of staff gen jose dante caridi 
caridi might well have to go the englishlanguage buenos 
aires herald said tuesday in an editorial because of his failure 
to anticipate this crisis and because of the extreme reluctance of 
many army units to adopt action stations thus denoting lack of 
control over his force 
alfonsin denounced critics who have wondered aloud whether a 
secret deal was made with the rebels he was quoted as calling them 
vampires who apparently feel sad because solutions were 
arrived at without the spilling of blood 
such doubts stem from the disinclination of loyalist troops to 
fire on rebels during the uprsing and the maintenance of army bases 
in rebel hands after the insurrrection was declared over sunday by 
the government 
after the april 1987 insurrection led by cashiered lt col aldo 
rico threequarters of the armys top generals were retired and 
legislation was passed that limited the prosecution of officers for 
rights abuses 
alfonsin also declared then that rebels had surrendered 
unconditionally

electronic information about government services and operations 
the two cities and the county are taking part in a computerbased 
pilot program that gives people easier access to local government 
officials said at the national league of cities convention tueday 
the projects cost was not released 
computerized communications between residents and government may 
seem impersonal but officials said the technology is a convenient 
efficient way to provide more better information 
using equipment donated by international business machines inc 
the three jurisdictions made the information services available this 
year the project was organized by public technology inc of 
washington the leagues nonprofit research and development arm 
in kansas city computer kiosks with a color screen that displays 
information and pictures have been set up in two malls for about a 
year connected directly to city hall 
residents can touch a screen and get information on recreational 
events licenses and permits complaints about police traffic or 
trash pickup neighborhood services government meetings or city 
jobs the computers have averaged 700 touches daily and are on line 
15 hours a day 
in a survey of the computer users more than half said they had 
never been to city hall for the kind of information available in the 
computer during a onemonth period requests for information on 
recreational events totaled 1880 compared with 398 complaints 
well be where they do business said sandra charbonier 
citizen action center manager for hillsborough county which 
includes tampa they wont have to come to where we do business 
charlotte established a telephone system in which people calling 
some city hall departments hear recorded messages that direct them 
to press numbers to select specific information or record a message 
of their own the result has been better response time from 
officials such as building inspectors who get messages from 
contractors 
not everyone is willing to accept oneway communication for 
information said boyd cauble executive assistant to the city 
manager i see the system being made available to pay bills by 
entering credit card numbers getting permits exchanging 
information all this requires a tremendous amount of refinement of 
the system and a tremendous amount of public education

president reagan has lifted a sixyear ban on 
us export of cluster bombs to israel on the understanding that the 
weapons will not be used against civilian targets 
the decision was denounced by ambassador clovis maksoud the 
league of arab nations representative in the united states who 
called it shocking very provocative and sickening 
reagan banned the sale of such munitions to israel after that 
country used them against civilian target areas in lebanon in 
violation of israeli assurances to the united states 
state department spokeswoman anita stockman said tuesday that 
because the issue of usage has been resolved pursuant to the terms 
of the recent understanding barring use against civilians we 
see no reason to prohibit israels access to these weapons which can 
contribute to israels security

budget cuts as inefficient and dangerous 
members of congress who call for defense reductions say little

conform to their version of political reality adm william j

crowe said in a speech he wants to help improve pentagon 
management and to convince congress that stable financing instead of

crowe said that while changes may be called for it would be a

israel has jailed human rights workers for 
months and violated international law by transporting palestinians 
detained without trial to a desert camp inside israel a usbased 
human rights group charged today 
the lawyers committee for human rights made the allegations in a 
95page report that features testimony from six palestinian lawyers 
and human rights workers as well as interviews with israeli 
officials 
the report accuses israel of arresting palestinian human rights 
workers on secret charges and outlines israeli abuses in the ketziot 
prison established during the yearlong palestinian revolt against 
israelis 21year occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
ketziots location in a remote part of israel proper its 
extremely harsh desert climate and its crowded inhumane living 
conditions combine to create an untenable environment in which to 
maintain longterm detainees the report by the new yorkbased 
group says 
the detention of residents of the occupied territories in 
israel proper is contrary to the fourth geneva convention the 
1949 convention states that detainees in an occupied country may not 
be moved to another country 
ketziot where more than 2000 detainees from the west bank and 
gaza are believed held is in the heart of israels southern negev 
desert 
last week ketziot inmates staged a twoday hunger strike arab 
reports said the strike was to protest harsh prison conditions on 
tuesday palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied lands 
in solidarity with the detainees 
the lawyers committee report alleges that arabs are routinely 
forced to stand in the sweltering desert heat for hours water 
supplies are inadequate and prisoners are sometimes beaten 
ketziot inmates made similar complaints when an associated press 
reporter visited the prison in june 
the report quotes army chief of staff lt gen dan shomron as 
saying the location may be a contradiction of the geneva 
convention but that israel has the right to transfer prisoners 
into a sovereign part of the country 
shomron also said the army is trying to improve conditions at the 
prison but that conditions are harsh 
its not a hotel he was quoted as saying 
the report says four palestinian fieldworkers for alhaq an 
arabrun human rights group based in the occupied west bank were 
detained for over six months on secret charges the administrative 
detention without charge of four alhaq fieldworkers is a serious 
blow to independent human rights monitoring in the west bank 
the report alleges that israel circumvents the legal process by 
routinely detaining palestinians on the basis of secret evidence 
the secret evidence is not made available to detainees or 
their lawyers and therefore can not be effectively challenged by 
counsel 
an army spokesman said he had not yet received the report and 
could not comment on its findings 
alhaq issued a report monday challenging israeli claims that the 
army was using lawful measures to quell the rebellion in which 319 
palestinians and 11 israelis have died since last dec 8 
the lawyers committee for human rights was established in 1978 
and has investigated human rights abuses in more than 25 countries

the us dollar rose against the japanese yen 
wednesday while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange rose 
sharply to a record high as the key index closed about 30000 for 
the first time 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which gained 5470 points for 
a record closing high the previous day added another 38144 points 
or 129 percent to finish trading at 3005082 yen 
the dollar closed at 12243 yen up 089 yen from tuesdays close 
of 12154 yen opening at 12182 yen the currency gradually rose 
while ranging between 12182 yen and 12260 yen it was the first 
time that the dollar rose back beyond the 122yen mark since nov 
29 when it finished at 12215 yen 
traders said the dollars strength stemmed from speculation that 
the united states and the soviet union would reach agreement on 
reducing conventional military forces during soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs visit to new york 
the dollar began rising gradually after the opening and 
participants continued to buy after it reached the 122yen level 
said a currency dealer at the bank of tokyo speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
he said recent bearish sentiment toward the dollar on the tokyo 
market had declined because of the upcoming ussoviet summit talks 
in new york 
gorbachev is scheduled to meet with president reagan and to 
address the un general assembly 
the dollars upturn in tokyo also followed news indicating that 
the us budget deficit may be reduced currency dealers said 
michael boskin chosen by presidentelect george bush to be his 
chief economic adviser reportedly said bush will take strong 
action on the deficit on the spending side of the budget 
on the tokyo stock exchange share prices rose mainly because of 
an overnight gain in the dow jones industrial average in new york 
dealers said 
stock investors also were encouraged by the announcement tuesday 
of a 22 percent gain in the japanese gross national product in the 
third quarter over the previous threemonth period dealers said 
the gnp rose 93 percent on an annual basis during the quarter

us officials have predicted for months that 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev would announce a unilateral cut 
in soviet troops in eastern europe a move that could reap public 
relations profits for moscow and allow it to divert money into 
domestic programs 
a number of soviet and american officials thought gorbachev would 
use his speech before the united nations general assembly today to 
announce a decision by the ruling politburo to go ahead with the 
cuts which have been opposed by senior red army generals 
following the sept 30 politburo shakeup that strengthened 
gorbachevs hand the ruling body agreed to cuts in the armed 
forces which currently number 56 million men and women according 
to published reports in the washington post and new york times 
the cuts are most likely in eastern europe where the soviets 
have about 500000 troops and along the soviet border with china 
gorbachev and his aides have been hinting at such reductions in 
what they describe as a new military doctrine of reasonable 
sufficiency based on an ability to defend against attack rather 
than to mount a major offensive 
many us officials thought gorbachev would announce troop cuts 
during the most recent summit last may in moscow 
but senior military officials led by the chief of staff marshal 
sergei akhromeyev have opposed any decrease in soviet forces 
without a reduction by the west 
in accordance with the new defensive doctrine we are beginning 
to introduce some changes in organizational structure of the soviet 
armed forces in order to impart a defensive nature to the armed 
forces but this will demand some time akhromeyev said during a 
visit last july to the pentagon 
the complete realization of the changes bears on bilateral 
steps he said therefore we must sit at the negotiating table 
and address the outstanding issues between us he said in a 
statement clearly aimed at discouraging speculation of any 
unilateral soviet cuts 
defense secretary frank c carlucci and other senior us 
officials have been watching soviet statements closely but say they 
have not yet seen any changes in the size armaments and deployment 
of the red army 
red army generals also opposed similar cuts in their forces made 
in the mid1950s by thensoviet leader nikita s khrushchev 
the kremlin could gain from unilateral troop cuts in eastern 
europe and along the chinese border 
such a move would improve the atmosphere for a spring summit 
scheduled between gorbachev and chinese leader deng xiaoping and 
would further enhance the popularity of gorbachev in western europe 
where he is already regarded more favorably than is reagan 
according to us government polls 
cutting conventional forces also could yield economic benefits 
for gorbachev whose government admitted this year for the first 
time that it was facing a budget deficit

a 17month fbi sting had colombian drugcartel 
point men using a phony electronics company as a clubhouse leading 
to indictments of 93 people and leaving traffickers wondering who 
do you trust authorities say 
about half of the suspects were in custody tuesday in boston 
houston los angeles tampa and miami and many were expected to 
surrender later the fbi said among those arrested were a latin 
recording star and two former miami police officers 
the sting nicknamed catcom for catch communications also 
allowed federal agents to seize about 5 tons of cocaine 100 tons of 
marijuana and some heroin authorities said 
ra communications and computers inc essentially was used as 
a clubhouse or a meeting place for firstline drug traffickers 
associated with the medellin and cali cartels said william perry 
south floridas acting fbi director 
he said the traffickers who were indicted by federal grand 
juries in miami and tampa were topoftheline us contacts 
for drug lords pablo escobar gaviria jorge luis ochoa vasquez and 
jose gonzalo rodrigues gacha who operate in the colombian towns of 
medellin or cali 
the indictments send a message that drug smugglers can never be 
sure who theyre dealing with said us attorney dexter lehtinen 
everything they do in the united states is subject to come back 
to haunt them lehtinen said 
they might have bought their ice cream from an undercover 
agent they might have bought their communications from an 
undercover agent 
unsuspecting traffickers became so trusting of the staff at the 
hialeah electronics company that they talked openly about the 
narcotics trade perry said 
the company which was closed following tuesdays indictments 
sold hightech equipment to them and soon was arranging 
communications that allowed the suspects to talk directly by twoway 
radio to smuggling ships and their bosses in colombia authorities 
said only a few of the companys customers were not involved in 
drug trafficking said fbi officials 
as the traffickers relaxed in a comfortable lounge at the 
company fbi agents and government sources recorded every 
conversation with hidden video and audio equipment perry said 
at one point the middlemen even asked the agents to check 
properties for electronic bugs the fbi said 
the investigation was the largest undercover operation ever 
directed toward the interworkings of the drug cartels fbi 
director william sessions said in washington dc 
more than 1 million in cash and property has been seized and 
total seizures are expected to exceed 4 million said the fbi 
director 
one of those arrested tuesday was raul alfonso 39 part of the 
popular salsa group hansel and raul alfonso was charged with 
conspiracy to import cocaine and importation of cocaine with intent 
to distribute the drug authorities said 
alfonso denied the charges as he and other defendants were loaded 
onto a bus at fbi headquarters in north miami beach 
the former police officers jorge luis canizares and ramon de 
jesus perez were arrested monday night near ra communications 
after buying 6 kilograms of cocaine authorities said they had been 
out on bond on other drug charges when they were arrested 
the fbi and other agencies including the drug enforcement 
administration customs service coast guard and local agencies had 
to walk a thin line on the case to both keep the traffickers 
confidence and enforce the us policy of not allowing any drugs to 
be imported even in an undercover operation 
information from the sting allowed navy and coast guard vessels 
to intercept the drugs usually in 500kilogram amounts before they 
reached the united states from south america 
in one instance the drug traffickers hired a sailboat named 
nautforfun piloted by fbi sources to carry nearly 900 pounds of 
cocaine from colombia 
the fbi had planned to seize the drugs covertly and tell the 
traffickers the sailboat had sunk with the crew lost at sea then 
bad weather hit and the boat was sunk the coast guard rescued those 
aboard and recovered the cocaine

more human rights workers were killed or 
suffered persecution in countries under freely elected leaders than 
in dictatorships of either the left or the right according to a 
survey of abuse cases 
the most violence directed against those trying to preserve human 
rights during the past year came in the 3yearold democracy of the 
philippines while the soviet union showed some of the greatest 
progress in support of human rights said the 217page report 
released tuesday by human rights watch 
the report for 1988 documented 750 cases of persecution against 
people monitoring human rights in 61 countries including 30 
killings or deaths under detention three disappearances and 16 
killings of people associated with human rights monitors the number 
of deaths was more than triple that found in the first such survey 
last year but officials said the higher figures reflect increased 
human rights activity rather than increased repression 
the country which unfortunately looms largest in terms of 
violence to human rights monitors is the philippines said aryeh 
neier human rights watch executive director at a news conference 
nine of the deaths and two of the disappearances were in the 
philippines columbia led a similar survey last year as the most 
dangerous country for pursuing human rights 
neier said president corazon aquinos overthrow of 20year ruler 
ferdinand marcos in february 1986 brought hope for change but new 
civilian governments often are either too weak or lack the 
political will to protect their people against abuses by the 
military and other forces 
the largest number of cases do not take place in dictatorships 
of either the right or the left who seem able to maintain control 
without resorting to extreme forms of violence against human rights 
monitors neier said 
other countries with elected civilian governments and serious 
human rights problems include brazil colombia el salvador 
guatemala honduras peru and sri lanka said neier director of the 
group which includes americas watch asia watch and helsinki watch 
it also is setting up africa watch and middle east watch to document 
and combat human rights abuses in those regions 
in both years covered by the group the largest number of 
persecutions not necessarily leading to death were in south 
africa chile czechoslovakia and the soviet union the report said 
the report said israel which was not included in last years 
report made the 1988 survey because of the efforts of the israeli 
authorities to suppress information about human rights abuses in the 
context of the uprising in the occupied territories 
however neier cautioned that the number of reported incidents 
against human rights workers in any country cannot be used as an 
index of general repression because many countries are too 
repressive to allow any monitoring he listed north korea saudi 
arabia iraq albania and ethiopia as countries where human rights 
workers cannot operate 
much of this years section on the soviet union dealt with 
releases of human rights monitors from detention rather than with 
persecution but neier said he did not consider any country heroic 
simply because it did not abuse people working to protect human 
rights 
the only heroes are the human rights monitors he said 
in its first report last year the group counted 10 deaths and 
two disappearances related to human rights work throughout the 
world five other deaths were discovered later and added to the 1987 
totals 
neier said abuse cases increased primarily because human rights 
monitoring has increased and spread into rural areas 
increased abuses were reported in cuba primarily because of 
increased international attention to human rights in the island 
nation he said

two governors praised a us appeals court 
ruling upholding their right to veto national guard training 
missions but the author of the law that had denied them that 
authority said the ruling was disturbing 
the courts decision restores the effective balance between the 
state and federal governments with regard to authority over the 
national guard minnesota gov rudy perpich who had challenged 
the law said in a statement released by his office tuesday 
responding to perpichs challenge the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals ruled 21 tuesday that the law is unconstitutional 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis whose state lost a similar 
challenge in the 1st us circuit court of appeals in october 
called the ruling a victory for common sense the constitution and 
the governors of the united states 
but rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss who wrote the 
socalled montgomery amendment taking away governors control over 
guard units said the ruling could hamper the guards effectiveness 
if 50 governors are allowed to veto guard missions because they 
dont like the way our foreign policy is administered it would have 
an adverse impact on training and would raise questions about the 
availability of the guard to meet its considerable defense 
responsibilities he said 
because the decision conflicted with the 1st circuits previous 
ruling the matter may have to be decided by the supreme court in 
the meantime federal officials said the ruling will not 
immediately affect guard training 
perpich and dukakis said tuesdays ruling reaffirms 
constitutionally guaranteed states rights ohio colorado vermont 
and maine also supported the minnesota lawsuit 
the montgomery amendment went too far in tipping the balance of 
power toward the federal government said perpich who was 
vacationing in hawaii 
dukakis the unsuccessful democratic presidential nominee also 
criticized what he said was the reagan administrations policy of 
using guard troops in central america to destabilize nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista regime that policy has been a failure he 
said in boston 
his states effort to block the use of massachusetts guard units 
in central america was criticized by vice president george bush 
during the presidential campaign 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon said his state now 
is more likely to appeal the ruling in its case 
the 8th circuit majority concluded that the montgomery amendment 
contravenes the intent of the framers of the us constitution who 
they said designed the militia now the national guard to serve 
as a check on the potential abuse of military power by the federal 
government 
the government has not demonstrated that the effectiveness of 
either the national defense or the national guard will be diminished 
by adherence to the constitutional principle of basic state control 
over national guard forces absent a declaration of war or national 
exigency the majority said in an 80page opinion 
the ruling reversed an august 1987 decision by us district 
judge donald alsop of minnesota 
amy brown a spokeswoman for the us department of justice in 
washington said the ruling only affects states in the 8th circuit 
arkansas iowa minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota and 
south dakota the ruling does not take effect immediately she said 
and probably would be put on hold if the government appeals 
dan donohue a spokesman for the national guard bureau in 
washington suggested further legal action is likely because of the 
conflicting appeals court decisions but no decisions have been 
made officially on an appeal he said 
the montgomery amendment is still the law of the land except in 
the affected case donohue saidwe will continue to deploy and 
train soldiers in accordance with the federal law 
nationally about 115000 men and women serve in the air national 
guard and an additional 460000 serve in the army national guard 
donohue said 
the pentagon is planning to send about 6000 guard members from 
across the country to honduras during 1989 for roadbuilding and 
engineering exercises donohue said

hundreds of police who sealed off the soviet 
mission for mikhail gorbachevs visit didnt deter protesters or 
other bystanders including a gorby lookalike who briefly 
fooled the media and donald trump 
when the real soviet leader arrived tuesday at the mission on 
manhattans fashionable upper east side he waved from his limousine 
at the crowds the car then disappeared into a ramp to an 
underground garage 
but 30 minutes before gorbachevs arrival ronald v knapp caused 
a bigger commotion among the hundreds of people milling through 
nearby streets 
knapp the spitting image of gorbachev down to what looked like a 
winecolored birthmark on his head drove up a block away from the 
mission in a silver stretch limousine as confused media members 
scrambled for their cameras and notepads knapp stood on the corner 
speaking through an interpreter 
the message from the interpreter was simple he distributed 
business cards informing everyone how they could hire knapp by 
contacting his agent 
later two groups totaling about 200 people gathered at the 
corner closest to the sealedoff block in front of the mission 
where gorbachev is staying during his threeday visit to chant 
sing and make speeches 
the larger group of armenianamericans was protesting 
gorbachevs handling of ethnic unrest in azerbaijan and armenia a 
smaller group of jews protested soviet emigration policy 
we want to let the soviets know that we are concerned about 
human rights said sen frank lautenberg dnj who came to the 
armenian rally at the request of the organizers 
the mission showed no apparent acknowledgment of the protests 
and there was no glimpse of gorbachev 
in fact his lookalike who caused commotions all around 
manhattan was as close as anyone got to seeing the soviet leader 
for most of tuesday 
when knapp strolled past tiffanys in midafternoon greeting 
shoppers with a russiansounding hi hundreds crowded around 
perhaps remembering the soviet leaders impromptu appearance on a 
washington dc street during last years summit 
the impersonators act was apparently good enough to fool real 
estate tycoon donald trump who recently learned that gorbachev had 
turned down a chance to visit the developers glittering trump tower 
trump accompanied by bodyguards rushed down from his nearby 
office and pushed his way through the crowd for a chance to pump the 
hand of the world leader 
he looked fabulous and he sounded fabulous but i knew it 
couldnt be right trump said for one thing i looked into the 
back of his limo and saw four very attractive women 
i knew that his society had not come that far yet in terms of 
capitalist decadence 
businessmen in the upper east side neighborhood of the mission 
had mixed feelings about the effects of the gorbachev visit which 
includes a speech before the united nations today followed by a 
meeting with president reagan and presidentelect george bush 
gerald gibson manager of the le laurier restaurant around the 
corner from the soviet mission invited gorbachev to lunch despite 
getting no reply he remained unfazed

atlantis astronauts returned home under a cover 
of darkness early today a fitting finale to their secret space 
mission during which they reportedly launched a powerful spy 
satellite into orbit over the soviet union 
atlantis bruised a lot more than usual streaked out of orbit 
tuesday completing a fourday space voyage with an unusual 
afternoon landing on a packed clay runway at edwards air force base 
in californias mojave desert 
the military mission the second shuttle flight since challenger 
exploded 34 months ago was believed to have included deployment of 
a sophisticated satellite that can peer through clouds and darkness 
to spy on the soviets 
the five astronauts lowkey middleofthenight arrival here 
seemed an appropriate ending to the classified flight which had 
been shrouded in secrecy since it launched friday from cape 
canaveral fla 
despite the crews 1250 am arrival more than 200 people were 
there to cheer the astronauts and their wives when they stepped off 
two planes in contrast some 5000 flagwaving spectators greeted 
the evening return of discoverys crew in october 
navy cmdr robert l gibson who guided the 97ton shuttle to a 
centerline touchdown tuesday was surprised at the earlymorning 
turnout 
i cant believe all of you are out here at one oclock in the 
morning he said this is incredible i expected just a hop in 
the cars and go 
it really was a great flight said air force lt col guy s 
gardner who made his first trip into space as atlantis pilot i 
think we did a good job for nasa and the space program and think we 
did some good things for our country 
after making a few brief remarks to the crowd the astronauts 
shook hands with other astronauts and johnson space center employees 
and then left with their families in vans 
the other crew members were col richard m mullane and lt col 
jerry l ross of the air force and navy cmdr william m shepherd 
before tuesdays 335 pm pst landing nasa and the air force 
only broke their silence twice to say the crew could proceed with 
operations and to give 24hour notice on the landing time 
mission control then lifted its curtain of secrecy about an hour 
before landing to report as it was happening that gibson had fired 
braking rockets to slow the spaceships 17400mph speed by 283 mph 
and drop it out of orbit onto an hourlong fiery descent through the 
atmosphere 
atlantis landed with a slow leak in a tire on its landing gear 
that nasa previously had said was not a concern the leak did not 
seem to affect the smoothness of the touchdown 
as the astronauts and several officials of the national 
aeronautics and space administration inspected the shuttle some 
damage could be seen to the underside including dings in the 
black protective tiles the tiles shown by nasa cameras appeared 
to be a lot more damaged than usual said nasa spokeswoman nancy 
lovato 
the landing was closed to the public because of the flights 
classified nature leaving only a few hundred journalists invited 
guests and nasa employees to watch some 425000 spectators 
witnessed discoverys landing 
atlantis flight was the 27th shuttle mission and the longest of 
three trips dedicated entirely to military purposes lasting 4 days 
9 hours and 5 minutes 
sources said atlantis primary goal to deploy the spy satellite 
was accomplished during the weekend the sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the 500 million lacrosse satellite was 
operating well in an orbit that allows it to make radar pictures of 
80 percent of the soviet union 
lacrosse is said to be designed to help american intelligence 
agencies monitor soviet compliance with arms control treaties and to 
eventually serve as the radar eye for the new b2 stealth bomber 
the afternoon landing was only the fourth for a shuttle nasa 
prefers morning landings at edwards because winds tend to kick up 
after noon 
a nasa official said he assumed the afternoon landing was 
required by the shuttles orbit deploying a spy satellite to fly 
over much of the soviet union would require a highinclination orbit 
in which atlantis zigzagged far north and south of the equator as 
it circled earth 
the shuttle will remain at the base for several days of servicing 
before it is mounted on a modified jumbo jetliner for a piggyback 
ride home to the kennedy space center in florida the astronauts 
have today off

in the irancontra affair he worked closely with us officials 
and made trips to europe and iran 
nir resigned to become a private businessman earlier this year 
in mexico where he died last wednesday nir said he was an avocado 
exporter 
investigators cast doubt on the report because of nirs past and 
because he used an assumed name when renting the plane in which he 
was killed 
amiram lived in a storm and died in a storm rabin said in 
his eulogy at the kiryat shaul cemetery his missions led him to 
mysterious destinations and to veiled affairs to deep secrets he 
knew how to keep

combat an increase in drug trafficking in the state of michoacan 
where nir died 
on monday an informed israeli source told the associated press 
the former government adviser was a licensed arms dealer israeli 
officials and nirs friends and former colleagues denied the claim

representatives of at least 20 agencies from the 
us state department to the city fire department have gathered 
under one roof for one purpose to keep mikhail gorbachev safe and 
happy until hes put to bed 
we would define success as having nothing to do for the next 
three days police deputy inspector james vitti said tuesday as 
the soviet president began his threeday visit to new york city 
the command center at police headquarters is in a large room 
containing two long tables with banks of telephones and a 
26by10foot video screen on the wall 
in addition to the dozen or so police officials more than 20 
other agencies operate there including the fbi the secret service 
the coast guard the state department the federal aviation 
administration the fire department the citys traffic department 
and ambulance corps 
the brain center is in operation until midnight on each day of 
gorbachevs visit or until hes put to bed at the soviet 
mission vitti said 
the premise is that we have one location where people who can 
speak for their agencies are available to cope with any potential 
problem that may develop vitti said its an assembly of people 
who are problemsolvers 
few authorities could conceive of a greater problem than if the 
ebullient gorbachev indulges his penchant for mingling with street 
crowds most however were confident of the soviet leaders safety 
we have 6000 cops out there and hes safe in this city as 
safe as anyone can be mayor edward i koch said on abctvs 
nightline obviously there are nuts all around the world but 
i believe we dont have a full moon and its going to be ok 
on tuesday the command center officials watched local television 
coverage of gorbachevs arrival on the video screen and several 
other television sets in the room 
the center which is in constant contact with agents and officers 
in the field was called upon at least three times before gorbachev 
and his wife raisa were safely delivered to the soviet mission in 
manhattan from kennedy international airport 
the first call came before their arrival when motorists on the 
long island expressway became impatient with detours and drove up on 
the grass to avoid roadblocks 
this problem went to police officials who dispatched extra 
patrols to the area to turn back the motorists 
another traffic problem arose on the van wyck expressway in 
queens when a propane truck broke down in a southbound lane before 
it was to be closed for gorbachevs motorcade 
the representative for the city transportation department at the 
command center ordered the immediate dispatch of a tow truck which 
removed the disabled vehicle 10 minutes before gorbachev left the 
airport 
as the motorcade traveled down the grand central parkway in 
queens another call came in a private helicopter hired by a news 
organization was hovering too close to the procession of 45 cars 
the faa representative notified the closest air control tower and 
the helicopter was told to pull back 
when the motorcade arrived at the soviet mission another police 
official lt vincent kennedy remarked with relief as an old 
friend of mine used to say it went like ice cream no problems

a senior soviet official says there are no 
plans for sovietstyle economic reforms to be imposed on communist 
cuba the island nations official news agency reported 
victor kompletkov soviet deputy foreign minister made his 
statements tuesday at the press center for soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev who is to arrive in the soviet client state friday for a 
threeday visit 
kompletkovs comments were carried tuesday by the prensa latina 
news agency which was monitored in mexico 
on monday the 32nd anniversary of the landing of the yacht that 
carried cuban leader fidel castro from mexico to launch the 
revolution against dictator fulgencio batista castro said he would 
defend the cuban form of socialism against friend and foe prensa 
latina reported 
castro said some of cubas problems have been caused by its own 
errors but that others were caused by imitating other socialist 
countries 
kompletkov said the political and economic reforms gorbachev has 
championed apply to conditions only in the soviet union and are not 
intended for other countries the report said 
nevertheless gorbachev is expected during his visit to encourage 
castro to follow the soviet model of encouraging individual 
initiative by enabling enterprises to make profits and by allowing 
people to launch private cooperatives 
castro has been cool to such suggestions and has also been 
unsympathetic to gorbachevs policies of encouraging greater 
openness of expression and a more competitive system of electing 
party and government officials

irancontra prosecutors are narrowing the case 
against oliver l north to try to undercut defense arguments that 
government secrets must be disclosed to guarantee the former white 
house aide a fair trial 
responding to president reagans refusal to release virtually any 
of the secret documents north wants to disclose at trial 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh conceded that some of the 
operations financed by the usiran armssale proceeds were legal 
the prosecutor said he wouldnt contest the legality of spending 
some of the proceeds from the usiran arms sales to help drug 
agents locate american hostages in lebanon purchase a danish ship 
for clandestine operations buy radios for a foreign political group 
and pay nicaraguan rebel leaders 
the government is willing to concede for the purposes of this 
case that this group of expenditures went to programs otherwise 
lawful but not authorized as part of reagans attempt to free 
hostages by selling arms to iran walsh said in a pleading released 
late tuesday in federal court 
walsh however maintained that there was still sufficient 
evidence to prove that north conspired with former national security 
adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers richard v secord and 
albert hakim to defraud the government 
the central conspiracy and theftofgovernment property charges 
against the former national security council aide and his 
codefendants who are to be tried separately stems from the 
diversion of more than 14 million in armssale profits to the 
nicaraguan rebels known as the contras 
norths deceitful acquisition of 18 million in profits from 
the usiran arms sales is the critical element of norths 
behavior that makes it criminal walsh said 
instead of turning over the money to the us government north 
placed it in secret swiss bank accounts along with funds raised from 
foreign countries and from private donors through a taxexempt 
foundation 
whether he used the diverted funds for ends that the government 
could otherwise legitimately fund is irrelevant the independent 
prosecutor said norths crime lies in how he acquired and 
maintained control of these funds not in the specific purposes for 
which he spent them 
by conceding that some covert operations directed by north were 
legal particularly the drug enforcement administrations efforts to 
free american hostages in lebanon walsh apparently hopes to 
foreclose defense use of classified documents 
the reagan administration is particularly unwilling to divulge 
any information that might compromise efforts to release the 
hostages disclosure of such material could jeopardize the lives of 
the hostages or subject them and others to torture walsh warned 
earlier this year 
the pleadings were filed at the request of us district judge 
gerhard a gesell who is conducting secret hearings on norths 
objections to deleting classified material from 395 documents walsh 
wants to use as trial exhibits 
gesell must decide whether any of the secrets north wants to use 
are relevant to his defense if so the classified information 
procedures act provides for the dismissal of charges if the 
governments refusal to release certain material prevents a 
defendant from getting a fair trial 
in addition to objecting to censoring prosecution exhibits north 
wants to disclose an additional 40000 pages of secret documents 
walsh contended that norths use of classified documents to 
demonstrate the bona fides of the programs supported by certain of 
the proceeds of the iranian arms sales is unjustified in light of 
the governments theory of the case 
a separate pleading disclosed that prosecutors would rely heavily 
on evidence that north personally supervised establishment of the 
clandestine network to arm the contras in a way calculated to 
defeat legal restrictions on such aid imposed by congress 
walsh said there was evidence that by the summer of 1986 the 
secret resupply operation employed 20 fulltime employees and had a 
monthly payroll of 60000 
prosecutors have records showing that north spoke by telephone 
with former cia agent joseph fernandez more than 100 times between 
august 1985 and november 1986 to direct a resupply operation walsh 
said 
fernandez identified as an unindicted coconspirator used a 
kl43 encryption device outside of normal cia secure channels to 
send messages to north about establishment of an airstrip in costa 
rica for the resupply operation 
separate criminal charges against fernandez the cias station 
chief in costa rica were dismissed oct 19 following a 
jurisdictional dispute walsh has indicated he will seek to obtain a 
new indictment against fernandez from a federal grand jury in 
virginia which the defense contends is the only proper place to try 
the case

during mikhail gorbachevs arrival here local 
programming was preempted but not only for the soviet president 
new yorkers also got to watch hours of live coverage of a murder 
trial 
when hedda nussbaum took the stand last week to testify against 
her former livein lover joel steinberg accused of beating to 
death their illegally adopted 6yearold daughter lisa all three 
network affiliates went live with the testimony the networks have 
preempted up to three hours a day of regular programming since 
cable channels have carried live trial coverage in the past 
notably cnns coverage of the new bedford mass gang rape trial in 
1984 but the steinberg case seems to be the first time network 
affiliates have preempted so much regular programming for such 
coverage 
this is compelling television in the best sense of the word 
said roger colloff general manager of wcbstv which had carried 
about 13 hours of live coverage of the trial since nov 30 
this is not something being done by actors colloff said 
this is a case with real and horrible consequences 
last december new york joined 43 others states when it enacted a 
law allowing cameras in the courtroom under an 18month experimental 
period 
in new york judges can have veto camera coverage and the 
steinberg case is the first trial of major interest in which the 
judge has approved coverage during testimony 
the death of lisa in an affluent welleducated household shocked 
many new yorkers and led to a reexamination of the duty and ability 
of neighbors teachers and social workers to recognize and report 
evidence of child abuse 
in two recent highly publicized cases the howard beach racial 
killing and the robert chambers murder trial the respective judges 
allowed television coverage only during sentencing 
i think its the new toy kind of phenomenon said everette 
e dennis executive director of the gannett center for media 
studies at columbia university 
this is the first time that the television stations have had an 
opportunity to do this kind of live coverage i do think its a 
passing show unless the ratings are so high higher than the soap 
operas that in an economic sense they the stations feel its 
warranted 
wabctv which has the highestrated soap operas resumed regular 
programming monday according to ac nielsen co ratings trial 
coverage was higherrated on wnbctv and wcbs than the stations 
regularly scheduled soap operas 
on monday afternoon trial coverage on wcbs had a rating of 52 
in the november sweeps key ratings periods that determine 
advertising rates the station averaged a 31 for soap operas 
airing during the same time period and a 43 for a syndicated show 
called on trial 
on tuesday the networks preempted some programming for 
gorbachevs arrival coincidentally there was no session in the 
steinberg trial scheduled for today when the networks planned more 
extensive live coverage of gorbachev 
even though ratings have gone up the trial coverage is 
unsponsored so stations lose many tens of thousands of dollars 
in advertising revenues said colloff but there is a public 
relations value to the coverage along with a public service one 
there really has been a reaction from people watching this 
testimony which may be beneficial and may lead people to get out of 
situations that they should be getting out of colloff said i 
dont want to sound to ethereal but it actually may prevent another 
steinberg case from occurring 
the new york times agreed in an editorial tuesday this drama 
offers beyond wallowing a redeeming possibility reliving on 
television one childs terrible death can arouse in a large audience 
the will to prevent the deaths of many others 
new yorks chief administrative judge albert m rosenblatt who 
favored the new law told the times last month the purpose of the 
cameras in the courtroom experiment was to show the workings of the 
justice system the more people learn about the system the more 
confidence theyll have in it 
i think the overall effect is probably good said dennis 
the more people are exposed to trials and nuances and questioning 
the better even if its fragmented id rather have that than a few 
highly sensational details

an advertising agency took out a fullpage ad in 
russian in todays editions of the new york times in an attempt to 
open negotiations with mikhail gorbachev over his budding career as 
a television pitchman 
the madison avenue firm of messner vetere berger carey 
schmetterer wants to lure the soviet leader into its offices with a 
blank check for his inadvertant appearance in a republican campaign 
commercial in which he is shown greeting george bush 
you the secretary general of the soviet union were the star 
of a major commercial in the george bush campaign this fall and as 
an oncamera principal are now due a pretty substantial sum of 
money in talent payments says the ad which is written in russian 
and translated into english on the opposite page 
if gorbachev can produce a screen actors guild card he would be 
due about 60000 in talent fees for his appearance said ron 
berger a partner in the firm 
but since the soviet leader is not a member of the union his 
compensation would be the subject of negotiation berger said 
the ad makes no secret of its real reason for the appeal to 
gorbachev 
we have immense experience selling upscale items we can help 
you sell beluga caviar or help stoli stolichnaya vodka fight off 
absolut which has been eating into your market share the ad says 
the ad also offers gorbachev the firms services if he decides to 
run for reelection

fishermen have found the wreckage of a 
world war ii japanese warplane and skeletal remains of its two 
crewmen off a coastal village in the southern philippines a 
japanese official said today 
consul kaisaku kawamoto said in a telephone interview from davao 
city that the twoseater fighter plane geko was found nov 15 
about half a mile east of talomo village in the province of davao 
600 miles southeast of manila 
fisherman mario calinao 34 said one of the planes engines 
radio communications equipment four machine guns a 20mm 
antiaircraft gun and revolvers had so far been recovered from the 
wreckage 
calinao said a filipino businessman in davao had offered to pay 
him if he could locate and refloat a japanese warplane 
i got interested in this because i was promised 30000 pesos 
1500 if i could refloat any japanese warplane i saw this plane 
when my friends learned about it they offered to help and since we 
all needed the money i said yes calinao told the associated 
press in a telephone interview from the consulate office 
calinao said his group lifted the plane from a depth of about 140 
feet by using metal drums filled with water he said rubber hoses 
were attached to them and water was pumped out 
but calinao said his hopes for new money dimmed because regional 
military commander col miguel abaya had ordered operations to be 
suspended and demanded that the objects be turned over to the 
military 
kawamoto said he had asked the military to permit floating to 
resume to enable japanese embassy officials to identify the pilots 
no response has since been received 
this plane is not japanese property kawamoto said i just 
want to identify the names of the pilots and inform their 
relatives and families 
he said calinao brought him an oldstyled fountain pen from 
the wreckage with the inscribed name ito

whales from winter ice off northern alaska was in many ways 
counterproductive 
the prince said the rescue gave people a false impression that 
they are doing something about conserving nature 
he said resources devoted to rescuing the whales could have been 
used for very much more positive things adding that gray whales 
as a species are vulnerable to eskimo hunters 
the threeweek operation to free the whales involved us 
scientists eskimos and two soviet icebreakers and attracted world 
news media attention 
you have got to see it as a circus act or an act of 
entertainment in that sense it was highly successful he said 
the whales became trapped after failing to leave the region early 
enough on their annual migration to waters off mexico gray whales 
regularly become trapped and die this way 
asked why the plight of the two whales attracted international 
attention and aid he said i honestly dont know except its 
quite a dramatic idea it had no signifigance whatever for the 
conservation of nature or for the conservation of that species 
prince philip who has been president of the fund formerly the 
world wildlife fund since 1981 and who travels widely promoting 
nature conservation also defended his own interest in hunting 
he compared taking part in bloodsports a favorite pastime of the 
royals to being a butcher who sells the meat of slaughtered animals 
i dont think doing it killing animals for money makes it any 
more moral i dont think a prostitute is more moral than a wife 
but they are doing the same thing he said 
it is really rather like saying it is perfectly all right to 
commit adultery providing you dont enjoy it he added 
james barrington executive director of the league against cruel 
sports a british animal rights group said prince philip seems 
to be so out of touch with ordinary decent people i am saddened 
and offended by his attitude 
he said the prince failed to recognize that wild animals killed 
for sport suffered far more than farm animals slaughtered for meat 
if the duke of edinburgh wants to help the cause of conservation 
the best thing he can do is keep his mouth shut barrington said 
charles secrett campaigns director for the environmental group 
friends of the earth called ridiculous prince philips comments on 
both the whale rescue and bloodsports 
referring to the princes remark on wives and prostitutes 
legislator clare short of the opposition labor party said he has 
just insulted his wife and all the married women of britain he has 
called his wife the equivalent of a prostitute 
another labor legislator ron brown said it is typical of the 
duke that every time he opens his mouth he lets his belly rumble it 
is another case of the dukes doublethink 
you go with a prostitute to enjoy it that is why you pay for 
it but the killing of animals is something different bearing in 
mind that animals have no means of protecting themselves against 
humans at least a prostitute can say no or refuse the money 
the times of london and the tabloid daily mirror reported prince 
philips remarks on whales wives and prostitutes on their front 
pages without comment the daily mirror headlined its report 
wives v whores by philip 
the prince a royal navy officer in world war ii often expresses 
himself in bluff salty turns of phrase and is not famous for his 
tact

the former livein lover of a lawyer accused of 
beating his llegally adopted 6yearold daughter to death described 
a life of drug use and hypnotism and testified the girl was 
sexually abused at age 2 
in her third day of crossexamination by the defense in state 
court tuesday hedda nussbaum admitted using heroin cocaine and 
lsd and said defendant joel steinberg told her she had the power to 
put people in a trance 
steinbergs attorney ira london attempted to discredit ms 
nussbaums testimony for the prosecution with repeated questions 
about drug use hypnotism and an imaginary cult 
steinberg a 47yearold disbarred lawyer is charged with murder 
in the november 1987 beating death of lisa steinberg whom he 
illegally obtained at birth from an unmarried teenager 
lisas death in an affluent welleducated household shocked many 
and led to a reexamination of the duty and ability of neighbors 
teachers and social workers to recognize and report evidence of 
child abuse 
ms nussbaum the prosecutions star witness has directly 
implicated steinberg in the death saying he admitted knocking lisa 
down the night the girl was fatally injured 
ms nussbaum said tuesday that steinberg made her believe that 
hypnotism and programming by the imaginary cult had made her have 
sex with everybody in the world 
i was hypnotizing everyone and was using them sexually 
she said 
at that point ms nussbaum smiled the absurdity of the whole 
thing just hit me she said as she dabbed her left eye with a 
tissue the tear duct allegedly ruptured by a steinberg beating 
drains continuously 
ms nussbaum said the sexual abuse occurred in 1983 when lisa 
spent three weeks at the home of a doctor who often joined her and 
steinberg in cocaine parties 
she said the doctor later told her and steinberg during an 
encounter session that his wife had sexually abused the girl 
ms nussbaum said she showed steinberg a bruise on lisas vagina 
but he didnt take any action or do anything about it 
she admitted that she did not take lisa to a doctor or hospital 
no no ms nussbaum said i took her to joel 
she said she took no action against the couple and did nothing to 
ensure that lisa had not been harmed physically or emotionally 
ms nussbaum glanced several times at the defense table where 
steinberg sat either gazing at her intently or scribbling notes 
asked by london about books on demonology necromancy and other 
occult subjects that police found at the apartment she shared with 
steinberg she said they were research materials for a book of 
horror stories she was writing for teenagers 
ms nussbaum a childrens book editor denied that she was 
interested in satanic cults and witchcraft 
she said she and steinberg took precautions against posthypnotic 
buzzwords they believed could trigger certain actions when heard by 
a subject 
ms nussbaum said steinberg also warned her that her own sister 
judy liebman was a member of this cult and could buzz me 
ms liebman watching the trial from a front row seat said 
its crazy but it was one of his steinbergs ways of controlling 
her 
london also tried to show that steinberg was irrational he 
frequently asked ms nussbaum whether steinberg actually believed 
the incredible things he told her she said she did not know 
on monday london asked for permission to present a belated 
insanity defense state judge harold rothwax denied the request

president reagan and soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev should remember pearl harbor as they meet in new york 
says a retired navy captain who survived the japanese sneak attack 
47 years ago today 
i hope theyre working for peace as were remembering war 
said forrest biard who was to be the keynote speaker at a national 
park service ceremony marking the dec 7 1941 attack that plunged 
the united states into world war ii 
we were both on the same side during world war ii but look 
whats happened since then the 75yearold biard said of the 
superpowers gorbachev arrived in new york on tuesday for informal 
talks with reagan and presidentelect george bush 
thousands were expected to attend ceremonies across hawaii today 
commemorating the air raid on hawaiian military installations the 
largest crowds generally gather at pearl harbor which was hardest 
hit 
the park service predicted 1000 people sailors past and 
present tourists and history buffs would mark the attack at its 
ceremony on the harbor shore and that 5000 others would attend 
special programs and lectures throughout the day 
more than 2400 people were killed and 1200 wounded that sunday 
morning in 1941 
the navy planned a private ceremony today aboard the uss arizona 
memorial which spans the sunken hull of the battleship as a tribute 
to the 1177 men who went down with the battleship the arizona was 
one of 21 ships damaged or destroyed in the raid 
at 755 am hst 1255 pm edt the moment the first bombs 
fell a moment of silence was to be observed then hawaii air 
national guard jets were to fly in the missing man formation 
a navy ship was to pass the memorial and wreaths and flowers 
were to be presented as the national anthem and navy hymn were 
played 
remarks by navy officials were to be followed by prayers a 
21gun salute and marine corps buglers playing taps 
pearl harbor entered this years presidential campaign on sept 7 
when bush in a speech to an american legion meeting in louisville 
ky erroneously reminded veterans that that day was the attacks 
anniversary 
the flub angered many pearl harbor survivors but had a positive 
effect said dan martinez a spokesman at the uss arizona memorial 
unfortunately so many americans especially younger ones have 
forgotten the importance of pearl harbor or never learned it 
martinez said so in a way mr bushs mistake got people to 
remember when it really was and what it really means 
december 7 1941 is a turning point in history he said 
adding that it changed the lives of all americans whether they 
realize it or not

the space shuttle atlantis 
played to an allbutempty house when it returned from its hushhush 
defense department mission and even its sonic booms seemed quieter 
than usual 
the crowds that have numbered in the hundreds of thousands to 
greet previous returning shuttles were forbidden from the base for 
tuesday afternoons landing on rogers dry lake 
only the news media base workers and 125 invited guests were on 
hand a far cry from the 425000 that that greeted the shuttle 
discovery when it landed in october 
the small crowd some on the roof of nasas amesdryden flight 
research facility building cheered and clapped and a minute after 
the 335 pm touchdown the starspangled banner blared from 
loudspeakers 
two booms crackled overhead as atlantis descended through partly 
sunny skies and made its swooping approach 
the sonic boom was not as loud as usual barbara selby a 
nasa spoekswoman told the new york times 
for the oct 3 landing of discovery vice president george bush 
who was then in the homestretch of his presidential campaign rode 
out across the dusty clay to greet discoverys crew he later 
proclaimed them americas new heroes at a redwhiteandblue 
ceremony attended by a marching band and famed test pilot chuck 
yeager 
atlantiss five crew members had to make do with greetings from 
nasa administrators when they climbed down the stairway from the 
orbiter instead of a ceremony there was a photo opportunity a van 
pulled up in front of reporters and nasa workers who had waited into 
the night and the crew got to say a few words 
instead of the vice president they were introduced by the acting 
director of the ames research center 
but that didnt seem to deflate the elation of atlantis crew 
its always great to come visit here and its especially great 
to come visit under these kind of circumstances said navy cmdr 
robert l gibson the mission commander 
hey thanks for coming out said air force lt col guy s 
gardner as he stepped to the microphone i was stationed here 
about 10 years ago and its great to get another lake bed landing 
in we had just a great time and did some good things for our 
country 
col richard m mullane saluted the nasa workers we certainly 
do greatly and deeply appreciate the opportunity to ride a rocket 
thats supported by such fine people 
space flight is something that you cant describe to other 
people as hard as we try said lt col jerry l ross but i 
think from the smile that all of us have on our faces you can get a 
sense that it was quite an experience 
navy cmdr william m shepherd agreed 
its something that leaves you really speechless about trying 
to describe it to somebody else he said 
though the lowkey atmosphere seemed strange it was not 
unprecedented 
the first department of defense shuttle mission designated 51j 
and flown oct 37 1985 ended much the same way 
that was probably quieter said ralph jackson a nasa 
spokesman at edwards

a soviet newspaper reflecting on the final meeting 
of mikhail s gorbachev and president reagan expressed a sense of 
loss today over the departure of the leader who once called the 
soviet union an evil empire 
gorbachevs arrival in new york on tuesday received frontpage 
attention in the official press and was broadcast on the morning 
television program 120 minutes 
but because of the eighthour time difference between moscow and 
new york soviets this morning got little more than their 
presidents arrival statement nationwide newspapers printed on 
their front pages a picture from moscow of gorbachevs departure 
gorbachevs speech to the united nations today was to be shown 
live in moscow officials of state television said 
the soviet leaders gathering shortly afterward with reagan and 
presidentelect bush will be the last of five official meetings 
between gorbachev and the us president 
because of his defense buildup and statements labeling the 
soviet union an evil empire the soviet press portrayed reagan 
in the early years of his presidency as an unstable missiletoting 
cowboy 
but yuri bandura a columnist for the weekly moscow news 
expressed a feeling somehow close to a feeling of loss over the 
final reagangorbachev meeting 
the feeling is more natural if you bring to mind the alarm 
caused by reagans words and deeds over about half of his 
presidency how dramatically his cooperation with mikhail gorbachev 
began and how many longlost hopes were returned to us by the 
persistance of these two people in the search for common goals and 
movement toward them he wrote 
bandura said reagan least of all for us resembles a kind uncle 
sam 
the soviet union has said gorbachev is hoping during his meeting 
with bush and reagan to set the groundwork for progress on arms 
control issues with the bush admininstration once it takes office in 
january

at a nursing home for the emotional release it brought her her 
alleged accomplice told police according to court documents 
catherine wood former nurses aide supervisor at alpine manor 
nursing home also told investigators that gwendolyn graham killed 
six patients in their beds and collected a souvenir from each 
according to search warrants released this week 
the women are suspects in the deaths of eight female patients at 
the nursing home in this grand rapids suburb from january 1987 to 
may 1987 
wood 26 was charged monday with two counts of murder and held 
without bond pending a dec 16 preliminary hearing 
graham 25 was arrested sunday near her home in tyler texas 
and arraigned on one count of murder she was being held on 1 
million bond and was fighting extradition to michigan 
police chief walt sprenger said tuesday that the six other deaths 
were being investigated and that more charges against the women were 
likely 
under questioning by police oct 7 wood said graham had told her 
that each of the six killings provided an emotional release for 
her with the exception of the death of 97yearold edith cook 
who was killed to end her suffering from gangrene according to the 
documents 
wood also told police that she and graham lived together from 
september 1986 to july 1987 and were lovers the documents said

60yearold marguerite chambers an alzheimers patient 
she observed gwendolyn gail graham suffocating the patient by 
pressing a washcloth beneath the chin of chambers and another 
washcloth over chambers mouth and nose the warrant said she 
told police she did not intervene

charged with killing cook and chambers graham who worked at the 
home from june 1986 to july 1987 is charged with killing cook both

profit as motives he said the womens lesbian relationship was 
part of a complex web that brings the whole thing together but 
would not elaborate

approached police about the deaths last october

federal prosecutors took more than 30 days to 
present their case against bess myerson but defense lawyers at the 
former miss americas divorcefixing trial took just one day to make 
their point 
neither miss myerson the citys former cultural affairs 
commissioner and miss america 1945 nor either of her two 
codefendants testified tuesday as the defense presented its side 
the trial will resume monday when lawyers begin a week of final 
arguments to the jury which could get the case the following week 
miss myerson 64 her lover carl andy capasso 43 and 
former state supreme court justice hortense gabel 75 are charged 
with an alleged conspiracy to fix capassos divorce 
miss myerson is accused of giving a 19000 city job to the 
judges daughter in 1983 in exchange for a sharp reduction of 
capassos temporary support payments to his estranged wife 
prosecutors have contended that miss myerson named correspondent 
in the divorce by capassos wife nancy sought to have the payments 
slashed out of greed 
in his opening statement to the jury 10 weeks ago assistant us 
attorney david lawrence said that miss myersons affair of the 
heart with capasso became an affair of the pocketbook the gifts 
and luxuries that mr capasso previously had given to his wife and 
his children were now being lavished on miss myerson 
but myerson attorney frederick hafetz read numerous financial 
documents to the jury to show that miss myerson had a net worth of 
at least 7 million during the period of the alleged conspiracy 
according to the documents miss myerson once a television 
celebrity and democratic senate nomination hopeful had large sums 
invested in manhattan real estate partnerships and brkerage accounts 
capasso lawyer jay goldberg introduced documents that showed his 
client incurred legal fees of 480000 backing up his claim that 
capasso wouldnt have spent so much money on lawyers if his divorce 
was fixed 
former mayor robert f wagner was among several character witness 
who testified on behalf of mrs gabel 
asked about the former judges reputation by defense lawyer 
michael feldberg wagner said it was the finest reputation that 
anyone could have 
former city council president paul odwyer said mrs gabels 
reputation was excellent and author robert caro said she was 
kind to him and consented to an interview when new york master 
builder robert moses the subject of his pulitzer prizewinning 
biography the power broker told everyone else in city 
government not to cooperate 
the trial began oct 4 
the prosecution case consisted of 150 exhibits and 34 witnesses 
including mayor edward i koch and mrs gabels daughter sukhreet 
all three defendants are charged with conspiracy mail fraud and 
other briberelated charges if convicted on all counts they face a

the operations of the countrys first labor 
group placed under government control were returned to allies of the 
former mobdominated leadership of teamsters local 560 following a 
final tally of votes today 
the teamsters for liberty ticket a strong well organized group 
whose candidates are related to two barred union leaders won 65 
percent of the vote after the 4530 ballots were counted according 
to state board of mediation officials 
teamsters for liberty outpolled the rival united new beginning 
party by 2842 votes to 1535 officials said 
despite the kinship of leaders between the new group and the old 
a government trustee of the union said he saw progress in tuesdays 
vote 
the question and ultimately the success of the trusteeship is 
whether the process continues or whether the freedom these people 
have created is destroyed said edwin h stier a former federal 
and state prosecutor who was appointed trustee of the 7600member 
union when the government took over 
but stier said that after talking with all the parties he was 
confident everybody is going to try to run this union in a 
progressive way 
the local is one of the largest in the nation and was taken over 
by the government 2 years ago to purge it of organized crime 
the winning slate of candidates included danny sciarra and mark 
sheridan the brother and nephew respectively of former local 
leaders michael sciarra and joseph sheridan 
michael sciarra and joseph sheridan served as interim officers 
during appeals of the government takeover when a federal judge 
barred them this fall from running in the election because of their 
links to the old regime they nominated their kin to become officers 
the government said michael sciarra was the designated heir of 
the genovese organized crime family he has denied any involvement 
in organized crime 
the losing slate was backed by an independent rankandfile 
movement and represented opponents of the unions former officers 
from the 1960s 
we put up a fight said ray carney who opposed sciarra for 
president you got a lot to overcome we dont have the money they 
have 
carney who lost the last contested election 23 years ago was a 
friend of a murdered local 560 dissident anthony castellito who 
was garroted with piano wire at the direction of ousted union 
official anthony tony pro provenzano 
us district judge harold a ackerman in ruling in favor in 
1984 of the justice departments racketeering lawsuit seeking to 
remove the locals executive board wrote this group of 
gangsters aided and abetted by their relatives and sycophants 
engaged in a multifaceted orgy of criminal activity 
the union was dominated by the provenzano group an alleged 
faction of the genovese organized crime group the three provenzano 
brothers anthony salvatore and nunzio all have been jailed for 
a variety of crimes including racketeering and extortion

special powers police have used for 14 years to 
fight terrorism in northern ireland have been made permanent by the 
house of commons 
the commons voted 30545 on tuesday in favor of the proposed law 
under which parliament no longer would have to renew the 1974 
prevention of terrorism act every year the act gives police 
sweeping powers to detain terrorist suspects without trial for up to 
a week and restrict their movements 
dissident members of the opposition labor party cast all 45 votes 
against the measure labor party leaders had ordered their 226 
legislators to abstain rather than vote against the bill 
the measure was intended mainly to counteract the irish 
republican armys guerrilla campaign against british forces in 
northern ireland 
it was expected to be approved by the 650member commons where 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative party has a 101seat 
majority 
later the bill is to be examined by a bipartisan committee it 
was expected to pass all legislative stages without difficulty and 
become law next year 
before the vote mrs thatcher told parliament i can think of 
nothing more important to indicate that people are determined in 
fighting terrorism not to have the powers of this bill would 
enlarge the opportunities for terrorism said ian stewart 
minister for northern ireland 
however opposition legislator barry sheerman said every 
repressive measure passed by the government was celebrated by 
terrorists as a symptom of their success the bill represents 
further encroachment on the rights and liberties of all people of 
our country and a step further down the tragic path to a less 
democratic and less free society sheerman said 
the act allows suspected terrorists to be detained without charge 
for 48 hours although the government can extend that for five days 
and to bar suspects in northern ireland from entering mainland 
britain 
on monday night the commons approved a bill that would make all 
candidates for local and provincial assembly offices in northern 
ireland sign a declaration disavowing violence 
the measure which passed by a 27441 vote was seen as aimed 
mainly at sinn fein the iras legal political arm 
it will permit the prosecution and possible ouster of council 
members who publicly support the iras violent campaign to drive the 
british government out of northern ireland 
more than 2700 people have been killed in almost 20 years of 
political and sectarian violence in the province 
the mainly roman catholic ira aims to unite protestantdominated 
northern ireland with the catholic republic of ireland under 
socialist rule 
sinn fein commands about onethird of the catholic vote in 
northern ireland and captured about onetenth of the seats in 17 of 
the provinces 26 local councils in may 1985

two medical illustrators whose drawings updating 
pictures of longmissing children have helped find some of the 
youngsters are speeding up their work with computers 
lewis sadler and scott barrows of the university of illinois used 
to take 20 hours to prepare a drawing now with a computer they 
can do it in about 20 minutes 
using old photos they measure 48 anatomical landmarks nose 
size width of the mouth and spacing of the eyes for example and 
expand them to account for growth producing a picture often 
remarkably similar to the childs appearance 
with a computer the photographs can be scanned by lasers in 
seconds and the facial information transferred into software 
programs that create images of missing children as they age 
john rabin deputy director of the national center for missing 
and exploited children in washington said sadler and barrows 
computerized system will vastly enhance the centers efforts to find 
more than 7500 children 
its like going from a quill pen to stateoftheart equipment 
the speed alone is going to be amazing rabin said 
sadler said that the finished product will look more like a 
photograph and that the computer isnt as prone to error as humans 
in calculating childrens features 
the new computer supported by a 13 million grant from the 
american telephone amp telgraph co goes into fulltime work in 
january sadler said tuesday 
so far the data on anatomical landmarks collected by 
anthropologists dentists and plastic surgeons is complete enough 
only to make pictures of white nonhispanic children updated 
pictures of blacks hispanics and asians will have to wait for more 
information 
the work of the two scientists has drawn national attention 
of the approximately 80 missing children drawn by sadler and 
barrows since they began their work in 1985 24 of the children have 
been found sadler said of those the drawings played at least some 
role in 17 cases he said 
in one case their drawing of a 13yearold girl who had been 
missing since she was 3 was the clue that brought her home 
in another case two sisters missing for 7 years were located 
just 20 minutes after drawings by sadler and barrows were broadcast 
on national television

presidentelect george bush offered former 
house speaker thomas p oneill the job of ambassador to ireland a 
post in which the massachusetts democrat once expressed an interest 
but oneill turned it down for personal reasons a bush aide 
confirmed today 
transition press secretary sheila tate said that bush was 
disappointed oneill declined the offer made during a private 
meeting friday because the vice president felt oneill would have 
been a wonderful ambassador 
the offer was first reported in todays editions of the boston 
globe 
ms tate confirmed the accuracy of the account saying the 
vice president did indeed offer the ambassadorship to tip oneill 
the post is held by margaret heckler a former congresswoman from 
massachusetts 
oneill 76 told the newspaper that he met with bush and his 
wife barbara but did not discuss details of the session 
one factor in oneills decision was the health of his wife 
millie the globe said oneill told the newspaper tuesday that she 
was suffering from pneumonia 
ms tate said oneill felt apparently quite regrettably that 
he would be unable to serve because of concern for his wife 
when oneill left office in 1986 he told reporters that the only 
other government service he might consider would be the job of 
ambassador to ireland suggesting it was a post he had often thought 
of fondly 
however when president reagan mentioned press speculation over 
such an appointment oneill jokingly replied 
what and have your picture on the wall of my office no way

the foreign office said it suspended a second 
secretary today for criticizing prime minister margaret thatcher in 
a letter published in the guardian newspaper 
patrick j haseldine who has served in france and west africa 
is likely to face severe disciplinary action for breaching civil 
service strictures against expressing political opinions 
he accused mrs thatcher of selfrighteous invective in 
attacks on belgium and ireland for their failure to extradite an 
irish priest suspected of terrorism 
the letter also charged mrs thatcher connived to let four white 
south africans suspected of arms smuggling go free in 1984 
it is all very well for mrs thatcher to inveigh against the 
belgians and the irish with such selfrighteous invective the 
letter said in the not too distant past her allegations of being 
soft on terrorism and allowing political considerations to override 
the due legal process could have been leveled against mrs thatcher 
herself 
it cited the case of the four south africans who were granted 
540000 bail by a magistrate in coventry central england and 
allowed to return to south africa 
the south african government which provided the bail refused to 
send them back and forfeited the money 
mrs thatcher failed to denounce mr bothas refusal to 
surrender the four the letter added 
the foreign office said haseldine has been suspended pending an 
investigation 
mrs thatcher has accused the belgian and irish governments of 
failing to live up to antiterrorist declarations over the 
extradition of the priest the rev patrick ryan british police 
suspect him of involvement in irish republican army bombings 
belgium where ryan was arrested last summer refused a british 
extradition request this month and sent him to the republic of 
ireland which says it is still considering the issue

president reagan said today that he and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev would continue their quest for 
human rights and personal freedom when they hold lunchtime talks 
this afternoon on governors island 
the 2hour meeting is concluding a relationship between the two 
superpower leaders that has mellowed since their first summit three 
years ago 
presidentelect george bush is joining the pair at the luncheon 
table 
although our time together will be brief i welcome this 
opportunity for a final meeting between myself president gorbachev 
and vice president bush that will demonstrate the continuity of the 
process that we first put in place in geneva in 1985 reagan told 
reporters as he prepared to leave for governors island and his fifth 
and final summit with the kremlin leader 
he said the quest for human rights and personal freedom is 
very much a part of the agenda of the americansoviet relations 
todays meeting was one that reagan did not anticipate when he 
visited moscow last summer and withdrew evil empire from his 
political vocabulary 
for reagan in the twilight of his presidency the trip to new 
york could be the sentimental culmination to a relationship that 
overcame his distrust of most things soviet 
the relationship reached a high point last summer on the streets 
of moscow where gorbachev introduced his american guest to startled 
russians at one point he gathered a small boy into his arms and 
said shake hands with grandfather reagan 
reagan reminded that he had described the soviet union as an 
evil empire that was not to be trusted dismissed that as a 
comment about another time another era 
todays meeting also gave reagans wife nancy a chance to patch 
things up with raisa gorbachev a rival with whom mrs reagan has 
acknowledged she was not in sync the two ladies were to have a 
final lunch together as their husbands met 
before flying to new york on tuesday mrs reagan contended that 
the nancyraisa feud was a reporters invention or at least an 
exaggeration 
you all keep saying that theres fussing and feuding but 
there really isnt she said i think theres been too much 
attention paid to it 
reagan planned to return to washington this evening and address 
the american enterprise institute probably using that forum to sum 
up his talk with gorbachev 
reagan also scheduled a news conference for prime time thursday 
evening probably his last such meeting with the white house press 
corps 
mrs reagan talking with reporters as she accepted delivery of 
the white house christmas tree admonished them be nice its his 
last one 
reagan leaves office jan 20 relinquishing the white house to 
bush who was traveling separately to new york for the meeting with 
gorbachev 
reagan and gorbachev first met in geneva in 1985 and made some 
progress toward agreement on arms control 
they conferred again at reykjavik iceland in october 1986 at a 
meeting that was initially billed as not a summit but turned 
into an extended bargaining session over a gorbachev proposal for a 
dramatic slash of 30 to 50 percent in each of the superpowers 
arsenals of strategic arms lastminute disagreement over reagans 
star wars program blocked any agreement and left american officials 
dejected 
an arms control agreement was reached at the next 
reagangorbachev meeting in washington in december 1987 it 
provided for the actual destruction of nuclear weapons with each 
nation observing that unprecedented act 
further arms control agreements eluded the two leaders in moscow 
last june but they cemented their personal relationship and reagan 
used the kremlin as a pulpit for preaching the virtues of democracy 
and freedom

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout 
the nation 
dec 6 
the indianapolis star on the b2 bomber 
the air forces new b2 stealth bomber may be a technological 
military wonder but it costs too much 
the sophisticated plane 10 years in development is intended for 
attacks on the soviet mobilemissile force its radarproof design 
is intended to enable it to penetrate far into soviet airspace and 
find and destroy missilelaunchers 
however the technology it is supposed to use to find the 
missiles does not yet exist 
the price of a single b2 is more than 500 million the cost of 
a fleet of 132 b2s and their base equipment is reportedly 57 
billion 
this is an astronomic price unduly high considering that huge 
fleets of advanced cruise missiles would probably be able to perform 
the same kind of mission at a fraction of the cost 
we hope that the bush administration and the new congress will 
give the b2 program a long hard look

st louis postdispatch on political campaigns 
as the echoes of blistering invective from the campaign continue 
to fade presidentelect george bush has made a wideranging effort 
at mending fences indicating he may really plan to be president of 
all the people 
if his round of conciliatory postelection meetings is a 
harbinger of his behavior after inauguration day the bush 
administration could bring some welcome surprises 
its easy to be gracious in victory of course and bush 
should not think that his program of outreach will entirely erase 
the memory of his bitter attacks on his opponents during the 
illtempered campaign 
but if he can follow the symbolic meetings he has had in recent 
days with substantive action perhaps a kinder and gentler 
administration will take root in washington after all

st paul minn pioneer press dispatch on irancontra 
president reagan last week wisely rejected pardons for either 
oliver north or john poindexter the key defendants in the 
irancontra armsforhostages case the president has praised 
them for their patriotism and said he believes the justice 
system will exonerate them 
yet his subsequent action belies that belief in one breath he 
ruled out pardons in another he blocked the progress of a fair 
trial 
the president refused to disclose information about the case that 
north says he needs to build his defense the white house 
reagan said has a duty to protect state secrets of the 
highest order 
but withholding that sensitive material could result in dismissal 
of the conspiracy charges should that happen the public will never 
know whether crimes were committed justice would not be served 
the president denies that he is attempting a back door 
approach to pardoning the principals in the scandal but it has the 
same effect it appears that reagans goal is to clear the men 
but avoid taking direct responsibility 
americans should not be fooled by such subterfuge

charge more for their services out went most discounted fares 
and in came ticket price increases of up to 30 percent 
since deregulation competition has led to major mergers and the 
demise of more than 100 small airlines 
uncle sam has done little to stand in the way of acquisitions 
that have placed control of twothirds of all domestic flights in 
the hands of eight carriers several of which also control airports 
and reservation systems 
the round of fare increases and rising prices in other industries 
may be just the beginning unless the government more vigorously

saginaw mich news on taking pennies out of circulaton 
us rep jim kolbe rariz wants to take the pennies out of 
our pockets and our loafers piggybanks and junk drawers too 
kolbe has introduced a bill requiring the treasury department to 
take pennies out of circulation 
merchants wouldnt mind seeing the shiny brown pieces become a 
symbol of nostalgia some already place saucers of pennies near cash 
registers to avoid delays caused when customers dig in pockets and 
purses for correct change 
our problem is that kolbes bill would round off purchases to the 
nearest nickel if you offered a penny for our thoughts we would 
receive nothing 
disneyland still has oldtime moviola machines that cost one cent 
to operate after paying a couple thousand pennies for admission a 
vacationer deserves a break 
and nickels from heaven would not be a song that would stir 
our fancy 
so lets keep our pennies those who dont like them can invite 
us to keep the change

senate 
presidentelect george bush and sen bob dole kissed and made 
up for the time being insiders predict it will be 
impossible for dole to bite his tongue for the next four years 
back when they were political equals on the wintry campaign trail 
in iowa and new hampshire the two were at each others throats now 
that bush has grabbed the brass ring dole must be satisfied with an 
attendant role as senate minority leader 
in that role his first assignment will be to embrace the new 
presidents claim that the nations 155 billion budget deficit can 
be reduced significantly without new taxes 
his doubts about that proposition are well known and it seems 
only a matter of time before he finds some embarrassing riposte that 
will torpedo this chummy relationship with the white house 
the gop must swim upstream in the democraticcontrolled 101st 
congress so doles cooperation would be a plus for the bush 
administration 
bush proved his chameleon qualities when he swallowed his pride 
and disappeared in president reagans shadow eight years ago dole 
is more stubborn and less restrained so be surprised if he finds 
this kind of political fidelity too demanding and kicks the traces

the milwaukee journal on college athletes 
in their quest to win careers as professional football or 
basketball players too many college students are setting themselves 
up for failure in life thats the sad but clear message that 
emerges from a new study of 4083 students at 42 major us colleges 
and universities 
the 175 million study was conducted for the national collegiate 
athletic association 
it found that major college football and basketball players spend 
more time on their sports during the season than they do studying 
and attending class 
to anyone who follows college sports these findings come as no 
surprise but they do provide a factual basis for action by the 
ncaa and action is needed 
when college students spend more time on sports than on academic 
work they twist their priorities and so do the schools they 
attend 
for athletes as for others a rewarding life in this complex era 
requires an education not necessarily a college education but at 
least a skill that will not become obsolete fairly quickly thats 
why students need to spend most of their time studying 
when they neglect the development of these lasting skills they 
are doing themselves no favor and colleges that permit such 
distorted priorities arent helping either

nation by a commission of presidents of the nations largest 
colleges and universities 
the ncaa presidents commission surveyed 4083 college 
athletes and students from 42 of the largest colleges and 
universities 
the research showed jocks spend an average of 30 hours a week on 
their football and basketball sports while they spend only 12 hours 
studying and 14 hours in classes 
college presidents need to find something to do to fill out their 
idle days obviously 
the only differences between college jocks and college students 
is that the students are preparing for a later job the jocks 
already have one though the pay is convoluted because of the 
hypocrisy surrounding the job

here is the text of president reagans 
departure remarks as he left washington today for his meeting in new 
york with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
i have a brief statement here i am delighted that later today 
ill have the opportunity to welcome president gorbachev to the 
united states and extend to him the hospitality and good wishes of 
the american people 
as most of you know our meeting today is under the gaze of lady 
liberty and i think thats altogether appropriate the quest for 
human rights and personal freedom is very much a part of the agenda 
of americansoviet relations 
and let me also say that since they began in 1985 my discussions 
with president gorbachev have been friendy businesslike and 
productive and although our time together today will be brief i 
welcome this opportunity for a final meeting between myself 
president gorbachev and vice president bush that will demonstrate 
the continuity of the process we first put in place at geneva in 
1985 
the pursuit of peace is of course always in season but i think 
its especially appropriate that president gorbachev should be here 
at this time of year a time when the thoughts and prayers of all of 
us turn to the hope that someday nations and people from every part 
of the world will live in peace and harmony with one another its 
for this reason that i journey to new york and thank you and god 
bless you

plo leader yasser arafat today said he 
told a group of american jews that his organization accepts israels 
right to exist and condemns all forms of terrorism 
but he told a press conference that a twopage declaration 
drafted with the jewish group is nothing new from the 
resolutions adopted by the plos parliamentinexile last month 
he repeatedly avoided answering questions on whether plo attacks 
against israel were terrorism but said resistance against 
occupation was legitimate under the un charter 
foreign minister sten andersson announced the declaration saying 
it was intended to elaborate on the plos acceptance last month of 
two un resolutions which implicitly recognize israel 
andersson said that according to the statement the palestine 
national council established the independent state of palestine 
and accepted the existence of israel as a state in the region 
the statement released in english said the plo also declared 
its rejection and condemnation of terrorism in all its forms 
including state terrorism 
but the palestine national council spoke of limiting military 
action to israel and the occupied territories in its meeting in 
algiers algeria israel contended the council did not recognize 
israel and had not outlawed terrorism 
todays declaration mentioned un resolutions 242 and 338 as the 
basis for an international middle east peace conference in which 
the plo wants to participate 
but it did not refer to the resolutions in relation to the 
recognition of israels right to exist or an end to terrorism 
the fivemember jewish delegation hailed the document as an 
important step forward in the peace process which removed the 
ambiguities from the plo councils declaration last month 
with this clarification of what were ambiguities in the algiers 
document we hope fervently that the united states will open a 
dialogue with the plo said rita hauser of the international 
center for peace in the middle east 
washington has made recognition of israel and renunciation of 
terrorism conditions for dealing with the plo 
president reagan asked about todays declaration as he was 
leaving the white house for new york said we havent had time to 
review what it is that he arafat said there specifically 
arafat held six hours of talks tuesday with the jewish delegation 
led by ms hauser whose leftist coalition advocates that israel 
give up part of its occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the meeting came a week before arafats speech to a special 
session of the un general assembly in geneva he is expected to 
seek support there for the palestinian state proclaimed last month 
by the palestine national council 
the un session was moved to geneva after the united states 
denied arafat an entry visa 
in jerusalem israels foreign ministry today said the american 
jews who met with arafat could not be regarded as representatives of 
any major jewish organization in the united states or israel 
these people represent only themselves the ministry said 
jewish leaders in the united states and sweden also dismissed the 
jewish delegation as unrepresentative 
un resolution 242 primarily calls for withdrawal of israeli 
armed forces from occupied territories and the end of all 
hostilities in the middle east with all states recognizing the 
rights of the others to live in peace within secure and recognized 
boundaries free from threats or acts of force 
resolution 338 calls on all parties to begin implementing 
resolution 242 and urges negotiations between the parties for a 
just and durable peace in the middle east 
arafat today also said the yearlong uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories justified by what he called israeli 
terrorism he said it would continue 
at least 319 palestinians and 11 israelis have died in the 
rebellion against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip taken by israel during the 1967 middle east war

was 14 more than the twothirds required to pass a constitutional 
amendment 
it was the widest margin of disagreement yet in the estonian 
parliament officially called the supreme soviet which has only 
recently begun to debate issues that it once rubberstamped 
the proposed law would have required nonnative workers including 
police shop clerks and doctors to learn estonian 
many migrants from other parts of the soviet union have not 
learned the local language even after years of residence in the tiny 
republic on the baltic sea the law will be reconsidered in january 
the language proposal generated considerable controversy 
many of the russian migrants preferred not to learn a new 
language and the native population feared it would soon be 
outnumbered in its own homeland and that its language and culture 
would die 
a russian organization called intermovement denounced the 
language proposal as divisive at a rally last week some of its 
members went so far as to call it an incitement to ethnic hatred 
hundreds of thousands of russians poured into estonia for 
wellpaid factory jobs largely from now nearly deserted farming 
villages said estonian engineer martin kuusk if they want to 
stay they must absorb our culture he said if they do not want 
to learn their country is in the neighborhood 
a supreme soviet deputy with the russian name of mayakovsky 
suggested adding a line defining russian as the international 
language of the soviet union but the proposal was defeated by a 
vote of 14135 
the former leader of estonia communist party first secretary 
karl vaino knew little of the republics language and for most of 
the 1980s all government documents were written only in russian 
vaino was replaced last summer by a reformer and native estonian 
vaino vyalyas 
estonia joins four other republics that declared state languages 
the nearby baltic republic of lithuania passed its law in recent 
weeks armenia azerbaijan and georgia have had similar 
constitutional amendments since 1978 
at a special meeting of the estonian communist party this 
morning recently elected prime minister indrek toome resigned his 
party job as ideology secretary he was replaced by mikk titma one 
of four men who devised estonias currently debated proposal for 
economic reform 
titmas elevation to the party secretariat was a dramatic 
promotion because he had not even been a member of the partys 
central committee 
on tuesday estonias parliament banned further industrial 
development in an ecologically devastated area of the republic 
putting itself on a collision course with moscow ministries 
the action marked a first exercise of the republics newly 
declared sovereignty in all but military and foreign policy matters 
the republics parliament on nov 16 declared estonias 
sovereignty over all its internal affairs in moscow the executive 
council of the national parliament promptly deemed the action 
illegal 
but the estonians who number 16 million have refused to abide 
by the kremlin directive and their parliament has even amended the 
republics constitution to give it the power to veto soviet laws 
estonian officials have used that veto power cautiously 
on tuesday they postponed plans to override two controversial 
nationwide decrees limiting demonstrations and dissent deciding to 
ignore the decrees and instead enforce a more liberal estonian law

a land mine explosion and repeated attacks 
by rebels killed seven people on a truck convoy carrying food to the 
southern sudan town of juba a un official said today 
the attacks in the jungles north of the uganda border came 
despite the signing of a peace agreement last month between the 
rebel sudan peoples liberation army and a party in sudans 
governing coalition 
planes flying with safety guarantees from both sides were not 
attacked as they carried supplies to starving civilians in 
governmentheld and rebelcontrolled towns for a fourth day 
the souths 6 million civilians have been the main victims of the 
civil war relief officials said today that new information leads 
them to believe that at least 500000 people have died this year 
most perished while trying to flee the battle zone for safety or 
food because the war has driven them from their agricultural lands 
previous estimates had put the years civilian death toll at 260000 
the un official in daily radio contact with juba 750 miles 
south of khartoum said the civilian convoy of 25 to 30 trucks left 
yei 100 miles southwest of juba on thursday 
except for a few un trucks it carried food owned by merchants 
not relief supplies he said despite an army escort the trucks 
encountered five maybe six ambushes by the spla he said on 
condition of anonymity 
he said three civilians and a soldier died in the attacks which 
were carried out with automatic weapons and rocketpropelled 
grenades he said three other civilians died and 14 were wounded 
later when a truck hit a land mineall the victims were sudanese 
as far as we can tell the food remains intact the official 
said our offices also have a few trucks carrying supplies to 
juba which are ok 
this morning they were 44 miles away from juba this is a 
100mile journey which should take five hours but it takes ages 
because they move at a walking pace to let men with manual mine 
detectors proceed in front of them 
the attacks came as the government assembled a delegation to send 
to addis ababa ethiopia to meet with renegade col john garang 
the rebel leader 
he organized his rebellion in 1983 to press for a better 
economic political and administrative deal for the nonmoslem 
majority in southern sudan the moslemdominated central government 
imposed islamic law six months later which exacerbated the war

the drugs were discovered tuesday evening about 45 minutes after 
the plane arrived at san francisco international airport from miami 
via los angeles said spokeswoman susan timper 
the airline gave no estimate of the value of the cocaine but

a motorists excuse that he was bugged by an 
insect moments before his car collided with a tractor just wont 
fly an appeals court ruled in ordering a new trial in a lawsuit 
against him 
a jury had decided verryl bunnell was not negligent in the 1986 
accident that fractured the knee of 22yearold rose m garceau and 
it awarded garceau 118500 in damages garceau who had asked for 
200000 sought a new trial 
bunnell contended that an insect flew into his car and struck his 
cheek as he approached a rise in the highway as he swatted the 
insect he said he drove his car into the opposite lane and struck 
the tractor operated by garceau 
but an appeals court tuesday said bunnells testimony fails to 
support a finding that a bug striking his cheek leaving his vision 
unobstructed creates a danger 
even if bunnell was stung by the bug the court said he was 
never placed in an emergency situation

a hospital reduced its caesarean births to half the 
national rate by requiring doctors to get second opinions and follow 
a few easy rules in a strategy that could save more than 1 billion 
if applied everywhere its developers said 
caesarean sections are the most common form of surgery in the 
united states many medical experts agree that physicians perform 
far too many of them but there is little consensus on how to cut 
back 
the program started at chicagos mount sinai hospital medical 
center lowered the caesarean rate from 175 percent of births to 
115 percent over two years nationwide last year 244 percent of 
the 38 million births were caesarean deliveries 
we lowered it not from 24 to 17 percent but from 17 to 11 
percent which is even harder to do said dr stephen a myers 
its like going on a diet the first five pounds are easy the 
last five pounds are tough 
a report on the program developed by myers and dr norbert 
gleicher was published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine 
the hospital set these rules 
except in emergencies second opinions must be obtained before 
all caesareans 
vaginal deliveries are preferred for all patients who have 
undergone previous caesareans 
difficult birth is considered to be an acceptable reason for a 
caesarean only if a women fails to deliver after two hours of 
strong regular uterine contractions 
fetal distress must be confirmed by a blood sample drawn from 
the fetus 
vaginal deliveries are recommended for nearly all breech 
births those in which the baby appears bottom first 
a peer review process was set up to make sure that all doctors 
follow the rules those who seem to be performing too many 
caesareans are notified although no disciplinary action is taken 
the doctors estimated that if their program were adopted by other 
hospitals the united states could avoid 450000 caesareans 
nationally hospitals charge about 3000 more for caesareans than 
for vaginal births and doctors charge 250 to 500 more 
at beth israel hospital in boston dr benjamin sachs said 
doctors frequently do caesareans at the first sign of fetal 
distress because they fear they will be sued for malpractice if 
anything goes wrong 
i dont think what they have done in this particular hospital 
is going to be easy to duplicate in the environment that we have 
today he said 
in an editorial dr frederick c battaglia of the university of 
colorado questioned whether the chicago doctors paid enough 
attention to the safety of sharply reducing caesareans 
the doctors said the reduction made no difference in the death 
rate among babies or mothers although there were more reports of 
depressed breathing among infants they said this was probably 
because doctors were more alert to this problem not because of a 
true increase in its occurrence 
myers said doctors at the hospital were generally enthusiastic 
about the program although some women were unhappy when told they 
could not have caesarean sections 
some women say i dont want to go through that aggravation i 
want another caesarean section myers said but because they 
say it thats not a valid reason to do it we said no we are 
going to have a trial of labor 
experts once recommended that after an initial caesarean women 
undergo the operation for all later births in recent years 
however this advice has changed 
at the chicago hospital 87 percent of all women with previous 
caesareans underwent some labor of these 70 percent gave birth 
vaginally

but equally there is no escaping the need to find a balance of 
interests within an international framework which has become a 
condition for survival and progress 
pondering all this one comes to the conclusion that if we are to 
take into account the lessons of the past and the realities of the 
present if we are to reckon with the objective logic of world 
development we must look for ways to improve the international 
situation and build a new world and we must do it together 
and if so we ought to agree on the basic truly universal 
prerequisites and principles of such action 
it is obvious for instance that the use or threat of force no 
longer can or must be an instrument of foreign policy this applies 
above all to nuclear arms but that is not the only thing that 
matters all of us and primarily the stronger of us must exercise 
selfrestraint and totally rule out any outwardoriented use of 
force 
that is the first and the most important component of a 
nonviolent world as an ideal which we proclaimed together with 
india in the delhi declaration and which we invite you to follow 
after all it is now quite clear that building up military power 
makes no country omnipotent what is more onesided reliance on 
military power ultimately weakens other components of national 
security 
it is also quite clear to us that the principle of freedom of 
choice is mandatory its nonrecognition is fraught with extremely 
grave consequences for world peace 
denying that right to the peoples under whatever pretext or 
rhetorical guise means jeopardizing even the fragile balance that 
has been attained freedom of choice is a universal principle that 
should allow for no exceptions 
it was not simply out of good intentions that we came to the 
conclusion that this principle is absolute we were driven to it by 
an unbiased analysis of the objective trends of today 
more and more characteristic of them is the increasingly 
multioptional nature of social development in different countries 
this applies both to the capitalist and to the socialist system the 
diversity of the sociopolitical structures that have grown over the 
past decades out of national liberation movements also attests to 
this 
this objective fact calls for respect for the views and positions 
of others tolerance a willingness to perceive something different 
as not necessarily bad or hostile and an ability to learn to live 
sidebyside with others while remaining different and not always 
agreeing with each other 
as the world asserts its diversity attempts to look down on 
others and to teach them ones own brand of democracy become totally 
improper to say nothing of the fact that democratic values intended 
for export often very quickly lose their worth 
what we are talking about therefore is unity in diversity if 
we assert this politically if we reaffirm our adherence to freedom 
of choice then there is no room for the view that some live on 
earth by virtue of divine will while others are here quite by chance 
the time has come to discard such thinking and to shape our 
policies accordingly that would open up prospects for strengthening 
the unity of the world 
the new phase also requires deideologizing relations among 
states we are not abandoning our convictions our philosophy or 
traditions nor do we urge anyone to abandon theirs 
but neither do we have any intention to be hemmed in by our 
values that would result in intellectual impoverishment for it 
would mean rejecting a powerful source of development the exchange 
of everything original that each nation has independently created 
in the course of such exchange let everyone show the advantages 
of their social system way of life or values and not just by 
words or propaganda but by real deeds 
that would be a fair rivalry of ideologies but it should not be 
extended to relations among states otherwise we would simply be 
unable to solve any of the worlds problems such as 
developing wideranging mutually beneficial and equitable 
cooperation among nations 
making efficient use of the achievements of scientific and 
technological revolution 
restructuring the world economy and protecting the environment 
overcoming backwardness eliminating hunger disease illiteracy 
and other global scourges 
nor of course shall we then be able to eliminate the nuclear 
threat and militarism 
those are our reflections on the patterns of world development at 
the threshold of the 21st century 
we are of course far from claiming to be in possession of the 
ultimate truth but on the basis of a thorough analysis of the past 
and newly emerging realities we have concluded that it is on those 
lines that we should jointly seek the way leading to the supremacy 
of the universal human idea over the endless multitude of 
centrifugal forces the way to preserve the vitality of this 
civilization possibly the only one in the entire universe 
could this view be a little too romantic are we not 
overestimating the potential and the maturity of the worlds social 
consciousness we have heard such doubts and such questions both in 
our country and from some of our western partners 
i am convinced that we are not floating above reality 
forces have already emerged in the world that in one way or 
another stimulate the arrival of a period of peace the peoples and 
large sectors of the public do indeed ardently wish for an 
improvement in the situation they want to learn to cooperate 
it is sometimes even amazing how powerful this trend is it is 
also important that it is beginning to shape policies 
changes in philosophical approaches and in political relations 
form a solid prerequisite for imparting in line with worldwide 
objective processes a powerful impetus to the efforts designed to 
establish new relations among states 
even those politicians whose activities used to be geared to the 
cold war and sometimes linked with its mostcritical phases are now 
drawing appropriate conclusions of all people they find it 
particularly hard to abandon old stereotypes and past practices 
and if even they are changing course it is clear that when new 
generatihe understanding of the need for a period of peace is 
gaining ground and beginning to prevail this has made it possible 
to take the first real steps in creating a healthier international 
environment and in disarmament 
what are the practical implications of that it would be natural 
and sensible not to abandon everything positive that has already 
been accomplished and to build on all the gains of the past few 
years on all that we have created working together 
i am referring to the process of negotiations on nuclear arms 
conventional weapons and chemical weapons and to the search for 
political approaches to ending regional conflicts 
of course i am referring above all to political dialogue a 
more intense and open dialogue pointed at the very heart of problems 
instead of confrontation at an exchange of constructive ideas 
instead of recriminations without political dialogue the process 
of negotiations cannot advance 
we regard prospects for the near and more distant future quite 
optimistically 
just look at the changes in our relations with the united states 
little by little mutual understanding has started to develop and 
elements of trust have emerged without which it is very hard to 
make headway in politics 
in europe these elements are even more numerous the helsinki 
process is a great process i believe that it remains fully valid 
its philosophical political practical and other dimensions must 
all be preserved and enhanced while taking into account new 
circumstance

the defense departments inspector general has 
begun reviewing allegations the navy is routinely and unfairly 
funneling its major computer contracts to the international business 
machines corp 
the allegations were advanced last month in a letter to defense 
secretary frank c carlucci signed by six of ibms leading 
competitors the six assert the navy is wasting hundreds of millions 
of dollars by using biased procurement practices that favor ibm 
jim turner a pentagon spokesman said the allegations in the 
nov 17 letter were referred to the inspector generals office late 
laspector general is an independent 
auditorinvestigator with the authority to probe any aspect of 
defense procurement 
turner said neither carlucci nor the pentagon would have any 
further comment on the matter pending t month the insthe inspector generals 
review the navy likewise declined immediate comment 
the fivepage letter sent to carlucci was signed by executives of 
the amdahl corp memorex telex corp pacificorp capital inc vion 
corp ncr compten and storage technology corp 
the companies which sell equipment that is compatible with ibms 
system 370 architecture contended that navy purchasing agents 
routinely wire contracts by drawing up specifications that are 
based olies 
but that gene has been shown not to be a factor in other families 
supporting the longstanding suspicion of multiple factors perhaps 
environmental and genetic 
the voices and hallucinations are gone now for aldridge 47 
thanks to daily medication that keeps his illness at bay im 
enjoying relatively good health now he said but nothing is 
guaranteed me for the future 
for the louisiana native the schizophrenia battle began after 
his athletic career he played defensive end for the packers and was 
part of the most famous defensive line in national football league 
history when the team won three straight nfl championships and the 
first two super bowls 
he was traded to the san diego chargers in 1971 and retired from 
pro ball after two seasons taking up radio and tv sportscasting in 
milwaukee nbc used him as an analyst for several seasons including 
its 1977 super bowl coverage 
but the first signs of trouble had already appeared in early 
1974 he had trouble concentrating he couldnt get his work done on 
time and as a result his broadcasts often ran shorter than planned 
i became very suspicious of people especially the people i 
worked with the workplace became very difficult a very unhappy 
place 
aldridge sought psychotherapy but later that year he began to 
have bouts of psychosis with imaginary voices and hallucinations 
it was like suddenly discovering another world one that had 
been here all along one that was totally foreign and frightening 
while his behavior on the air appeared normal his life at other 
times was bizarre he feared that his wife was a witch he ran 
barefoot through the snow in search of his therapist 
soon he was hospitalized i knew i needed help he said but 
the medication he received for a couple years zombied me out so 
bad i couldnt work he had to work so he gave up the medication 
he continued to fight the voices that told him to quit his job 
and leave town and that nobody liked him he battled the delusions 
that the station was underground that he had to hide from others 
and watch out for himself 
that was the existence i chose because i wouldnt take the 
medication because i figured i could take care of myself 
in 1981 he took a leave of absence from his job i simply could 
not do it any more he said his wife had already filed for 
divorce 
he left milwaukee and traveled the country for as long as his 
money held out then he sold the car and continued by bus and train 
within a few months of leaving town he was living on the streets 
but he found some respectable jobs sports director at a 
louisiana radio station prison counselor football coach at a high 
school and a college 
i could keep myself straight during the interview he 
recalled and when the employers found out who he was they were 
happy to hire him 
but the voices wouldnt let me stay anyplace for any length 
of time he said one by one he left his jobs or was let go 
in 1984 he found himself back in a milwaukee hospital thanks to 
friends alarmed by his behavior the doctors talked about medicine 
again and aldridge figured he would give it a try i had nothing 
to stay straight for on the outside so being zombied out 
would not be a problem he reasoned 
so it went for about three months but then his doctor cut the 
dose until aldridge was taking just enough medication to keep the 
voices and hallucinations away while avoiding the side effect 
in late 1984 he left the hospital for a nursing home then went 
on to his own apartment he started work at the post office in 1985 
and apart from a brief interruption he has been there since now 
aldridge speaks publicly about schizophrenia hoping to encourage 
research he was recently honored for his efforts by the national 
mental health association 
looking back at what schizophrenia cost him he said im 
trying to find out what good it brought 
it brought me the ability to travel around the country and talk 
to people about it it made me stronger in some ways 
it made me comfortable in situations where i was uncomfortable 
before i cant think of any situation where i can be intimidated 
because the worst has already happened how much more can you lose 
than everything

current realities make it imperative that the dialogue that 
ensures normal and constructive evolution of international affairs 
involve on a continuous and active basis all countries and regions 
of the world including such major powers as india china japan 
and brazil and other countries big medium and small 
i am in favor of a more dynamic and substantive political 
dialogue of strengthening the political prequisites needed to 
improve the inteions to many problems tough as it may be this is 
the road that we must travel 
everyone should join in the movement toward greater unity of the 
world 
today this is particularly important for we are approaching a 
very important point when we shall have to face the question of how 
to assure the worlds solidarity and the stability and dynamism of 
international relations 
and yet in my taiks with foreign government and political 
leaders with whom i have had over 200 meetings i could sometimes 
sense their dissatisfaction over the fact that at this crucial time 
for one reason or another they sometimes find themselves as it 
were on the sidelines of the main issues of world politics 
it is natural and appropriate that no one is willing to resign 
oneself to that 
if although different we are indeed part of the same 
civilization if we are aware of the interdependence of the 
contemporary world then this fact must be increasingly present in 
politics and in the practical efforts to harmonize international 
relations perhaps the term perestroika would not be quite 
appropriate in this context but i do call for building new 
international relations 
i am convinced that our time and the realities of todays world 
call for internationalizing dialogue and the negotiating process 
this is the main the most general conclusion that we have come 
to in studying global trends that have been gaining momentum in 
recent years and in participating in world politics 
in this specific historical situation we face the question of a 
new role for the united nations 
we feel that states must to some extent review their attitude to 
the united nations this unique instrument without which world 
politics would be inconceivable today 
the recent reinvigoration of its peacemaking role has again 
demonstrated the united nations ability to assist its members in 
coping with the daunting challenges of our time and working to 
humanize their relations 
regrettably shortly after it was established the organization 
went through the onslaught of the cold war for many years it was 
the scene of propaganda battles and continuous political 
confrontation 
let historians argue who is more and who is less to blame for it 
what political leaders today need to do is to draw lessons from that 
chapter in the history of the united nations which turned out to be 
at odds with the very meaning and objectives of our organization 
one of the most bitter and important lessoms lies in the long 
list of missed opportunities as a result at a certain point the 
authority of the united nations diminished and many of its attempts 
to act failed 
it is highly significant that the reinvigoration of the role of 
the united nations is linked to an improvement in the international 
climate 
in a way the united nations blends together the interests of 
different states it is the only organization capable of merging 
into a single current their bilateral regional and global efforts 
new prospects are opening up for it in all areas that fall 
naturally under its responsibility in the politicomilitary 
economic scientific technological environmental and humanitarian 
areas 
take for example the problem of development which is a truly 
universal human problem conditions in which tens of millions of 
people live in a number of third world regions are becoming a real 
threat to all mankind 
no closed entities or even regional communities of states 
important as they are are capable of untangling the main knots that 
tie up the principal avenues of world economic relations 
northsouth eastwest southsouth southeast and easteast 
what is needed here is joining the efforts and taking into 
account the interests of all groups of countries something that 
only this organization the united nations can accomplish 
external debt is one of the gravest problems 
let us not forget that in the age of colonialism the developing 
world at the cost of countless losses and sacrifices financed the 
prosperity of a large portion of the world community the time has 
come to make up for the losses that accompanied its historic and 
tragic contribution to global material progress 
we are convinced that here too internationalizing our approach 
shows a way out 
looking at things realistically one has to admit that the 
accumulated debt cannot be repaid or recovered on the original terms 
the soviet union is prepared to institute a lengthy moratorium of 
up to 100 years on debt servicing by the least developed countries 
and in quite a few cases to write off the debt altogether 
as regards other developing countries we invite you to consider 
the following 
limiting their official debt servicing payments depending on the 
economic performance of each of them or granting them a long pariod 
of deferral in the repayment of a major portion of their debt 
supporting the appeal of the united nations conference on trade 
and development for reducing debts owed to commercial banks 
guaranteeing government support for market arrangements to 
assist in third world debt settlement including the formation of a 
specialized international agency that would repurchase debts at a 
discount 
the soviet union favours a substantive discussion of ways to 
settle the debt crisis at multilateral forums including 
consultations under the auspices of the united nations among heads 
of government of debtor and creditor countries 
international economic security is inconceivable unless related 
not only to disarmament but also to the elimination of the threat to 
the worlds environment in a number of regions the state of the 
environment is simply frightening 
a conference on the environment within the framework of the 
united nations is scheduled for 1992 we welcome this decision and 
are working to have this forum produce results that would be 
commensurate with the scope of the problem 
but time is running out much is being done in various countries 
here again i would just like to underscore most emphatically the 
prospects opening up in the process of disarmament particularly 
of course nuclear disarmament for environmental revival

let us also think about setting up within the framework of the 
united nations a center for emergency environmental assistance its 
function would be promptly to send international groups of experts 
to areas with badly deteriorating environment 
the soviet union is also ready to cooperate in establishing an 
international space laboratory or manned orbital station designed 
exclusively for monitoring the state of the environment 
in the general area of space exploration the outlines of a 
future space industry are becoming increasingly clear 
the position of the soviet union is well known activities in 
outer space must rule out the appearance of weapons there here 
again there has to be a legal base the groundwork for it the 
provisions of the 1967 treaty and other agreements is already in 
place 
however there is already a strongly felt need to develop an 
allembracing regime for peaceful work in outer space the 
verification of compliance with that regime would be entrusted to a 
world space organization 
we have put forward our proposal to establish it on more than one 
occasion we are prepared to incorporate within its system our 
krasnoyarsk radar station a decision has already been taken to 
place that radar under the authority of the ussr academy of 
sciences 
soviet scientists are prepared to receive their foreign 
colleagues and discuss with them ways of converting it into an 
international center for peaceful cooperation by dismantling and 
refitting certain units and structures and to provide additional 
equipment 
the entire system could function under the auspices of the united 
nations 
the whole world welcomes the efforts of this organization and its 
secretarygeneral mr perez de cuellar and his representatives in 
untying knots of regional problems 
allow me to elaborate on this 
paraphrasing the words of the english poet that hemingway took as 
an epigraph to his famous novel i will say this the bell of every 
regional conflict tolls for all of us 
this is particularly true since those conflicts are taking place 
in the third world which already faces many ills and problems of 
such magnitude that is has to be a matter of concern to us all 
the year 1988 has brought a glimmer of hope in this area of our 
common concerns as well this has been felt in almost all regional 
crises on some of them there has been movement we welcome it and 
we did what we could to contribute to it 
i will single out only afghanistan 
the geneva accords whose fundamental and practical significance 
has been praised throughout the world provided a possibility for 
completing the process of settlement even before the end of this 
year that did not happen 
this unfortunate fact reminds us again of the political legal 
and moral significance of the roman maxim pacta sunt servanda 
treaties must be observed 
i dont want to use this rostrum for recriminations against 
anyone 
but it is our view that within the competence of the united 
nations the general assembly resolution adopted last november could 
be supplemented by some specific measures 
in the words of that resolution for the urgent achievement of a 
comprehensive solution by the afghans themselves of the question of 
a broadbased government the following should be undertaken 
a complete ceasefire effective everywhere as of jan 1 l989 
and the cessation of all offensive operations or shellings with the 
opposing afghan groups retaining for the duration of negotiations 
all territories under their control 
linked to that stopping as of the same date any supplies of 
arms to all belligerents 
for the period of establishing a broadbased government as 
provided in the general assembly resolution sending to kabul and 
other strategic centres of the country a contingent of united 
nations peacekeeping forces 
we also request the secretarygeneral to facilitate early 
implementation of the idea of holding an international conference on 
the neutrality and demilitarization of afghanistan 
we shall continue most actively to assist in healing the wounds 
of the war and are prepared to cooperate in this endeavor both with 
the united nations and on a bilateral basis 
we support the proposal to create under the auspices of the 
united nations a voluntary international peace corps to assist in 
the revival of afghanistan 
in the context of the problem of settling regional conflicts i 
have to express my opinion on the serious incident that has recently 
affected the work of this session the chairman of an organization 
which has observer status at the united nations was not allowed by 
us authorities to come to new york to address the general 
assembly i am referring to yasser arafat 
what is more this happened at a time when the palestine 
liberation organization has made a constructive step which 
facilitates the search for a solution to the middle east problem 
with the involvement of the united nations security council 
this happened at a time when a positive trend has become apparent 
toward a political settlement of other regional conflicts in many 
cases with the assistance of the ussr and the united states we 
voice our deep regret over the incident and our solidarity with the 
palestine liberation organization 
ladies and gentlemen 
the concept of comprehensive international security is based on 
the principles of the united nations charter and is predicated on 
the binding nature of international law for all states 
being in favor of demilitarizing international relations we want 
political and legal methods to prevail in solving whatever problems 
may arise 
our ideal is a world community of states which are based on the 
rule of law and which subordinate their foreign policy activities to 
law 
the achievement of this goal would be facilitated by an agreement 
within the united nations on a uniform understanding of the 
principles and norms of international law their codification with 
due regard to new conditions and the development of legal norms for 
new areas of cooperation 
in a nuclear age the effectiveness of international law should 
be based not on enforcing compliance but rather on norms reflecting 
a balance of state interests 
in addition to the ever increasing awareness of the objective 
commonality of our destiny this would make every state genuinely 
interested in exercising selfrestraint within the bounds of 
international law 
democratizing international relations means not only a maximum 
degree of internationalization in the efforts of all members of the 
world community to solve problems it also means humanizing those 
relations 
international ties will fully reflect the genuine interests of 
the peoples and effectively serve the cause of their common security 
only when the human being and his concerns rights and freedoms 
become the center of all things

the communist party chief in tibet known for his 
support of relatively liberal policies in that region has been 
removed from his post an official spokesman said wednesday 
wu jinghua appointed to the job in may 1985 was replaced by hu 
jintao head of the party committee in guizhou province since july 
1985 
a western traveler and a tibetan switchboard operator meanwhile 
said the situation in lhasa tibets provincial capital was calm 
two clashes in as many years between proindependence tibetans and 
chinese forces killed dozens of people 
in beijing zhang wenyuan spokesman for the liaison office of 
the chinese communist party said wus removal was part of a 
normal job rotation and denied the switch was related to unrest 
in tibet 
zhang said the transfer had been made recently although he 
declined to specify when he said he did not know what job if any 
wu was to hold following his dismissal 
a chinese source contacted wednesday night in beijing said the 
move was made dec 1 the source described the new party leader hu 
as a conservative meaning that he would likely adopt a harder 
approach than wu toward tibetan proindependence activities 
rumors have circulated since summer that wu was set to be sacked 
because he had not cracked down hard enough on the proindependence 
protests 
antichinese demonstrations began in lhasa in late september and 
october 1987 resulting in the deaths of at least 14 people 
on march 5 proindependence tibetans clashed again with police 
and western travelers quoted tibetans as saying at least 24 people 
died chinese reports said hundreds were arrested in october and 
march 
since march sketchy reports from lhasa have described the city 
as tense although little violence has been reported 
on wednesday the western traveler contacted by telephone said he 
had not seen many soldiers on the street he said the mood in the 
city was mellow 
the telephone operator also reported the city was calm 
while head of the party in tibet wu has been credited with 
enacting relatively liberal policies said one source close to the 
dismissed leader 
during the cultural revolution which lasted from 1966 to 1976 
bands of ultraradical red guards destroyed tibets buddhist temples 
and killed thousands of monks in an attempt to wipe out tibets 
culture vilified as feudal and backward 
the use of the tibetan language was banned in schools and 
tibetans were forbidden from traveling within the region unless they 
first obtained a permit 
with the end of the cultural revolution chinas policies in 
tibet moderated somewhat 
under wu tibetans were allowed to use their native tongue in 
schools and were given limited freedom to travel within the huge 
region which borders india nepal bhutan and burma 
wu the source said was also responsible for encouraging the 
central government to develop tibets economy and opening lhasas 
first university 
china claims sovereignty over tibet dating to the 13th century 
chinese troops entered tibet in 1950 nine years later the 
crushed an antichinese uprising and tibets religious and spiritual 
leader the dalai lama fled to exile in india 
after decades of accusing the chinese of genocide the dalai lama 
recently adopted a more conciliatory tone in a speech in 
strasbourg france in june he said he would accept a chinese troop 
presence in tibet and chinese management of tibets foreign 
relations if china let tibet run its internal affairs 
china in september proposed to meet with the dalai lama but 
stressed that the strasbourg proposals could not be used as a basis 
for the talks 
the dalai lama has proposed that the two sides meet in geneva in 
january china has yet to respond

in this context i would like to join the voice of my country in 
the expressions of high appreciation of the significance of the 
universal declaration of human rights adopted 40 years ago on dec 
10 1948 
today this document retains its significance it too reflects 
the universal nature of the goals and objectives of the united 
nations 
the most fitting way for a state to observe this anniversary of 
the declaration is to improve its domestic conditions for respectlng 
and protecting the rights of its own citizens 
before i inform you on what specifically we have undertaken 
recently in this respect i would like to say the following 
our country is going through a period of truly revolutionary 
uplifting 
the process of perestroika is gaining momentum we began with the 
formulation of the theoretical concept of perestroika we had to 
evaluate the nature and the magnitude of problems to understand the 
lessons of the past and express that in the form of political 
conclusions and programmes this was done 
theoretical work a reassessment of what is happening the 
finalization enrichment and readjustment of political positions 
have not been completed they are continuing 
but it was essential to begin with an overall concept which as 
now confirmed by the experience of these past years has generally 
proved to be correct and which has no alternative 
for our society to participate in efforts to implement the plans 
of perestroika it had to be democratized in practice under the 
sign of democratization perestroika has now spread to politics the 
economy intellectual life and ideology 
we have initiated a radical economic reform we have gained 
experience at the start of next year the entire national economy 
will be redirected to new forms and methods of operation this also 
means profoundly reorganizing relations of production and releasing 
the tremendous potential inherent in socialist property 
undertaking such bold revolutionary transformations we realized 
that there would be mistakes and also opposition that new 
approaches would generate new problems we also foresaw the 
possibility of slowdowns in some areas 
but the guarantee that the overall process of perestroika will 
steadily move forward and gain strength lies in a profound 
democratic reform of the entire system of power and administration 
with the recent decisions by the ussr supreme soviet on 
amendments to the constitution and the adoption of the law on 
elections we have completed the first stage of the process of 
political reform 
without pausing we have begun the second stage of this process 
with the main task of improving the relationship between the center 
and the republics harmonizing interethnic relations on the 
principles of leninist internationalism that we inherited from the 
great revolution and at the same time reorganizing the local system 
of soviet power 
a great deal of work lies ahead major tasks will have to be 
dealt with concurrently 
we are full of confidence we have a theory and a policy and 
also the vanguard force of perestroika the party which also is 
restructuring itself in accordance with new tasks and fundamental 
changes in society as a whole 
what is most important is that all our peoples and all 
generations of citizens of our great country support perestroika 
we have become deeply involved in building a socialist state 
based on the rule of law work on a series of new laws has been 
completed or is nearing completion 
many of them will enter into force as early as in 1989 and we 
expect them to meet the highest standards from the standpoint of 
ensuring the rights of the individual 
soviet democracy will be placed on a solid normative base i am 
referring in particular to laws on the freedom of conscience 
glasnost public associations and organizations and many others 
in places of confinement there are no persons convicted for their 
political or religious beliefs 
additional guarantees are to be included in the new draft laws 
that rule out any form of persecution on those grounds 
naturally this does not apply to those who committed actual 
criminal offenses or state crimes such as espionage sabotage 
terrorism etc whatever their political or ideological beliefs 
draft amendments to the penal code have been prepared and are 
awaiting their turn among the articles being revised are those 
related to capital punishment 
the problem of exit from and entry to our country including the 
question of leaving it for family reunification is being dealt with 
in a humane spirit 
as you know one of the reasons for refusal to leave is a 
persons knowledge of secrets strictly warranted time limitations 
on the secrecy rule will now be applied every person seeking 
employment at certain agencies or enterprises will be informed of 
this rule in case of disputes there is a right of appeal under the 
law 
this removes from the agenda the problem of the socalled 
refuseniks 
we intend to expand the soviet unions participation in the 
united nations and csce conference of security and cooperation in 
europe human rights monitoring arrangements we believe that the 
jurisdiction of the international court of justice at the hague as 
regards the interpretation and implementation of agreements on human 
rights should be binding on all states 
we regard as part of the helsinki process the cessation of 
jamming of all foreign radio broadcasts beamed at the soviet union 
overall this is our credo political problems must be solved 
only by political means human problems only in a humane way 
now let me turn to the main issue disarmament without which 
none of the problems of the coming century can be solved 
international development and communication have been distorted 
by the arms race and the militarization of thinking 
as you know on jan 15 1986 the soviet union put forward a 
program of building a nuclear weaponfree world translated into 
actual negotiating positions it has already produced material 
results 
tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the signing of the inf 
treaty i am therefore particularly pleased to note that the 
implementation of the treaty the elimination of missiles is 
proceeding normally in an atmosphere of trust and businesslike 
work 
a large breach has thus been made in a seemingiy unbreakable wall 
of suspicion and animosity we are witnessing the emergence of a new 
historic reality a turning away from the principle of super 
armament to the principle of reasonable defense sufficiency 
we are present at the birth of a new model of ensuring security 
not through the buildup of arms as was almost always the case in 
the past but on the contrary through their reduction on the basis 
of compromise 
the soviet leadership has decided to demonstrate once again its 
readiness to reinforce this healthy process not only by words but 
also by deeds 
today i can report to you that the soviet union has taken a 
decision to reduce its armed forces 
within the next two years their numerical strength will be 
reduced by 500000 men the numbers of conventional armaments will 
also be substantially reduced this will be done unilaterally 
without relation to the talks on the mandate of the vienna meeting 
by agreement with our warsaw treaty allies we have decided to 
withdraw by 1991 six tank divisions from the gdr czechoslovakia and 
hungary and to disband them

assault landing troops and several other formations and units 
including assault crossing units with their weapons and combat 
equipment will also be withdrawn from the groups of soviet forces 
stationed in those countries 
soviet forces stationed in those countries will be reduced by 
50000 men and their armaments by 5000 tanks 
all soviet divisions remaining for the time being in the 
territory of our allies are being reorganized their structure will 
be different from what it is now after a major cutback of their 
tanks it will become clearly defensive 
at the same time we shall reduce the numerical strength of the 
armed forces and the numbers of armaments stationed in the european 
part of the ussr 
in total soviet armed forces in this part of our country and in 
the territories of our european allies will be reduced by 10000 
tanks 8500 artillery systems and 800 combat aircraft 
over these two years we intend to reduce significantly our armed 
forces in the asian part of our country too by agreement with the 
government of the mongolian peoples republic a major portion of 
soviet troops temporarily stationed there will return home 
in taking this fundamental decision the soviet leadership 
expresses the will of the people who have undertaken a profound 
renewal of their entire socialist society 
we shall maintain our countrys defense capability at a level of 
reasonable and reliable sufficiency so that no one might be tempted 
to encroach on the security of the ussr and our allies 
by this action and by all our activities in favor of 
demilitarizing international relations we wish to draw the 
attention of the international community to yet another pressing 
problem the problem of transition from the economy of armaments to 
an economy of disarmament 
is conversion of military production a realistic idea i have 
already had occasion to speak about this we think that indeed it 
is realistic 
for its part the soviet union is prepared 
in the framework of our economic reform we are ready to draw up 
and make public our internal plan of conversion 
in the course of 1989 to draw up as an experiment conversion 
plans for two or three defense plants 
to make public our experience in providing employment for 
specialists from military industry and in using its equipment 
buildings and structures in civilian production 
it is desirable that all states in the first place major 
military powers should submit to the united nations their national 
conversion plans 
it would also be useful to set up a group of scientists to 
undertake a thorough analysis of the problem of conversion as a 
whole and as applied to individual countries and regions and report 
to the secretarygeneral of the united nations and subsequently 
to have this matter considered at a session of the general assembly 
and finally since i am here on american soil and also for other 
obvious reasons i have to turn to the subject of our relations with 
this great country i had a chance to appreciate the full measure of 
its hospitality during my memorable visit to washington exactly a 
year ago 
the relations between the soviet union and the united states of 
america have a history of 5 decades as the world changed so did 
the nature role and place of those relations in world politics 
for too long a time they developed along the lines of 
confrontation and sometimes animosity either overt or covert 
but in the last few years the entire world could breath a sigh of 
relief thanks to the changes for the better in the substance and the 
atmosphere of the relationship between moscow and washington 
no one intends to underestimate the seriousness of our 
differenees and the toughness of outstanding problems we have 
however already graduated from the primary school of learning to 
understand each other and seek solutions in both our own and common 
interests 
the ussr and the united states have built the largest nuclear 
and missile arsenals but it is those two countries that having 
become specifically aware of their responsibility were the first to 
conclude a treaty on the reduction and physical elimination of a 
portion of their armaments which posed a threat to both of them and 
to all others 
both countries possess the greatest and the most sophisticated 
military secrets but it is those two countries that have laid a 
basis for and are further developing a system of mutual verification 
both of the elimination of armaments and of the reduction and 
prohibition of their production 
it is those two countries that are accumulating the experience 
for future bilateral and multilateral agreements 
we value this we acknowledge and appreciate the contribution 
made by president ronald reagan and by the members of his 
administration particularly mr george shultz 
all this is our joint investment in a venture of historic 
importance we must not lose this investment or leave it idle

speech wednesday was carried live on soviet radio and tv with an 
announcer saying delegates gave him an ovation that was unlike any 
other in memory 
the professional quality of those sitting at the delegation 
tables dictates restraining a display of feeling the stormy 
expression of which is just not acceptable here a tv announcer 
said after gorbachevs speech the first at the world body by a 
soviet leader since nikita s khrushchev in 1960 
but such a reaction which you the television viewers witnessed

the next us administration headed by presidentelect george 
bush will find in us a partner who is ready without long pauses or 
backtracking to continue the dialogue in a spirit of realism 
openness and goodwill with a willingness to achieve concrete 
results working on the agenda which covers the main issues of 
sovietus relations and world politics 
i have in mind above all consistent movement toward a treaty on 
50 percent reductions in strategic offensive arms while preserving 
the abm treaty 
working out a convention on the elimination of chemical weapons 
here as we see it prerequisites exist to make 1989 a decisive 
year 
and negotiations on the reduction of conventional arms and armed 
forces in europe 
i also have in mind economic environmental and humanistic 
problems in their broadest sense 
it would be quite wrong to put the positive changes in the 
international situation exclusively to the credit of the ussr 
and the united states 
the soviet union highly appreciates the major and original 
contribution of socialist countries in the process of creating a 
healthier international environment 
during the course of negotiations we are constantly aware of the 
presence of other major powers both nuclear and nonnuclear 
many countries including mediumsized and small ones and of 
course the nonaligned movement and the intercontinental group of 
six are playing a uniquely important constructive role 
we in moscow are happy that an ever increasing number of 
statesmen political party and public figures and i want to 
emphasize this scientists cultural figures representatives of 
mass movements and various churches and activists of the socalled 
peoples diplomacy are ready to shoulder the burden of universal 
responsibility 
in this regard i believe that the idea of convening on a regular 
basis under the auspices of the united nations an assembly of 
public organizations deserves attention 
we are not inclined to simplify the situation in the world 
yes the trend touard disarmament has been given a powerful 
impetus and the process is gaining a momentum of its own but it 
has not yet become irreversible 
yes the willingness to give up confrontation in favor of 
dialogue and cooperation is felt strongly but it is still far from 
becoming a permanent feature in the practice of international 
relations 
yes movement toward a nuclearweaponfree and nonviolent world 
is capable of radically transforming the political and intellectual 
identity of our planet but only the first steps have been made and 
even they have been met with mistrust in certain influential 
quarters and face resistance 
the legacy and the inertia of the past continue to be felt 
profound contradictions and the roots of many conflicts have not 
disappeared and there remains another fundamental fact which is 
that a peaceful period will be taking shape in the context of the 
existence and rivalry of different socioeconomic and political 
systems 
however the thrust of our international efforts and one of the 
key elements of the new thinking is that this rivalry should be 
given a quality of reasonable competition with due regard for 
freedom of choice and a balance of interests 
then it will even become useful and productive from the 
standpoint of global development 
otherwise if the arms race as before remains its basic 
component this rivalry will be deadly 
more and more people throughout the world leaders a well as 
ordinary people are beginning to understand 
esteemed mr president distinguished delegates 
i am concluding my first address to the united nations with the 
same feeling that i had when i began it a feeling of 
responsibllity to my own people and to the world community 
we are meeting at the end of a year which has meant so much for 
the united nations and on the eve of a year from which we all expect 
so much 
i would like to believe that our hopes will be matched by our 
joint effort to put an end to an era of wars confrontation and 
regional conflicts to aggressions against nature to the terror of 
hunger and poverty as well as to political terrorism 
this is our common goal and we can only reach it together 
thank you

the federal aviation administration announced today 
the fines ranged from 1000 each against a handful of commuter 
carriers to more than 200000 apiece against three large carriers 
american airlines northwest airlines and united airlines each of 
which had more than two dozen violations 
the lapses included lapses by security guards in detecting mock 
weapons during tests conducted by undercover faa officials 
a total of 236 mock weapons went undetected at the various 
checkpoints most of them in a sixmonth period from april to 
september the faa said the agency declined to give a breakdown on 
the detection rates at specific airports 
despite the latest civil penalties transportation department 
officials said the airlines which are responsible for passenger 
screening at airports have significantly improved their detection 
of weapons at screening points since the matter became a focus of 
heightened concern in late l987 
according to faa figures the airlines during the julyseptember 
period increased their detection rate to 889 percent compared to 
789 percent in all of l987 
but transportation secretary jim burnley said the faa will 
continue to test the airport security network 
although the detection rate has improved since last year i 
will not be satisfied until we achieve a 100 percent success rate in 
detecting weapons burnley said

incense prayers and pleas for the homeless 
were part of a memorial for a scion of a wealthy new england family 
who battled addiction and aidsrelated complex before dying homeless 
on a tenderloin district sidewalk 
tuesday afternoons ceremony for joseph emerson eaton 38 took 
place near the spot where he was found dead five hours after he 
passed out and was dragged from a fastfood restaurant by a guard 
who thought he was drunk 
it was our brother who died and we shall miss him greatly 
said a homeless man who identified himself as cz and said he knew 
eaton 
about 100 people many of them homeless gathered around two 
eastern orthodox priests and a makeshift altar with a frayed white 
cloth candles flowers and religious pictures to remember eaton and 
other homeless people who have died 
let this be a time again of healing and reconciliation the 
time for anger is over said the rev thomas flowers a monk who 
runs a soup kitchen in united nations plaza nearby it was flowers 
who found eatons lifeless body just two blocks from city hall while 
making rounds in the seedy tenderloin 
the coroners office said eaton suffered from alcoholism drug 
abuse and aidsrelated complex and his arms showed fresh needle 
marks they were awaiting toxicology test results before determining 
the cause of death 
theres no one to blame flowers said were all to blame 
two long sheets of paper taped to a wall outside the carls jr 
restaurant listed others who have died on san franciscos streets 
scattered through the gathering were gaunt people with bedrolls 
strapped to their backs shopping carts loaded with belongings and 
plastic bags filled with food one man wore a lapel button reading 
have faith a group called food not bombs distributed free 
fruit 
as carls jr workers looked on flowers urged listeners not to 
ignore anyone they see lying in doorways or on the streets 
as a result of eatons death dr james werdegar head of the 
citys department of public health on tuesday urged the public to 
call authorities when they find someone unconscious on the sidewalk 
eaton was found dead early saturday 
the tenderloin is known for panhandlers homeless people sleeping 
in doorways and on benches and a tent city outside the us health 
department office demanding more federal funding to fight aids 
its a far cry from the affluent boston suburb of duxbury where 
eaton grew up his late grandfather charles freedom eaton jr was 
a financier who founded investors bank amp trust co his father 
joseph emerson sr is a retired business executive 
eaton attended prestigious new england prep schools but he was 
an alcoholic from the time he was 13 from the time he took his 
first drink said his brother nick a new hampshire contractor 
and later he got heavily into using drugs nick eaton said 
but time after time after time it was alcohol that brought him 
his troubles 
family members said eaton tried several treatment programs with 
their moral and financial support 
he never attended college but worked as a chef or florist eaton 
moved to san francisco in 1981 and told his family he was 
homosexual 
we accepted his choice of lifestyle said another brother 
boston television reporter henry eaton it was only his 
selfdestructive drinking that ever concerned us 
eaton became romantically involved with phillip coleman also a 
recovering alcoholicaddict according to eatons alcoholics 
anonymous sponsor skip b they were very happy and eaton was sober 
until coleman died of aids in november 1987

includes some of aids symptoms but not lifethreatening cancers or 
infections that take advantage of the bodys weakened immune system

finance another treatment program they agreed he died hours later

melanoma a sometimesfatal skin cancer is 
striking more people at a younger age than ever before and an 
expert said the trend could get worse as a result of a thinning of 
atmospheric ozone 
dr darrell s rigel an assistant clinical professor of 
dermatology at new york university medical school said melanoma is 
now diagnosed in one of every 128 americans an increase of about 
1500 percent compared with 1935 
rigel told the american academy of dermatologys annual meeting 
on tuesday that an even more disturbing trend is that the ages of 
patients with melanoma is dropping dramatically 
five years ago it was unusual to see someone under the age of 
40 with skin cancer said rigel now were commonly seeing 
people in their 20s with skin cancer 
about 25 percent of the estimated 27300 americans diagnosed as 
having melanoma this year will be age 39 or under he said only a 
few years ago it was considered a disease of the aged 
not only has the overall rate grown but the age group where it 
has grown the most rapidly is in the youngest group said rigel 
the rate of increase is highest among the youngest people not 
only here but in other countries 
the disease is found largely among lightskinned people and in 
this country in the sun belt states of the south and west 
it is generally believed that melanoma a skin cancer that will 
spread throughout the body if not excised early by surgery develops 
after 10 to 20 years of heavy or damaging exposure to ultraviolet 
rays of the sun but rigel said the increasing rate of the disease 
among the young suggests that the time it takes to develop the 
disease may be decreasing 
a loss of ozone in the atmosphere might be the explanation of 
why people are getting it younger and younger maybe that has been 
brought up as a hypothesis said rigel for every decrease of 1 
percent in the ozone layer there is a 2 percent increase in the 
incidence of skin cancer 
ozone is a natural atmospheric gas that partially blocks 
ultraviolet solar rays from reaching the earths surface studies in 
recent years have shown that some types of chemical pollutants 
principally the fluorocarbons used for refrigerants and solvents 
destroy atmospheric ozone thus allowing more ultraviolet radiation 
to reach earth 
counterbalancing the ozoneloss effect is a growing consciousness 
about dangers from excessive exposure to the sun rigel said he 
said more people are using sun screen a skin lotion that filters 
ultraviolet rays 
people are so much more sunconscious than they were just five 
years ago rigel said in an interview the use of sun screen has 
risen very dramatically 
many parents now know that sun damage on the skins of children 
under the age of 10 can result in cancer among those youngsters 
before they are 30 said rigel as a result he said even children 
now are using sun screen 
we wont begin to see the effects of that sun screen usage for 
another 10 to 20 years from now he said the hope is that by 
the turn of the century the sun screen use and more common sense 
about avoiding the sun will kick in to cause a decline in skin 
cancers 
if not said rigel melanoma may strike one in every 90 americans 
by the year 2000 
melanoma first appears as a black brown or mixed colored spot of 
irregular shape on the skins surface left untreated the cancer 
penetrates to the interior of the skin and releases cells that can 
move through the bloodstream and establish colonies in the bone 
brain lung or even heart once this happens the disease cannot be 
cured rigel said 
but if the cancer is detected early when it is still about the 
size of a pencil eraser it easily can be cut from the skin and cure 
is almost certain he said 
rigel said the number of melanoma cases in the united states has 
almost doubled during the last eight years and the number of deaths 
has tripled to about 5800 since 1960 however the survival rate 
for melanoma patients has risen from 60 percent in the 1960s to 
about 83 percent now

atlantis five astronauts relaxed 
with their families wednesday but they planned to return to work 
the next day to begin briefing nasa and air force officials on their 
secret shuttle mission 
crew members ended their fourday flight tuesday with a smooth 
touchdown at edwards air force base calif they left for houston 
several hours later arriving home early wednesday 
after getting a day off the astronauts will begin several weeks 
of debriefings on their classified military flight nasa and the air 
force have refused to discuss the missions main goal but sources 
said it was deployment of a 500 million satellite that can spy on 
the soviet union through clouds and darkness and will someday serve 
as a radar eye for the new stealth bomber 
atlantis crew members were navy cmdr robert gibson the 
commander air force lt col guy s gardner the pilot air force 
col richard m mullane air force lt col jerry l ross and navy 
cmdr william m shepherd the flight was the first trip to space 
for both gardner and shepherd 
more than 200 people welcomed the astronauts home when they 
arrived at ellington field compared with the nearly 5000 
wellwishers who turned out for the celebrated return of discoverys 
five astronauts 
i cant believe all of you are out here at one oclock in the 
morning gibson said this is incredible i expected just a hop 
in the cars and go 
it really was a great flight gardner said i think we did 
a good job for nasa and the space program and i think we did some 
good things for our country 
the crowd was small but enthusiastic cheering the astronauts and 
their wives as they stepped off two nasa planes after making brief 
remarks the crew members spent several minutes shaking hands and 
hugging their friends and coworkers 
at edwards which was closed to the public because the flight was 
classified only a few hundred journalists nasa employees and 
invited guests watched as gibson guided the 97ton shuttle to a 335 
pm pst touchdown on the packed clay runway in the mojave desert 
the landing time apparently was dictated by the orbit atlantis 
had to follow in deploying the radar satellite nasa prefers morning 
landings at edwards because winds tend to gather force later in the 
day 
although nasa and the air force permitted live television 
coverage of the landing as they did for fridays blastoff from cape 
canaveral fla everything in between was blacked out 
about an hour after touchdown the crew and several nasa 
officials inspected the orbiter and nasa cameras showed underside 
scarring to the shuttle including dings to the black protective 
tiles 
the damage to the tiles appeared to be a lot more than usual 
nasa spokeswoman nancy lovato said 
atlantis will remain at the base for several days for servicing 
it then will be mounted on a modified jumbo jetliner for a piggyback 
ride home to the kennedy space center in florida 
atlantis flight was the 27th shuttle mission and the second 
since the 1986 challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts and 
halted manned space missions for 32 months it was the third 
dedicated solely to the military

the leftist government and the roman 
catholic church are at odds but both are taking the day off 
thursday to celebrate the religious feast of the immaculate 
conception of the virgin mary 
its one of the nations most important holidays celebrating the 
roman catholic belief that mary was conceived without original sin 
traditionally nicaraguans take to the streets the eve of the 
feast visiting altars erected in front of homes and chanting hymns 
of praise owners of a home where the altar is erected distribute 
candy fruit and toys and offer pastries and cocoa drinks to 
visitors who go on to other altars for additional goodies 
fireworks explode through the night and groups meet each other 
chanting what causes so much happiness marys immaculate 
conception 
the chants and celebration are known as the griteria or 
the shouting 
the roman catholic church has celebrated the feast for centuries 
and the sandinista government accused by the church of following a 
marxist ideology has yielded to popular tradition 
devotion to the virgin mary rooted in the soul of catholic 
spain is common in the spanishspeaking countries notably among 
them mexico and its patron saint the virgin of guadalupe 
the nicaraguan church says the government is trying to capitalize 
on the peoples religiosity for its own political ends 
they try to take the religious aspect away to concentrate more 
on the giving of candy bread and sugar cane and the secular 
celebrations said monsignor bismarck carballo director of the 
catholic radio station 
the church encourages the faithful to celebrate the old way with 
neighborhood altars and gatherings 
government officials including president daniel ortega who has 
called cardinal miguel obando y bravo a reactionary and a 
counterrevolutionary visit altars built by government agencies and 
join in celebrating and distributing gifts 
interior minister tomas borge a critic of the church and its 
hierarchy has said that as long as there is a revolution there 
will be a celebration of the immaculate conception 
government newspapers filled pages this week with interviews with 
old managua residents who recalled the folkloric celebrations of the 
early century in a bucolic managua that had not yet heard of 
revolution 
chico gurdian 75 told the newspaper barricada that after the 
religious celebration in the old days we turned the statue of 
virgin around so she would not see and everybody started dancing 
on wednesday soldiers in blue berets were busy building the 
sandinista armys altar just off a wide avenue lined by eucalyptus 
trees behind the virgin was a large painting showing nicaraguan 
mountains with army helicopoters flying over them 
another government agency built an altar that bore the sign 
mary energy for reconstruction 
religious or political the feast is a brief respite in a country 
hard hit by civil war a hurricane runaway inflation and low wages 
a few blocks from the altars a store advertised simple twoslice 
toasters for 60 more than a secretary earns in a month

the flags the us seal the decor and the 
bible for george bushs inauguration will look a lot like those from 
george washingtons oathtaking 200 years ago at federal hall in new 
york 
but the bicentennial inauguration jan 20 will also be marked by 
some departures from tradition including security screening for 
the more than 140000 guests expected to attend the ceremony 
my worst nightmare is that 50000 people will show up at 1120 
am for a ceremony that starts at 1130 said michael ruehling 
executive director of the joint congressional committee on inaugural 
ceremonies 
for the first time those with inauguration tickets will have to 
walk through metal detectors to get to their seats the four gates 
will open at 9 am and a musical prelude is scheduled to start 90 
minutes later all in an attempt to get people to come early 
the only thing were not providing is popcorn ruehling said 
i dont know what else we can do but it does scare me 
the inauguration will wait for no one invited guest or not 
since the constitution stipulates the oath must be taken at noon 
the security precautions are the most obvious change from past 
practice but there are other new twists as well for the first time 
ever the inaugural program will contain the names of the president 
and vice president in the past they were referred to by title only 
another first the program will include a fourpage history of 
inaugurations in commemoration of the bicentennial 
we want to make it a little extra special if we can ruehling 
said of the bush inauguration 
capitol historians and architects have thoroughly researched the 
washington inauguration and the design for the ceremonial backdrop 
reflects their work 
for example the archway of the door to the west front where 
bush and vice presidentelect dan quayle will enter will be draped 
in red bunting similar to the bunting used on the federal hall door 
in 1789 
two flags with 13 stars representing the original 13 states will 
be part of the backdrop along with two 38star flags from 1889 and 
the current 50state flag 
bush will likely take the oath of office on the bible used by 
washington and several presidents since including jimmy carter and 
all inaugural materials will be imprinted with the first great seal 
of the united states used as the national emblem from 1782 to 1841 
at the first inauguration washington simply bowed to his 
audience repeated the 35word oath of office and added at the end 
i swear so help me god 
subsequent ceremonies were more elaborate with music speeches 
and services and this year is no exception participants include 
the us marine and army bands the harlan ky boys choir and the 
rev billy graham who will deliver the invocation and the 
benediction 
chief justice william rehnquist will administer the oath of 
office to bush while justice sandra day oconnor will swear in 
quayle the committee said wednesday 
more than 500 choruses bands bellringers and other groups 
inundated the congressional committee with requests to perform most 
of them seeking to participate in the inaugural parade to the white 
house their letters were dispatched to the presidential inaugural 
committee the private group in charge of the parade and other 
festivities 
the bush inauguration marks only the second time the ceremony has 
been held on the capitols west front from his podium bush will 
have a panoramic view of the grasscarpeted smithsonian mall the 
soaring washington monument and many grand buildings of the city 
president reagan was sworn in there in 1981 but most 
inaugurations have taken place on the east front which overlooks 
the asphalt capitol parking area as well as the carefully landscaped 
capitol grounds 
the inauguration platform and stands under construction on the 
west front are costing 323000 to build taxpayers are footing the 
bill for the inaugural preparations and also for an hourlong 
catered lunch that precedes the traditional parade down pennsylvania 
avenue to the white house 
the quadrennial meal in the capitols statuary hall will be 
attended by about 200 people among them the president and vice 
president their families and congressional leaders following long 
custom sen wendell ford dky chairman of the congressional 
inaugural committee will toast the new president and present him 
with a gift 
weve got a good one ruehling said youll find out what it 
is on jan 20

mikhail gorbachev president reagan and george 
bush shared a lunchtime summit on wednesday spiced by the soviet 
leaders call for a period of peace and announcement of a 
unilateral cut of 500000 red army troops 
in a day of superpower substance and symbolism the soviet 
president answered bushs welcoming handshake with a vigorous 
twohanded embrace he declared that the presidentelect would find 
the soviets ready without long pauses or backtracking to 
continue improving relations 
reagan said he heartily approved of gorbachevs overtures 
made in a united nations speech and said we certainly would 
adjust western troop strength downward if this left us with a 
superiority 
weve accomplished much there are still things to do he 
said before sitting down for the fifth and final time with his 
superpower partner 
gorbachev used his un speech to declare that military force no 
longer can or must be an instrument of foreign policy he said 
50000 soviet troops and 5000 tanks would be pulled out of eastern 
europe by 1991 and pledged reductions on western and eastern soil 
within the soviet union as well overall the reductions were to 
reach half a million 
gorbachev also called for steps to end the war in afghanistan 
under un auspices within a month and urged international 
cooperation on issues ranging from arms control to the environment 
i would like to believe that our hopes will be matched by our 
joint efforts to put an end to an era of wars confrontation and 
regional conflicts aggressions against nature terror of hunger and 
poverty as well as political terrorism he said in an hourlong 
speech 
the un speech and summit talks came on the second of 
gorbachevs three days in new york thursday is devoted to 
sightseeing and the soviet leader departs for cuba on friday 
in a speech to an audience that included his wife raisa 
secretary of state george shultz and a hall filled with diplomats 
gorbachev pledged to continue his reform of soviet society as well 
and he said that nations should look for ways together to improve 
the international system and build a new world 
it is now quite clear that building up military power makes no 
country omnipotent gorbachev declared whats more onesided 
reliance on military power ultimately weakens other components of 
national security 
from the united nations the soviet leader went to governors 
island in new york harbor where a smiling reagan greeted him the 
two men shook hands in the sunshine and posed for photographers 
if we score any points we can do it only together gorbachev 
said if we try to score points alone nothing good will happen 
a few moments later bush emerged to join them and when the 
presidentelect offered his hand in welcome gorbachev grasped it 
energetically with both of his own 
gorbachev reagan and bush broke bread inside the brick and 
columned admirals house while their wives were being entertained at 
a ladiesonly luncheon in manhattan sponsored by the wife of un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
i am happy to be in the city you call the big apple mrs 
gorbachev said 
across town at governors island the lunch menu began with 
chicken consomme followed by filets of veal with smoked quail and 
lobster sausage and ended with a chocolate tart with raspberry 
sauce the wine was from reagans home state of california 
new york police said dozens of demonstrators were arrested 
outside the un after they crossed police lines to protest 
treatment of jews in the soviet union 
it was the first time a soviet leader had spoken to the united 
nations in 28 years and the contrast couldnt have been more 
striking 
in 1960 nikita krushchev pounded the podium with his shoe in one 
of the most memorable gestures of belligerence of the cold war 
in contrast gorbachev spoke calmly and sprinkled references to 
peace and progress throughout his remarks his most notable contrary 
word was a brief criticism of the reagan administrations decision 
to deny a visa to plo leader yasser arafat 
he called for a period of peace and noted that cold war 
politicians find it particularly hard to abandon old stereotypes 
and past practices in apparent reference to reagan and british 
prime minister margaret thatcher he said some are now drawing 
the appropriate conclusions 
his most dramatic announcement was his declaration of troop cuts 
he said his nation will maintain our countrys defense capability 
at a level of reasonable and reliable sufficiency to deter attacks 
asked later as he posed for pictures with reagan and bush whether 
he was getting resistance from the soviet military establishment he 
smiled and said nyet nyet nyet back home however the 
soviets announced the retirement of their longtime military chief of 
staff for health reasons 
specifically gorbachev said he would withdraw 50000 troops and 
5000 tanks from east germany huyngary and czechoslovakia by 1991 
it is estimated that the soviets maintain 500000 troops there the 
warsaw pact holds a 25to1 troop edge over nato in conventional 
strength 
gorbachev said many of the forces to be pulled out of europe 
including six tank divisions would be disbanded 
he said overall he would reduce the red army by 500000 men 
western officials estimate the soviet army has an overall strength 
of about 56 million men 
gorbachev said he intended to move his economy to an economy of 
disarmament and would develop and publish plans for converting its 
defense plants and shifting military specialists into civilian 
industry 
in other parts of his speech gorbachev called for un 
peacekeeping forces to help assure the neutrality and 
demilitarization of afghanistan where a soviet occupation force 
that once numbered more than 100000 troops is being withdrawn 
he called for a ceasefire beginning jan 1 and challenged the 
united states to stop shipping arms to afghan rebels 
he also 
announced the soviet union would soon reform its penal code 
and said soviet jews seeking to leave would be handled in a humane 
spirit still he said those citizens with knowledge of state 
secrets would not be permitted to emigrate 
proposd creating an international organization that would help 
third world countries alleviate their massive debt payments he said 
the soviet union would be willing to enforce a 100year moratorium 
on debt repayment for some countries and cancel debts altogether in 
some cases 
proposed an international space lab devoted to environmental 
protection although he said quickly that any space mission must 
rule out the appearance of weapons there

its the brent farris morning shows 
all three of them 
there used to be just one brent farris morning show and that was 
the adult contemporary music program on radio station kzst but then 
brent farris grew tired of getting junk mail addressed to his show 
these underwear companies kept mailing me these underwear 
catalogs and i didnt want them he explained 
so he offered 1000 to the first person who legally changed 
their name to the brent farris morning show he figured that person 
would start getting his underwear ads 
this prompted donna johnson to file a fictitious business 
statement with the county saying she was doing business as the brent 
farris morning show then cynthia machado legally changed her name 
to the brent farris morning show 
after some negotiations the women agreed to split the money as 
the disc jockey explained it the one who was first had not legally 
changed her name and the one who legally changed her name wasnt 
first 
and will all this keep the real brent farris from getting 
underwear ads of course not 
it wont keep me from getting them he said but at least 
now i have someone to send them to

commuters on miamis metromover could have heard 
wankwanktunk or tinkerteetink every time the doors opened on the 
mass transit system this week 
instead theyll hear the same old ding dong 
dade county transit officials rejected plans to set up a sound 
exhibit that was to begin sunday as part of the new music america 
festival calling the bongo drums indian chants and other sounds 
signaling the door opening unsafe because they might cause the doors 
to open unexpectedly 
canadian artist gordon manahan who created a set of 11 
prerecorded sounds called the decision blatant censorship 
jeffrey kaplan the agencys deputy director acknowledged he 
wasnt thrilled with the eskimo mouth harp that sounded like an 
alarm or a radio disc jockey jabbering in italian but was only 
concerned about safety 
some commuters didnt seem to notice during a test run of the 
music and others noticed but couldnt tell what they were hearing 
i was wondering if there was some kind of subliminal message 
behind it downtown commuter ralph pujol said after hearing an 
electronic cha cha and some tribal music its definitely 
strange but its strange in a neat way it adds to the mystique of 
miami

the top federal regulator for savings and loan 
companies said wednesday he may have some surprises for the ailing 
industry and will continue to order more liquidations acquisitions 
or mergers of sampls this month 
w danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board told 
an advisory group of bankers and others affected by the industry 
that the threemember board is still considering actions to take but 
has focused on a direction 
he said the moves would be very positive for the industry but 
may not be what anyone expects 
i have nothing more to say other than stay tuned said 
wall who had made a similar statement to a national council of 
savings institutions in new york a day earlier hold onto your 
hats he told the sampl executives we are going to be taking 
steps that are going to surprise everyone 
the council and the larger us league of savings institutions 
have sharply different views on how to approach the industry crisis 
estimates of the amount of money it will take to bail out or 
liquidate failing sampls range from 50 billion to 100 billion 
the council two thirds of whose members are savings banks whose 
deposits are presently insured by the federal deposit insurance 
corp proposed on tuesday that the fdic insure all savings 
institutions not just banks 
the proposal would dismantle the nearly bankrupt federal savings 
and loan insurance corp after about five years during which the 
insurer would liquidate the remaining insolvent sampls fslic insures 
deposits in sampls but no longer has enough money in its accounts to 
cover deposits in all those expected to fail 
the larger league which includes some sampls that are not healthy 
enough to join the fdic wants to retain the separate systems for 
savings institutions and banks 
wall made no comment on those differing proposals but said the 
board is examining several ideas for dealing with the industrys 
problems 
he said up to 60 financially troubled savings institutions will 
have been dealt with by the end of 1988 with about 200 more to be 
dealt with next year 
a large proportion of the sampls the board has had to deal with 
are in texas oklahoma louisiana arkansas and new mexico where 
low oil and natural gas prices have hurt the economies 
board member roger martin noted that the bulk of savings 
institutions remain strong and suggested that the industry conduct a 
campaign to counteract the bad publicity that inevitably will result 
from continued sampl liquidations

nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner 
on wednesday welcomed the announcement by soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev of a unilateral cut in soviet military forces a 
spokesman said 
the us mission to the north atlantic treaty organization called 
gorbachevs speech at the united nations a positive step 
obviously we need to study it carefully but note that 
significant asymmetries would remain even if all these steps were 
taken said a spokesman at the mission who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
gorbachev announced the cuts in a speech to the general assembly 
in new york it came on the eve of a twoday meeting of secretary of 
state george shultz and other foreign ministers of the 16nation 
western alliance 
in response to the soviet announcement nato spokesman florent 
swijsen said woerner welcomes any measure that may lead to long 
overdue reductions of overwhelming warsaw pact superiority in 
conventional forces in europe 
the announcement he said seems to be a step in the right 
direction for which we have been calling for a long time 
it will now be analyzed by the allies and we will be looking 
carefully for the followup of mr gorbachevs statement swijsen 
said 
gorbachev said the soviet union will unilaterally cut its 
military forces by 500000 troops and reduce its conventional arms 
substantially the military he said no longer can or must be an 
instrument of foreign policy 
he said the move comes without relation to international 
negotiations on conventional forces in europe but his offer would 
likely give a new push to those stalled talks in vienna austria on 
reducing warsaw pact and nato conventional forces in central europe 
while meeting thursday and friday the nato foreign ministers are 
expected to discuss their position in the arms negotiations called 
the conventional stability talks those talks are expected to get 
under way early next year 
nato officials speaking on condition of anonymity have said the 
ministers will likely issue a statement at the end of their talks 
setting forth the outline of their common strategy 
woerner however declined to confirm that our goal is clear 
to reach stability at lower levels of arms and to get it by 
reductions on both sides he told reporters earlier in the day 
there is one clear principle he said that who has more 
has to cut more we have to get rid of imbalances 
there are disparities and these disparities are in favor of the 
warsaw pact he said so of course we have to expect that since 
the warsaw pact has much more arms they have to reduce much 
more 
a nato report that compared conventional forces stationed in 
europe said that as of january 1988 the warsaw pact countries had 
3090000 ground forces personnel while nato had 2213593 
the report also said the warsaw pact countries also had at least 
twice as many battle tanks artillery antitank weapons and combat 
aircraft stationed in europe than nato countries do

leon trotskys grandson says the fact that 
hes been given permission to visit his sister in the soviet union 
is another sign the revolutionary leader is slowly recovering his 
rightful place in history 
esteban volkow bronstein said he was recently granted a visa to 
visit his halfsister trotskys granddaughter alexandra 
zakharonavna who is dying of cancer in moscow 
its all part of soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policy 
im sure volkow said in a tuesday night interview with the 
associated press 
volkow said he had not seen his sister since 1931 when he was 5 
years old that was the year his mother fled the soviet union 
taking him but leaving his older sister behind 
volkow was living with trotsky in mexico city when the former 
head of the red army was assassinated on josef stalins orders on 
aug 20 1940 volkow was only 14 but still remembers finding 
trotsky on the floor dying from serious head wounds 
trotsky born lev davidovich bronstein was one of the leaders of 
the october 1917 revolution that established the soviet union but 
he lost a power struggle with stalin went into exile and became a 
nonperson vilified in the his native land 
volkow a 62yearold retired chemical engineer has been 
watching from mexico city as trotskys name is brought out of what 
volkow called the the dark cave of soviet history 
there was a minor sensation when gorbachev mentioned trotsky in a 
speech last year in september the communist party newspaper pravda 
called trotsky an enemy of stalin rather than an enemy of 
socialism and the revolution 
last month the soviet supreme court rehabilitated a son 
volkows stepuncle sergei sedov who died in 1937 in stalins 
purges 
stalin shot him because he was trotskys son he wasnt 
political at all he was just a technician volkow said of sedov 
volkow said he understands why the changes have been coming 
slowly 
you cant change black to white in one day said volkow 
volkow said that until last month he had known nothing of his 
sisters fate except for a reference in a book published 10 years 
ago that showed she was still alive 
he said he had asked friends traveling to moscow to try to find 
her several times but none could until pierre broue a historian 
and trotsky specialist at the university of grenoble in france 
located her in november 
i havent been able to talk to her really because i dont 
speak russian except for a few phrases that i memorized to say to 
her said volkow she doesnt have long to live 
he said zakharonavna only a year older than volkow had spent 10 
years in stalins prison camps solely because she was a relative of 
trotsky 
shes suffered a lot and now shes very weak said volkow 
he said he will leave for italy next week to appear on a 
television show about his grandfather then fly to moscow for a 
fourday visit before christmas 
now a mexican citizen volkow said he had never tried to get a 
visa to visit the soviet union before in part because until now he 
was sure it would be denied 
volkow said he himself is not a trotskyist believer in 
international revolution but he fiercely defends his grandfather 
and says trotsky was too important for his role in soviet history to 
remain distorted 
it cant be hidden he said

rock n roll pioneer roy orbison whose 
surging falsetto mourned the misery of fading romance and who 
recently had become popular with a new generation of fans was 
felled by a heart attack and died he was 52 
the grammy awardwinning orbison famed for hits like oh 
pretty woman only the lonely and crying died shortly 
before midnight tuesday at hendersonville hospital where he had 
been taken by ambulance said melanie lamb a spokeswoman for the 
suburban nashville hospital 
he was and always will be one of the greats of rock n roll 
said former beatle paul mccartney we toured with roy in the early 
days and he was a really good guy 
a singer guitarist and songwriter who was instantly recognizable 
by his everpresent sunglasses and dark attire set off by an ebony 
pompadour orbison had 27 straight records on the charts during his 
heyday in the early 1960s 
but his biggest success came with oh pretty woman about a 
flirtatious episode which sold more than 7 million copies in 1964 
a cover version later was a hit for van halen 
in 1977 elvis presley one year orbisons senior introduced him 
as the greatest singer in the world bruce springsteen saluted 
him in his song thunder road 
last year he rerecorded his 1963 hit in dreams after the 
song had been revived in the movie blue velvet 
but it was orbisons recent recordings as one of the traveling 
wilburys along with exbeatle george harrison tom petty bob 
dylan and jeff lynne that brought him a new generation of fans 
the groups handle with care is no 45 on the charts and their 
swiftselling album the traveling wilburys is no 8 
the upturn in his career surprised him orbison said last week as 
he was leaving londons heathrow airport for home 
ive been rediscovered by young kids who had never heard of me 
before the wilburys he said they are getting into my original 
songs and apparently the old stuff is selling at the rate of 20000 
copies a day 
its very nice to be wanted again but i still cant quite 
believe it 
harrison in england was too shocked at news of orbisons death 
to comment said warner bros spokesman bob merlis 
orbison was upbeat a few weeks ago when he met with record 
producer fred foster who had worked with the singer since the early 
days 
he seemed in good health he was exercising and all that 
foster said wednesday he was the most talented man i ever worked 
with 
orbison got his early recording experience in the 1950s with sun 
records of memphis the label that launched the careers of elvis 
presley johnny cash and jerry lee lewis he was one of the first 
rockabilly singers a hybrid of rock n roll and hillbilly 
music as country music was known then 
his career peaked in the first half of the 60s but tailed off in 
the aftermath of two family tragedies his wife died in a motorcycle 
accident in 1966 and in 1968 two of his three sons ages 10 and 6 
died in a fire that destroyed his 150000 lakeside home 
his third son is in his 20s and he had two teenage sons from 
his second marriage his wife and three sons survive him the family 
lived in nashville 
a little hurt went a long way he said in a 1986 associated 
press interview his song too soon to know was inspired by the 
death of his wife 
some of his big hits were blue bayou its over mean 
woman blues and dream baby he won a grammy award for his 
1980 collaboration with emmylou harris on that loving you feeling 
again 
in addition to the traveling wilburys two of his most recent 
albums were class of 55 and the great roy orbison 
on sept 30 1987 orbison gave a concert at los angeles 
cocoanut grove nightclub roy orbison and friends a 
blackandwhite night the friends were springsteen elvis 
costello jackson browne tom waits tbone burnett and jd 
souther with bonnie rait jennifer warnes and kd lang singing 
backup 
orbisons penchant for sunglasses and dark clothing created a 
mysterious persona that was heightened by his natural reclusiveness 
the image was partly an accident born when orbison accidently 
left his regular glasses at home and had to wear the shades while 
performing in london in 1963 he liked the image so much that he 
wore them constantly giving some people the false impression that 
he was blind 
rock n roll singer carl perkins who joined orbison lewis and 
cash on the album class of 55 said orbison was was the kind 
of man who you would like to have living next door so you could lay 
some tomatoes on the fence for him 
orbison a native of vernon texas grew up in wink texas and 
learned guitar from his father an oil field worker he played 
guitar on a radio station at age 8 and was in a country band by age 
14 
with an impressive threeoctave range he continued to perform 
concerts right up to his death appearing sunday in akron ohio 
before 2000 people 
i dont feel im the guy i should be unless im writing and 
performing and singing he said in the 1986 interview 
he estimated at that time that he had sold 30 million records 
one day when they are mentioning people who had an impact if 
they just mention me among the rest of the guys and gals it would 
be great he said when asked how he wanted to be remembered 
funeral arrangements were incomplete wednesday

billionaire donald j trump offered his 
philosophy of business success and vowed wednesday to give employees 
a major boost in morale if he were allowed to buy eastern 
airlines northeast shuttle 
trump flashed a wide smile at the judges female law clerks and 
shook hands with the bailiff during a short break in his testimony 
at a federal court hearing on the 365 million deal that is being 
challenged by easterns unions 
the most important asset of the enterprise is the employees 
trump said they are wonderful they need a major boost in morale 
thats 90 percent of the problem 
but trump who insisted he has already befriended easterns 
shuttle employees during his frequent travels declined to guarantee 
current wages for flight attendants pilots and other workers 
i cant answer that question now trump replied i want my 
employees to be happy i want my employees to be well paid i want 
my employees to do a good job 
in order to have a competitive and successful airline i do not 
know whats going to have to take place he said 
trump whose manhattan hotels and atlantic city gambling casinos 
have become glittering symbols of business success said he wanted 
to purchase the shuttle to restore a great institution to the 
grandeur it once enjoyed 
over the last number of years ive seen it deteriorate very 
unfortunately trump testified 
trump compared the bostontonew yorkto washington shuttle to 
new yorks plaza hotel which hadnt been run right until he 
purchased it 
i really look forward to the chance of putting it back on track 
and doing something with it trump said 
trump decried the shuttles loss of customers which he 
attributed to deteriorating service and the stormy relationship 
between eastern and its unions 
it would take 50 million which eastern cant afford to 
refurbish dilapidated airplanes and terminals to attract new 
customers he said 
if i can take the shuttle and turn it around i think the deal 
that i made would be an ok deal trump said acknowledging that he 
agreed to pay a high price 
trump insisted the deal was good for both eastern and its 
employees as well 
if i were on the eastern side i would rush like hell to make 
this deal he said without this deal i think eastern is 
finished 
while projecting a common touch trump was also combative with 
union lawyers who contend that easterns parent texas air corp is 
selling the shuttle as part of a larger effort to liquidate the 
financially troubled airline 
the air line pilots association the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers and the transport workers union of 
america contend that the sale violates the railway labor act because 
the unions were not consulted 
you think so negatively trump replied when machinists union 
attorney joseph guerrieri jr suggested that the sale would reduce 
employees protection from layoffs 
trump said texas air chairman frank lorenzo sought him out as an 
investor in the shuttle earlier this year because he knows i have 
money 
he would have come to you if he thought you had money trump 
told guerrieri 
trump said he declined lorenzos initial offer saying he would 
want to operate the shuttle himself without partners generally 
i dont have partners its easier that way 
at several points trump was reminded by us district judge 
barrington d parker that his jocular banter was inappropriate for 
the witness stand 
this is a courtroom this is not a boardroom parker said 
the judge however paid tribute to trumps abilities as a 
witness and entrepreneur when he overruled objections that the real 
estate developer was being badgered by union lawyers 
mr trump is no babe in the woods he is no neophyte he is a 
well respected businessman of no little experience parker said 
mr trump can take care of himself

does three reactors at the plant near aiken sc have been 
shut down due to safety concerns and maintenance needs they are the 
nations only source for tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen 
used in modern nuclear warheads 
because tritium decays at a rate of 55 percent a year it needs 
to be regularly replenished 
a report issued tuesday by the energy department outlined more 
than 160 separate tasks for restarting the plants k reactor it 
called for a complete overhaul of training safety management 
operating and inspection procedures 
the white house official who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified said energy came in and asked for new money to fund 
some of the cleanup 
in the fiscal 1990 budget review what happened is that they 
were told they cant have new money you have to find the money 
within your own budget which is the same case as every federal 
agency has now under the grammrudman restrictions he said 
the official added its not that it isnt a good cause and 
that everyone doesnt support doing it its where you get the 
money from 
with the start of the 1990 fiscal year 10 months off there are 
no indications that ombs rejection of the extra money means that 
the work will not be done

labor party leader shimon peres predicted 
wednesday his party would reverse itself and agree to talks with the 
rival likud bloc over forming a coalition government 
peres said labor could agree to a coalition if the rightwing 
likud gives labor an equal voice in the government pursues a middle 
east peace pact and stops building settlements in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
last week labors 110member executive bureau vetoed further 
negotiations with likud defying calls by peres and defense minister 
yitzhak rabin 
the centerleft partys 1432 member central committee was to 
meet thursday to reconsider that decision i estimate the proposal 
will be approved peres said on israel television 
still likud continued efforts to try to form a narrower 
coalition with rightwing and religious parties before labor meets 
prime minister yitzhak shamir the likud leader reached 
agreement wednesday on some sticking points with the national 
religious party and the tehiya party israel radio reported 
under the agreement likud would commit the new government to 
build 10 new settlements in the occupied lands and to give both 
parties ministries in the new government in exchange for their 
support the radio said likud leaders say they hope to form a 
narrow government then invite labor into a partnership 
but the agreement to increase settlements in the territories 
jeopardizes possible negotiations with the labor party 
of course i will not enter a government that will create 
settlements said peres who is israels foreign minister of 
course i will not go to a government that has no peace process 
i propose a government with the two major parties at its 
center but im not ready to join like a fifth column or a comet 
that only has its tail he said in the television interview 
the issue of negotiations with likud has deeply divided labor 
israel radio predicted acrimonious discussions continuing into 
the night on thursday with the old guard of peres and rabin finally 
triumphing over younger labor members the margin could be narrow 
the radio said 
labor leaders scheduled the central committee meeting after 
president chaim herzog a veteran laborite called peres to his 
office monday to request a reopening of coalition talks herzog said 
he had received thousands of letters demanding a joint government 
and a change in israels election laws 
in the nov 1 parliament elections likud won 40 seats to labors 
39 with the other 41 seats divided among 13 smaller parties likud 
has been asked to form a government and must get backing either from 
labor or from several of the smaller rightwing and religious 
parties to do so 
shamirs efforts to form a narrow government have been stymied by 
the stiff demands of the religious parties which are pushing for 
changes in religious legislation that could alienate secular 
israelis and nonorthodox jews

fiftysix people protesting the treatment of jews 
in the soviet union were arrested wednesday when they crossed 
barricades and sat in the street outside the united nations building 
during mikhail s gorbachevs speech 
they were part of a throng of chanting flagwaving 1000 
demonstrators who massed outside the un in an effort to remind the

appreciate the initial steps but theres much more to be done 
he cited a need for greater freedom for jews to practice their 
religion and emigrate 
comptroller harrison goldin one of the citys highest elected 
officials was among those who addressed the crowd 
we hope that as gorbachev pursues glasnost he will be equally 
vigorous in implementing a fundamental human freedom the right to 
emigrate and freely practice ones religion for jews that is 
fundamental to maintain jewish identity 
franklin smiles a rabbinical student was asked whether he 
thought gorbachev who stepped directly from his limousine to the 
un building even heard the demonstrators message

will pressure us officials to pressure their soviet counterparts

the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan some protesters 
chanted death to gorbachev 
members of an estonian group waved their national flag and

belgium should not build another nuclear 
power plant because it is cheaper to use energy sources such as coal 
and natural gas an economics ministry study said wednesday 
the government is to decide this week whether to build a proposed 
21 billion plant said ministry spokesman philippe demeyer at 
this stage the decision could still go either way 
using traditional energy sources could save the country up to 
915 million the study says electricity producers who support the 
construction of what would be belgiums eighth nuclear plant have 
said nonnuclear options would cost 21 billion more than atomic 
power 
critics have underlined the possible environmental damage from 
building the new plant about six miles from downtown antwerp near 
four other nuclear units and a cluster of chemical plants 
belgium derives 66 percent of its energy from nuclear power and 
its electricity consumption is increasing by about 3 percent a year

are dwarfing all funds contributed to and by other voluntary 
organizations for local human services independent sector 
president brian oconnell said in the foreward to the report the 
report documents that religious congregations are the primary 
voluntary service providers for neighborhoods 
according to the survey by the gallup organization nearly nine 
out of 10 of the nations 296000 congregations had one or more 
programs in human services and welfare with a heavy focus on family 
counseling activities 
seventy percent were involved in overseas charitable activities 
and 56 percent were involved institutional care such as hospitals 
nursing homes or hospices 
the 191 billion given by congregations mostly in the form of 
collections and pledges was in addition to the approximately 11 
billion contributed by other sources to religiously affiliated 
organizations such as schools nursing homes and day care centers 
the group said 
of the 481 billion of total expenditures by congregations in 
1986 84 billion was donated directly to other organizations and 
individuals the study said of that 55 billion went to 
denominational organizations and charities such as catholic 
charities 19 billion went to other charitable organizations in 
the community and 1 billion was given directly to individuals

the nations poorest rural areas experienced a 
dramatic reversal of years of progress in improving infant 
health during the first half of the 1980s a consumer research group 
said wednesday 
public voice for food and health policy analyzing infant health 
data from the nations 332 poorest rural counties between 1975 and 
1985 said the percentage of babies born at dangerously low weight 
dropped from 91 percent in 1975 to 83 percent in 1980 before 
climbing to 88 percent in 1985 
in addition the study said the infant mortality rate in the 
nations poorest rural areas declined by only 5 percent between 1980 
and 1985 after registering an 119 percent drop between 1975 and 
1980 
the infant mortality rate in the 332 poor rural counties was 136 
per 1000 live births in 1985 compared to 106 nationally and the 
low birthweight rate was almost 30 percent higher in those counties 
than in the nation as a whole 
the study said that if the infant mortality rate in the poor 
rural areas had been as low as the national average during the 
decade there would have been between 4000 and 6400 fewer infant 
deaths in those poor counties 
this country has long had one of the highest infant mortality 
rates among the worlds industrialized nations said rep roy 
rowland dga the only physician in congress and the vice chairman 
of the national commission to prevent infant mortality 
it has also been apparent for some years that the rate is even 
higher in economically depressed rural areas than in the country as 
a whole he said this study confirms our worst fears 
rowland whose district includes 13 of the 332 counties in the 
study said infant health problems in rural areas have been worsened 
by spending cuts under the reagan administration for health care 
programs 
but he said the problem also stems from a decline in the number 
of physicians in rural areas from the lack of transportation 
available to get pregnant women to health care centers and from a 
failure to educate poor women on the importance of prenatal care 
the study recommended that the federal government provide more 
maternal and child health care for rural areas 
it also called for new intiatives to expand access to food and 
nutrition assistance programs and for the development of more 
efficient ways to provide infant health care in impoverished rural 
areas

nasa on wednesday showed off a 
spacecraft resembling a giant insect that will be launched toward 
venus when the space shuttle atlantis makes its next flight 
the probe called magellan stood upright in a sterile white 
room its solar panels spread like the wings of a butterfly as 
reporters and photographers got a closeup look 
because of the spacecrafts susceptibility to certain 
contaminants the visitors wore white coveralls and hair covers and 
were asked not to use makeup or hairspray during the hours before 
the showing 
magellan is being groomed to be carried into space by atlantis on 
its fourth flight scheduled to begin april 28 
atlantis landed at edwards air force base calif tuesday at the 
end of its third flight a secret military mission it will be 
ferried back to cape canaveral next week atop a boeing 747 airliner 
to be readied for its next launch 
once the shuttle is in orbit the fivemember crew will release 
magellan and a rocket will start it on a 466day trip to venus 
the probe is to settle into an orbit around venus and obtain the 
best images yet of the planets surface with an advanced radar 
system 
the goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of 
the planet said stephen saunders magellan project scientist at 
the national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena calif 
he said the images would help scientists understand how venus was 
formed and might provide answers to the puzzling question of how 
earth and venus evolved so differently even though at the beginning 
of the solar system they were almost identical 
venus earths closest planetary neighbor has a surface 
temperature of about 900 degrees fahrenheit its atmosphere is 
almost entirely carbon dioxide and its atmospheric pressure is 90 
times that of earths it is 672 million miles from the sun 
compared to the earths 93 million miles from the sun 
magellan will be the first planetary probe launched from a 
shuttle as well as the first us planetary mission since two 
pioneer spacecraft were dispatched in 1978 to study venus 
atmosphere

soviets watching president mikhail s gorbachevs 
speech that was televised live from the united nations on wednesday 
praised his decision to reduce troop and tank levels in eastern 
europe 
but a few others grumbled that the decision was unnecessary or 
that the soviet union had more pressing problems 
its a really good idea to cut down the amount of troops abroad 
because it will save our country some money said oleg abramov a 
mechanic from the provincial city of tula 150 miles south of moscow 
abramov was in a crowd that watched the speech on color tv sets 
in the waiting hall of moscows kiev railway station 
we have a big army and a great army we can afford to bring 
some of the troops home and even things out with the americans a 
bit said alexander yermakov a truck driver from suburban moscow 
gorbachev proposed that 500000 troops be withdrawn from eastern 
europe and well as 10000 tanks he also called for a ceasefire in 
afghanistan starting jan 1 
the main evening news program vremya opened with a sixminute 
report on the speech including excerpts of meetings and other 
activities the official news agency tass carried separate stories 
on different aspects of the speech 
there have been no official comments on gorbachevs speech yet 
but a television commentator offered an explanation of the reaction 
of un delegates shown applauding gorbachev 
the professional quality of those sitting at the delegation 
tables dictates restraining a display of feeling the stormy 
expression of which here is just not acceptable but such a reaction 
which you have witnessed is difficult to recall the commentator 
said 
tass quickly carried congratulatory remarks on gorbachevs speech 
from various world leaders and prominent public figures including 
british prime minister margaret thatcher 
television later interrupted regular programming with gorbachevs 
arrival at governors island for a meeting with president reagan 
others who watched gorbachevs speech were more restrained in 
their assessment 
i like to watch gorbachev but i would really rather have a 
look at his wife said a moscow factory worker 
how could i possibly listen while waiting in line at the 
grocery store said another muscovite 
this is not the kind of thing we need to hear and not the sort 
of thing i support said an army soldier who refused to give his 
name 
muscovites were unable to watch the speech at several traditional 
spots a huge tv screen on a building on the busy kalinin prospekt 
remained dark throughout the speech and all the tv sets in the orbit 
electronics store were turned off 
the viewers got a rare glimpse of new york with pictures of 
gorbachevs limousine arriving at the united nations a panorama of 
the bustling city streets and reagans warm welcome on governors 
island

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on 
wednesday called for a vastly expanded role for the united nations 
from sending peacekeepers into afghanistan to barring weapons from 
outer space 
gorbachev also proposed a peace corps to rebuild afghanistan 
a team of international scientists to solve environmental disasters 
giving the world court jurisdiction in human rights cases and 
unsponsored talks between debtor and creditor nations 
the united nations gave the soviet union an honorable way to 
withdraw more than 100000 red army troops from afghanistan in the 
geneva accords which call for un monitoring of a total soviet 
pullout by feb 15 
the recent reinvigoration of its peacemaking role has again 
demonstrated the united nations ability to assist its members in 
coping with the daunting challenges of our time and working to 
humanize their relations gorbachev told the general assembly 
gorbachev proposed a complete ceasefire in afghanistan effective 
jan 1 along with sending to kabul and other strategic centers of 
the country a contingent of united nations peacekeeping forces 
currently about 50 officers of the un good office mission to 
afghanistan and pakistan are monitoring the soviet troop withdrawal 
and investigating complaints of violations of the geneva accords 
we also request the secretarygeneral to facilitate early 
implementation of the idea of holding an international conference on 
the neutrality and demilitarization of afghanistan said gorbachev 
we shall continue most actively to assist in healing the wounds 
of the war and support the proposal to create under the auspices 
of the united nations a voluntary international peace corps to 
assist in the revival of afghanistan he pledged 
the world body has embarked on an 18month 1166billion 
program to move afghan refugees home and revive the shattered 
agricultural economy of afghanistan 
turning from war on the ground to peace in the heavens gorbachev 
said the soviet union is also ready to cooperate in establishing 
an international space laboratory or manned orbital station designed 
exclusively for monitoring the state of the environment 
all activities in outer space must rule out the appearance of 
weapons there there is already a strongly felt need to develop 
an allembracing regime for peaceful work in outer space the 
verification of compliance with that regime would be entrusted to a 
world space organization an idea that the soviets have been 
promoting in the united nations for several years 
we are prepared to incorporate within its system our 
krasnoyarsk radar station in siberia which the united states says 
violates the antiballistic missile treaty 
soviet scientists are prepared to receive their foreign 
colleagues and discuss with them ways of converting it into an 
international center for peaceful cooperation by dismantling and 
refitting certain units and structures and to provide additional 
equipment the entire system could function under the auspices of 
the united nations he said 
president reagan has insisted on the destruction of the radar 
installation 
a major function of the space laboratory would be to keep track 
of pollution for which gorbachev had another proposal 
let us also think about setting up within the framework of the 
united nations a center for emergency environmental assistance its 
function would be promptly to send international groups of experts 
to areas with badly deteriorating environment he said 
the soviets have for years been promoting the concept of making 
the world courts humanrights rulings mandatory particularly on 
the five permanent members of the security council the soviet 
union united states china britain and france 
currently the opinions of the court formally called the 
international court of justice are now advisory 
we believe that the jurisdiction of the international court of 
justice at the hague as regards the interpretation and 
implementation of agreements on human rights should be binding on 
all states gorbachev said 
our ideal is a world community of states which are based on the 
rule of law and which subordinate their foreign policy activities to 
law he said 
developing nations have been crushed by debt repayment schedules 
during the 1980s the total third world debt is over 12 trillion 
and many nations cant even repay the interest on their loans 
gorbachev proposed limiting their official debtservicing 
payments depending on the economic performance of each of them or 
granting them a long period of deferral in the repayment of a major 
portion of their debt 
he backed the appeal of the genevabased un conference on trade 
and development for reducing debts owed to commercial banks which 
are almost exclusively in western nations 
the soviet union favors a substantive discussion of ways to 
settle the debt crisis at multilateral forums including 
consultations under the auspices of the united nations among heads 
of government of debtor and creditor countries gorbachev added

mikhail s gorbachev announced today the soviet 
union will unilaterally cut its military forces by a halfmillion 
troops and reduce its conventional arms substantially saying the 
military no longer can or must be an instrument of foreign 
policy 
gorbachev said the move comes without relation to 
international negotiations that have long been stalled in vienna 
addressing the united nations general assembly the soviet 
president said thousands of tanks as well as troops would be 
withdrawn from eastern european countries as well as from soviet 
europe and others forces would be pulled out of mongolia and asia 
in a major drawdown of the soviet military machine 
later after viewing the statue of liberty with president reagan 
and presidentelect george bush gorbachev was asked whether he 
sought anything in return for his military cuts 
in developing our relations we can work only together so we do 
hope that the united states and the europeans will work with us and 
will also take certain steps gorbachev told reporters he did not 
elaborate 
as he and reagan began their fifth and final summit meeting 
gorbachev said his announcement was a continuation and 
implementation of a general outline of soviet goals that he 
conceived as early as january 1986 
asked by reporters whether the soviet military establishment was 
resisting his plan the kremlin leader smiled and exclaimed nyet 
nyet nyet the soviets announced the retirement today of their 
longtime military chief of staff 
gorbachev said he considered todays talks with reagan and bush 
on governors island to be not a negotiating meeting but a 
gettogether 
gorbachevs announcement came in the first address by a soviet 
leader to the un in more than a quarter century gorbachev had 
hinted tuesday at the reduction of the soviet military forces 
believed to number 56 million 
gorbachev also turned to the un for further assistance in 
helping it remove its troops from afghanistan a pullout suspended 
amid claims that a unbrokered withdrawal accord has collapsed 
the soviet occupying force there once numbered more than 100000 
he called for a total ceasefire beginning jan 1 and a halt in 
all offensive operations in the wartorn nation which would include 
attacks by the afghan rebels 
he also proposed an end to all arms supplies to forces on both 
sides of the civil war and asked for a united nations peacekeeping 
force to oversee formation of a broadbased afghan government 
echoing a proposal by afghan leader najib gorbachev asked for an 
international conference to guarantee the neutrality and 
demilitarization of the mountainous country on the soviet border 
where soviet troops have been bogged down for nine years 
in a speech that blended ponderous rhetoric with a quotation from 
author john donne the soviet leader said the bell of every 
regional conflict tolls for all of us 
in addition gorbachev said bush will find the soviet union a 
ready partner in continuing negotiations for a 50percent cut in 
strategic nuclear arsenals and expressed hope there would be no 
long pauses or backtracking in ussoviet relations during the 
transition from the reagan to bush administrations gorbachev was 
meeting over lunch with bush and reagan at governors island in new 
york harbor 
calling for a period of peace gorbachev said that cold war 
politicians find it particularly hard to abandon old stereotypes 
and past practices but in an apparent reference to reagan and 
british prime minister margaret thatcher he said some western 
leaders are now drawing the appropriate conclusions 
reagan arriving at governors island was asked whether the 
soviet arms move would move forward arms control talks well have 
to wait and see reagan said 
in a speech to a hall packed with diplomats including a solemn 
secretary of state george shultz gorbachev also called for steps to 
alleviate the burden of debt repayment on underdeveloped countries 
and called for international steps to safeguard the environment 
saying he was living up to a pledge to switch from an offensive 
to a defensive force structure gorbachev told the world body his 
nation will maintain our countrys defense capability at a level 
of reasonable and reliable sufficiency to deter attack 
but he said the use of threat of force no longer can or must 
be an instrument of foreign policy 
he said by 1991 the soviets would withdraw 50000 men and 5000 
tanks from east germany czechoslovakia and hungary it is believed 
the soviets have 500000 troops in that region 
gorbachev and his aides had long been hinting at the reduction 
but had been opposed by top soviet generals notably marshal sergei 
akhromeyev the military chief of staff soviet spokesman gennady 
gerasimov said wednesday that akhromeyev had retired for reasons 
of health 
gorbachev said there would be further reductions on soviet soil 
bordering eastern europe as well as along the asian borders 
gorbachev said many of the forces to be pulled out of europe 
including six tank divisions from east germany czechoslovakia and 
hungary would be disbanded 
in a bold stroke that nonetheless had been anticipated for some 
months by western observers the reformist soviet president said he 
intends to convert his economy to an economy of disarmament and 
would develop and publish its plans for converting its defense 
plants and shifting military specialists into civilian industry 
gorbachevs overhaul and modernization of his country will 
require a major redistribution of resources 
his speech lasted a few minutes longer than an hour and was 
applauded by the international audience staterun radio and 
television broadcast gorbachevs address live in his home country 
in other parts of his speech gorbachev 
criticized the united states for denying a visa to palestinian 
leader yasser arafat so he could address the un general assembly 
we voice our deep regret over the incident gorbachev said 
shultz rejected arafats request on the grounds that he and the 
palestine liberation organization sponsor terrorism 
announced that the soviet union will soon reform its penal 
code soviet jews seeking to leave his country to be reunited with 
their families will be handled in a humane spirit he said but 
he said soviet citizens will still be denied exit visas if they have 
knowledge of state secrets 
suggested that the world court in the hague be used as a forum 
to adjudicate human rights complaints 
proposed creating an international organization that would help 
third world countries alleviate their massive debt payments he said 
the soviet union would be willing to enforce a 100year moratorium 
on debt repayment for some countries and cancel debts altogether in 
some cases 
proposed an international space lab devoted to environmental 
protection although he said quickly that any space mission must 
rule out the appearance of weapons there 
his announcement is expected to give new momentum to longstalled 
talks on reducing warsaw pact and nato conventional forces in 
central europe and improve the climate for a summit expected next 
spring between gorbachev and chinese leader deng xiaoping china has 
cut its own ground forces by 1 million troops in the past four 
years leaving it with about 4 million 
gorbachev is the first soviet leader to address the world body 
since 1960 when nikita s khrushchev spent three weeks in new york 
attending sessions of the general assembly his visit is best 
remembered for an incident in which he pounded his shoe on his desk 
to protest remarks by another speaker

a former czechoslovak foreign minister 
indirectly called wednesday for prague leaders to reconsider the 
1968 sovietled invasion and hardline policies still considered 
legitimate 
jiri hajek arrived in austria on monday on his first western 
trip in almost 20 years to speak at a seminar organized by several 
peace groups to mark international human rights day on dec 10 
the human rights activist traced developments since the universal 
declaration of human rights emerged 40 years ago 
i do not so much care about the rehabilitation of individual 
people but about whether one wants to make a clean sweep of the 
events of 1968 he said in subsequent comments 
hajek referred to the invasion the subsequent purge of a 
halfmillion communist party members and the banning from public 
life of thousands of dissident and other nonconformist 
intellectuals artists and politicians since then 
the czechoslovak leadership headed by communist party chief 
milos jakes upholds the validity of lessons to be learned a 
conservative and dogmatic analysis defending the invasion the 
stationing of soviet troops and the repressive policies pursued 
under what was officially termed the program of normalization 
i do not challenge my homelands leadership on the right to 
recognize mistakes and carry out changes hajek said 
the most important thing is the reemergence and reawakening of 
the civil society said hajek 75 a signatory to the charter 77 
human rights manifesto 
modernization of the economy has the highest priority in 
czechoslovakia but that is not possible without a democratization 
of society said hajek who has refrained from criticizing the 
prague establishment

showed no reason to abandon injections of the drug called 
chloroquine according to a report in thursdays new england journal 
of medicine

common because it is cheap widely available well tolerated and 
cures the disease quickly

prevent the disease which kills an estimated 2 million to 3 million 
people annually

patients who cannot take chloroquine pills because of coma or 
vomiting

hospital for tropical diseases in thailand tested seven different 
treatment regimens in 58 children with severe malaria in gambia

a rightwing town council 
leader wednesday filed complaints accusing state radio of violating 
emergency laws by reporting on a black boycott protesting the 
councils resegregation campaign 
the regulations often disregarded by local and foreign 
journalists outlaw calls for boycotts and prohibit news reports 
about their extent 
blacks living near the industrial town of boksburg east of 
johannesburg launched a boycott of whiteowned stores last week to 
protest the conservative partycontrolled town councils decision to 
resegregate public facilities that had been opened to all races in 
recent years 
the governing national party which drafted south africas 
segregation laws during 40 years in power has joined in the 
widespread condemnation of the conservative party move even though 
councils under nationalist control still maintain some whitesonly 
facilities 
the statecontrolled south african broadcasting corp which 
generally gives scant coverage to antigovernment protests has 
reported extensively on the boksburg controversy and has mentioned 
the boycott 
complaints against the network were lodged by gideon fourie 
chairman of the boksburg councils management committee he filed 
similar complaints against beeld a progovernment daily newspaper 
and against the save boksburg committee led by business leaders 
seeking to force the council to reverse its racist decision 
ferdi hartzenberg deputy leader of the conservative party said 
the obvious unwillingness or inability of the government to deal 
with the boycotts gives the impression that it covertly supports 
the actions 
hartzenberg said boksburgs conservative mayor beyers de klerk 
has filed complaints accusing the natal building society of 
intimidation because the savingsandloan association closed its 
boksburg agency in response to the segregation controversy 
the conservative party which depicts the governments limited 
reforms as capitulation to the black majority took control of 
dozens of town councils in nationwide local elections oct 26 a few 
of these councils have followed boksburgs lead by resegregating 
amenities while others have said such moves were unnecessary because 
the nationalistcontrolled councils they ousted had not integrated 
any amenities 
in carletonville a mining town where conservatives control the 
council councilors decided tuesday to drop consideration of a 
nighttime curfew for blacks

the supreme court studying the fbis power to 
keep criminal records secret was told wednesday that individuals 
have no privacy right to conceal records of arrests and convictions 
kevin t baine representing a cbs news reporter and the 
reporters committee for freedom of the press conceded that 
information about old arrests that did not lead to convictions could 
paint an unfair picture about someone 
but that doesnt make the information private baine said 
roy t englert a justice department lawyer who argued the reagan 
administration position said the fbi should be allowed to exclude 
socalled rap sheets from disclosure under the freedom of 
information act 
there is a balancing between the public interest and privacy 
rights englert said 
he chose an example from les miserables a famous work of 
french literature and now a hit broadway musical to underscore his 
point 
jean valjean the hero of the work may be entitled to privacy 
for his conviction for stealing bread years earlier englert said 
the justices are studying the administrations bid to scuttle an 
foia lawsuit by cbs news reporter robert schakne and the reporters 
committee 
schakne in 1978 sought all fbi records of the arrests 
indictments and court dispositions of any charges against four 
brothers three of whom were identified as associates of reputed 
pennsylvania crime boss russell bufalino 
schakne sought the fbi records on william phillip samuel and 
charles medico 
he was trying to determine if they had criminal records because 
their firm medico industries inc had received lucrative defense 
contracts with the help of former rep daniel j flood dpa 
flood pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 1980 and was placed on 
probation in connection with charges he accepted 50000 in bribes 
the reporters committee later filed a request similar to 
schaknes for the fbi records 
the fbi maintains rap sheets on some 25 million americans 
compiling arrest and conviction records supplied by federal state 
and local law enforcement agencies 
the pennsylvania crime commission in 1980 identified phillip 
angelo and william medico as members of the bufalino crime family 
the commission said bufalino regularly visited the medico family 
business in wilkesbarre pa over a 20year period 
the fbi released information about the late william medico said 
it had no records on phillip and samuel also deceased and refused 
to release its file on charles medico on grounds it would violate 
his privacy rights 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last year that the 
1966 foia law does not exempt such records from disclosure 
some justices expressed skepticism wednesday over the 
administrations bid to reverse the appeals court decision 
there is an expectation of privacy that a public record will 
not be discovered justice antonin scalia asked englert 
i thought the underpinning of the first amendment is that the 
government will not decide what information is more useful to the 
citizenry scalia said im not inclined for the government to 
make that determination 
the court is expected to announce its decision in the case by 
july 
the case is us department of justice vs reporters committee

conditions at walata prison have 
improved considerably since four political prisoners died of 
illtreatment surviving detainees told reporters and human rights 
officials 
international attention focused last month on this harsh 
penitentiary 800 miles southeast of the capital nouakchott when 
londonbased human rights organization amnesty international 
reported the deaths and poor conditions 
since then the prison chief and an assistant have been arrested 
and the government has ordered an investigation 
the army officer who was in charge of the prison told us we 
were sent here to die said mamadou bocar ly 38 a former 
interior minister jailed since october 1987 for attempting a coup 
he always repeated i can kill you and say you died of 
diarrhea ly told reporters allowed to visit the prison at the 
weekend with abdelhamid ould ghaly president of the mauritanian 
league of human rights 
the 32 men imprisoned in this former french fortress constitute 
the military wing of the black mauritanian liberation forces who 
last year tried to overthrow the military government of president 
muawiya ould sidahmed taya who himself seized power in a bloodless 
1984 coup 
in a nov 21 report amnesty international said the government 
had confirmed the deaths of four political prisoners writer tene 
youssouf gueye policeman ba alassane oumar lt abdoul ghoudouss 
ba and former health minister djigo tafsirou 
the report said prisoners at walata built in the 1930s and 
isolated in the middle of the desert live under particularly 
harsh conditions suffering from malnutrition and receiving no 
medical care extreme temperatures aggravated the situation 
amnesty also said unofficial reports spoke of the deaths of three 
others ly journalist ibrahim sarr and engineer amadou moktar sow 
those three however were interviewed by reporters on the trip to 
walata 
all prisoners they saw appeared in good health officials said 
families of the prisoners would be allowed to visit soon 
after the deaths the government promised to take action 
thirtyone civilian prisoners were transferred to ayoun elatrouss 
185 miles west of here 
the civilians have been imprisoned since 1986 for distributing 
the black mauritanian manifesto a document accusing the 
government of racism 
this west african nation is dominated by people of arab berber 
origin who outnumber blacks 41 blacks have become increasingly 
vocal in opposing the arabs 
according to prison inmates the villain at walata was a lt 
ghaly who not only imposed harsh conditions of forced labor and 
poor food but regularly mistreated prisoners 
we ate only rice and water for nine months said abdoullay 
milikel there have been improvements since last may when ghaly 
was removed 
the real turning point prisoners say was when interior minister 
gibril ould abdallahy visited and met detainees 
mauritanian officials said appropriate measures have been taken 
against those involved 
the human rights leader said he was satisfied with the current 
situation of the detainees but he urged mauritanian authorities to 
impose heavy punishment on those who illtreated prisoners

authorities tested eight bottles of 
cocacola on wednesday for traces of a deadly and outlawed rat 
killer blamed for poisoning three family members leaving one 
comatose 
investigators were unsure whether the poisoning was accidental 
we wont know until we hear back from the fbi lab said steve 
hulsey polk county sheriffs spokesman lab results were not 
expected before friday 
authorities also made plans to inspect a tampa plant where the 
cocacola was bottled said rob martin a company spokesman 
high concentrations of thallium sulfate a rat poison and toxic 
insecticide banned from general use in 1965 were found in four 
empty 16 oz bottles of cocacola at the polk county home of peggy 
carr police said 
mrs carr 41 remained in critical condition at winter haven 
hospital unresponsive and on a respirator she was admitted oct 
31 hulsey said stepson travis carr 16 was stable and mrs 
carrs son duane dubberly 16 was released friday 
it was unclear where the family bought the soda or when it was 
consumed 
martin said there have been no other reports of poisoning related 
to cocacola 
we do not have any evidence it occurred in the bottling 
plant he said 
the four bottles were part of a lot of nearly 200000 shipped to 
central florida markets six weeks ago authorities were testing the 
four empty bottles and four others that were full 
we believe the rest of the lot is safe but we want local 
state and health authorities to draw the conclusions martin said 
earlier this week samples of the batch in question were tested a 
second time and no traces of thallium sulfate were found martin 
said 
dr sven normann director of the florida poison information 
center said thallium sulfate can be found in the form of a crystal 
powder or a paste which dissolves in water one gram of the chemical 
is considered a fatal dose

mikhail s gorbachev announced before a global 
audience today that he was cutting the size of the red army and 
reducing soviet forces in east europe then met with ronald reagan 
and george bush at a lunch that closed one chapter in ussoviet 
relations and opened another 
looking toward the bush presidency gorbachev told the united 
nations general assembly that he wanted to work with the new 
american president to make 1989 a decisive year he said he was 
ready to move toward a 50 percent slash in the superpowers 
stockpiles of nuclear bombers submarines and missiles and the 
elimination of chemical weapons 
reagan meeting gorbachev for the fifth time in a relationship 
that has become increasingly mellow welcomed the soviet leaders 
initiatives 
it was not a proposal it was a decision reagan said while 
seated at the luncheon table at admirals house on governors island 
within sight of the statue of liberty 
naturally i heartily approve reagan said 
he said the united states would stand ready to reduce the number 
of troops in the armies of te western alliance as long as this 
left us with a superiority 
after reagan boarded air force one for washington secretary of 
state george p shultz told a news conference that the president 
found gorbachevs speech with its unilateral decision to reduce 
soviet forces constructive and important 
as for the lunch said shultz the conversation was direct open 
informal and characterized by lots of humor somehow he said 
the subject came up and reagan chatted with gorbachev about the 
beneficial effects of riding horses 
shultz said there was discussion of the possibility of a 
gorbachevbush summit and although no immediate plans were made for 
one obviously there will be one at some appropriate moment 
a more thorough response to gorbachevs troopcutting proposal 
could come tonight when reagan returns to washington to address the 
american enterprise institute or on thursday at the last reagan 
white house news conference 
after lunch the three leaders rode in a long motorcade to a point 
on the island that offered a handsome view of the statue of liberty 
and of the skyline of lower manhattan they turned from one view to 
another for a few minutes making small talk with the help of an 
interpreter they wore overcoats 
reagan asked his view of the meeting said read our smiles 
gorbachev answering reporters questions stressed a need for 
cooperation 
in developing our relations we can work only together so we do 
hope that the united states and the europeans will work with us and 
will also take certain steps he said 
like his hosts he appeared relaxed and in good humor 
before lunch gorbachev was asked whether he was getting 
resistance from the soviet military establishment to his decision to 
reduce by about 10 percent the size of the 56 million red army he 
replied with a smile in russian nyet nyet nyet 
while the three leaders lunched their wives nancy reagan 
barbara bush and raisa gorbachev joined the wives of other 
diplomats and a number of other prominent women at a meal elsewhere 
the hostess was marcela perez de cuellar wife of the un 
generalsecretary 
i am happy to be in the city you call the big apple mrs 
gorbachev said after stepping from a limousine to attend the 
luncheon she said she liked america 
gorbachev belitting military power as a solution to 
international tensions told the united nations general assembly 
that tens of thousands of tanks as well as troops would be 
withdrawn from eastern european countries and other forces would be 
pulled from mongolia and asia in a reduction in size of the soviet 
military machine 
and he called for a jan 1 ceasefire in afghanistan for the 
creation of a un force to keep the peace there for the formation 
of a broadbased afghan government and for an end to all arms 
shipments to either side in that countrys war the united states 
has been aiding anticommunist fighters in that war 
as gorbachev arrived about 1000 demonstrators waved flags and 
chanted demanding freedom for soviet jews police arrested 58 
another thousand eastern european emigres demonstrated nearby a 
group of ukrainian emigres many of them elderly waved ukrainian 
flags members of an estonian group waved their national flag and 
chanted one two three four open up the iron door 
while gorbachev was spelling out his actions and his ideas 
reagan and bush flew separately to new york to have lunch with him 
said gorbachev if we score any points we can do it only 
together if we try to score points alone nothing good will 
happen 
bush let reagan do the speaking 
he said that there have been no meaningful negotiations on 
conventionalforce reductions and that the soviet leaders proposal 
is a unilateral action on their part 
speaking forcefully at the un for a bit more than an hour the 
soviet leader paraphrased the english poet john donne by way of 
ernest hemingway the soviet leader said the bell of every 
regional conflict tolls for all of us 
gorbachev criticized the reagan administration on one action 
its decision to deny a visa to palestinian leader yasser arafat so 
he could address the un from the same podium he was using 
the general assembly voted to hold a session in geneva so arafat 
could make his speech only israel supported the us action taken 
on grounds that arafat and his palestine liberation organization 
sponsor terrorism we voice our deep regret over the incident 
said gorbachev 
on yet another front gorbachev pledged that jews seeking to 
leave his country to be reunited with their families will be 
treated in a humane spirit but he said soviet citizens will 
still be denied exit visas if they have knowledge of state secrets 
worldwide he said military force no longer can or must be an 
instrument of foreign policy 
it is now quite clear that building up military power makes no 
country omnipotent gorbachev declared whats more onesided 
reliance on military power ultimately weakens other components of 
national security 
red alert city braces for gorby gridlock screamed the 
frontpage headline of the new york post 
gorbachevs visit to new york and the united nations was the 
first by a soviet leader since 1960 when an irate nikita s 
khrushchev punctuated his rhetorical points by pounding his shoe on 
a desk in the general assembly 
a unilateral soviet troop reduction would begin to redress what 
the north atlantic treaty organization describes as a more than 21 
warsaw bloc edge in conventional arms in europe and provide 
momentum to long stalled talks on reducing forces on both sides it 
could also boost gorbachevs image in western europe

former president ford on wednesday lobbied 
congressional leaders to reform their budget procedures to help 
combat the federal deficit and ensure a strong economy 
the budget process is in shambles said ford who had 
breakfast and lunch with congressional leaders concerned with budget 
matters 
the former president appeared at a press conference with former 
congressional budget office director rudolph g penner and political 
scientist alan j abramson two urban institute scholars who have 
written a new book on budget reform ford wrote the foreword for the 
book 
im concerned that unless you do something to correct the 
process there is no way to get the white house and congress to 
achieve the deficit reduction results for a healthy economy the 
former president said 
among the books suggestions is giving the president more sway 
over budget decisions including the power to veto the congressional 
resolutions that guide the drafting of spending and tax bills 
it also calls for giving the president more power to cancel 
spending already approved by congress 
currently the president proposes cuts but congress can stop them 
by ignorning them the authors propose requiring congress to vote to 
block the presidents proposals 
the book also calls for making the budget process less prone to 
political tampering including the use of an outside board of 
experts to make economic forecasts 
ford had breakfast with house speaker jim wright dtexas 
majority leader thomas s foley dwash minority leader bob 
michel rill incoming house budget chairman leon panetta 
dcalif and senate minority leader bob dole 
he later lunched with senate budget writers including incoming 
budget committee chairman james r sasser dtenn and the senior 
republican on the panel pete v domenici of new mexico 
ford and another former president jimmy carter have together 
proposed steps for reducing the federal deficit including some new 
taxes

attorney carla hills shapes up as an good 
choice for the nations chief trade negotiator despite her lack of 
experience in that field a senator active in trade issues said 
wednesday 
what i want is someone who is a tough negotiator and does not 
come to the job with a prefabricated philosophy sen john c 
danforth rmo said in an interview he said that described mrs 
hills 
danforth scoffed at the notion that mrs hills who was secretary 
of housing and urban development in the ford administration might 
be hampered in the post of us trade representative by her lack of 
trade experience 
presidentelect george bush announced his selection of mrs hills 
on tuesday 
us trade representative clayton k yeutter is wrapping up three 
years in the job in which president reagan vetoed three trade bills 
despite congressional clamor over record deficits in global markets 
reagan finally signed a wideranging 1000page bill cosponsored 
by danforth this year 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas another 
cosponsor said tuesday that mrs hills is a very able person 
but added a reservation 
i had hoped frankly that wed have someone from the business 
world who had extensive international experience in trade bentsen 
said 
danforth who had lunch with mrs hills on wednesday noted that 
most previous trade representatives came to the post with trade 
experience but that mrs hills had proven herself as a cabinet 
member 
my impression is that she is a very able person with a very 
keen mind and that shes energetic and she certainly has a lot of 
experience in washington danforth said 
he declined to speculate on whether she would be able to prevail 
in a policy dispute with secretary of statedesignate james a baker 
iii who as treasury secretary often was the reagan administrations 
guiding hand on trade 
i think it remains to be seen what the trade policy of the new 
administration will be and who the key players are danforth said 
meanwhile rep sam gibbons dfla said he would imagine that 
secretary baker is going to have a lot to do with trade as he did 
when he was secretary of the treasury 
he has a deep interest in it and a high degree of skill at 
it said gibbons who chairs the house ways and means trade 
subcommittee he said however that mrs hills might well prove 
effective in her job 
you have to have one of two things to be a good trade 
representative gibbons said you either have to have a high 
degree of technical skill and be a good bargainer or you have to 
have the ear of the president 
i imagine that hills has the presidents ear he said i 
say that because her appointment came early in this and because i 
think george bush listens to her at least that is what im told 
he said that one of the best trade representatives was democratic 
attorney robert strauss and he didnt know a thing about it when 
he walked into the job but jimmy carter would listen to him and 
thats what it takes

the national economic commission trying to 
break the sevenyear deadlock over huge budget deficits was told 
wednesday that it matters little to overall economic performance 
whether the deficit reduction comes from spending cuts or tax 
increases 
the highlevel advisory panel received a study prepared by the 
congressional budget office which showed that a fullscale assault 
on the budget deficit will not cause a recession as long as the 
federal reserve helps out by lowering interest rates to offset the 
reduced federal spending 
the cbo report rejected arguments often raised by critics that 
the current economic recovery could be thrown into a recession if 
the budget deficit is brought down too rapidly or if politicians 
rely too heavily on tax increases to close the gap between revenues 
and spending 
commission cochairmen robert strauss and drew lewis said they 
believed the cbo report showed that the commission had wide leeway 
from an economic standpoint in selecting a mix of spending cuts and 
tax increases to close the budget gap 
but the two men said the economic models did not take into 
account the political realities of crafting a package acceptable to 
congress and presidentelect george bush who has vowed to reject 
any new taxes 
we are right where we were at first the problem is 10 percent 
economic and 90 percent political lewis said 
the deficit panel was created by congress a year ago to provide 
advice to congress and the presidentelect on ways to eliminate the 
federal budget deficit which climbed to 1551 billion in the 
fiscal year which ended on sept 30 
the cbo ran four types of deficit reduction efforts through 
computer simulations of the us economy to see what the impact 
would be 
all of the options would achieve deficit cuts of 120 billion to 
130 billion by 1994 but would arrive at that goal in different 
ways one option got all of the reductions from domestic programs 
exempting social security and defense from any cuts this proposal 
also ruled out any tax increases 
at the other extreme a fourth proposal got half of its deficit 
savings from cuts in defense social security and other entitlement 
programs and other domestic programs and the other half from higher 
taxes 
fred ribe assistant director for fiscal analysis for the cbo 
said that the various computer models showed little difference on 
economic growth regardless of the mix of spending cuts and tax 
increases which were used 
he said that all of the models assumed that the loss of economic 
stimulus from the various combinations of reduced government 
spending and higher taxes would be offset by a more stimulative 
policy on the part of the federal reserve 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has indicated that the 
central bank would be willing to pursue a looser monetary policy 
pushing interest rates lower if congress cooperated by reducing the 
borrowing demands of the federal government 
ribe said that if the fed did not keep its part of the bargain 
the economic models forecast that economic growth as measured by 
the gross national product would be 1 percentage point lower than 
it otherwise would be over the next five years 
the cbo projections used economic computer models developed by 
data resources inc a lexington mass consulting firm washington 
university in st louis and yale professor ray fair 
the revenue options ranged from no increases in taxes to a 
package of tax hikes on personal income and increases in taxes for 
energy beer wine and cigarettes 
the commissions wednesday hearing was scheduled to be the last 
public meeting for the panel this year the panel had planned to 
hold a closeddoor session next monday to give the 12 members an 
opportunity to discuss various deficit cutting options 
several news organizations have gone to court in an effort to 
force that meeting to be opened to the public us district judge 
joyce hens green heard arguments on the dispute wednesday and 
indicated she would issue a ruling later this week

the farmers home administration said wednesday 
that some of the 83480 loan delinquencies targeted last month for 
official collection had already been settled by the time notices 
were sent out 
moreover many state fmha offices have been reporting far fewer 
delinquencies than the agriculture department agency listed on nov 
25 when it finished sending out the notices 
agency spokesman joe oneill said the 83480 loan delinquencies 
reported last month represented everybody who owed money and 
were behind in their payments to fmha 
in all more than 8 billion in overdue loans is involved the 
notices give a delinquent borrower 45 days to fill out forms showing 
how the debt will be settled 
oneill said in an interview that lists of 83490 delinquent 
loans were sent to county fmha offices so local officials could weed 
out those who had already made arrangements to settle their debt or 
for some other reason were not slated to get the notices 
as a result several thousand borrowers were pared from the 
tally he said those remaining were mailed notices by certified 
mail over a 10day period beginning on nov 15 
no indeed we did not sent out that many oneill said 
its probably closer to 80000 somewhere in there 
congress ordered fmha in the agricultural credit act of 1987 to 
revise its lending practices and to come up with ways of handling 
longoverdue debt owed by thousands of farmers one of the important 
features is a debt writedown or foregiveness provision which took 
effect last month 
the purpose of the notices is to give tardy payers an opportunity 
to let fmha know how they want to handle their debt under the new 
law if a farmer does not respond within the 45day period after 
receiving the notice the agency can begin collection proceedings 
including foreclosure and forced liquidation 
oneill said another point of misunderstanding is the manner in 
which local fmha offices have been carrying some of the borrowers on 
agency books for example he said some offices may not be 
including those whose overdue accounts have been accelerated or 
put into the foreclosure or forcedsale pipeline 
the 1987 law also changed the definition of a borrower to include 
anyone who owes fmha money so all those pastdue loans in 
acceleration and even those where the borrower is no longer 
farming are included in the list of delinquencies 
anytime you start playing with numbers its difficult at 
best oneill said

sorority sisters whose house was raided 
by nude fraternity members filed a criminal complaint wednesday 
saying the prank was frightening at a time when several campusarea 
rapes remain unsolved 
fraternities frequently pull pranks on sororities said 
michele knapp president of the 117member gamma phi beta chapter 
but this went too far quite frankly the women were petrified 
hearing strange men pounding on their doors especially since there 
has been a rash of rapes on campus recently 
police say they believe two men are responsible for as many as 14 
rapes on and near the ann arbor campus since september 1987 the 
last rape reported near the campus was oct 18 sgt tom caldwell 
said most of the assaults for which no arrests have been made 
occurred inside buildings 
the panty raid occurred in the early morning of nov 29 knapp 
said three or four nude fraternity members entered several 
bedrooms stole lingerie and asked girls to sign their posteriors 
i was stunned and dazed said amy long 20 of long island 
ny i could smell the alcohol on him and he kept asking me to 
autograph his rear except he used more vulgar language 
long said it may sound like a prank but it is more serious 
when you consider the invasion of privacy they had no right to come 
into my room and go through my personal things 
knapp accused police of dismissing it as a fraternity prank 
we are upset that the police did not seem to take us 
seriously she said 
caldwell said officers tried to take statements at the sorority 
house and from dorice kupper the housemother but were denied entry 
and told the incident had been reported to campus authorities 
the housemother would not allow the officers in caldwell 
said then she turns around and criticizes us for not taking any 
action 
caldwell said prosecutors will consider such charges as unlawful 
entry indecent exposure and theft 
a woman who answered the sororitys telephone wednesday said the 
sorority had no comments about the raid and she declined to give 
her name but earlier kupper said she was disturbed by officers 
attitude 
the officer tried to discourage the girls from filing charges 
saying theyd be on their record for the rest of their lives and may 
keep them the fraternity members from getting jobs she said

there was discussion of regional issues the president mentioned 
the cooperative effort that we are making together on southern 
africa the general secretary commented on his readiness to continue 
cooperation on seeking peace in the middle east and while we were 
waiting for the private meeting to end mr shevardnadze and i 
discussed cambodia at some length and his meeting and the general 
secretarys meeting with the chinese foreign minister and korea 
there were also references to peopletopeople exchanges 
so you can see that all elements of what we have described as the 
fourpart agenda came into play although this was not a kind of 
formal meeting so it was an informal flow from one thing to 
another but i think in many respects very illuminating as the 
one person or another was drawn out on a subject in an informal way 
and in that sense served a good purpose of people not only saying 
that they wished to see continuity but in the interplay kind of 
bringing that about by virtue of the presence of the vice president 
and the president together there with the general secretary 
q mr secretary did you have any reaction to his criticism of 
our decision on the plo did that come up during the meeting do you 
have any reaction to what he said during his speech independent of 
whether that came up and do you have any comment on mr arafats 
meeting in sweden 
shultz well as far as his comments in his speech are concerned 
i have we have described at length the reasons for my decision the 
president supports that decision most members of the united states 
senate do i recognize there are many differences of opinion and he 
expressed his but thats where we are 
as far as the meeting in stockholm is concerned i read the 
report of what was said this morning and it seems to be a little 
bit further clarification and i welcome that and theres still a 
considerable distance to go 
q mr secretary this unilateral troop reduction that gorbachev 
announced seems to amount to about 10 percent of soviet and eastern 
bloc forces in that area does it appear to you at first glance that 
that will bring a parity about because we contend that the eastern 
bloc has superiority in conventional forces now 
shultz there is a superiority more troops more tanks more 
various other categories of weapons and these reductions being 
unilateral are a welcome and significant step in the right 
direction but even after theyre completed in 1991 there still 
will be a very significant asymmetry so theres a lot of 
negotiating to do

honduras said the air force 
intercepted a sovietbuilt nicaraguan attack helicopter in its air 
space wednesday and the leftist sandinistas government said an army 
defector flew it across the border 
foreign minister carlos lopez contreras told a news conference in 
tegucigalpa the very sophisticated aircraft was intercepted by 
honduran fighters when it illegally penetrated our territory 
he said the mi25 helicopter was forced to land at the toncontin 
air base outside tegucigalpa the capital and authorities were 
investigating 
nicaraguas defense ministry said an army defector flew the 
chopper to honduras it demanded the return of both aircraft and 
pilot 
a nicaraguan statement identified the pilot as capt edwin 
estrada leiva and said he landed at hernan costa mejia air base in 
honduras another name for toncontin it said the foreign ministry 
was in touch with honduras about the return of the helicopter and of 
estrada described as a cia terrorist 
the soviet union has provided nicaraguas government with about 
40 helicopters and the pentagon says 12 are mi25 hind d flying 
tanks which can ferry up to 13 soldiers into combat at 200 mph 
mi25s are heavily armed and were used extensively in afghanistan 
a new york times report on march 27 said chad allowed the united 
states last year to examine soviet arms it had captured from 
retreating libyan forces including an mi24 hind in exchange for 
35 million in military aid to the african nation the times quoted 
the pentagon as refusing to discuss the matter 
pentagon sources said wednesday an mi25 is worth 2030 million

mikhail s gorbachev gave new momentum to arms 
control talks wednesday with his theatrical announcement at the 
united nations that the red army would reduce its forces by 10 
percent and pull 50000 of its troops along with tanks and cannon 
from eastern europe 
us analysts have been predicting such a move for months 
believing it could further boost gorbachevs popularity in the west 
and allow him divert needed funds from the military to the domestic 
sector 
gorbachev praised us willingness to discuss arms reductions and 
said that the soviet leadership has decided to demonstrate once 
again its readiness to reinforce this healthy process not only in 
words but in deeds 
within the next two years their numerical strength will be 
reduced by 500000 men he said near the end of a lengthy address 
to the un general assembly the soviet armed forces total about 
56 million men and women 
the numbers of conventional armaments will also be 
substantially reduced he said this will be done unilaterally 
gorbachev said the soviets would pull 50000 troops out of east 
germany czechoslovakia and hungary reducing by about 10 percent 
the number of forwarddeployed red army forces arrayed against the 
north atlantic treaty organization 
president reagan after he and presidentelect bush met over 
lunch with the soviet leader said i heartily approve of the 
kremlin troop decision 
conventional arms negotiations will continue said reagan and 
we should certainly adjust us force levels in europe if it 
would turn out that this left us with a superiority 
gorbachev and his aides had long been hinting at such a 
withdrawal but had been opposed by top soviet generals notably 
marshal sergei akhromeyev chief of staff of the soviet armed 
forces akhromeyev has resigned his post but will continue as an 
adviser to gorbachev on arms control 
besides the troop reductions gorbachev said the red army would 
be shedding 10000 tanks 8500 artillery systems and 800 combat 
aircraft from forward deployment in eastern europe 
exact details of the withdrawals were not made public but they 
appeared to fall short of redressing the 251 edge the warsaw pact 
holds over nato in conventional armies 
there still will be a very significant asymmetry so there is 
still a lot of negotiating to do secretary of state george p 
shultz told reporters at a news conference following the luncheon 
nevertheless gorbachevs proposals appeared to go a long way 
toward addressing us concerns over the heavy concentration of 
soviet forces near the borders of western europe 
a reduction in soviet forces could increase pressure in congress 
and possibly among pacifists in western europe to withdraw some of 
the more than 300000 us forces stationed in west germany 
gorbachevs announcement seemed more significant than a statement 
by soviet president leonid brezhnev in 1979 that 20000 soviet 
troops would pulled out of east germany western analysts later 
concluded that there had been no significant reduction in the soviet 
force in the wake of brezhnevs announcement 
the action also should impart new momentum to longstalled talks 
to cut nato and warsaw pact forces in europe negotiations that have 
made virtually no progress in more than 14 years 
the two blocs and nonaligned countries in europe are now 
negotiating the ground rules for a new series of talks to reduce 
conventional forces from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains 
at the edge of european russia 
additionally gorbachev said cuts would be made in the asian 
part of the country too a gesture likely to improve the 
atmosphere of his summit next spring with chinese leader deng 
xiaoping 
gorbachev and his aides have been hinting at the red army 
reductions in defining what they describe as a new military doctrine 
of reasonable sufficiency based on an ability to defend against 
attack rather than to mount a major offensive 
many us officials thought gorbachev would announce troop cuts 
during the moscow summit last may 
but senior military officials led by akhromeyev have opposed 
any decrease in soviet forces without a reduction by the west 
in accordance with the new defensive doctrine we are beginning 
to introduce some changes in organizational structure of the soviet 
armed forces in order to impart a defensive nature to the armed 
forces but this will demand some time akhromeyev said last july 
during a visit to the pentagon 
the complete realization of the changes bears on bilateral 
steps he said therefore we must sit at the negotiating table 
and address the outstanding issues between us 
to date us officials have not seen any changes in the size 
armaments and deployment of the red army 
now they are certain to be watching closely to see if gorbachev 
is true to his word

china has been authorized to buy an additional 
1 million metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices the 
agriculture department said wednesday 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg said the wheat will be 
available to china under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 
367 bushels of wheat 
under eep arrangements exporters can sell us commodities at 
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then collect 
free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses 
or subsidies 
the subsidies have ranged from less than 20 to more than 40 per 
ton of wheat or in the range of 54 cents to 109 per bushel 
under previous eep authorizations china has bought more than 5 
million tons of wheat for delivery in the 198889 marketing year 
which began june 1 the previous authorization which was for 2 
million tons was issued on aug 18 all but 10000 tons of was 
used and that now will be added to the 1 million tons just

washington ap soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs promise 
of a unilateral reduction in red army troops won cautious praise 
wednesday on capitol hill with legislators saying they were pleased 
but that they wanted action not words 
gorbachev in a speech wednesday to the united nations pledged 
to cut the red armys 56 million troop size by 10 percent and said 
he would order some soviet troops and tanks withdrawn from eastern 
europe 
now hes done more than anyone thought he could do 
politically said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house 
armed services committee his cuts are dramatic and significant 
especially that he will make them unilaterally 
but aspin added dont be distracted by all the dramatic 
numbers youre hearing we dont fight wars by the numbers 
aspin noted that gorbachev promised to reorganize the soviet 
military and added a reorganization that removes the soviet 
offensive capability declaws the russian bear and is far more 
important than numbers on a chart 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said mr gorbachev 
has promised a lot but can he deliver only his actions not just 
words will tell the world whether his un speech becomes a 
oneofakind christmas gift or just another stocking stuffer 
if we really see such cutbacks in eastern europe then we might 
indeed be seeing a good faith first step toward real conventional 
force parity our negotiators in vienna will be insisting on no 
less dole said 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee called gorbachevs statements profoundly 
welcome 
if the soviet government follows through on gorbachevs pledge 
this will challenge the united states and its allies to act 
imaginatively to start a similar process of arms reduction pell 
said 
pell said the administration should take advantage of the 
openings created by gorbachevs speech to accelerate the momentum of 
arms control negotiations on conventional as well as nuclear 
weapons 
sen george mitchell dmaine the new senate majority leader 
said while gorbachevs proposals are commendable they must be 
considered in view of overall levels of forces in europe and the 
offensive structure of soviet forces 
sen john warner rva top republican on the armed services 
committee said i would urge a note of caution explaining that 
even after the reductions the soviets will have two and onehalf 
times as many tanks three and onehalf times as many artillery 
pieces as nato forces 
its too early to tell exactly the impact of these dramatic 
announcements he said 
the soviets may simply reduce the number of older less capable 
weapons warner said the soviet union has quite a collection of 
antiquated military equipment 
sen alan cranston dcalif was euphoric gorbachevs speech 
could be the end of the cold war the end of the arms race the end 
of the danger of nuclear war and the end of the burdens that we and 
they carry on military preparedness 
of course we need deeds not words he added we have to 
see what the soviets actually do 
sen steve symms ridaho a member of the armed services 
committee and one of the senates most conservative members warned 
against having high hopes from gorbachevs visit to new york 
we must not allow the soviet public relations machine to use 
the warm feelings of the holidays to lull us into a false sense of 
security symms said 
american people do have a breathless naivete in our desire for 
peace said rep lynn martin rill a member of the house armed 
services committee thats a nice attitude but you have to be 
careful if he gorbachev removes the approximate 10 percent hes 
talking about the soviet union still has an incredible advantage 
it doesnt make it equal

i think the principal thing that is notable about them as 
described in the speech and then as asked about them during our 
meeting is the attention to trying to affect things like bridging 
capabilities that are offensive in nature and therefore to try to 
have the forces arranged so that theyre more clearly defensive in 
their nature but it still remains that after these reductions take 
place and if nothing else takes place there will be a major 
asymmetry in important categories of force structure for the soviet 
union but nevertheless this is a welcome step in the right 
direction 
q can i just follow that up that was the point that mr 
gorbachev made he said that at the end of these reductions would be 
clear that his forces were in a defensive posture what do you think 
shultz some of the reductions and i mentioned an illustration 
seemed to be pointed in that direction and thats a welcome 
development obviously we have sat i have sat in the hall and 
others watched on television his exposition of this and so im 
giving you a general reaction but obviously were going to sit and 
study this out carefully in the united states and in nato and factor 
it into our thinking about how to position ourselves in the coming 
conventional arms talks 
q mr secretary do you agree with mr gorbachev there are no 
political prisoners in the soviet union and could you tell us what 
you think youre getting two questions here for the price of one 
what do you think of his proposal for a mutual suspension of arms 
supplies to the belligerents in afghanistan 
shultz well as far as prisoners of conscience political 
religious prisoners are concerned there have been a great many 
released a great many in our opinion there still are such 
prisoners in the soviet union but the number is far less in our 
count now there can be differences of opinion about whether 
somebody is in prison because of political expression or religious 
expression or because of violation of the law so what we need and 
what i believe it will be possible to construct is a procedure a 
means through which we will go through with them name by name the 
people on our list and try to determine whether or not that person 
should be released or whether there is some valid reason for the 
imprisonment and i believe that we will be able to get that into 
place and so thatll be a way of answering the question in a kind 
of direct personal sense now youre other question was what 
q the proposal he had a very detailed proposal including the 
mutual suspension of assistance and military supplies to the 
belligerents in afghanistan is that a good idea 
shultz well of course we proposed to the soviet union quite 
some time ago a mutual cessation of supplies and they rejected 
that and so as we insisted and they agreed that there had to be 
symmetry we said well if you insist on supplying then we 
insist that we will have that right actually the mujahedeen 
dont need a lot of more supplies because theyre capturing a great 
deal of supplies 
but at any rate we have been prepared for such a proposal but 
it is tied in with a lot of other things of course the question of 
peacekeeping of trying to help people with reconstruction and 
development that there will be a massive effort needed 
but i dont think there is any way there could be agreement that 
forces would just continue to hold the ground that they have because 
the people of afghanistan broadly speaking do not accept the fact 
that the puppet regime is entitled to hold certain areas of that 
country 
lets review the situation 
there were 15 million people estimated as the population of 
afghanistan in 1979 right now there are a little over three million 
refugees in pakistan a little over two million in iran its 
estimated there are a million and a half casualties over two 
million internal refugees 
so i dont think its surprising that people who have been 
subjected to that kind of turmoil dont want to have anything to do 
with a puppet regime that seemed to have participated in it 
now i think it is a good thing that the soviets are now talking 
directly to the mujahedeen and certainly it is possible the 
mujahedeen are ready to negotiate arrangements whereby there wont 
be attacks on soviet forces as they leave but the key here is 
first and foremost for the soviet troops to leave as they are 
scheduled to do and i believe and hope that that will take place 
q mr secretary you mentioned in your opening statement that 
the presence of vice president bush himself meant a certain 
continuity in the relationship was there any discussion there of 
meetings between mr bush when he becomes president and mr 
gorbachev or of their foreign ministers or any of these other 
apparatus of meetings that we have seen over the past several years 
shultz there were general references to the desirability of 
having the level of contact the intensity of contacts at all levels 
maintained theres no immediate plan for any meeting that came out 
of the session as i saw it of the vice president when he becomes 
president and the general secretary although obviously there will 
be one at some appropriate moment no doubt therell be a foreign 
ministers meeting or two before that but as the vice president has 
said publicly he has to review the bidding for himself with his new 
team and assess the various elements in the relationship and no 
doubt hell proceed to do that and things will move forward on an 
orderly basis but the underlying intent is to see things develop in 
a positive way insofar as its possible and it certainly is quite 
possible 
q mr secretary returning to one of your answers earlier your 
comment on yasser arafats statement in sweden you said theres 
a considerable way to go a considerable way to go before what is 
the us having heard these kinds of comments from arafat now 
prepared to enter a dialogue of any sort of representative of the 
plo 
shultz we have for a long time had certain set things that we 
have said must be said by the plo positions they need to adopt if 
we are to have a substantive dialogue with them and theyre well 
known it is the acceptance of un resolutions 242 and 338 as a 
basis for negotiation of mideast peace number two recognition of 
israels right to exist and number three the renunciation of 
terrorism in all its forms and a pledge not to engage in it those 
are the things that we have insisted on and it is our view that 
they need to be said directly not inferentially not conditioned 
so we have seen at the pnc meeting and while i havent had a 
chance to study what was said this morning ive just heard a brief 
report of it so i dont want to be too definitive about it but it 
seems that there were some further clarifications in it i welcome 
that but so far as its been reported to me they havent meet 
these conditions if they meet these conditions then were prepared 
for a substantive dialogue weve said that well continue to say 
that thats our position 
q mr secretary could you give us a bit more of an idea of what 
the vice president contributed to todays forum 
shultz well the vice president was quite active in the 
discussion during the luncheon i cant really say from firsthand in 
the private meeting but i gather that he spoke there too 
naturally he is he came here very deliberately as the vice 
president and so it was up to the president to carry the meeting 
which he did as he always does but the vice president was very 
active in the discussion about chemical weapons

dan quayle investigating how as vice president 
he will involve himself in fighting drugs exploring space and 
picking his staff got some advice from walter mondale stay away 
from trivia 
mondale who was vice president under president carter and the 
democratic presidential nominee in 1984 said after meeting with 
quayle on wednesday that the indiana senator is obviously serious 
about this job 
although quayle was denounced by democrats throughout the 
campaign as unfit for the post mondale told reporters 
i believe he can do it and i believe he wants to do it hes 
been elected by the people of the united states and we all better 
hope that he does a good job 
mondale said he warned quayle to resist being diverted from 
significant issues into trivial pursuits 
i told him i thought a big danger of the vice presidency is to 
be trivialized to be given a number of functions to prove theyre 
important when in fact we have other agencies to do that work 
mondale said 
he ought to use his time to work on the really important 
matters after all mr quayle might become president he ought 
to be working on issues of significance 
quayle called mondale for the meeting as he continued to solicit 
advice from former vice presidents on how to handle the office he 
already has met with former president nixon who was vice president 
under dwight eisenhower and plans to see former president gerald 
ford who was nixons vice president 
quayle also met wednesday with nasa director james fletcher and 
gen john piotrowsky head of the us space command to discuss 
space policy bush has said he would appoint his vice president to 
head the new us space council a body created by congress to shape 
the direction of us space policy 
and he met with bush transition officials craig fuller and boyden 
gray fuller bushs longtime chief of staff who has said he is 
leaving government after the transition would be able to advise 
quayle on selection of his own staff gray who is serving as legal 
counsel to bushs transition office and will be white house legal 
counsel when bush takes office was discussing in part the role of 
the drug czar who will be appointed by the president 
bush initially said he wanted his vice president to oversee the 
administrations drugfighting efforts but recently passed 
congressional legislation calls for a drug czar who is not a member 
of the cabinet quayle has said he would look into the propriety of 
such options as having the drug czar report to him or having that 
person be part of his staff said press spokesman jim carroll 
quayle also met wednesday with indianapolis mayor william hudnut 
in what caroll described as a courtesy call by the mayor who was in 
washington on other business the meeting was not set up to discuss 
whether hudnut should succeed quayle as the senator from indiana 
said carroll 
mondale said it was apparent quayle had been boning up on the 
vice presidency and thinking a lot about how to approach it quayle 
sought ideas on how much time he should spend on capitol hill on 
administrative matters and on official functions mondale said 
theres going to be pressure on him to take on a lot of little 
functions to prove hes doing something i said reject that advice 
and just stay on the big issues mondale said 
mondale and carter were the object of harsh rhetoric from quayle 
during the presidential campaign this year as he sought to tie 
democratic nominee michael dukakis to what republicans dubbed the 
failed liberal policies of the past 
mondale said he had not been too flattering about him 
either and indicated that was behind them now 
meanwhile quayle has selected veteran time magazine correspondent 
david beckwith as his press secretary 
beckwith recently covered the bush campaign for 15 months and 
said of quayle 
ive talked to him a lot over the last couple weeks i realize 
hes a lot better than his press notices would make him appear he 
said noting the rash of negative publicity about quayles past and 
credentials that hit the vice presidentelect when bush picked him

marshal sergei f akhromeyev supervised 
intelligence and strategic missiles and earned the respect of his 
western counterparts during a 48year military career that ended 
with his retirement 
akhromeyev the military chief of staff traveled with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev to his reykjavik and washington summits 
with president reagan and visited the pentagon in july to meet with 
us military officials 
but akhromeyev 65 did not show up in new york for the latest 
summit which began wednesday and soviet officials there announced 
that akhromeyev had retired for health reasons it was the same day 
gorbachev announced unilateral cuts in soviet conventional forces 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov in new york 
denied that akhromeyev resigned in protest over the troop cutback 
plan which gorbachev disclosed in a speech to the united nations 
but top soviet military officials have opposed any reduction in 
soviet forces without corresponding moves by the west 
the marshal will remain as an adviser to gorbachev gerasimov 
said 
akhromeyevs resignation was not immediately reported by the 
soviet press and no successor was named 
akhromeyev supervised military intelligence and strategic nuclear 
weapons on the soviet general staff before becoming its chief in 
september 1984 
us counterparts who sat across the table from him during the 
1986 reykjavik iceland summit said he earned their respect 
he was tough and determined but he was trying to get an 
agreement one senior us official said on condition of anonymity 
after the talks failed to produce an agreement akhromeyev said 
of his american counterpart paul nitze i thought i could outlast 
him but i didnt 
akhromeyev during his trip to the pentagon said the soviet 
union was reorganizing its military in line with a policy of giving 
it a more purely defensive character but that the changes would 
take time gorbachev in his un address also talked about the 
switch to a defensive posture 
at a news conference in june akhromeyev who held top military 
posts under former president leonid i brezhnev criticized 
brezhnevs foreign policy we used to be too forthright in our 
reaction to the arms race pursued by the west he said 
he blamed the reagan administration for starting the arms race 
but said the soviets should not have been so willing to respond in 
kind 
akhromeyev a burly man with a strong voice that commanded the 
meetings he had with foreign journalists in moscow abruptly 
replaced nikolai v ogarkov as chief of general staff ogarkov was 
an advocate of turning to new military technologies instead of 
building more nuclear warheads 
six months after akhromeyev took the job gorbachev became the 
soviet leader and began his active search for arms agreements with 
the west 
gorbachev fired defense minister sergei l sokolov in may 1987 
after amateur pilot mathias rust of west germany threaded soviet air 
defenses to land a small private plane on moscows red square 
but he promoted dmitri t yazov a strong supporter of extending 
gorbachevs reforms to the military over akhromeyev and several 
other senior officers as the new defense minister 
akhromeyev has been in the soviet military since 1940 in august 
1942 during some of the grimmest days of world war ii for the 
soviet union he was discharged from the naval academy and sent to 
the army front line 
there he gained wide experience infantry and tank troops and 
worked his way up the ranks he became a full member of the 
communist party central committee in 1983

and he made his comments about continuity and at the same time 
his own need of course to study the situation for himself and 
develop his own positions so he was in and out of the conversation 
in a very comfortable and strong way 
q its not clear to me how much real discussion there was on 
gorbachevs conventional cut proposal 
shultz there was very little discussion of it at the luncheon 
and you have to remember he made this speech this morning the 
president and the vice president neither one of them heard it and 
i heard it but it was an extensive thing and we tried to write it 
down as best we can but thats no basis for having any intensive 
discussion beyond asking him well what does he have in mind he 
has in mind trying to restructure things so that theyre more 
clearly defensive in nature so we are interested in that comment 
and well study this carefully 
q you didnt draw him out and he didnt really elaborate that 
much on his proposal 
shultz well ive reported on the range of things that we talked 
about the meeting was a luncheon broad discussion it was a very 
i thought it was a very it was a very interesting luncheon to take 
part in it was hit interesting topics and there was a good flow 
across things that had important substance connected with them and 
at the same time rather informal and mr gorbachev talked about the 
situation in azerbaijan and what that meant and so on it was that 
kind of a discussion it wasnt in any remote sense a negotiating 
session or anything of that kind but in many ways better than a 
negotiating session 
q mr secretary in his speech soviet leader gorbachev talked 
several times about new thinking he talked about the need for 
cooperation coexistence of several systems do you believe that 
this new thinking is for real to stay an element of propaganda 
shultz ill just give you my own opinion i dont think there is 
a shadow of a doubt that an effort is under way to change the nature 
of the soviet system that is what mr gorbachev says that is what 
all of the evidence that we can see suggests so i chuckling i 
dont have any doubt that thats so now how successful can he be 
in making these changes and how fast will it happen of course 
nobody can answer those questions but that there is a major effort 
going on to change things i really dont see how thats even an 
open question

q do you agree with his appeal then that the days of the cold 
war are past 
shultz well i listened to the vice president answer that 
question yesterday i thought he gave a pretty good answer which 
was the words cold war mean one thing to you another thing to 
me another thing to somebody else and i think the important point 
is that there has been a very powerful change in the nature of the 
relationship between the us and the soviet union and more 
broadly in the eastwest relationship and you can see it in the 
things that have been settled in arms control you can see it in 
for example the ability we have to collaborate effectively for 
example in what were doing in southern africa you can see it in 
an altogether different manner of discussion of the area of human 
rights you can see it in our bilateral relations so i dont know 
whether you want to say thats the end of the cold war or not but 
its different a lot different and for my tastes a lot better 
q mr secretary with respect to the last answer if you could 
amplify it do you have any concern that the allies will show 
disagreement about what is going on in the soviet union 
particularly do you have any concern that the level of credit going 
from the europeans to the soviet union might not serve to dismantle 
the soviets military inaudible 
shultz well we meet a lot the allies do the european allies 
and we and the japanese and koreans australians and so forth we 
have a very active process of talk among us that goes on constantly 
as soon as we get through here i get on my plane and go to brussels 
and ill spend all day tomorrow and friday morning with the nato 
allies and ill spend friday afternoon at the european commission 
and these are the things we talk about and people have different 
views but we kind of put them in a pot and look at them and there 
has emerged from it a rather common view and a cohesive set of 
policies and of course its a constant sort of a moving target in a 
way 
now as far as credit is concerned we have a general 
understanding that noncocom restricted trade with the soviet union 
is no one sees any problem with that and that if there are 
credits they should be on a strictly commercial basis no one feels 
that it is that the soviet union should be subsidized so after 
youve said that then you observe these credits and in terms of 
the total flow of such things at this point at least it doesnt 
appear to me to be any particular problem but the creditors as 
commercial creditors of course have to ask themselves im going 
to loan some money am i going to get it back am i going to get it 
serviced and so on they have to make those calculations as 
people whose money that is 
q mr secretary can you say whether or not mr gorbachevs 
assurances on 
shultz i cant hear you 
q can you say whether mr gorbachevs assurances on 
institutionalizing human rights reforms in the soviet union were 
satisfactory enough to now conclude the vienna talks and go on to 
the conventional force talks 
shultz well as far as the vienna talks are concerned of 
course this is a multinational negotiation and we reflect our views 
into that in vienna and decisions will have to emerge from that 
setting but i think there is no question that in his speech mr 
gorbachev touched all of the key issues that we have been 
discussing one of them was the importance of institutionalizing and 
making law making rules whereby things are regulated so you get 
away from ad hoc decisions by some person in the bureaucracy that 
say yes well let this person go or we wont let that person 
go and rather you say there is a regulation about for 
instance the question of security secrets and therell be a time 
limit and therell be an understanding when somebody is hired and 
so on so we welcome that kind of procedure 
now what will we want to do well we will want to dig in with 
them and get the detail that lies underneath the statements that the 
general secretary made in his speech today however when the leader 
of the soviet union gets up in front of the world in effect and 
says that they are going to do certain things then i think you have 
to expect that those things are going to happen and we will of 
course explore them but i thought that it was a very helpful 
speech in that regard 
staff we have just time for one more question 
q mr secretary in his speech mr gorbachev also referred to 
the start talks and recommitted himself to the goal of a 50 percent 
reduction in strategic weapons was that discussed in the lunch at 
all or in the meeting this afternoon particularly in the context of 
continuing these under president bush 
shultz it really wasnt discussed much beyond the general 
secretary mentioning it and the vice president saying that of 
course he was interested in that but he will have to study it for 
himself and take his position so thats about the extent of it 
there wasnt any detailed discussion of that just as there wasnt 
any sort of detailed negotiatorlike discussion of any of these 
issues it was a much more general kind of discussion 
q well when you say that the vice president will actually 
decide on his position on it do you have any reason to doubt that 
those negotiations will continue in the next administration and be 
precedent 
shultz well i would think that they would be but a new 
president comes in he collects a new national security group around 
him so naturally he will want to look at the various positions that 
have been taken and where the issues now are and what are his views 
about them and since the vice president has been part of what has 
happened in the reagan administration there is a certain builtin 
presumption of continuity but i think that the vice president is 
quite correct in saying obviously hes a new president and hes 
got to look at it for himself and decide for himself where he wants 
to go so hes i think being properly straightforward in saying 
hes going to do that while at the same time expressing his 
general view of the importance of continuity in that and other 
things 
q and did he tell secretary gorbachev that 
no response

george bush and two longtime friends he has 
named to his cabinet are partners in a texas barge company an 
investment that earned the presidentelect more than 20000 last 
year 
bush secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii and 
commerce secretarydesignate robert mosbacher sr all are limited 
partners of hollywood lpg no 2 ltd one of several limited 
partnerships run by houstonbased hollywood marine inc state 
records show 
bush in 1987 reported 20773 in income from the company the 
money was listed as passive income on his federal tax return 
meaning bush has no say in business decisions the investment also 
is listed on his annual financial disclosure forms which are 
reviewed by government ethics officials 
we think its an honor to have them as part of the company 
said robert egan vice president and secretary of hollywood marine 
hollywood lpg no 2 ltd was formed in 1978 and at the time owned 
four barges according to records filed with the texas secretary of 
state 
bush and baker each were given 22 percent ownership of the 
company for an investment of 50000 apiece mosbacher was assigned 
47 percent interest for 105000 hollywood marine was assigned 67 
percent ownership for an investment of just 1000 a routine 
arrangement with general partners 
none of the three men has an active role in the business egan 
said other limited partners include other mosbacher family members 
and friends egan said the group was put together by mosbacher 
mosbacher has raised campaign funds for bush in every political 
race he has entered since his second unsuccessful campaign for the 
senate in 1970 mosbacher served as bushs finance chairman during 
the presidential campaign and raised nearly 20 million he also was 
chairman of the republican partys team 100 which raised 24 
million from individuals and corporations in 100000 donations 
baker resigned as treasury secretary earlier this year to manage

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said 
wednesday he is prepared to redesign and place under un control a 
soviet radar installation that president reagan charges violates the 
1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
the proposal was slightly different from an earlier soviet plan 
that the united states has said is unacceptable 
in his address to the un general assembly gorbachev proposed 
incorporating the radar installation at krasnoyarsk siberia into 
an allembracing regime for peaceful work in outer space 
the kremlin leader said he already has decided to place the 
installation under the authority of the soviet academy of sciences 
soviet scientists are prepared to receive their foreign 
colleagues and discuss with them ways of converting it into an 
international center for peaceful cooperation by dismantling and 
refitting certain units and structures and to provide additional 
equipment gorbachev said 
the entire system could function under the auspices of the 
united nations he said 
reagan in an unclassified version of his report to congress on 
ussoviet arms control agreements last week said the large 
phasedarray radar near krasnoyarsk constitutes a significant 
violation of a central element of the 1972 treaty 
the report added despite us requests no action has been 
taken nor soviet proposals made that would correct this 
violation 
reagan has demanded that the installation be dismantled 
the president said recent soviet proposals to modify the 
krasnoyarsk installation or to convert it into an international 
space research facility would not correct the violation 
such an action would not eliminate the prohibited radar 
capability or reverse the leadtime advantage already gained by 
krasnoyarsk construction the report said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that reagan raised 
the issue of the radar installation at the luncheon with gorbachev 
and vice president george bush 
fitzwater said gorbachev repeated the soviet position that they 
were transferring it to research uses 
secretary of state george p shultz in a news conference held 
after the luncheon said the soviet leader was asked whether he used 
the word dismantle in referring to the radar installation 
it was pointed out in his speech the general secretary had used 
the word dismantle did we hear that word right and he said yes 
that was the word i used shultz said

christmas shoppers and power lunchers went about 
their business wednesday as if mikhail s gorbachev had never left 
the kremlin but his lateafternoon motorcade finally plunged 
manhattan traffic into dreaded gorbylock 
for the morning rushhour warnings of gridlock evidently scared 
enough motorists to produce a significant drop in volumes all 
over the city according to transportation department spokesman 
victor ross 
i came this morning across the 59th street bridge queens plaza 
looked like the sahara the only thing that was missing were the 
camels said ross who earlier had issued dire traffic predictions 
but those predictions were fufilled when gorbachevs motorcade 
took its afternoon tour of wall street midtown manhattan and times 
square said deputy transportation commissioner sam schwartz 
those people who did come in got caught said schwartz during 
the height of the gorbylock at about 515 pm its little 
consolation to them that there was a 15 percent dropoff in traffic 
earlier in the day up and down the gorbachev midtown manhattan 
motorcade route the story was the same sure gorbachevs coming 
but whaddaya want me to do about it 
people arent really talking about it yet maybe later on 
said patrick coan an employee at the charivari store on west 57th 
street one of the streets on the route of the blockslong 
gorbachev motorcade wednesday afternoon 
although the stores front window was completely done in red 
coan said it had nothing to do with gorbachevs impending arrival 
nobody else has picked up on that actually its just to 
encourage people to have a red christmas instead of a white 
christmas 
as the soviet leader addressed the united nations assistant 
manager tim higbie of the barnes and noble book store on seventh 
avenue confirmed some of his books are around here although 
they werent selling particularly well 
higbie seemed unimpressed that gorbachev would later pass the 
store there were no plans to put his tomes on the book for a 
buck table his at the summit would still run buyers 1611 
he said 
as president reagan and gorbachev sat down for their afternoon 
repast on governors island powerlunchers and tourists around the 
city sat down for their own meals 
the manager at the russian tea room facing what one waiter 
confided was an overbooked lunch hour couldnt be bothered with 
gorbytalk at the hard rock cafe the british and american flags 
flew no sign of the soviet hammer and sickle over the heads of 
dozens of tourists waiting to eat 
outside the henri bendel store on west 57th street doorman 
charles rome opened a limousine door and let a patron inside 
blissfully unaware that 45 limos carrying gorbachev his wife raisa 
and assorted soviet associates would soon be cruising by the 
exclusive womens clothing store 
no down this street i heard he was in town but i didnt know 
he was coming through here said rome a manhattanite who also 
observed traffic on the crosstown street was lighter than usual 
tourists filled midtown to visit the usual holiday hot spots 
radio city music hall and the rockefeller center christmas tree and 
skating rink shoppers packed bloomingdales and macys oblivious 
to warnings of traffic jams and rumors of a shopping spree by raisa 
gorbachev 
weve got the typical prechristmas crowds the stores very 
crowded said bloomingdales spokeswoman miraed smith of 
course were right near a subway stop bus stops and the soviet 
embassy 
even the outoftowners werent too concerned about gorbachevs 
trip around town sixtynine students from martin luther king high 
school in philadelphia were at the cort theater to see the matinee 
of sarafina they had no plans to look for the soviet leader

presidentelect george bush said wednesday that 
the superpower luncheon with president reagan and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev was a good productive meeting and that 
there was no pressure now for him to have his own summit with the 
kremlin leader 
describing the two hours of talks on governors island in new york 
harbor bush said there was no pressing on substantive details 
although he said there were some substantive discussions 
bush said he made clear to gorbachev that he wanted to continue 
the progress thats been made during the reagan administration in 
ussoviet relations 
with his national security team still being assembled bush said 
i also made clear that we needed some time and he understood that 
he didnt seem to have any problem with that at all 
as the three leaders parted in new york bush told gorbachev i 
enjoyed the meeting hope to see you soon 
afterward secretary of state george shultz said bush was quite 
active in the discussion during the luncheon 
he said bushs presence provided proof of the desire on both 
sides to continue the dialogue that reagan and gorbachev had begun 
bush said that once his national security team is in place and 
the administrations strategy has been set secretary of 
statedesignate james a baker iii would contact nato allies and 
consult with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
at an appropriate time a meeting between me and general 
secretary gorbachev can be discussed bush said but theres no 
pressure on that the main thing is to formulate our plans and move 
them forward so we have progress thats what i want 
asked if the timing of a bushgorbachev summit had been 
discussed he replied no there wasnt any discussion of it at 
all 
outside the luncheon bush played a decidedly lowkey role 
remaining in the background for the most part as reagan and 
gorbachev greeted each other in their fifth and final meeting 
in a visible demonstration of his status bush rode in the 
limousine jumpseat with two translators facing backward as he 
accompanied reagan and gorbachev on a brief ride to a departure 
ceremony on the island 
bush seemed at ease in the presence of the superpower leaders 
clowning around bush pretended he was going to pitch himself 
into new york harbor from a waterside platform when photographers 
shouted to the trio to keep changing position as they viewed the 
statue of liberty 
smiling broadly bush seemed bemused as gorbachev talked at 
length about the luncheon at the conclusion of the departure 
ceremony 
neither reagan nor bush commented then but bush volunteered a 
statement to reporters upon his return to washington 
standing under the wing of air force two bush said i think it 
was a good productive meeting it was really in a sense a salute 
to president reagan giving him an opportunity to thank general 
secretary gorbachev 
saying that some substance had been discussed bush said 
generally it worked out as well as i had hoped 
bush said gorbachev seemed very upbeat after the meeting its 
not surprising i felt the same general feeling there theres no 
question that mr gorbachev is a very different individual from his 
predecessors hes a warm human being and people see that 
hes committed to change bush added 
he said gorbachevs speech to the united nations earlier in the 
day in which he proposed a 500000man cutback in soviet forces 
had some positive elements in it and i think that he felt that 
that had gone well 
so why shouldnt he feel good bush said he and president 
reagan had had a very good relationship and he was saying farewell 
to a man with whom hes worked very closely 
asked specifically about the troop cutback proposal bush said 
its a good decision adding that he would have to see the 
specifics of the proposal 
but the general idea of a reasonably substantial unilateral 
reduction is fine theres no way that that can result in a balance 
of forces but still its a step and so applaud it as a positive 
step 
he said it did not compel the united states to do anything 
while carving out a secondary role for himself bush and others 
have noted that gorbachev is aware who will be president on jan 20 
when reagan leaves office 
the next us administration headed by presidentelect george 
bush will find in us a partner who is ready without long pauses or 
backtracking to continue the dialogue in a spirit of realism 
openness and goodwill with a willingness to achieve concrete 
results working on the agenda which covers the main issues of 
sovietus relations and world politics gorbachev said in his 
address to the united nations 
when reagan greeted gorbachev on the steps of the twostory 
brick admirals house on governors island bush remained inside the 
building for a few moments allowing the two leaders to pose for 
pictures together 
bush then quietly stepped outside and joined reagan and 
gorbachev shaking hands with the soviet leader 
gorbachev greeted the vice president effusively taking bushs 
hand in both of his 
while reagan and gorbachev answered several questions bush 
declined to speak

western europe welcomed mikhail s gorbachevs 
pledge wednesday to reduce soviet conventional forces but tempered 
the praise with warnings that the warsaw pact still will have 
military superiority over nato 
television in communist poland carried footage without comment of 
the soviet leader announcing at the united nations in new york that 
he will reduce troop levels by 500000 and remove 5000 tanks and 
other arms within two years 
jacek czaputowicz cofounder of polands antinuclear peace and 
freedom movement said in warsaw the announcement could be the 
first step in pulling soviet troops out of poland 
east germany czechoslovakia and hungary from whose territory 
50000 soviet soldiers and 5000 tanks are to be withdrawn made no 
comment 
an official statement in london said prime minister margaret 
thatcher the most hawkish head of a nato government warmly 
welcomed gorbachevs pledge and will discuss it with him next week 
during his stop in britain en route home 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said in brussels it 
seems to be a step in the right direction but that considerable 
imbalances would remain 
the 500share index of londons financial times reversed a slump 
and rose 199 points to close at 99729 the dollar jumped initially 
on hopes a soviet cutback would mean reciprocal us defense 
reductions and a shrinking of the american deficit but fell back 
when dealers realized it was too soon to know 
widespread selling of gold resulted from the dollars surge 
pushing the bullion price in london and zurich down 4 to about 423 
an ounce 
mrs thatchers first reaction was that she warmly welcomed the 
cuts in forces and armaments proposed by mr gorbachev as an 
important step toward securing a better balance of conventional 
forces in europe in view of the soviets present overwhelming 
superiority said a statement from her office at 10 downing street 
chancellor helmut kohl now sees a good chance to reach 
conventional weapons stability in europe said friedhelm ost 
chief spokesman for the west german government 
rupert scholz kohls defense minister said gorbachev must 
follow up with actual and verifiable withdrawal of troops and 
reduction of forces 
franz vranitzky chancellor of austria called gorbachevs 
statement a courageous and constructive proposal 
former british defense secretaries michael heseltine 
conservative and denis healey labor disagreed in a television 
debate about how enthusiastically to welcome gorbachevs pledge 
heseltine said if youre suggesting that because he has made 
a gesture which leaves him with vast superiority in conventional 
forces i should say that there is no further threat that is naive 
to a fault 
even after mr gorbachev has carried through all the reductions 
he has promised he will have 3 times as many artillery pieces 
as nato 2 times as many tanks double the number of men and double 
the number of aircraft 
healey said the soviets no longer are a threat and that no soviet 
government even josef stalins ever intended to invade western 
europe 
the important thing now is we have the chance of working 
together with the russians to create stability and peace in 
europe he declared we ought to grab it with both hands 
paul rodgers an analyst at the department of peace studies in 
bradford northern england said gorbachev has the ulterior motive 
of sabotaging western agreement on modernizing nuclear forces nato 
has not yet agreed on what to do after intermediaterange missiles 
are withdrawn from europe under the ussoviet treaty 
it is going to make it much more difficult for nato to agree on 
a decision to modernize nuclear weapons rodgers said 
henry a kissinger national security adviser and secretary of 
state under president richard m nixon said in new york i think 
its an important speech the tone was positive and many of the 
ideas were very worthwhile for examination so i think its a good 
basis for relations after the new administration takes over in the 
united states 
dante m caputo argentine foreign minister and president of the 
un general assembly said the speech reflected a sort of new 
philosophical approach in soviet foreign policy and i think this is 
very very important i think this speech is going to very important 
in the next decade 
prime minister brian mulroney of canada said the troop cuts 
will begin to reduce the imbalance in conventional forces which 
have concerned canada and its allies in the north atlantic treaty 
organization for so long

plo leader yasser arafat ended two days of talks 
with a us jewish delegation wednesday by endorsing a statement 
accepting israels right to exist 
at a news conference however arafat seemed less straightforward 
than the document he endorsed and he declined to confirm or repeat 
the statements key clauses 
the document which also denounced terrorism was hailed by the 
jewish group as the most unequivocal acceptance of israel ever given 
by the palestine liberation organization the jewish group urged the 
us government to end its ban on talks with the plo 
foreign minister sten andersson who arranged the meeting called 
the document historic but said it was one step in a long 
process 
arafat described it as nothing new but was an accurate 
reading and interpretation of the policy declaration adopted last 
month by the plos legislative arm the palestine national council 
the plos parliamentinexile endorsed un resolutions 242 and 
338 which recognize the right of all states in the region to exist 
within secure borders but the council did not mention israel by 
name 
the twopage statement released wednesday said the council 
established the independent state of palestine and accepted the 
existence of israel as a state in the region 
the council also declared its rejection and condemnation of 
terrorism in all its forms including state terrorism said the 
englishlanguage document read by andersson and distributed to 
reporters 
arafat said the renunciation of terrorism excluded the uprising 
by palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
which enters its second year thursday 
the uprising will continue week after week until the end of the 
israeli occupation of our homeland he said 
he also said he remained committed to his 1985 cairo declaration 
to end terrorism outside israel and the occupied territories 
there was no greater thrill in my life than when yasser arafat 
signed on last night very clearly very assertedly the acceptance 
of the state of israel in the region and a denunciation of 
violence said stanley sheinbaum a los angeles publisher and 
economist 
in new york the president of the americanarab relations 
committee mt mehdi broke ranks with arafat on wednesday telling 
a group of arabs that arafat is no longer my friend his 
recognition of israel will not lead to peace in palestine 
in jerusalem israeli foreign minister shimon peres said it was 
very strange that arafat refused to make the declaration 
himself but he made no comment on the substance of the document 
if the plo has something to say since when is the swedish 
foreign minister a plo spokesman what arafat doesnt know how 
to read and write peres said 
israeli prime minister yitshak shamir rejected the statement 
saying the plos goal remains the destruction of the jewish state 
president reagan declined comment saying his administration had 
not had time to study the text the united states has demanded the 
plo recognize israels right to exist and renounce terrorism before 
it begins talks with the organization 
the fivemember jewish group sought the assurances to clear away 
misgivings left from the palestinian council resolutions regarding 
recognition of israel 
asked to endorse the clause verbally arafat replied this was 
clear in resolutions adopted in the last session of our palestine 
national council where we said clearly there are two states in 
palestine the palestinian state and the jewish state israel 
despite arafats evasiveness the jewish delegation said the 
wording in the document was stronger than the formula sought by 
washington and could clear the way for usplo talks 
the conditions the united states has been insisting on since 
1976 have been met said delegation leader rita hauser of new york 
the delegation has been widely dismissed by israel and by us 
jewish leaders since none represented a major us jewish group 
the group was from the us arm of the international center for 
peace in the middle east a tel avivbased leftist group with 
branches in israel the united states and europe 
morris b abram chairman of the conference of presidents of 
major jewish organizations said in new york that the group members 
were willing dupes of the plo 
arafat says he rejects terrorism but he declares the intefadeh 
uprising will continue abram said that is a typical arafat 
deception

a federal law that stripped governors of 
their power to veto national guard training missions dictated by the 
federal government is unconstitutional a federal appeals court 
ruled tuesday 
however another federal appeals court has ruled just the 
opposite and the two rulings presumably will have to be considered 
by the supreme court 
a panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled 21 
tuesday that the socalled montgomery amendment taking away a 
governors control over national guard units is unconstitutional 
the amendment was challenged by minnesota gov rudy perpich who 
objected to the defense department ordering minnesota guard units to 
central america governors of other states also have objected and 
the states of massachusetts ohio colorado vermont and maine 
supported minnesotas lawsuit 
however the 1st us circuit court of appeals in october 
rejected a similar challenge to the amendment filed by massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis 
dukakis said in a statement todays ruling by the 8th us 
circuit court of appeals is a victory for common sense the 
constitution and the governors of the united states 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon said the state was 
now more likely to appeal the 1st circuit ruling 
todays ruling in the minnesota case was what we argued here in 
boston so our position has been vindicated by one court of 
appeals said shannon 
justice department official said tuesdays ruling will apply only 
to states within the 8th circuit a guard official in washington 
said no decision had been made on whether to appeal 
the amendment was attached to the defense authorization act of 
1987 by rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss prior to its passage 
in 1986 state units could not be sent on federal training missions 
without a governors consent 
the 8th circuit concluded that the montgomery amendment 
contravenes the intent of the framers of the us constitution who 
they said designed the militia or national guard to serve as a 
check on the potential abuse of military power by the federal 
government 
the government has not demonstrated that the effectiveness 
of either the national defense or the national guard will be 
diminished by adherence to the constitutional principle of basic 
state control over national guard forces absent a declaration of 
war or national exigency the 8th circuit majority held 
the opinion was released in st paul and at the courts 
headquarters in st louis 
the amendment violates the plain language of the constitution is 
at odds with declarations of the us supreme court and departs 
from an unbroken pattern of congressional deference to reserved 
state authority over the national guard which is embodied in the 
militia clauses of the constitution the court said 
perpich was vacationing in hawaii but his office issued a 
statement from him from the beginning this has been a states 
rights issue the montgomery amendment went too far in tipping the 
balance of power toward the federal government 
at the defense department in washington national guard bureau 
spokesman dan donohue said the ruling suggests further legal action 
is likely but no decisions have been made officially on an 
appeal he said 
donohue said the ruling in the minnesota case would have little 
immediate effect 
from our point of view the training of the national guard 
continues to be our primary responsibility and the montgomery 
amendment is still the law of the land except in the affected case 
minnesota we will continue to deploy and train soldiers in 
accordance with the federal law 
amy brown a spokeswoman for the department of justice in 
washington said the only states covered by the ruling are the seven 
in the 8th circuit arkansas iowa minnesota missouri nebraska 
and north and south dakota however she said the ruling does not 
take effect immediately and if the federal government appeals it 
probably would be put on hold 
about 115000 men and women serve in the air national guard and 
460000 in the army national guard donohue said 
the pentagon is planning to send about 6000 guard members from 
across the country to honduras in 1989 for roadbuilding and 
engineering exercises donohue said no such exercises are under way 
because of the rainy season in central america he added 
capt david wirwahn a spokesman for the minnesota national 
guard said minnesota guard members are scheduled for missions in 
panama from january through march perpich already has agreed to 
those missions he said 
montgomery said in a statement that giving governors veto power 
over guard missions would raise questions about the availability 
of the guard to meet its considerable defense responsibilities

his army commanders wednesday and unconfirmed reports said lt gen 
dante caridi the chief of staff would resign in a deal that 
stopped the latest military revolt 
in the fourday rebellion that ended sunday the third in 20 
months three military bases joined rebel leader col mohamed ali 
seineldin and several others refused to send troops against him 
the 6th mechanized infantry regiment at mercedes about 60 miles 
west of buenos aires remained in rebel hands wednesday apparently 
because the defense ministry had not yet chosen a new commander 
maj hugo avete who rallied the bases estimated 100 soldiers 
against two senior officers last weekend is waiting to turn it 
over to whoever the army chiefs send a man who identified himself 
as avetes spokesman said in a telephone interview with the 
associated press 
seineldin was questioned by a military judge the 54yearold 
colonel was being held at a military garrison in palermo a northern 
district of buenos aires no details of the interrogation were 
revealed 
news reports citing military sources they did not identify said 
caridis resignation was part of a deal under which seineldin agreed 
to end his revolt peacefully the afternoon daily el heraldo said 
the high army command was deciding on caridis successor 
alfonsin has publicly expressed confidence in caridi after 
wednesdays meeting presidential press secretary jose ignacio lopez 
said the general is and will continue to be the chief of staff 
caridi called a meeting of 28 generals and 16 colonels to 
determine the situation in each of their commands and to help decide 
which colonels would be promoted alfonsin met with the same group 
later wednesday at government house where he has his office 
the meetings were to resume thursday the army chiefs office 
said in a communique 
carlos menem the opposition peronist partys candidate for 
president in national elections set for may said in an interview 
with the independent agency noticias argentinas he was certain the 
government made concessions to the rebels 
the president said sunday night there had been no type of 
negotiation and now he says there were two hours of talks menem 
said it seems that one of the conditions was the departure of 
caridi 
defense minister horacio jaunarena addressed the senate in closed 
session wednesday for almost three hours members of the peronist 
party asked that he explain how the insurrection was ended 
rebels had demanded an end to the prosecution of officers for 
human rights abuses in 197683 during the socalled dirty war 
on leftists by military governments at least 8900 people 
disappeared and are presumed dead according to a commission 
appointed by alfonsins civilian government 
the rebels also demanded major changes in the defense hierarchy 
and a bigger military budget

his summitry completed mikhail s gorbachev took 
a 75minute motorcade tour of manhattan on wednesday from the 
canyons of wall street to garish times square twice jumping out of 
his limousine to greet astonished and delighted crowds 
though traffic was light most of the day the dreaded 
gorbylock arrived late in the afternoon once the 45car 
motorcade began snaking through the city 
traffic was locked up in lower manhattan for about an hour after 
the soviet leader left the world trade center where he and his 
wife raisa admired the view from the top of the 110story twin 
towers 
at 50th street and broadway just outside the winter garden 
theater gorbachev stopped his motorcade and jumped out to greet 
people on the street 
i was right there and i yelled in russian how are you 
said geranno valentine he said thank you fine 
the crowd was just going hysterical said joe crawford a 
17yearold high school student from connecticut who had seen a 
matinee of starlight express at a nearby theater it was 
fantastic truly something fantastic to see someone like that up 
close 
gorbachev also briefly stepped out of his limousine at 
bloomingdales at lexington avenue and 59th street but despite 
advance speculation that mrs gorbachev planned a shopping 
expedition she remained in the car 
the drive which followed a luncheon meeting on governors island 
with president ronald reagan and presidentelect george bush 
included glimpses of the new york stock exchange times square with 
its glitter and garbage and busy 57th street with carnegie hall and 
the russian tea room 
all along the route people gathered to get a glimpse at the 
visiting dignitary crowds were thickest at times square where the 
scene resembled an early new years eve gathering 
at the world trade center the entourage sped to the top of the 
citys tallest building standing nearly a quartermile high and 
gazed out at the citys spectacular skyline as the sun was setting 
into a bank of clouds 
as the lights from skyscrapers around the city winked on mrs 
gorbachev commented how beautiful how beautiful said port 
authority spokesman mark marchese the group could see a distance of 
25 miles 
marchese said gorbachev asked where kennedy airport was and 
picked out governors island by himself when officials pointed out 
the empire state building the soviet leader quipped that he had 
heard of it 
what i particularly liked about the city is this is a unique 
city a city of splendid identity and architecture gorbachev said 
in response to reporters questions you see different areas in 
the city that have their own special identity 
were very pleased by the fact that thousands of new yorkers 
have come out to see us he added we saw their faces we saw 
their eyes their friendliness we are grateful for this warm 
hospitality 
during the halfhour stop gorbachev endured a long speech by 
port authority chairman philip kaltenbacher he appeared either 
bored or tired and was seen several times twiddling his thumbs 
the soviet leader said his visit to the world trade center was 
symbolic because it serves as a center to promote 
international economic and commercial cooperation 
though he could have stopped in time to ring the closing 4 pm 
bell at the new york stock exchange gorbachevs motorcade breezed 
past the financial mecca 
his long black limousine decked with a red soviet flag on the 
fender slowed slightly as it turned onto broad street where the 
exchange is located just long enough for the crowd standing 10deep 
behind police barricades to proffer a hearty cheer 
it looked like a new car show said onlooker brendan murray 
27 an office manager for a brokerage firm i hope he got a good 
laugh out of it he got half a hundred stock brokers to stand out 
here for an hour and a half and all we saw were his cuff links 
i just saw gorbachev a messenger said after the motorcade 
had passed ill never wash my eyes again 
times square was ready with all its glitz glitter and garbage 
for which there is no equivalent in the soviet union 
the famous electronic billboard in the middle of times square 
flashed a red hammer and sickle with the message welcome 
general secretary gorbachev 
the greeting was sandwiched between advertisements for the movie 
my stepmother is an alien and for us news and world report 
xxxrated movie theaters sported their usual fare including 
frisky wives ii 
this is the most exciting moment of my life for two 
superpowers to be in new york said lorenzo hudson a 23yearold 
security guard from brooklyn 
im supposed to be to work at 6 oclock but if i dont see 
gorby before then i wont go to work today 
earlier in the day the gorbachevs toured the united nations 
where the soviet leader addressed the world body 
outside the un they were greeted by some 1000 demonstrators 
protesting conditions for jews inside the soviet union and 
supporters of dissidents from the baltic states ukrainians afghans 
and armenians 
some 56 people were arrested for crossing police barricades and 
charged with disorderly conduct 
raisa gorbachev did a little sightseeing of her own after an 
afternoon luncheon with first lady nancy reagan and incoming first 
lady barbara bush visiting the estee lauder beauty shop on fifth 
avenue 
the city did not go to great lengths to spruce itself up for the 
dignitaries visit other than to warn motorists to use mass 
transit for the most part commuters listened

palestinian leaders called for two days of 
strikes starting thursday in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
to mark the first anniversary of their uprising against israeli rule 
the conservative hebrew daily maariv said the army was increasing 
forces in the territories in anticipation of trouble 
army officials declined wednesday to comment on the report for 
security reasons 
so far its business as usual said an official who cannot 
be identified by name under military rules we will respond in 
accordance with the situation 
the intefadeh arabic for uprising began dec 8 1987 with 
riots in the jabaliya refugee camp in the occupied gaza strip after 
an army truck collided with a van killing four palestinians rumors 
had spread it was no accident and was instead revenge for the 
stabbing death of an israeli businessman three days earlier 
a day after the riot soldiers opened fire on protesting students 
in the camp after a firebomb was hurled at an army patrol two 
palestinians were killed the first of 319 to die in the yearlong 
uprising eleven israelis also have died in the violence 
israel has controlled the territories since it took gaza from 
egypt and the west bank from jordan in the the 1967 middle east war 
on wednesday 10 palestinians suffered gunshot wounds in 
stonethrowing clashes with israeli troops in the west bank and gaza 
strip arab hospital officials said 
the army confirmed six of the woundings 
a soldier was hospitalized with a minor gunshot wound he suffered 
while riding on a bus near the west bank city of hebron the army 
reported the army spokesmans office said there is nothing to 
indicate the bus was shot at and said the army was investigating 
whether it involved the accidental discharge of another soldiers 
weapon 
in ramallah a firebomb was thrown at an israeli military vehicle 
but caused no damage or injuries an army spokesman said arab 
reporters said troops rounded up about 200 suspects for questioning 
but the army spokesman could not confirm this 
the defense ministry announced it uncovered 93 guerrilla cells in 
the past two months and arrested 610 members most from the west 
bank and gaza strip 
defense minister yitzhak rabin praised israels security forces 
for their daring determination and courage in uncovering the 
groups believed responsible for 87 antiisraeli attacks in the past 
year 
these numbers speak for themselves your success merits great 
praise rabin wrote to the head of shin bet israels secret 
security agency 
among the attacks attributed to the groups is an oct 31 firebomb 
assault on an israeli passenger bus in the west bank city of jericho 
that killed a woman and three of her children the statement said 
also wednesday an army official said that a commander followed 
proper procedures in the monday shooting that killed a 15yearold 
palestinian girl 
asma abu obadah of the shati refugee camp in gaza city was hit 
in the back of the head with a single plastic bullet witnesses said 
she encountered soldiers trying to disperse a demonstration as she 
walked home from school and that she panicked and ran 
she was wounded after the soldiers shot in the air and warned 
the demonstrators the official said the commander shot in the 
direction of the demonstrators legs and a bullet hit her 
the strikes thursday and friday were announced in a leaflet 
issued this week by the plobacked underground leaders of the 
uprising 
as the intefadeh enters its second year we call on 
palestinians to strengthen the authority of the people as the 
foundation stone for our future state more power to popular 
organizing committees and the hit teams the leaflet said 
as darkness fell wednesday in the crowded old market area of 
nablus the west banks largest city activists used loudspeakers to 
read from the leaflet and to urge people to observe the thursday and 
friday strikes they began with the shouts appeal appeal 
appeal then preceded the readings with the islamic phrase in 
the name of god the compassionate 
slogans painted on walls in gaza city called for five minutes of 
silence on saturday in memory of the intefadeh martyrs the term 
for palestinians killed in the uprising 
in addition to the deaths the army says 3500 palestinians have 
been shot or severely wounded in the intefadeh others give much 
higher figures including the palestinian human rights group law in 
the service of man which estimates more than 20000 people have 
been shot beaten or suffered tear gas inhalation 
the palestinians have lost millions in revenue by keeping their 
shops and offices open only three hours a day and by closing 
altogether for almost weekly general strikes israels tourist 
business has dropped by 14 percent and its construction industry 
dependent on palestinian workers also is suffering 
according to army statistics more than 5600 palestinians are in 
israeli prisons about 1500 of whom are held under administrative 
detention without charge or trial thirtytwo palestinians have 
been deported and 27 await deportation government figures say

the transportation department gave the goahead 
wednesday for airlines using chicagos ohare airport to jointly 
propose schedule changes that might ease flight delays in and out of 
chicago 
the department said it was granting a request by united airlines 
for temporary antitrust immunity for such discussions as long as 
any agreement is considered only a proposal to the federal aviation 
administration which would take final action 
we find that the discussions are necessary to mitigate the 
delays at ohare for those delays would otherwise cause substantial 
inconvenience for the traveling public the department said 
the number of flights are capped at ohare as they are at three 
other busy airports around the country but in early october the 
faa imposed further restrictions cutting the number of hourly 
flights from 96 to 80 because of concerns that air traffic 
controllers were being asked to handle too much traffic 
the controllers handling aircraft in the chicago area had 
committed an unusually high number of errors this year in late 
november the maximum number of flights was increased slightly to 85 
flights an hour 
the discussions sought by united were aimed at getting all 
airlines that use ohare to jointly juggle schedules and make other 
adjustments that might reduce the delays caused by the new flight 
restrictions 
in october arrival delays increased sharply over the previous 
month at ohare the dot said 734 percent of the flights arrived on 
time during the month compared to 816 percent in september 
departures left on time 83 percent of the time in october compared 
to 871 percent in september 
the department said that the airlines could begin their meetings 
on dec 14 with the aim of providing guidance to the faa on ways 
to reduce the delay problem 
american airlines and air canada had filed in support of the 
discussions while america west opposed them southwest airlines had 
asked that the discussions not result in any action that might 
reduce the number of flights into chicagos midway airport 
the dot said the discussions would primarily concern the 
conditions under which airlines could use their takeoff and landings 
slots in and out of ohare the airlines also will be able to 
discuss possible scheduling adjustments to prevent too many flights 
from being scheduled within short periods of time the department 
said

here are the comments made by soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev during a ceremony at the world trade center 
observatory wednesday he spoke after receiving gifts from officials 
of the port authority of new york and new jersey 
i thought we were here just as tourists and that was nice to 
be here as a tourist almost half a mile over new york 
im very impressed by this city and by its architecture its 
bridges by all that ive seen the water ive learned something 
about the history of this city 
ive been told about the history of the building of the 
brooklyn bridge the story of the building of this bridge is in a 
way i think similar to the story of the development of the great 
expanse that is the united states 
but one thing that id like to say is that it is certainly 
symbolic that we are here in this building of the world trade center 
that serves to promote international economic and commercial 
cooperation 
we have mentioned the soviet fair that will be opening i think 
that political dialogue and political relations between our 
countries should be supplemented by an expansion of our commercial 
and economic ties i think this is a very solid basis for a better 
development of our relations 
i think you have said quite appropriately that both our two 
peoples share a desire to improve their relations they both want to 
know each other better 
it is i think the task of political leaders to make policies 
to shape their policies based on the will of their people and this 
is what ive tried to do today in my address to the united nations 
all americans must know that our people deeply respect the 
american people all americans should know that the soviet people 
want to cooperate with them they want to have exchanges with them 
our people want to live in peace with the americans 
i think we are now at the threshold present at the birth of a 
new phase in our relations a phase that promises many good things 
for both our nations 
and this informal gathering and the good atmosphere that i see 
here is i think also a sign of the kind of change that we are 
seeing in our relations im sure that we can talk that we can 
discuss things and find solutions to any problem 
let me share with you some of the impressions about the meeting 
ive just had with the president and vice president 
presidentelect it was a very open meeting in a good atmosphere 
we shared the view that what we have been able to begin over these 
years should be continued this is very important 
so i think our two peoples can look forward to good prospects

president reagan taking a waitandsee 
attitude toward mikhail s gorbachevs pledge to unilaterally reduce 
conventional forces declared wednesday night that us officials 
must exercise caution as eastwest dealings enter this critical 
junction 
reagan said he was pleased with the tone and substance of the 
luncheon talks with his counterpart on governors island in new york 
harbor but that fundamental differences between our countries 
remain in many areas 
at the conclusion of their fifth and final summit reagan toasted 
the soviet president for what we together have accomplished and 
what you and the vice president after jan 20 will accomplish 
together 
asked how the meeting had gone reagan replied read our 
smiles 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the lunch was very 
enjoyable and that the participants told a lot of stories 
later in a speech to the american enterprise institute a 
conservative think tank the president said that freedom is on the 
march around the world while totalitarianism is on the decline and 
he said i am proud to say i am still an anticommunist 
and i continue to be dedicated to the idea that we must trumpet 
our beliefs and advance our american ideals to all the peoples of 
the world until the towers of the tyrants crumble to dust reagan 
said 
while applauding gorbachevs announcement of a sweeping reduction 
in red army ground forces reagan said he wants to see how well the 
kremlin follows through on that commitment 
about the soviet unilateral troop reduction i can only say 
that if it is carried out speedily and in full history will regard 
is as important signficant he said 
the president devoted only one sentence in a 4page speech to 
the initiative that gorbachev had announced hours earlier at the 
united nations in new york although reagan initially said that he 
heartily approved of the measure 
presidentelect george bush who joined reagan and gorbachev at 
the luncheon table declared that the soviet decision was a good 
one youve got to look at the specifics but the general idea of 
a reasonably substantial unilateral reduction is fine he said 
theres no way that that can result in a balance of forces but it 
still is a step so applaud it as a positive step 
us officials said the slashing of 500000 troops from the red 
army would still leave the soviets with a heavy advantage over the 
nato alliance in ground troop strength where they already held a 
roughly twotoone edge 
gorbachev talking to reporters before parting company with 
reagan and bush urged the united states to take certain steps 
in response to his announcement but he did not elaborate on that 
point 
in his wednesday night speech reagan went to great lengths to 
defend the peacethroughstrength foreign policy that he has pursued 
over the last eight years 
let us remember too that at this critical junction our 
responsibilities grow more not less serious he said we must 
remain strong and free of illusion for only by doing so can we 
reach out and embrace this new era and transform this hope of peace 
and freedom for all the world into reality 
reporting on his talks with gorbachev reagan said i think we 
both expressed satisfaction in what we have achieved in recent 
years but we also recognized that fundamental differences between 
our countries remain in many areas and determined efforts by both 
sides will be necessary in the months and years ahead to overcome 
such differences 
over the years ive been described as an inveterate 
optimist he said an eternal optimist a reflexive optimist a 
born optimist a canny optimist a cagey optimist even as 
defiantly optimistic 
i am an optimist because i believe we have proved with our 
policy of peace through strength that when we are strong peace and 
freedom will prevail he said this november the electorate 
told us they agreed

the strongest earthquake to hit the soviet caucasus 
region in 80 years flattened buildings wednesday and left thousands 
homeless one soviet official said he received unconfirmed reports 
of more than 200 people killed 
a scientist at the seismic station in yerevan capital of the 
republic of armenia said he visited the disaster area and estimated 
the death toll probably would run into the thousands but he 
stressed the estimate was unofficial and declined to give his name 
official soviet news media did not give any casualty figures 
armenia was the hardesthit area in the caucasus 
deputy duty officer lyova oganisyan at the interior ministry in 
armenia said unconfirmed witness reports to police indicated more 
than 200 people had been killed 
an official of the armenian governments office in moscow who 
would not give his name said the number of casualties was a very 
big figure 
the quake centered near the sovietturkish border killed at 
least four people and caused extensive damage in eastern turkey 
authorities said 
the us geological survey in golden colo said the quake 
centered south of the georgian capital of tblisi occurred at 1141 
am 241 am est and registered 69 on the richter scale a 
quake of that magnitude is capable of causing widespread heavy 
damage 
the temblor followed by a moderate aftershock struck a mountain 
region in the soviet union already wracked by months of ethnic 
violence between residents of armenia and the neighboring republic 
of azerbaijan 
president mikhail s gorbachev who was visiting the united 
states called the earthquake a grave tragedy 
staterun television in an unusually prompt and detailed report 
from the scene showed film of crumbled buildings in kirovakan 
armenias third largest city and in spitak a regional center of 
armenia 
workers were shown picking up huge slabs of concrete amid the 
rubble goldcolored curtains and beds protruded from the side of a 
building where a wall once stood in one dramatic shot a man put 
his hands over his head in grief as he stood amid a collapsed 
building 
the spontaneous elements didnt spare onestory or multistory 
building a tv correspondent said on the evening broadcast 
cars on the streets were crushed by falling concrete 
the correspondent said thousands were homeless and that there 
are casualties injured but neither he nor soviet news reports 
gave figures 
in several regions of armenia there is significant damage 
deaths and injuries tass said the cities of leninakan 
kirovakan and also several others especially suffered 
officials said communications had been cut off with leninakan 
near where the quake was centered and with much of the disaster 
area leninakan a city of 200000 people is 100 miles northwest of 
yerevan and close to the sovietturkish border 
they said the loss of communications complicated efforts to 
assess the damage and casualties 
asked for the phone number of the police station in spitak 
oganisyan the interior ministry official said it wouldnt do any 
good because the station was destroyed 
he said casualty tolls are likely to run high because schools 
were in session and factories were working 
the government set up a commission to oversee rescue and salvage 
operations and sent soldiers and civilian volunteers to the disaster 
area tass said 
the man who oversaw cleanup from the chernobyl nuclear power 
plant accident in april 1986 deputy premier boris y shcherbina 
visited the disaster area with armenian communist party chief suren 
arutyunyan television reported 
state turkish radio quoted the kars provincial governor hasan 
fakir as saying four residents of the town of akyaka were killed in 
the quake many houses were damaged in akyaka and in the nearby 
cildir township it said 
the kandilli observatory in istanbul reached by telephone said 
the quake shook four eastern turkish provinces 
tass said the quake reached 9 on the 12point soviet scale which 
measures tremors on the basis of their visible effects an 
earthquake of 8 on the soviet scale is described in soviet reference 
works as destructive causing cracks on sharp slopes and in 
wet soils monuments are moved or turned over houses are 
considerably damaged 
the us geological survey said the earthquake was followed less 
than five minutes later by a moderate aftershock measuring 58 on 
the richter scale 
the moscow central seismic center put the epicenter 30 miles from 
leninakan it was felt in the armenian capital of yerevan 95 miles 
to the southeast as well as in georgia and azerbaijan soviet tv 
said 
because of violence between armenians and azerbaijanis more than 
180000 refugees reportedly have fled across the border between 
their two republics in the past three weeks the earthquake is 
likely to cause further dislocation 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65

marshal sergei akhromeyev who has voiced 
opposition to unilateral cuts in red army conventional forces 
resigned as military chief of staff wednesday the day soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev announced a cutback of 500000 troops 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov confirmed 
that akhromeyev had resigned but said the marshals decision was 
based on poor health and was not in protest of gorbachevs move 
he supported the proposals in the speech gerasimov said 
akhromeyev was among top soviet generals who opposed a unilateral 
reduction in the kremlins troop strength arguing that the cuts 
should be done simultaneously with reductions by the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
for health reasons he decided to retire gerasimov told a 
news conference it was merely a coincidence he said of the 
timing of the resignation 
gerasimov speculated that the unspecified health problems stemmed 
from injuries akhromeyev suffered in world war ii 
akhromeyev will continue to serve as a military adviser to 
gorbachev said gerasimov

african national congress 
leader nelson mandela was transferred wednesday evening from a 
clinic to live at a house on a prison farm outside cape town 
aside from stays in hospitals it marked the first time since 
1962 that the 70yearold prisoner south africas most widely known 
black leader has lived outside a cell 
prison officials said mandelas wife winnie children and 
grandchildren would have unlimited access to mandela at his new 
quarters in a staff house on prison property the onestory house 
has a patio flower garden and swimming pool 
but mrs mandela rejected the offer and said she will continue to 
make the standard 40minute visits to her husband until he is freed 
according to the familys lawyer ismail ayob 
the government has been under intense domestic and international 
pressure to release mandela unconditionally but officials have 
indicated that his outright release is not imminent and that 
restraints on him will be eased in stages so the government can 
assess the political impact of his possible freedom 
some opposition leaders criticized the governments move 
dullah omar a human rights lawyer who leads the banned united 
democratic front called the move utterly disgraceful and 
callous 
what we were looking forward to was his release not a transfer 
from a clinic back to prison he said 
zach de beer leader of the antiapartheid progressive federal 
party welcomed the transfer on humanitarian grounds but added 
unless mr mandela is given the freedom to participate in the 
political process of the country he is denied the opportunity of 
making his contribution towards the future 
the transfer was announced by justice minister kobie coetsee who 
said mandela was moved to a suitable comfortable and properly 
secured home at the victor verster prison in paarl 
mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for plotting a sabotage campaign against the 
whitecontrolled government 
the outlawed anc is the largest guerrilla organization fighting 
the government and apartheid south africas policy of racial 
segregation 
mandela has rejected the governments repeated offers to release 
him if he renounces violence or live in a tribal homeland he has 
said the government should renounce violence end apartheid and 
legalize the anc 
last august mandela was diagnosed with tuberculosis and 
transferred to a hospital from cape towns pollsmoor prison later 
he was moved to the constantiaberg clinic a luxury private hospital 
near pollsmoor and coetsee announced on nov 24 that mandela would 
not be returned to pollsmoor when his recuperation was complete 
ayob quoted mrs mandela as saying that mandelas transfer is 
clearly a response to the domestic and international pressure for 
his release 
i do not intend taking more than the normal 40minute visit 
ive been allowed in the past until all political prisoners have the 
same privilege she said in a statement provided by ayob 
south africa is still under a state of emergency and there are 
thousands of political prisoners and detainees and large numbers of 
leaders organizations and the media remain restricted mrs 
mandela said in the statement 
there was no indication that other visitors such as the media 
would be allowed access to mandela 
mandelas transfer to a private home is one of a series of moves 
by the government in the past two weeks aimed at easing 
international pressure on south africa 
the government has given tentative approval to a peace pact that 
would bring independence to namibia commuted the controversial 
death sentences of six blacks known as the sharpeville six and 
freed two other prominent longserving black prisoners anc leader 
harry gwala and zeph mothopeng president of the rival 
panafricanist congress 
but the government has given no indication that it is willing to 
negotiate with freed black leaders on their demands for oneperson 
onevote democracy 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

so the meeting today was a time for reflection and for 
continuity now let me do the same with you and consider how weve 
done these last eight years and whether weve done well and i do 
mean we 
we have come a long way together from the intellectual 
wilderness of the 1960s through the heated intellectual battles of 
the 1970s to the intellectual fruition of the 1980s 
the american enterprise institute stands at the center of a 
revolution in ideas of which i too have been a part our ideas 
were greeted with varying degrees of scorn and hostility by what we 
used to call the establishment institutions 
the universities once the only real home for american 
scholarships have been particularly unresponsive and so it became 
necessary to create our own research institutions as places where 
scholars could congregate and important studies could be produced 
that did not kowtow to the conventional wisdom and your 
institutions remarkably distinguished body of work is testimony to 
the triumph of the think tank 
for today the most important american scholarship comes out of 
our think tanks and no think tank has been more influential than 
the american enterprise institute applause 
what we wanted was a chance to try our ideas out on the world 
stage we have and my friends i hope youre as proud as i 
because despite the naysayers and the conventional wisdom the 
words of the pundits and the false prophecies of false cassandras 
who proclaimed we could not succeed we knew we were right 
and i believe that yes we have been vindicated 
and nowhere is that more true than in the realm of foreign 
policy we came to washington together in 1981 both as 
anticommunists and as unapologetic defenders and promoters of a 
strong and vibrant america i am proud to say i am still an 
anticommunist applause and i continue to be dedicated to the 
idea that we must trumpet our beliefs and advance our american 
ideals to all the peoples of the world until the towers of the 
tyrants crumble to dust 
yes it seems to me that weve been as one these past eight years 
in an effort to establish a foreign policy that stood in firm 
opposition to the previous decades misguided attempt to place this 
country on what they used to call in the 1970s the right side of 
history by which those who used that unpleasant marxist phrase 
meant we should accept the dominion of our adversaries over large 
parts of the world 
we said no we said we must propound and advance our national 
ideals abroad and once again hold high the banner for what i will 
until the breath is gone from my body continue to call the free 
world applause 
we promulgated a foreign policy whose fundamental basis was the 
truths all americans hold to be selfevident that all men are 
created equal that they are endowed by their creator with 
unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness 
we have done this not solely because we believe it is right but 
because we know it is in our national interest to do so 
a foreign policy based on our bedrock principles allows us to 
offer a practical solution to the suffering peoples of the world a 
means of achieving prosperity and political stability that all 
americans take for granted as their birthright 
what we are telling them and their ofttimes recalcitrant 
leaders is that they cannot achieve prosperity and stability 
through redistribution of resources or by taking up arms against a 
sea of selfinflicted troubles 
weve seen how that last monstrous idea has worked this decade 
the war between iran and iraq whose initial aim was control over an 
oilrich province has done more damage to both countries than 10 
plagues

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
declared wednesday that his government no longer holds political 
prisoners and that it has applied strict time limits on the use of 
state secrecy as a reason for refusing jews permission to emigrate 
although western observers generally acknowledge there has been a 
dramatic reduction in the number of political prisoners since 
gorbachev rose to power human rights groups still count about 150 
people said to be held solely because of their political or 
religious beliefs 
gorbachev promised the problem of exit from and entry to our 
country including the question of leaving it for family 
reunification is being dealt with in a humane spirit but he gave 
no indication the soviet union is prepared to open its borders to 
unrestricted travel or emigration 
in places of confinement there are no persons convicted for 
their political or religious beliefs the soviet leader told the 
united nations general assembly but he added that his statement did 
not apply to those who committed actual criminal offenses or state 
crimes such as espionage sabotage terrorism et cetera whatever 
their political or ideological beliefs 
secretary of state george shultz said the soviet union has 
released a great many political prisoners but such people still 
exist differences of opinion exist on whether a person is in prison 
because of his political views or because of a violation of law he 
said 
but shultz said he thought it possible to a construct a procedure 
in which we will go through with them namebyname the people on 
our list to determine whether a person should be released 
the united states and human rights groups have focused attention 
on two soviet laws gorbachev didnt mention specifically but which 
make it a crime to slander the soviet state or engage in antisoviet 
agitation the soviets have indicated they will modify or eliminate 
those statutes in a rewrite of their criminal code now under way 
nobel laureate andrei sakharov the wellknown soviet dissident 
whom gorbachev released from internal exile two years ago contends 
that an unspecified number of soviets remain in prisons or labor 
camps for their political or religious views 
one of the reasons for refusal to leave is a persons knowledge 
of secrets gorbachev told his audience strictly warranted time 
limitations on the secrecy rule will now be applied this 
removes from the agenda the problem of the socalled refuseniks 
refusenik is a journalists term used to describe soviets usually 
jews who have been refused permission to emigrate 
alexander yakovlev a member of the communist partys ruling 
politburo and a top adviser to gorbachev told an american peace 
coalition after the speech that he does not believe that there are 
any serious obstacles to those who want to emigrate 
he said the process of disarmament has not reached a stage at 
which it is possible to let those with military secrets leave the 
country but yakovlev contended there are fewer than 46 such cases 
remaining 
this is unfortunate he added but it is another motivation 
to disarm 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov claimed this 
is a problem that has disappeared with the establishment of an 
appeal procedure to permit review of refuseniks cases 
jerry strober a spokesman for the national conference on soviet 
jewry told the associated press after gorbachevs speech that his 
group has documented 1987 soviet jewish families who have been 
refused exit visas for more than five years a significant number of 
whom have been told they were not permitted to leave because they 
once had access to state secrets 
strober noted that gorbachev said four years ago no one would be 
held more than 10 years for having had access to secrets but at 
least 512 of those still on the conferences list have waited more 
than 10 years for permission to leave he said 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights 
organization has said in recent weeks it has information on 150 
soviets imprisoned solely for the nonviolent exercise of their 
fundamental human rights 
and a lay roman catholic organization called puebla institute 
counts 156 soviets it says are jailed for their religious beliefs 
the two lists overlap but are not identical

californias supreme court agreed wednesday 
to hear insurers lawsuits challenging the proposition 103 rate 
reduction initiative but allowed immediate enforcement of all major 
provisions except a 20 percent rollback in auto insurance rates 
the portions of the measure that the court allowed to take effect 
will force companies to base insurance rates primarily on a drivers 
record and experience and repeal an exemption from state antitrust 
laws for insurance companies 
harvey rosenfield chairman of voter revolt and author of the 
measure said he was disappointed that the court did not also allow 
the rate rollback but he said he was excited that some provisions 
will take effect 
one insurance industry official said he was disappointed that the 
courts prior stay on the entire measure had been modified at all 
but said it was a positive sign that the court had blocked the 
rollback provision 
at first blush were pleased that the court will hear our 
arguments but we feel the briefing schedule is more relaxed than 
wed like said john kozero a spokesman for firemans fund 
insurance cos no date has been set for a hearing and we hoped 
for a speedy resolution to the case 
the justices indicated they would not hear oral arguments until 
february the court voted 61 to hear the case with justice stanley 
mosk dissenting 
attorney general john van de kamp who is defending the measure 
in court called the courts action the first step toward full 
implementation of proposition 103 
the court had blocked implementation of proposition 103 on nov 
10 two days after voters approved it it was the only one of five 
insurancerelated initiatives to pass 
in wednesdays order the court left its stay in place for only 
two of the measures numerous provisions 
one which is the central target of the lawsuits would reduce 
motor vehicle and property insurance rates 20 percent below november 
1987 levels and freeze them until november 1989 the only 
exemptions would be for insurers that could show a substantial 
threat of insolvency 
the insurance companies lawsuits contend the rollback and freeze 
are an unconstitutional confiscation of the insurers property 
because they do not take into account a companys continued ability 
to make a profit 
the other provision that remains blocked would require mailing of 
notices to announce the formation of a nonprofit corporation to 
advocate the interests of insurance consumers insurers contend the 
corporation violates restrictions in the california constitution 
the provisions that will be allowed to take effect include a 
requirement that auto insurance rates be based primarily on a 
drivers record and experience rather than place of residence a 
ban on cancellation or nonrenewal of auto policies except for 
failure to pay fraud or an increase in the risk and a repeal of 
the insurance industrys exemption from state antitrust laws 
the courts order appeared to support the position of the state 
attorney general and private sponsors that a stay of all portions of 
the measure was excessive because most do not threaten the companies 
with any immediate measurable financial harm 
the insurers lawsuits did not attack all provisions of 
proposition 103 but argued that the entire initiative should be 
thrown out if the rate rollback and freeze are declared 
unconstitutional

opposition politicians said wednesday 
that economic pressure may have led officials to cover up a nuclear 
accident a year ago at a reactor in central west germany 
in the northern part of the country officials said another 
nuclear accident occurred nearly seven months ago they said 
investigators are determining whether the utility took too long to 
report that incident 
in parliament federal environment minister klaus toepfer told a 
committee there is an urgent need to better inform people about 
nuclear accidents and chancellor helmut kohl demanded a complete 
explanation of the dec 1617 biblis accident 
the justdisclosed incident at biblis nuclear power plant in 
hesse state has prompted charges of an attempted coverup from 
opposition parties and environmentalists 
toepfer has said he did not hear about the accident until oct 12 
under improbable but thinkable circumstances the reactor could 
have fallen into a state that would have been difficult to 
control he said 
marlene muehe his spokeswoman said wednesday that the 
government may review the reliability of the utility that operates 
the biblis plant rheinischwestfaelische elektrizitaetswerke but 
she did not say what such a review could lead to 
biblis operators allowed a malfunctioning valve to go uncorrected 
for 15 hours and a small amount of radioactive steam was released 
into the atmosphere when they finally tried to rectify the problem 
environmentalists allege the accident could have led to a 
meltdown of the biblis reactor core but energy officials insist the 
plant has emergency systems to prevent this 
the incident was disclosed this week by the american nuclear 
industry newsletter inside the nrc nrc is a reference to the 
us nuclear regulatory commission 
federal legislator klaus lennartz suggested economic pressure 
to keep the plant open may have played a role in any coverup the 
disclosure has prompted widespread demands that authorities shut 
down the reactor 
closing down an atomic power plant costs 570000 per day 
lennartz told reporters atomic energy personnel are under 
tremendous economic pressure he said 
the utility company operating biblis plant 
rheinischwestfaelisches elektrizitaetswerk denies it tried to 
conceal information 
the utility notified not only the authorities but also the 
residents in the area said company spokesman heinzjosef franken 
lower saxony state officials meanwhile said a leak occurred at 
the atomic power plant in stade city may 27 and the incident was not 
reported for three days 
state officials said the incident was given an urgent rating 
the same as biblis but they have not further described what 
happened 
preussenelektra the utility that runs the saxony plant 
acknowledged the incident but said no radioactivity escaped from the 
plant and there was never any serious danger to the public 
a company statement said a valve in the nonnuclear part of the 
plant failed but was repaired quickly 
werner hemmer environment minister for lower saxony state said 
state officials did not hear of the accident until three days later 
but the company denied trying to hide the incident and also 
rejected charges that reactor operators took too much time shutting 
down the plant 
guenther jansen energy minister in schleswigholstein state has 
charged that stade operators did not shut down the reactor until 
ordered to by federal inspectors 
stade is 15 miles west of hamburg and biblis is 30 miles south of 
frankfurt in the heavily populated rhine river valley

no we have told the world the truth we have learned from the 
noble tradition of western culture and that is that the only answer 
to poverty to war to oppression is one simple word freedom 
now freedom is not only a moral imperative for our foreign 
policy its also if i may use a word for which few in this room 
have much use supremely pragmatic for if there is anything the 
world has learned in the 1980s it is that as alan keyes has said 
freedom works 
that is a historic lesson because until very recently many 
intellectuals believed to the contrary they supported political 
philosophies that argued for tyranny and more particularly 
communist tyranny 
the claim was that these tyrannies worked better than freedom and 
were more equitable these intellectuals believed that the people of 
maos china hos vietnam castros cuba and other socialist 
utopias were actually happy to sacrifice their freedom for food and 
shelter and socalled literacy programs 
these noxious ideas have not to put it mildly withstood the 
scrutiny of honest scholars and the testimony of those fortunate 
enough to escape from those national prison camps 
refugees have told us what diligent researchers at aei were 
meticulously demonstrating that where there is little freedom 
there is little food that where there is totalitarian 
indoctrination instead of education literacy programs are a form of 
spiritual and psychological coercion that in these countries 
infant mortality is shockingly high and is getting worse that the 
povertystricken tyrannies of the 1980s have only grown poorer and 
poorer that tyranny is a parasite that saps the strength of a 
nation in its sway that like those who lived under macbeths 
tyranny the tyrannized millions will ever cry out our country 
sinks beneath the yoke it weeps it bleeds and each new day a 
gash is added to her wounds 
tyranny fails freedom works these facts so little accepted 
only a decade ago are now indisputable there is little need here 
to rehearse the evidence in great detail 
the tiny freeexchange experiments in the east bloc and the 
liberalization in the peoples republic of china are stunning 
evidence of the communist worlds desperate efforts to find a way 
out of the economic morass of state socialism 
at the same time the abject failure of the sandinistas in 
nicaragua a nation where the standard of living has dropped 
precipitously since the 1979 revolution is stark proof of 
communisms inherent inability to compel an enslaved population to 
do much of anything but suffer 
i know it is often said of me that i am an optimist 
over the years ive been described as an inveterate optimist an 
eternal optimist a reflexive optimist scattered laughter a 
born optimist a canny optimist a cagey optimist even as quote 
defiantly optimistic unquote laughter 
it just goes to show there is no word that cannot be turned into 
a pejorative if the pundits work hard enough at it laughter 
applause 
but yes i am perfectly happy to admit that i am an optimist and 
i would like to explain why i believe in contrast to some of you 
here tonight that optimism is an appropriate attitude to bring to 
bear when thinking about our foreign policy 
the story of this century is actually two stories its a 
terrible story of world wars totalitarian enslavement 
concentration camps but it is also the story of freedom the 
fulfillment of the promise of freedom inside the united states and 
the triumph of democratic systems in western europe japan israel 
el salvador and many other places 
we have seen the thrilling spectacle of mankind refusing to 
accept the shackles placed upon us when we read the works of 
solzhenitsyn and valladares consider the heroism of sharansky and 
sakharov and watch in wonder these last months as hundreds of 
thousands throughout the captive nations gather to press for freedom 
now one may if one chooses take the first story as the 
representative tale of the 20th century well i look to the second 
and find glorious examples of what freedom can bring 
i think of how astonishing it is that italy and germany and 
japan three nations that engaged us in a struggle literally to the 
death have in just two score become our brethren our friends 
the nations of western europe which existed in a state you might 
call cold war for most of the past millennium with periods of 
real war thrown into the bargain are now the best of friends and 
are on the verge of creating the worlds largest free market 
latin america once a despots paradise is now 90 percent 
democratic the brave people of el salvador have faced down those 
who would still their voices by turning out to vote in great number 
in the far east democracy has taken unprecedented strides in 
such countries as south korea and the philippines 
freedom works and freedom is on the march and yes i am an 
optimist and yes i believe i have every reason to be 
i am an optimist because we are rapidly developing the means to 
neutralize the extraordinary threat of nuclear missiles through our 
strategic defense initiative 
i an an optimist because i believe that we have proved with our 
policy of peace through strength that when we are strong peace and 
freedom will prevail 
this november the electorate told us they agreed 
but while i believe that optimism is appropriate and while i 
believe that freedom is on the march i believe optimism must be 
tempered with prudence and its assumptions challenged every waking 
moment of every day 
the new democracies around the world are fragile and inattention 
to their fragility and their needs may result in the end of freedom 
there 
in central america our policy of peace through strength has been 
undercut by a wavering democratcontrolled congress that seems less 
concerned about the threat of a consolidated marxistleninist regime 
in nicaragua than the possibility of scoring points against a policy 
so closely associated with our administration 
and yes i still believe the noble freedom fighters who have been 
battling for the soul of their homeland continue to be the best hope 
for freedom and democracy in nicaragua applause 
i am troubled by something else as well 
the 1980s have been the glory years of the nato alliance the 
soviet deployment of intermediaterange missiles presented nato with 
its greatest challenge since the construction of the berlin wall 
and the alliance not only survived but was vindicated by the 
signing of the inf treaty in washington one year ago tomorrow 
the nato alliance is the best example we have to show the less 
fortunate peoples of the world how freedom and democracy create 
friendship and comity between peoples and nations 
but 40 scattered applause but 40 years after the north 
atlantic treaty there are still some who question the alliance 
thus we hear just months after the destruction of the first 
intermediaterange missile that somehow the united states is being 
mistreated by our friends and allies 
the argument they use is that our allies are not sharing their 
burden of their own defense equitably 
i agree that our nato allies could be sharing the burden better 
but we must also solve our economic disputes more fairly 
but we must always remember the very real burden our allies bear 
that we never will we must remember our allies perform a role that 
geography has forced upon them 
they are literally on the front lines for the west our fortunate 
geography has kept the wars of the 20th century well away from the 
american mainland but in europe the memory is as fresh as the 
memories of a 50yearold and the tales of a grandfather

success of the postwar era 
i believe we can and will make progress on these matters as long 
as we hold true to our principles and do not give up the battle 
now i would like to ask those of you in this room who consider 
yourselves foreign policy skeptics to do me one last favor i want 
to ask you to remain vigilant 
you are the people who play the vital role of reminding 
politicians and policymakers of many important and necessary truths 
we sometimes forget 
its true that sometimes you cant see the forest for the trees 
indeed sometimes you cant even see the trees for the grass that

so please for george bushs sake and for the sake of all we hold

barricading herself in a room for 90 minutes before police persuaded 
her to give up

brandon center after an officer convinced her she would not be 
harmed and promised to buy her some hair curlers that she wanted 
when the shooting began mothers grabbed their small children and 
ran out into the falling snow without taking time to put on coats

the citys communist officials 
agreed tentatively to allow an independent rally which they have 
not done since reform leader alexander dubcek was ousted in 1969 
dissident leaders said wednesday 
one activist jiri dienstbier said rally organizers and city 
officials reached a provisional accord wednesday to allow a 
demonstration marking saturday as the 40th anniversary of the 
universal declaration of human rights 
dienstbier who belongs to the charter 77 human rights movement 
said authorities were expected to make a final decision thursday 
it looks as if it is permitted he said 
if the gathering takes place without police interference it 
would be the first time in nearly 20 years that independent groups 
gained permission for a rally in prague in 1969 authorities ousted 
dubcek in the wake of a sovietled invasion provoked by his reforms 
known as the prague spring 
another charter 77 source who spoke on conditon of anonymity 
called the tentative approval of a demonstration a small step by 
authorities toward engaging independent groups in dialogue 
authorities told organizers tuesday that the demonstration will 
not be permitted as requested in pragues central wenceslas square 
the sources said 
but charter 77 member milos hajek said he and two other group 
members went wednesday to pragues municipal government to discuss 
an alternative location 
the other charter 77 source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said a second discussion with authorities later wednesday resulted 
in a tentative agreement for a demonstration in a small square about 
a mile from the center of prague 
saturdays demonstration was called by the charter 77 movement 
the committee for the unjustly prosecuted known as vons the 
movement for civil freedom the independent peace association and 
czech children 
authorities banned a rally called by the same five groups on oct 
28 the 70th anniversary of czechoslovakias independence about

more than 100 companies that dumped hazardous 
waste into a suburban landfill agreed wednesday to a 66 million 
settlement of a federal lawsuit to clean up one of the nations 
worst toxic dumps 
the agreement filed as a consent decree with the lawsuit in 
federal court addresses a decade of concerns over the 190acre 
operating industries inc landfill in monterey park which took 
municipal and industrial waste between 1948 and 1984 
dan mcgovern regional administrator of the us environmental 
protection agency said the settlement was one of the largest ever 
achieved by the agency and a landmark for the federal superfund 
cleanup program 
the decree represents a significant commitment by the 119 
participating companies to clean up the contamination for which they 
are responsible and to thereby protect the health and restore the 
environment he said 
the settlement outlined by us attorney robert bonner and other 
officials at a news conference calls for 32 million in payments 
from some settling defendants and 34 million worth of cleanup work 
from others 
about 190 companies are responsible for 80 percent of the waste 
put into operating industries mcgovern said and the government 
will begin issuing administrative orders to compel action by those 
that didnt settle 
the settling companies will build a plant to treat leachate 
liquid moving through the ground to prevent contamination of water 
supplies around the dump which is 10 miles east of downtown and 
surrounded by 53000 residences 
neighbors have complained for years of health problems they 
believe stem from the dump which is bisected by the pomona freeway 
one side is a 150foot mound of solid waste and the other is a flat 
area where liquids were dumped 
we think that its a long time coming said hank yoshitake a 
representative of homeowners to eliminate landfill problems which 
represents 460 families living in the neighborhood 
the epa has identified wastes buried there as including such 
toxins as benzene and vinyl chloride 
dr kenneth kizer director of the california department of 
health services said the site is a cauldron for potential health 
problems for the community but there is no indication that those 
problems have come 
settling companies included the petroleum aerospace airline 
food products steel and paint industries 
the superfund act imposes liability for hazardous waste cleanup 
costs on those who sent material to dumps even if they did so 
legally 
sixty of the settling companies have formed the oii steering 
committee to undertake the cleanup committee chairman jeff 
zimmerman lauded the agreement 
the settlement embraces fully the spirit of the superfund law 
in bringing the government and the private sector together to 
produce more effective and efficient cleanup plans for a landfill 
which while it was legally accepting a great variety of wastes over 
its history must now be addressed he said 
zimmerman said it would be more costly to wage a legal battle 
against the government than to settle and in any event the money 
would be better spent on cleaning up operating industries he urged 
other companies to join in

the estonian parliament rebuffed moscow 
wednesday by voting to keep in place the tiny baltic republics 
declaration of sovereignty 
the legislature also made estonian the official language and 
asked the central government to consider calling repressions under 
the late dicator josef stalin crimes against humanity 
the body refused to rescind its declaration of limited 
sovereignty by a 15291 vote 
moscow had branded the move illegal and told the republic to 
rescind it 
instead the body agreed merely to be guided by the national 
parliament known as the supreme soviet 
the vote on the constitutional amendment to make estonian the 
official language was 20449 with four abstentions 14 more votes 
than the twothirds required it was the widest margin of 
disagreement yet in the legislature a former rubberstamp body in 
which debate is a recent phenomenon 
but the legislature delayed action until january on a proposed 
law to force nonnative residents to learn estonian 
under the proposed law residents from other parts of the soviet 
union would have to learn estonian many of them including police 
doctors and shop clerks have lived in estonia for years without 
doing so 
about 40 percent of estonias 16 million residents are 
nonnative and the number is increasing estonians fear they will 
outnumbered in their own homeland and their language and culture 
will die 
the nonnatives speak russian which everybody in the soviet 
union learns estonia has both russianlanguage and 
estonianlanguage newspapers and business can be conducted in 
either language 
a russian organization called intermovement denounced the 
language proposal as divisive at a rally last week some members 
even called it an incitement to ethnic hatred 
martin kuusk an estonian engineer said hundreds of thousands of 
people have come to estonia for wellpaid factory jobs and if they 
want to stay they must absorb our culture if they do not want to 
learn their country is in the neighborhood 
estonia joins four other republics in declaring their own 
official languages lithuania a nearby baltic republic passed its 
law in recent weeks but armenia azerbaijan and georgia three 
caucasus republics in the south have had theirs since 1978 
estonia approved its declaration of sovereignty in all but 
defense and foreign affairs on nov 16 
it also amended the constitution to give itself the right to 
reject soviet laws but that new power has been used cautiously 
the estonian parliament said wednesday that crimes which it laid 
to stalin should be prosecuted and suggested paying damages to the 
surviving victims from the national budget 
tens of thousands of estonians were deported to siberia and the 
arctic in the 1940s and 1950s and many died there from the harsh 
conditions 
stalin ruled from 19241953 according to western historians he 
ordered the murder or imprisonment of millions of soviets many died 
in prison 
the soviet union however has only begun to admit the horrors of 
stalins crimes in the past two years until now there has been no 
official call to identify and prosecute the thousands of soviet 
citizens who carried out stalins orders and are still alive 
one estonian activist said republican leaders did not go far 
enough in simply asking moscow to consider the matter 
the soviet union is still hunting nazi war criminals all over 
the world said tonis avikson a spokesman for the estonian 
peoples front an independent political group if we declare the 
stalinist repressions to be crimes against humanity why shouldnt 
we raise our hands against these people he said

aircraft 
but kotaite said the council reserved judgment on the incident 
until it hears back from the organizations air navigation 
commission at its next meeting in february 
he denied there was any discussion of condemning the united 
states for the downing of the iran air a300 airbus on july 3 in the 
persian gulf all 290 people aboard the plane were killed 
edmund stohr us representative to the united nations agency 
earlier told reporters there were a number of council members 
that felt that there should have been a condemnation 
kotaite said the condemnation of the use of force against 
civil aircraft was stated by a number of representatives now we 
postpone our action on the report until spring 
the iranian delegation has urged the council to censure the 
united states since a special meeting last july considered the 
downing of iran air flight 655 by the uss vincennes 
mahmood hajighasemali spokesman for the delegation told 
reporters that iran will wait for the commissions report but he 
said our people will not tolerate a further delay in the 
finalizing of the issue 
president reagan has promised compensation to families of the 
victims but the us has accepted no blame in the incident 
both the icao report which was officially released wednesday 
after being leaked last week and an earlier us defense department 
investigation found a series of events aboard the vincennes led the 
ships crew to erroneously believe the passenger plane was an 
attacking iranian f14 fighter 
the report said american warships in the persian gulf had no 
equipment that allowed them to monitor air traffic control 
frequencies they therefore had no way to hear radio transmissions 
between the iran air airbus and air traffic controllers it said 
the report said 11 warnings were issued to the jet before it was 
downed by two missiles from the vincennes but only one warning 
from another us ship in the area was coded specifically for the 
iran air flight that message came only about 40 seconds before the 
jet was destroyed 
the report says military units in hazardous situations should be 
provided with the means to monitor air traffic control frequencies 
and to communicate directly with civilian controllers it also 
recommends that military warnings be improved 
sending the report to the air navigation commission a 15person 
technical body follows an example set in 1983 when icao 
investigated the downing of a korean air lines boeing 747 by the 
soviet union all 269 people aboard were killed 
after that investigation the report was sent to the commission 
the icao council eventually refused to condemn the soviet union 
adopting instead a motion deploring the use of military force 
against civilian aircraft 
icao with 159 member countries sets standards for civil 
aviation and airline safety from its headquarters in montreal it 
can make recommendations that are not binding on its members

prosecutors said wednesday they have 
dropped their investigation of mathias rust for his daredevil 
unauthorized flight into moscow that embarrassed the soviet military 
last year

soviet union landing on moscows red square on may 28 1987 he was 
19 at the time 
his unhindered penetration of soviet air space resulted in a

police stopped and searched a 
black us judge after mistaking her for someone they believed was 
taking photos of an anticrime operation in a black township police 
and the judge said wednesday 
now at least i have a taste of what life is like for blacks who 
live in the black townships of south africa 24 hours a day 365 
days a year knowing the fear the complete lack of control one has 
over ones person when police are doing whatever they want to do 
said ladoris cordell a judge of the santa clara county superior 
court in san jose calif

illegal to take pictures but he said police can demand that someone 
identify himself anytime

that another black woman was taking photographs of the operation 
they confronted this lady without the knowledge that she was a 
judge from the united states he said 
sauerman said ms cordell was released without being detained as 
soon as police were satisfied of her identity 
however ms cordell who was visiting south africa to 
participate in a conference for un human rights week said i 
was not free to go at one point i was so terrified i actually 
wondered if i would be seeing anybody i knew again

apartheid that establishes a racially segregated society in which 
the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts

denied having done so 
while they were searching one of the policemen said to me 
its not as bad here as they say it is in the us is it she

an argentine citizen who was arrested by 
mexican authorities after he identified the body of israeli 
counterterrorism expert amiram nir has been released argentine 
embassy sources said wednesday 
the sources said on condition of anonymity that immigration 
authorities released pedro curchet this week after he proved his 
identity and showed he was in the country legally 
nir 38 died nov 30 when a small private plane he chartered in 
the western mexican town of uruapan crashed on a flight to mexico 
city 
nir an adviser on counterterrorism to two israeli prime 
ministers until 1987 was linked to the irancontra affair and 
former national security staffer col oliver north 
associates in uruapan said nir was negotiating to buy avocados 
for export to europe and israel and that curchet was an official of 
an avocado exporting company called eupasa 
curchet was one of the people who identified nirs body on dec 
1 and he was detained on suspicion that he was engaged in business 
activities in mexico without a work permit 
we were informed tuesday that he had been freed apparently he 
could not produce personal documents at the time he was detained he 
said he had given them to a lawyer who was getting him working 
papers one source said 
and apparently the lawyer came forth and produced his 
passport and he was freed the source said 
the sources said curchet was not in contact with the argentine 
embassy before his arrest although argentine nationals in mexico 
are required to register at the embassy 
the sources said the embassy also did not know curchets age 
hometown or other personal details curchet could not be located 
wednesday although his luggage was still being held by a hotel in 
uruapan about 200 miles west of mexico city 
a secretary for the mexican interior ministrys press office said 
nobody was available for comment 
nir made several trips to europe and iran in arranging for the 
secret sale of weapons to iran in exchange for the release of us 
hostages in lebanon and us officials had been seeking him for 
testimony in the irancontra case 
nir used his own name in business dealings in uruapan but gave 
the assumed name of pat weber when he rented the plane 
mexican authorities said a preliminary investigation blamed the 
crash on mechanical failure 
an airline employee who had hitched a ride on the flight also 
died 
the pilot and adriana stanton 25 a canadian citizen who worked 
for eupasa were seriously injured but were reported in good 
condition after undergoing operations wednesday stanton apparently 
also used an assumed name for the charter flight 
nir son of holocaust survivors was buried tuesday at a suburban 
tel aviv cemetery in israel hundreds of people including cabinet 
ministers and former colleagues attended the funeral 
also on tuesday the long island newspaper newsday quoted 
intelligence sources as saying nir kept in contact with us 
intelligence officials until his death 
the newsday report said nir may have been involved in a large 
shipment of israeli weapons that arrived in the gulf of mexico port 
of veracruz last week to bolster mexicos drug fighting forces 
on monday an informed israeli source told the associated press 
that nir was a licensed israeli arms dealer but former colleagues 
and friends said there was no evidence nir ever used the license 
one friend said nir was tired of arms dealing after the 
irancontra affair and went into the fruit and vegetable importing 
business with a base in london

the coast guard recovered the body of one boater and 
called off its search for another man missing after a phantom vessel 
demolished their 37foot catamaran off key largo authorities said 
wednesday 
the body of john zeigler of fort myers was spotted by an air 
force helicopter at 530 pm but ronald brennan of sarasota was 
still missing wednesday night said coast guard spokesman dan 
vogeley 
since weve found zeiglers body well probably not continue 
the search in the morning vogeley said the coast guard 
searches whenever theres a hope of finding survivors since we 
found one body and the debris we found was very splintered up we 
dont think the odds are too good that well find brennan alive 
the coast guard received a cryptic notification from an 
unidentified vessel around midnight saying it might have hit 
something about six miles southeast of key largo 
soon afterward the crew of the sawa sawa reported that their 
sailing companion the suli suli had disappeared after what looked 
like a pleasurecraft shining a spotlight passed by in the opposite 
direction vogeley said 
the first debris was found by the coast guard at 930 am about 
six miles east of key largo carried there by gulf stream currents 
and the crew of the sawa sawa confirmed the wreckage was from its 
companion boat the two boats had left marathon sailing for gun cay 
in the bahamas 
normally if something is hit youll find large pieces of the 
boat but what were finding in this case suggests the boat that hit 
them was very large because were finding very small pieces of 
debris said coast guard petty officer joe dye 
the coast guard dispatched a falcon jet a helicopter and two 
boats to search for the missing men 
the vessel that originally reported that they hit something did 
not give their name and were attempting to locate them also dye 
said 
the rules of the road state that a mariner is required to stop 
and render assistance to somebody in need regardless of whether 
they hit them or not they are required to stop and assist them 
he said he obviously knew he hit something so he should have 
stopped and checked it out he might have been able to help them 
asked about the likelihood of finding the other vessel involved 
in the collision dye conceded its going to be difficult unless 
the guy wants to come forward right now we dont have any specific 
information on the type of boat it was or where it was going

the leader of mexicos leftist opposition said 
wednesday that he would work with newly inaugurated mexican 
president carlos salinas de gortari to cut mexicos huge burden of 
foreign debt but not on anything else 
we consider salinas and his government are illegitimate and 
this makes for difficult relations cuauhtemoc cardenas said in 
his first appearance in the united states since salinas was 
inaugurated dec 1 
cardenas who was defeated by salinas in the recent elections 
added that he believes economic conditions will bring about salinas 
resignation and new elections he contended that salinas did not win 
the majority he claims 
cardenas noted soviet president mikhail gorbachevs suggestion 
that payments on some debts ought to be delayed by as much as 100 
years saying we would support any solution that establishes 
priority for mexicos economic growth and improvement of social 
conditions 
any new curb on mexicos worsening living standards would 
endanger social peace he said 
cardenas said the heavily indebted country can no longer continue 
in present conditions he said social risks and tensions are 
increasing day by day 
it is estimated that salaries have lost at least 50 percent of 
their real purchasing power over the last five years he said he 
added that unemployment has reached unprecedented levels rising 
from 1 million in 1982 to 65 million today 
cardenas the son of former president lazaro cardenas told the 
overseas development council that new terms should be negotiated 
with creditor banks to ease mexicos debt burden the council is a 
private organization dealing with third world problems 
the main contribution from the world financial community has 
been more loans with which to service the debt he said debt 
service consists largely in payments of interest 
mexico which owes more than 102 billion is the largest debtor 
in the third world after brazil much of its debt is owed to us 
banks the country has recently had a 35 billion loan from the 
us treasury 
mexico needs to grow economically and in the short term the 
only resources available to do so are being used to service the 
debt cardenas went on 
he estimated that since 1983 mexico had transferred 66 billion 
abroad without obtaining any real goods or services in exchange 
the speech was written before gorbachev earlier on wednesday 
proposed to the united nations a delay in the poorest countries 
debt repayments for as long as 100 years mexico where incomes 
averaged 1820 last year is not usually classed among the poorest 
countries 
for the somewhat betteroff debtors gorbachev proposed a new 
international organization to buy up debt at a discount a proposal 
similar to one in the trade law president ronald reagan signed last 
august

former white house aide oliver l north on 
wednesday dropped efforts to disclose a quarter of the 40000 pages 
of classified documents he wants to use to defend criminal charges 
arising from the irancontra affair 
defense lawyers filed a brief statement that they were 
withdrawing 10000 pages of cia intelligence cables on nicaragua 
that were listed in norths nov 14 notice of government secrets he 
wants to reveal in a public trial 
the monthly intelligence cables covered a threeyear period from 
january 1984 through december 1986 a month after the irancontra 
affair became known and north was dismissed from his job at the 
national security council 
in a motion last month irancontra special prosecutor lawrence 
e walsh sought to bar the defense from using any secret documents 
as evidence walsh accused the defense of listing a large number of 
irrelevant documents to overwhelm the courts and the governments 
abilities to conduct proceedings under the classified information 
procedures act 
he specifically criticized norths listing of large swatches of 
cia cables concerning nicaragua that bear only the most tangential 
relation to the subject matter of the case 
norths statement was filed as us district judge gerhard a 
gesell continued closed hearings into the use of secret documents at 
trial the hearings began last week 
gesell has not ruled on secrecy issues and must decide if 
classified material north wants to disclose is needed for his 
defense president reagan said last week he would allow virtually 
none of the documents to be disclosed in open court 
if gesell decides north cannot get a fair trial wthout disclosing 
some documents he could dismiss the central charge that the former 
presidential aide conspired to illegally divert usiran armssale 
proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels 
to foreclose norths need to disclose government secrets walsh 
has narrowed the focus of allegations against the former 
presidential aide 
on tuesday he filed a detailed statement of norths wholly 
legitimate efforts to try to release american hostages in the 
middle east 
the summary of norths activities was offered as an unclassified 
statement that could be introduced as evidence at trial 
the reagan administration seeking to protect wellguarded 
secrets about intelligence operations is particularly sensitive 
about revealing any details about efforts to free the hostages 
walsh argues that north and his codefendants corrupted president 
reagans armsforhostage initiatives by diverting proceeds to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
no date has been set for norths trial separate trials have been 
ordered for former national security adviser john m poindexter and 
arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v

the story is that with only enough oil to last 
for one day the lamps miraculously burned for eight 
thats one of the wonders of hanukkah whose crescendo of lights 
reaches its peak saturday at sunset when jewish homes and synagogues 
glow with the full eight tapers of the menorahs 
its the religious calendars prelude to christmas which is 
separate but which indirectly hinges on the ancient event marked by 
that effusion of jewish lights 
starting with a customary single candle when the holiday began 
last saturday an additional one was lit on each successive night 
until the fullorbed tier of eight shines this weekend 
the holiday a time of games and giftgiving is sometimes 
regarded as a jewish counterpart of christmas and both signify a new 
start a fresh element of faith 
also without the precedent of hanukkah scholars point out that 
there presumably could be no christmas 
the jewish festival of lights celebrates an ancient turn of 
history that prevented destruction of the mother faith of 
judaism from which the christian tradition emerged 
but the specific significance and origins of two holidays differ 
with christmas marking the birth of christ and hanukkah recalling a 
much earlier event of great joy judaisms regained right to exist 
this happened in about 165 bc when a small guerrilla army led 
by judas maccabee the hammerer defeated the worlds then 
mightiest military force of syria which had sought to stamp out 
every vestige of jewish religion 
the ancient victory was celebrated by cleansing the temple in 
jerusalem of installed pagan altars and prostitutes and rededicating 
it with kindling of its lamps on a oneday oil supply legend says 
those lamps inexplicably kept on burning for eight 
but the phenomenon of the lamps had a surpassing antecedant the 
amazing victory by a small motley mountain band of guerrillas over 
the foreign conqueror the ancient syrian empire 
it had spread over the entire middle east and ordered the 
extermination of all traces of judaism so that subjects would be 
one people serving the state pantheon of idols 
whoever refuses should be put to death it was decreed and 
thousands of jews were slain scripture scrolls were ripped apart 
and burned many jews submitted and bowed to the state idols 
all over israel pagan altars were erected and patrols circulated 
to compel allegiance to the new gods jewish obervance of the 
sabbath was forbidden in the temple turned into a scene of 
debaucheries stood a statue to jupiter 
if the suppression had succeeded it would have crushed judaism 
which would have eliminated the seedbed of christianity 
but revolt flamed against that threat 
an aging father of five sons the maccabees attacked and killed 
a syrian officer who was forcing jewish villagers to make offerings 
to a pagan altar the maccabees fled to the hills 
gathering a scanty illequipped crew of resistance fighters the 
eldest maccabee son judas told them 
arm yourselves and be brave it is better for us to die in

the 1988 alternatives poster shows a 
sleighing santa and reindeer flying over the holy family and child 
in the manger a caption asks whose birthday is it anyway 
alternatives a campaign seeking to recover a christcentered 
christmas and to protest its commercialization this year has the 
backing of more than 100000 protestant and roman catholic 
congregations across the country 
milo thornberry director of the campaign founded by various 
christian groups in 1973 says it doesnt want people to reject the 
whole notion of giftgiving and celebration nor send them on a 
guilt trip about it 
rather it seeks to help them restore perspective to a season 
that often degenerates into a religionsanctioned orgy of 
selfindulgence 
sponsoring agencies for 1988 are detroits catholic diocese and 
seven major protestant denominations 
alternatives which distributes resource material rituals 
and bible study guides suggests such alternative activities as 
reducing time spent shopping and watching television and using 
it for bible study and meditation 
replacing the santa tradition with that of st nicholas patron 
saint who loved and cared for children 
more personal thoughtful and valuescentered giftgiving 
instead of moneyspending competitions to give the best 
giving a fourth of holiday spending money to the needy and 
reaching out to people who otherwise would be alone at christmas

after sticking it to everyone else for the 
past 10 years jr ewing has finally gotten a taste of his own 
medicine on cbs dallas 
first jr larry hagman landed in jail on a rape charge then 
he was put on a chain gang now hes guest of honor at a shotgun 
wedding 
jr gets hitched to purty little thing cally harper played 
by cathy podewell the wedding catered by smith amp wesson takes 
place friday 
im a waitress at a hunting lodge in arkansas where jr and 
bobby ewing take rooms on a hunting trip said podewell when i 
come to their table jr sets his sights on me with a vengeance 
we have a rendezvous and he says shes too beautiful to stay 
in a small town he sweet talks me into bed then my two older 
brothers come in and stick a shotgun under his nose 
dallas has always been outrageous but this year with hagman 
serving as executive producer the show is seeking new directions 
for one thing hagman is taking the show about an oil family out of 
the boardroom george kennedy has joined the cast as the foe in an 
an oldfashioned range war with the ewings 
the show of course has never taken itself seriously that has 
enabled it to get away with such stunts as dismissing bobbys death 
and an entire season as a dream of his wife pamela 
jr has been wounded by the shot heard round the world in 
1980 then by wife sue ellen at the close of last season but hes 
never had his comeuppance in the current sequence hes on the 
receiving end of some rough rural justice 
caught under the covers with cally he tries to fend off her 
brothers by telling them hes jr ewing but it doesnt work 
because the bucolic brethren have never heard of the famous texas 
oil millionaire the brothers are played by cliff potts and sherman 
howard 
i dont bat an eyelash when he says who he is said podewell 
yet ive never encountered anyone like him before hes so full 
of confidence 
the sheriff puts jr in jail but cally agrees to help break him 
out after he promises to marry her the escape attempt goes awry 
and hes caught and sentenced to 10 years on the chain gang 
my brothers break him out of prison so they can kill him 
said podewell i tell them im pregnant and he has to marry me 
which brings us to fridays episode and the shotgun wedding no 
help is on the way bobby is back in dallas unaware of his 
brothers plight 
jr does escape after the wedding and returns to dallas but 
cally is right behind him waving the wedding certificate under his 
nose 
he doesnt want anything to do with me but i think im here to 
stay said podewell who has a twoyear contract with dallas 
her first series the closest ive ever come to being a regular 
was a twopart role as kirk camerons love interest on growing 
pains i played that as 17 although im 24 
she also stars as martin sheens daughter in the upcoming comedy 
feature beverly hills brats 
podewell was born in evanston ill but grew up in walnut creek 
in northern california her fathers a teacher and coach at berkeley 
high school and her mothers a real estate agent 
her grandparents however are actors in chicago lester 
podewell 81 recently had a part in shoeless joe starring 
kevin costner her grandmother beverly younger podewell was a 
regular with studs turkel on studs place in 1950 
podewell began acting in high school then studied theater arts 
and dancing at the university of california at santa barbara 
i moved to los angeles and almost immediately got a role on 
lady blue which got me my screen actors guild card she said 
i got killed by johnny depp whos now on 21 jump street and

it is difficult not to view maria callas life as 
high melodrama or greek tragedy says john ardoin executive 
producer of maria callas an operatic biography 
the documentary about the great soprano airs tonight on pbs as 
part of the great performances series 
callas who died in 1977 at age 53 was famed for her voice and 
her acting for reviving the bel canto repertoire in the 20th 
century for being a superstar before the word was invented for her 
liaison with greek shipping magnate aristotle onassis 
no one ever had so much and wound up with so little said 
ardoin its hard not to see it as the gods taking away all 
theyve given 
the tv show includes callas singing and talking and others 
talking about her 
ardoin says public interest in callas remains high a lot of 
people remember her still a big number are hooked on her because a 
friend played them a record which reached out and grabbed their 
attention and wont let them go 
ardoin had been a friend of callas since 1964 his fourth book 
about her focusing on her master classes at the juilliard school 
is scheduled to be published this month he says maria callas was 
two people maria the person and callas the diva 
it was like two people fighting for some kind of supremacy in 
this body one always trying to dominate the other he said 
its not typical most singers have a pretty good sense of 
identity ive never encountered anyone else who had such a terrible 
battle between the person and the persona maybe marilyn monroe 
maria spent most of her time away from the stage trying to 
understand callas she knew she had a tremendous effect on people 
she never really could understand why 
it was just chemistry which she had in spades 
on stage when she did something it was in such perfect sync 
with the music it knocked the socks off of you she physically was 
the music whether you realized what was happening or not something 
told you it was right 
ardoin music critic for the dallas morning news wrote the 
script for a 1978 documentary on pbs callas which emphasized 
her art 
this new documentary he says emphasizes her as a woman 
director tony palmer had an idea which i think was wonderful 
he was more interested in the quality of this life i helped him 
with interviews and background material a lot of her voice speaking 
on the soundtrack came from interviews i had with maria 
ardoin went through his 40 hours of taped callas interviews for a 
fourhour documentary that will air on national public radio in 
january 
her best recordings he believes are lucia di lammermoor in 
berlin medea in dallas la sonnambula in cologne and la 
traviata in london all live performances ardoin says she had 
that extra additive of the audience inspiration of the moment 
the tour of concerts that callas undertook in 1973 showed a voice 
past its prime ardoin says i think part of her reason for 
touring was to show onassis she was not beaten she could survive 
without him she really couldnt she truly loved him and wanted to 
make her life with him 
she had to show she was still beautiful had a new boyfriend 
had her audience back when he died in 1975 there was nobody to 
play the game with anymore and she gave up 
at the carnegie hall concert somebody yelled you are music 
ardoin says some of the most absorbing moments in maria callas 
an operatic biography are when you watch her living the music how 
different she looks in the don carlo and the barber of seville 
arias it was the music that transformed her 
that solitary voice at carnegie sums her up best i cant think 
of a better way to say it the look of her and the sound of her was 
music

thanks to a mixture of holidayseason generosity 
and enlightened selfinterest many people give some extra thought 
at this time of year to charitable contributions 
donations bring the psychic reward of helping out your favorite 
social service agency religious organization or college 
and they also offer the financial reward of reducing your income 
tax bill since most contributions remain fully deductible under tax 
reform 
if you have any doubt about whether a specific institution or 
program entitles you to a deduction you can check your local 
library for internal revenue service publication 78 cumulative 
list of organizations 
whenever you contemplate charitable giving experts in personal 
finance say it makes sense to know the tax rules so that both donor 
and donee get the greatest possible benefit 
for one thing you must itemize your deductions in order to take 
advantage of the tax break a special arrangement that was set up 
for nonitemizers a few years ago no longer exists 
so if you are in a situation where you itemize in some years and 
take the standard deduction in others it makes sense to consider 
concentrating your contributions in years when you plan to itemize 
the simplest form of contribution is cash which can be 
documented either by a receipt or canceled check but that is by no 
means the only way to do it 
if cash is not readily available it is possible to charge 
donations on a credit card and take the deduction in 1988 while 
deferring payment until 1989 says the arthur young accounting 
firm 
many organizations accept noncash contributions such as 
clothing books or canned goods which you can deduct at their fair 
market value 
specific records must be kept to support a deduction for 
donated property cautions deloitte haskins amp sells another large 
accounting firm 
if you claim noncash contributions of more than 500 the rules 
require that you file a special form with your tax return to 
document it above 5000 you also must provide a formal appraisal 
unless the item involved is a publicly traded stock whose value at 
the time of donation is a matter of public record 
stocks and other capital investments that have appreciated in 
value since the time of their purchase qualify for special treatment 
when they are given as charitable gifts 
donors of these securities can take a deduction for the full 
current market value and avoid a capital gains tax liability at the 
same time higherincome people giving substantial amounts of 
appreciated property are advised to check beforehand to see whether 
this will expose them to the alternative minimum tax 
there is nothing to prevent you from contributing a security on 
which you have a loss but the experts say it is smarter to sell 
such a security and then give the cash proceeds to the charity of 
your choice 
that way you can write the loss off on your tax return within 
limits set by the tax code as well as take a deduction for the 
securitys market value 
what if you prefer to contribute your time rather than money 
doing volunteer work the rules dont permit you to assign a 
financial value to your time and deduct it 
however say accountants kpmg peat marwick you can take a 
deduction for your outofpocket expenses incurred in donating your 
time and for the charitable use of your automobile 
the standard rate for car use is 12 cents a mile plus any 
parking or toll fees you pay if you are willing to keep good 
records of all your auto expenses you may be able to take a bigger 
deduction

a large percentage of economic forecasters are 
looking for trouble ahead and theyre finding support for their 
fears in the past 
whether the fears are justified is an entirely different matter 
a vocal minority of forecasters for instance say their brethren 
are locked into a neurotic view of the economic world as one in need 
of punishment 
why the punsishment good times breed the feeling and when those 
good times persist despite budget and trade deficits and myriad 
other unresolved problems a sense of guilt develops good times it 
is felt are undeserved 
in the political realm therefore a good many economists say 
that even if george bush enjoys an extended honeymoon he eventually 
will be confronted by the problems it is his fate they say to 
face the deficit and tax monsters 
this is how they set the stage 
for the eight years of the reagan administration the economy 
enjoyed great prosperity interest rates fell inflation declined 
sharply and remained fairly low both stocks and bonds rose by 
roughly 11 percent a year in real terms 
business strengthened itself during this time small companies 
prospered employment grew large companies became much more 
competitive corporate profits rose by most measures real income 
also rose 
all this came about while some economists worried themselves 
silly it couldnt be happening they said pointing to the 
mountainous budget deficit spectacular trade deficit low savings 
rate and shaky financial institutions 
they insist we have run up debts that must be repaid 
the comparison of ronald reagan and calvin coolidge is convenient 
for such thinkers the roaring 20s of calvin coolidges 
administration were among the best years of the century for stocks 
then the economy collapsed 
in the bad things to come scenario presidentelect george 
bush plays the role of herbert hoover coolidges era buried hoover 
ronald reagans era could disintegrate and smother bush and his 
plans 
the scenario appeals to those who like their rationales well 
packaged but such packaging is accomplished only by eliminating 
some factors 
securities markets for example might be overpriced but not to 
the same extent as in 1929 the federal reserve board has a better 
handle on the economy industry today is stronger than it was two 
decades ago or in 1929 
such factors dont fit into the package it doesnt stop the 
thinking however those who see trouble ahead then point to an 
expansion that already is six years old which they view as old age 
it cannot last they say 
perhaps not but recessions have always been a threat and an 
actuality too president eisenhower had three of them and his terms 
generally are viewed as having been economically stable and 
successful 
there is no question that bushs administration will be forced to 
deal with tough matters including the twin deficits of budget and 
trade tax questions bad debts everywhere structural problems in 
banking poverty uncertainty 
in the years since world war ii the stock market has declined 
five of six times during the first year after a republican election 
victory it could do so again adding to the existing pressures but 
it will come back 
as important as the potential downside to the problems is how 
effective the new presidents policies are there are always 
problems to deal with which is why presidents are elected bush 
isnt without weapons to use 
some of those weapons might have to be used to infiltrate the 
minds of those who spread the philosophy of inevitable failure

just a bass and a voice simple right well not 
really for rob wasserman who traveled all over the world to record 
duets his new album of twosomes with such artists as aaron 
neville rickie lee jones lou reed and stephane grappelli 
he used a basic formula for the 12 songs on duets the artist 
selected the tune the location and an instrument of his or her own 
preference but only wasserman and the singer could appear on the 
finished recording 
there was no official producer on most of the tunes he said 
just me oneonone with the artists its a real intimate album 
it sounds like that its got its own uniqueness 
wasserman sought a range of styles for duets from nevilles 
soul to the pop vocals of jones reeds heady rock and the jazz 
interpretations of grappelli the songs range from the hoagy 
carmichael standard stardust sung by neville to jennifer 
warnes version of the leonard cohen composition ballad of the 
runaway horse 
it was challenging because i didnt just want to become an 
accompaniest said the 35yearold bassist in a recent interview 
at the sir studio 
i really focused on every song being different some tunes it 
was more appropriate to play the simplest possible bass lines on 
other songs i was all kind of roles 
he also was in all kinds of places duets was recorded in los 
angeles london san francisco and texas this has been more than 
an album its been a journey an adventure 
the record is a progression numerically for wasserman in 1983 
he recorded solo an album featuring only his bass playing the 
enthusiastic response for that work encouraged wasserman to add 
vocals on his next lp 
i didnt really want to jump from the solo record to a band 
said wasserman a native of california who lives in marin county 
id worked with a lot of singers on and off for a lot of years and 
i realized that that was a great combination for me thats always 
blended really well if you find the right voices 
i didnt know a lot of people on the album before i did it 
he admitted sometimes i didnt get to play musically with them 
until the session there was that risk of walking into the studio 
and not knowing whether youre ever going to hit it off 
also performing on duets is dan hicks former leader of dan 
hicks and his hot licks who covers gone with the wind 
he was one of the first working jobs i had after i got out of 
music school wasserman recalled 
when i joined the band most of the time it was just me and 
him he ended up being the first duet i ever played in i asked him 
to be on this record because i felt he was one of those unique 
artists who hasnt had a recording out in quite a while 
reeds appearance on the album came about in true storybook 
fashion wasserman who needed to record a few additional songs to 
fill the album was in a bar in copenhagen when reed walked in 
the guitar player i was with said thats lou reed i had a 
demo of the album with me i went to him and gave him the tape and 
figured thats the last ill ever see of him 
not exactly he called wasserman less than 15 minutes later he 
had heard the aaron neville piece and was flipped out 
and reed whose songs include heroin and walk on the wold 
side decided to record the standard one for the road 
i thought it was a great selection he was also considering 
these foolish things said wasserman he and reed gave the song 
a rock treatment 
we didnt want to really do it in a jazz mode i said ill 
play the chords on the bass we made up this primal stripped down 
kind of groove its still just two people 
they did it in one take 
however he spent the longest time working on the warnes track 
shes a very hardworking and intense character wasserman 
said she wanted every word to be perfect with jennifer every 
word had to be sung correctly it had a lot of sculpturing to it 
she did a lot of incredibly subtle background singing 
an hourlong video of duets is being filmed the neville 
segment and the reed segment with singersongwriteractor tom 
waits as a bartender have already been shot 
next hed like to do a trios lp recording a piece with soul 
queen aretha franklin and classical cellist yo yo ma he also 
envisions a combination of himself with rocker van morrison and 
rickie lee jones 
of course wasserman would still like to do a solo lp 
it would probably be a live concert solo album he said i 
would like to do it when i have a new set of solo bass songs 
to me all this is exciting

gaming whiz steve wynn stood in the 
sunbaked parking lot of his latest casino acquisition recently and 
enthused laughlin reminds me of what las vegas was 40 years ago 
wynn isnt alone in the attachment americas gaming giants have 
developed for this fastgrowing gambling community nestled along 
the scenic colorado river near the southern tip of nevada 
what once was a tiny bar and a handful of slot machines hidden at 
the end of an isolated road has been transformed into one of the 
premier growth areas in this booming gambling state 
giants of the hotelcasino industry such as holiday inn ramada 
hilton circus circus and golden nugget are clamoring to get a piece 
of the laughlin action 
the 1988 visitor count is expected to be up by onethird from the 
estimated 15 million a year ago casino revenues are forecast to 
surpass those of lake tahoe the no 3 market in the state after las 
vegas and reno in a year or two 
bolstered by balmy temperatures no vacancy signs abound 
throughout the winter months 
welcome snowbirds flashes a 20foothigh neon sign atop don 
laughlins riverside resort and casino the flagship of the 
evergrowing list of casino resorts here 
it was laughlin 57 who happened across this remote area while 
flying along the colorado river in a private plane in 1966 he 
spotted an outoftheway rundown bar and paid 225000 for the 
saloon a blackjack table a dozen slot machines and eight 
boardedup motel rooms four of which became the temporary home for 
the laughlin family 
giving the town his name wasnt laughlins idea when postal 
officials asked for a name for the patch of real estate 20 years 
ago laughlin suggested casino noting a town on nevadas northern 
border was named jackpot 
the inspector of irish descent balked at the idea and opted for 
laughlin calling it a good irish name 
for many years don laughlins motelcasino was the only game in 
town because of the remote location and competition from las vegas 
95 miles to the northwest 
the town came alive in the early 1980s with gaming revenues 
climbing to 41 million by 1981 doubling to 80 million by 1983 and 
hitting 2424 million in 1987 
lake tahoe recorded 3095 million in gaming revenues in 1987 
while reno had 5525 million and las vegas hit 2237 billion 
location plays a major role in laughlins stunning growth 
the town is about 280 miles the same distance as las vegas 
from most southern california cities the markets that feed southern 
nevadas voracious appetite for gamblers 
gaming giants sat on the sidelines for years while land 
speculators touted the area as the next las vegas 
suddenly the major players began to make their move two years 
ago when the town had 1600 hotel rooms today laughlin has 4118 
rooms at nine resorts with 3000 new rooms to be completed in the 
next 12 to 18 months 
the first major player to move here was circus circus the 
familythemed gaming empire with operations in las vegas and reno 
the company built an 80 million 1238room hotel and casino in the 
shape of a mississippi riverboat the facility with smokestacks 
soaring 21 stories high and paddlewheels 90 feet in diameter 
dominates the waterfront 
not since noah has anyone built such a big boat in the middle 
of the desert quipped bill paulos the hotels general manager 
when the company opened the facility on a blistering july 1 1987 
last june ramada set up shop across busy casino center drive 
the main drag that was a sleepy twolane street six years ago and 
now carries four lanes of cars and campers bumpertobumper around 
the clock 
the 60 million ramada express features an early americana 
railroad theme with a steam engine train toting passengers around 
the 406room hotel and casino 
harrahs the gaming arm of holiday inn opened the mexicanstyle 
del rio in july the 65 million 446room resort became the ninth 
hotelcasino in laughlin 
wynn who owns the golden nugget in downtown las vegas and is 
building a 550 million resort on the las vegas strip said laughlin 
couldnt be ignored any longer 
he bought the nevada club casino from del webb corp for 40 
million in may taking over oct 1 and announcing plans to build a 
70 million 1100room 20story hotel on the site 
add to the list of high rollers the hilton corp which announced 
in september it would build a 127 million 1200 room hotel and 
casino in laughlin with construction set to begin next year 
most workers in laughlin still commute from bullhead city ariz 
across the colorado a town built to house workers building the 
davis dam which was completed in 1953 
as for laughlin itself its population is now 3400 up from just 
94 four years ago 
the visitor count is expected to top 2 million this year 
compared with 17 million in las vegas 68 million in renosparks 
and 5 million in the lake tahoe basin 
we average 20000 visitors a day in the winter months said 
dan tucksen executive director of the laughlin chamber of commerce

the true legend of the traveling wilburys 
began when george har er nelson wilbury needed to record an 
extra song at short notice and invited two of his dinner companions 
to lend their voices 
nine days and 10 songs later the result was one of those happy 
accidents that proves theres more to the music business than 
accountants and estates 
you wont find the names george harrison bob dylan roy orbison 
tom petty and jeff lynne on volume one the debut album by the 
oddlynamed traveling wilburys but the dark glasses and pseudonyms 
cant hide those familiar talents orbison died at the age of 52 on 
dec 6 of a heart attack 
we definitely didnt want to treat this like a supergroup 
said petty or charles t wilbury jr i dont even like the term 
all that much but we were aware that it would be viewed as such we 
look at the wilburys as a completely other persona as ourselves 
harrison mentioned to lynne and orbison over dinner last spring 
that he needed a new bside for a 12inch single release the other 
two said theyd help him put together a song 
the former beatle had to retrieve his guitar which hed left at 
pettys california house during a visit a few days earlier petty 
said the lead heartbreaker was also asked to join in on the record 
since all the nearby studios were booked the three amigos had to 
impose on another friend who had recording facilities in his house 
dylan said hed be glad to offer his assistance 
we all sat around the grass at bobs house and wrote this song 
called handle with care and recorded it that night petty 
recalled when it was all done it sounded really good 
much too good they thought for a bside so they kept on 
writing and recording 
it was a very innocent thing really petty said we were 
just kind of enjoying it and we were deep into it before we realized 
almost what we were doing 
that spontaneity and a lot of humor comes through on the 
record volume one sounds like a group of friends albeit 
extremely talented friends enjoying themselves together all five 
trade lead and backing vocals and strum guitars 
the results are a cross between harrisons early 70s solo work 
and the electronic flourishes lynne brought to the electric light 
orchestra orbisons not alone any more is in the vein hes 
mined for a quartercentury and the three songs dylan dominates are 
some of his best work in years 
the song dirty world pokes fun at prince with a series of 
sexual doubleentendres and the wickedly funny tweeter and the 
monkey man is littered with bruce springsteen references 
the record was a true collaboration petty said on tweeter 
for instance he and dylan spoke lyrics into a tape recorder then 
edited them into a story other wilburys added the chorus he said 
credit a nonrocker prince charles of great britain with the 
name traveling wilburys petty said 
harrison and lynne performed at the princes trust concert last 
year and were complimented by the host following the show he said 
the prince said the two should form a band and when they asked for 
a name he suggested the traveling wilburys petty said 
the quintet quickly adopted the persona harrison is identified 
throughout as nelson wilbury lynne is otis wilbury orbison is 
lefty wilbury and dylans called lucky 
the whimsical liner notes explain that the original wilburys 
were a stationary people who realizing that their civilization 
could not stand still forever began to go for short walks 
the offbeat sense of humor seemed to take the pressure off the 
participants and lent the album a certain mystique said paul grein 
author of the chartbeat column in billboard magazine its working 
the album debuted on the charts at no 57 and shot to no 23 in its 
second week he said 
its destined to be a very big hit grein said 
the wilbury monikers also took some pressure off the businessmen 
since harrison dylan petty and orbison are all contracted to 
different record companies there are more than just joking reasons 
why all the names were left off the album jacket 
petty said the wilburys have been approached to do a tour and 
though no ones said no they havent all said yes either 
he hinted that the wilbury family tree might be larger but 
wouldnt say if a volume two is planned theres the obvious 
risk of losing the spark that made this record special 
i dont think anybody wants the wilburys to be work he said 
i would leave the door open to that we wouldnt rule it out 
because we had so much fun i think it could be done again but not 
right away 
we were all very pleased with the way it came out petty 
continued its so nice when you get the spirit into the vinyl 
thats what you strive for i hope everybody smiles when they hear 
it

predicts increasing worldwide demand for oil will push opec 
countries to full capacity and prices above 30 a barrel during the 
1990s 
but after adjusting for inflation the higher price level will 
still amount to only 60 percent to 80 percent of the peak price of

speculation that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev would offer 
dramatic peace initiatives enabling the united states to cut 
military spending energized the financial markets pushing down 
interest rates bolstering the dollar and rallying the dow jones 
industrial average for the second straight day 
traders said rumors swept the markets tuesday that gorbachev who 
flew to new york to address the united nations and confer with 
president reagan would announce a significant proposal aimed at 
letting both superpowers concentrate less on defense and more on 
economics and trade 
if so traders reasoned the united states would have more 
flexibility in finding ways to reduce its staggering budget and 
trade deficits which the markets view as a fundamental risk to the 
us economy 
the gorbachev speculation was felt primarily in the bond market 
a sensitive barometer of inflation and interest rates the 
treasurys closely watched 30year issue surged more than 20 for 
every 1000 in face value and its yield tumbled to 89 percent from 
912 percent late monday it was the largest oneday rally in about 
three months 
declining interest rates in turn made stocks a more attractive 
investment and pushed prices up sharply on wall street where the 
dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 2560 points to 214936 
that followed a 3148 point jump monday 
the sudden enthusiasm for us securities strengthened the dollar 
as well pushing it up against all major currencies 
the market rallies eclipsed the other major economic event of the 
day the wideranging talks held by the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade in montreal where deadlocked talks on farm subsidies were 
suspended with no progress reported 
there was also little movement on other contentious issues trade 
in services such as banking and insurance and protection of 
intellectual property such as copyrights patents and trademarks

federal home loan bank board chairman m danny 
wall says he believes the worst is behind the troubled savings and 
loan industry 
there are fewer unprofitable institutions than there were last 
year wall told the national council of savings institutions at an 
annual management conference tuesday 
he said that by the end of the month we will have dealt with 
the worst cases of insolvent thrifts and that with 30 billion 
more his regulatory agency could tackle the others 
but the council which represents about 500 of the more 
profitable savings banks and sampls nationwide painted a more somber 
picture of the industry tuesday they said wall might be 
underestimating the cost of removing the 511 insolvent thrifts 
nationwide 
the group says that one solution is to phase out the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp which insures desposits of up to 
100000 among the nations thrifts and is currently in red ink and 
to use taxpayer money toward the cleanup costs 
in a plan released last week and outlined again tuesday the 
council said that healthy thrifts should be transferred to the more 
stable federal deposit insurance corp the insurer of banks and 
some sampls those that failed to meet the fdics stiffer capital 
requirements would have five years to become healthy or shut down 
that was the opposite of recommendations made last week by the 
largest sampl trade group the us league of savings institutions 
which advocated preserving the current system 
many members of the league though are not healthy enough to 
join the fdic which has substantially lower premiums while about 
twothirds of the councils members already are insured by that 
agency no thrifts can switch to the fdic now anyway because of a 
moratorium imposed by congress 
fdic chairman l william seidman was unavailable for comment 
tuesday however the american bankers association the largest bank 
trade group criticized the councils proposal saying the group 
wants to have its cake and eat it too they want to leave the 
problems of their industry behind 
the national council of savings institutions did not provide any 
estimates for reaching its goals although some members indicated it 
would cost more than the 30 billion figure suggested by wall 
we think the problem is bigger than that said keith g 
willoughby chief executive officer of first mutual of boston 
charles john koch head of the first federal savings bank in 
cleveland and council chairman said if thats the number that 
solves the problem great but its really immaterial the cost is 
clearly in excess of what the industry can pay by itself 
estimates for dealing with the quarter of the 3200 federally 
insured sampls that are considered at or near insolvency lately have 
ranged from 50 billion to 100 billion 
wall said that while shaky thrifts continue to drag down the 
industry the vast majority of all sampls are profitable because more 
and more troubled thrifts have been restructured or merged with 
healthy institutions 
he said that industrywide net losses totaled 15 billion in the 
third quarter down from 38 billion in the second quarter and 39 
billion in the first quarter 
at the same time the amount of federal income tax paid out by 
the profitable thrifts has risen to 573 million in the third 
quarter from 547 million in the second quarter and 490 million in 
the first 
wall said that at the start of this year the bank board which 
regulates federally insured sampls predicted 52 thrifts would be 
restructured this year but in fact about 200 have been

the whiff of wall street may be enticing to 
reformminded soviet leader mikhail gorbachev but hes way behind 
his chinese communist rivals a trio from the peoples republic has 
been training in the heart of highstakes capitalism for two months 
the interns from the peoples bank of china are guests of the 
nations largest stock exchange sent as part of a cooperation pact 
signed two years ago enabling the chinese to study how a 
sophisticated securities market works 
the peking government began tolerating limited stock and bond 
trading in 1985 after a 35year ban on what was considered immoral 
speculation that benefited the rich the official position now is 
that buying and selling securities play a useful role in the 
countrys modernization 
were only in the very beginning said zhang zhiping 32 a 
senior official in the peoples banks financial control department 
the rough equivalent of the securities and exchange commission 
because it regulates where and what type of securities can be sold 
we have to develop trading firms and brokers skilled 
professionals zhang said we have to educate the people on what 
is a stock we have to develop companies that issue securities we 
have to change all the systems 
in china if you want to do something it takes a long time 
he said you cant build rome in a day 
zhang and his two colleagues duan jining 28 and han jianjun 
33 spoke highly of their experience in the heart of the wall street 
jungle where just in the past few months they have witnessed some 
of the biggest corporate takeover brawls in history the 1year 
anniversary of the black monday crash and the normal barrage of 
market gossip that traders thrive on 
we dont have such takeover business in china said han an 
executive in the peoples bank branch on southern hainan island a 
special zone for foreign trade and investment the government 
tells one company to buy another company bankers dont play much of 
a role 
although primitive overthecounter markets for trading 
companyissued securities have been allowed in about 70 chinese 
cities there is no structure and few laws governing how they 
operate the three bankers said 
nevertheless china is much more advanced in securities trading 
than the soviet union the other communist superpower where talk of 
establishing stock and bond markets is still in its infancy 
that raised speculation that gorbachevs itinerary might include 
a lastminute stopover at the nyse during his new york visit 
although big board officials said no trip was planned as of late 
tuesday 
the chinese interns have spent much of their visit at the nyse 
where they talk to floor traders market makers surveillance 
officials and market economists they also have spent time on the 
trading floors at first boston corp shearson lehman hutton inc 
and merrill lynch amp co 
when they go home later this month they will drag a few file 
cabinets worth of training manuals and textbooks with them on 
topics that range from stockindex futures to insider trading 
i didnt know much about stocks and capital markets its very 
useful said ms duan a researcher in the peoples banks 
international department 
of particular interest to her she said were the 
investorprotection safeguards in us securities laws 
the emphasis here is more on the buyers side she said in 
china the emphasis is more on the sellers side 
if the billions of dollars that change hands on wall street is 
staggering to most americans it is even more so for the three 
visitors who could not afford new yorks cost of living unless they 
stayed at an nyseleased apartment still they are considered 
highly paid in their home country 
zhang said he makes about 250 chinese yuan a month or about 
9250 at current exchange rates lunch for two at windows on the 
world in downtown manhattan duan and han said they earn about 150 
yuan a month or 5550 one ticket each to a broadway show 
the government takes more care of you in china but its still 
not so good han said the people dont have enthusiasm when 
they get the same pay no matter how hard they work 
the chinese interns said that despite the awesome problems of 
establishing a rational securities trading system in their country 
they were confident it could work eventually but probably would not 
resemble the us system 
we shouldnt take an example and exactly duplicate it said 
zhang

the days of lower oil prices will end by 1992 and 
the coming decade will be marked by higher prices that will slow 
economic growth in the united states a study by two economists at 
the federal reserve bank of dallas says 
stephen brown and keith phillips contend that falling demand for 
oil in the 1980s has had more to do with the collapse in oil prices 
than the disarray in the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
and they say in a study to be published next month that growing 
demand in the 1990s will push opec countries to full capacity and 
prices above 30 a barrel 
people planning on building big cars in the next decade may be 
headed in the wrong direction brown said in an interview but 
it wont be as bad as the the 70s where we saw sharp price 
increases that really nailed the economy 
the economists said however that those in the currently 
depressed oil business shouldnt begin dancing in the streets 
after adjusting for inflation the higher price level will still 
amount to only 60 percent to 80 percent of the peak price of oil 
reached in 1981 they said 
by 1992 oil prices should begin rising and by the year 2000 
oil prices will reach 35 to 40 a barrel or more than double the 
current level they predict 
i really dont think well see a return to the boom times of 
1981 in the oil industry brown said but we should see some 
increases as early as 92 barring opec action and definitely by 
95 by 1995 the price will have to be in the neighborhood of 25 
a barrel because of the demand 
in the united states alone brown and phillips said oil 
consumption will increase between 21 percent and 95 percent 
annually 
current price levels encourage consumption and discourage the 
development of alternative resources or conservation efforts in the 
next decade the growth of world economies will continue to spur 
demand and pressure prices higher the economists suggest 
under nearly all of our scenarios the growth in oil 
consumption pushes opec close to full capacity between late 1992 and 
early 1995 said the study which will be published in january in 
the feds regional economic review as opec nears full capacity 
prices are likely to rise sharply 
the study assumes no major disruptions in oil production or 
artificial pushes such as a resumption of the iraniraq war or a 
sharp increase in taxes on oil 
rising oil prices will strengthen economic growth in 
energyexporting countries while hindering economic growth in 
energyimporting countries like the united states the study says 
and as in the past the effects will cut unevenly through this 
country 
energyproducing regions like texas and louisiana will benefit 
while energyconsuming areas like the northeast will suffer 
currently production of oil exceeds worldwide demand thus 
triggering the fall in prices to between 15 and 16 a barrel last 
month opec agreed to try to limit its production and bolster oil 
prices but the cartels past attempts at output restraint have 
failed

itt corp has received a 200000 federal fine for 
treating air force officials to golf games sports and theater 
tickets and meals to obtain confidential government information used 
to bid on 180 million in military contracts 
us district judge david s nelson handed down the fine tuesday 
to the new yorkbased conglomerate which pleaded guilty in october 
to one count of conspiring to defraud the government itt had faced 
a maximum possible fine of 500000 
itt admitted that an employee in its defense technology division 
in 1984 and early 1985 spent about 15000 and was reimbursed for 
illegal gifts to air force officials at hanscom air force base in 
bedford mass 
in exchange itt received copies of internal government documents 
with confidential procurement information on two air force programs 
itt was interested in purchasing 
it was a plea bargain situation itt spokesman james 
gallagher said we agreed to plead guilty to one charge of fraud 
the government agreed to drop three other charges 
itt was indicted in june 1987 several months before a separate 
federal investigation into the use of consultants by corporations to 
get information for use in bidding on contracts 
edward m vincenzi a senior marketing representative of itts 
van nuys califbased gilfillan subsidiary which specializes in 
radar technology pleaded guilty to the same charge 
he received a 1year suspended sentence and was placed on 
probation for one year vincenzi who cooperated with federal 
authorities had faced up to 35 years in prison and a 500000 fine 
federal prosecutors charged that itt gilfillan executives tacitly 
approved of attempts by vincenzi to defraud the government and later 
tried to cover up his activities by destroying or concealing air 
force documents 
according to the indictment in the case vincenzi was hired in 
1983 to pursue two air force contracts an antiradiation missile 
decoy system valued at more than 80 million and a mobile air 
traffic control radar system worth between 100 million and 150 
million 
his job was to get inside information on the programs including 
air force plans specifications procurement strategy and projected 
costs the indictment said 
four government employees at the air forces electronics systems 
division at hanscom who received gratuities from vincenzi gave him 
copies of documents with information on the contracts as well as 
general planning and funding documents

a preliminary 64 million development contract for the missile 
decoy system which was never built

15000 the government said

the chickens sold in the soviet union are so 
scrawny that shoppers joke the poultry is starved to death rather 
than slaughtered and even frank perdue says he cant help until the 
emaciated birds are fed better 
perdue who picked over the poultry during a visit to moscows 
famous gum department store on red square last week politely 
referred to the chickens he saw as lean and narrowbreasted 
the chickens lack protein concluded perdue chairman and 
chief promoter of perdue farms inc the united states 
fourthlargest poultry producer 
soviet chickens make do with 15 percent corn feed plus wheat and 
barley while perdue says he feeds his birds on a diet of nearly 60 
percent corn 
their diet isnt likely to improve soon since both corn and high 
protein soybeans require a warmer climate than found in most of the 
soviet union said donald w mabe president and chief executive of 
perdue farms 
they could buy corn on the world market but what could they 
use to pay for it he asked all their vodka is taken up by 
pepsi cola 
mabe was referring to the obstacle facing western companies the 
fact that soviet rubles are not convertible on the world market 
thus forcing most firms to barter one commodity for another 
the soviets have few goods to sell and pepsi cola sewed up world 
demand for its vodka 15 years ago with a deal that sends soft drink 
syrup to the soviet union in exchange for stolichnaya vodka 
still a visit to a market makes it clear the soviet union could 
use perdues help soviet chickens are so tough that few will bake 
them 
one solution by local cooks is impaling the chicken on a glass 
milk bottle filled with water the bird and bottle are balanced in 
the oven and the chicken is steamed from the inside out while it 
bakes the recipe is called chicken on a bottle 
perdue said chickens could be the answer to the soviet unions 
perennial food shortage as the birds require only two pounds of 
feed to produce a pound of meat twice as efficient as hogs and 
more than three times as efficient as producing beef 
perdue along with his father built the company from a few dozen 
chickens into an operation with sales of 964 million in 198687 
that distributes poultry products along the east coast from maine to 
north carolina at age 67 he stepped down last summer as chief 
executive with mabe taking over that job 
perdue and mabe visited the national poultry breeding institute 
north of moscow in ptitsagrad or poultry city 
they found that soviet breeding methods were quite advanced 
wrapped in orange nylon capes and booties to prevent the spread 
of infection they found the barns barely lighted but cleaner than 
the average soviet street 
they even picked up a few ideas for their own operations they 
discovered that the soviets ration water to the birds slowing their 
digestion and resulting in more chicken for less feed 
however the soviets scientific expertise seldom is followed at 
the mass production level 
some chicks are fed rotten fruits and vegetables from local 
produce packagers and processing consists of stuffing plastic bags 
with whole hens that often are not quite plucked or gutted 
the hens at gum contrasted starkly with the packages of 
barbecued chicken breasts precooked chicken nuggets and fillets 
that perdue brought along from the united states and gave to his 
hosts 
perdue and mabe indicated that if a business deal results from 
their trip it likely would be a sale of perduedesigned equipment 
to handle the cleaning cutting and filleting that is largely 
ignored in the soviet union

the day on the new york stock exchange 
i think its a lot to do about nothing said steel analyst 
charles bradford at the investment firm merrill lynch amp co one 
thing is pretty clear that icahns postion at usx although it 
looks better today than it did yesterday isnt one of his better 
investments 
bradford said icahn bought the stock at 23 or 24 per share 
icahn will have a year from nov 25 to buy additional stock 
without reapplying for ftc permission ticknor said 
andrew gray an oil analyst for the investment firm donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette icahn now has more flexibility or apparent 
flexibility than he had before this release 
but icahn has shown little inclination to move against the 
company since acquiring his shares and threatening in october 1986 
to make a tender offer for usx 
he showed an extreme amount of patience i never really 
believed it would go this long its over two years gray said 
since icahn appeared on the scene usx has announced plans to 
sell its transportation division and certain real estate but has 
not unveiled any major corporate restructuring to fend off an 
unwanted takeover attempt 
i dont think thats what people are looking for gray said 
were looking for bigger things if you look at usx stock in the 
energy group its probably been one of the worst performers in 
1988 
higher crude oil prices and renewed profitability at usxs steel 
division could make the stock attractive to investors and the 
companymandated retirement of chairman david roderick in may could 
be misinterpreted as a chink in usxs armor gray said 
in addition icahn could raise additional money if texaco inc 
follows through on suggestions it will reward shareholders in the 
first quarter he said

hour of trading 
expectations of higher prices in the market were really strong 
as the index approached the 30000point mark said a dealer at 
daiwa securities 
market players seemed to be buying issues simply in order to 
achieve a 30000point nikkei said another trader with a major 
securities firm 
i knew the index would make the 30000point mark sooner or 
later but its gain at the last moment was just amazing said the 
trader who spoke on condition of anonymity 
an analyst at nomura securities said the nikkeis big gain in 
tokyo followed an overnight rise in the dow jones industrial average 
in new york 
traders speculated that the reagangorbachev talks might lead 
to arms reduction and they thought a cut in arms spending would 
reduce us deficits he said 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev is visiting the united states 
where he will meet president reagan and address the un general 
assembly 
market participants were also encouraged by tuesdays 
announcement that japans gross national product jumped 93 percent 
on an annual basis during the july to september quarter after a 33 
percent annual rate contraction in the april to june quarter the 
analyst said 
the measure of the value of the nations goods and services rose 
22 percent over the previous quarter 
on the foreign exchange market investors bought dollars 
following the currencys overnight rise on wall street dealers said 
the dollars strength in new york was believed to be largely due 
to expectations that the united states and soviet union would reach 
an agreement on reducing conventional military forces

has eased because of the ussoviet talks said takamasa yamasaki 
of daiwa bank 
the dollar is no longer bearish many speculative investors

trading companies yamasaki said 
the dollar was also helped by speculation that the us budget 
deficit would shrink if the united states cuts military spending 
said a dealer at the bank of tokyo speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
michael boskin chief economic adviser to presidentelect george 
bush reportedly said bush will take strong action on the deficit 
on the spending side of the budget

of 26646 points marked on oct 14 1987 while the dow jones 
industrial average on the new york stock exchange is struggling to 
regain crash losses more than 13 months after black monday 
despite optimistic prospects cautious analysts warned share 
prices are way beyond the markets own energy and expressed concern 
about a possible plunge 
what goes up is destined to come down some time said josen 
takahashi a chief analyst at mitsubishi research institute a noted 
think tank in tokyo 
he said the current market strength is caused by a huge sum of 
funds poured into stocks by land speculators looking for new targets 
of investment after land prices peaked last year 
once the funds were withdrawn from the market he said stocks 
could suffer a major setback

authorities have launched a fullscale investigation 
of two trading firms alleged to have illegally exported sensitive 
chemical solutions to the soviet union trade ministry officials 
said wednesday 
the ministry of international trade and industry said daikin 
industries an osakabased air conditioner manufacturer and tokyo 
boeki a small trading house exported 860 tons of highdensity 
halogenated hydrocarbon to the soviet union in 1986 and 1987 without 
ministry permission 
exporting such a solution in concentrated form to the soviet 
union or other communist nations is prohibited under japanese export 
control laws and international agreements among western members of 
the coordinating committee on multilateral export control or cocom 
cocom is an international watchdog body regulating the flow of 
high technology products from western nations to the communist bloc 
the body however does not directly intervene in members trade 
practices nor impose penalities against violators 
in an earlier case toshiba machine co was accused of selling 
sophisticated milling equipment to the soviet union in 1986 also in 
violation of cocom regulations 
the toshiba incident led to tough criticism from the united 
states which claimed the equipment helped the soviets build 
quieter harder to detect submarines washington later slapped 
severe sanctions on toshiba machine and prohibited the company from 
exporting to the united states for three years beginning in 1988 
in the wake of the toshiba machine incident in 1986 the trade 
ministry strengthened its export control sections last year the 
trade ministry implicated three traders for illegally exporting 
hightech digital equipment to china 
the osaka prefectural police notified by the trade ministry 
searched daikin and tokyo boeki offices wednesday morning 
the ministry filed charges with osaka police against the company 
for violating the foreign exchange law by exporting the chemical 
known as halon2402 with a purity of more than 998 percent by 
declaring it to be of lower purity 
daikin executive noriyuki inoue said at a hastily called news 
conference that the company did not deliberately export any illegal 
products 
it was the result of our deficient management and we promise 
we will never repeat the same mistake he said 
halon2402 is 9995 percent pure when it is produced and it had 
to be diluted with other chemicals to meet cocom regulations he 
said 
daikin which had been exporting halon2402 to the soviet union 
for use in fire extinguishers on fishing boats since 1979 said it 
has exported about 900 tons of halon2402 for about 328 million in 
198687 through tokyo boeki 
daikin stopped exporting the chemical in august when it found 
the product violated cocom regulations the daikin official said he 
said daikin would discontinue producing halon2402 
analysts said the trade ministrys action indicated its 
determination to strictly clamp down on illegal exports of sensitive 
goods to the communist nation 
i take it as something like a hello call to presidentelect 
bush said kazuhisa ogawa a defense analyst and noted author on 
usjapan military relations 
halogenated hydrocarbon is a fluoric compound commonly used in 
fire extinguishers but it can also be used as a coolant for guided 
missiles ogawa said 
ogawa said the timing of the trade ministrys action ahead of a 
visit by soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze stresses 
japans loyalty to the united states shevardnadze is scheduled to 
visit tokyo on dec 19 for talks with prime minister noboru 
takeshita and foreign minister sousuke uno

westinghouse electric corp said wednesday it 
has agreed to sell its unimation robot and automation business to 
staubli international ag of zurich switzerland 
westinghouse acquired unimation for 107 million in 1983 
unimation had been the nations largest maker of industrial robots 
with headquarters in danbury conn and several hundred employees 
staubli international is a privately owned manufacturer of 
programmable mechanisms for the textile industry and its robotics 
division makes a line of material handling systems 
westinghouse spokesman jay mccaffrey confirmed the sale but 
withheld details saying it had agreed with staubli not to announce 
the deal until thursday the pittsburgh press said wednesday that 
the sale was announced tuesday to westinghouse employees 
unimation installed the worlds first industrial robot in 1961 
and in 1983 its share of that market was estimated at 40 percent 
with sales of more than 71 million 
more than 50 competitors entered the field by 1982 looking for a 
share of a market that some analysts had predicted would grow to 2 
billion in annual sales by 1992 the failure of those predictions 
led to a number of firms being sold or closed 
just after westinghouse acquired unimation the market shifted to 
electrically powered robots from the hydraulic models built by 
unimation the company responded to the switch but lost business to 
a joint venture formed in 1982 by general motors corp and fanuc 
ltd of japan

what should you do with those odd socks that drive 
you mad you know the leftover halves of pairs that have vanished 
inexplicably in the laundry 
you should dispose of them and buy a new pair says 
32yearold sock magnate sophie mirman they are absolutely not a 
trend that will catch on 
the anglofrench ms mirman has more than a passing interest in 
the matter she is chairman and cofounder of sock shop 
international plc a chain of specialty stores that sell socks of 
almost every sort 
they come in one shape but sock shop offers them in many sizes 
and colors and patterns lots of patterns 
ms mirman got the idea for sock shops when she trudged around 
london about six years ago looking for a pair of creamcolored 
tights to match an outfit 
i went to every single department store to find them it seemed 
like a very inefficient way to buy an everyday necessity she 
recalled 
ms mirman and her business partner richard ross opened their 
first sock shop in the knightsbridge subway station right near 
harrods department store in april 1983 
married in 1984 the couple now oversee a growing empire of 110 
sock shops they have expanded into france belgium and the the 
united states with 12 sock shops in new york city and more opening 
in east coast shopping malls 
she is a prime example of the growing number of selfstarting 
entrepreneurs who have blossomed in the capitalist revolution prime 
minister margaret thatcher has brought to britain 
her company has gone public and last year added the governments 
company of the year award to a growing array of prizes her shops 
in black red and white design have become part of the london 
cityscape 
ms mirman is short and pale with cropped brown hair redrimmed 
glasses and a quick wit beneath a subdued manner 
she is the only child of french parents who eloped because their 
own parents disapproved of the match and arrived in england in the 
1940s speaking no english 
her mother simone mirman is a royal milliner and her late 
father was an executive for christian dior in britain 
ms mirman was educated at the french lycee in london and went on 
to do a bilingual secretarial course because it was socially 
acceptable it seemed the thing to do 
she then joined marks and spencer plc a leading british retailer 
where even mrs thatcher shops and which is fondly known by its 
rhyming cockney nickname marks and sparks 
but as she puts it dryly i didnt find the typing pool 
particularly stimulating 
she became secretary to lord sieff then chairman of marks and 
spencer and displayed her chutzpah 
i told him categorically i would become the first woman 
director of marks and spencer and he didnt laugh ms mirman 
said 
sieff encouraged the young woman to enter the companys 
management training program and she worked in several of the chains 
stores including the paris branch 
eventually ms mirman became restless and looked for something 
new in 1981 she found a job with tie rack a chain of tie shops 
where she became managing director within three months 
but after two years she said i decided if i was going to work 
so hard i might as well work for myself 
ms mirman and ross who was finance director of tie rack needed 
45000 pounds about 82000 for their enterprise and approached a 
number of venture capitalists offering them a 49 percent stake 
nobody was interested but today ms mirman is grateful the 
stake is now worth about 55 million 
we thank all those people she said 
ms mirman and ross opened that first knightsbridge shop with a 
governmentguaranteed loan and about 2000 each of their own money 
six months later they opened another shop in london 
we had no ideas of grandeur in those first days in our wildest 
dreams we thought we might have five or six shops ms mirman said 
an early franchising experiment failed so the couple decided to 
operate all its shops alone 
we found it very difficult to control the quality standards 
in franchises ms mirman said we prefer to expand perhaps more 
slowly but fully in control of the operations 
the company grew quite quickly in britain then elsewhere in 
europe and ms mirman set her sights further afield 
america held a great fascination for us she said partly 
because women had this strange habit of wearing their socks over 
their pantyhose 
she was referring to the practice of women wearing socks and 
sneakers over stockings while they travel to and from work 
the idea of double sales was too good to miss she said 
jokingly 
sock shop went public in march 1987 selling 46 million worth 
of shares on the london stock exchanges unlisted securities market 
a secondary market designed for smaller companies 
the stock which was offered at about 2 per share doubled on 
its first day of trading and is now hovering at about the same 
level ms mirman and ross retain an 80 percent holding 
the company which employs 750 people had net profit of 18 
million on revenue of 26 million in the year ended september 1987 
the 1988 results will be reported in january 
at its south london headquarters the atmosphere is informal 
crowded and cluttered 
we try to have a very open company the ideas come through 
discussion ms mirman said marketing decisions are based on gut 
feeling she said 
she has abandoned her ambition of becoming marks and sparks 
first female director and sieff has become a director on her own 
board 
ms mirman and ross have a 26monthold daughter and a 
9monthold son and a very good nanny the family lives in 
london and ms mirman squeezes in skiing and tennis when she can 
we have a rule when were away from the business not to talk 
about sock shop ms mirman said but its impossible 
envisioning more than 1000 sock shops in her future ms mirman 
said theres a long way to go yet with socks

china is moving its fledgling auto industry into 
overdrive thanks to the influx of foreign money and technology but 
the goal of challenging other world leaders in the industry is still 
a long way off 
this year china will make up to 560000 vehicles all trucks and 
buses except for 30000 passenger cars by the year 2000 passenger 
car output is expected to jump from 700000 to 1 million 
by contrast more than 15 million cars and light trucks were sold 
in the united states in the 1988 model year 
the increase in chinese production will come about almost 
entirely through joint ventures with foreign automakers with the 
focus on three production bases in the northeast city of 
changchun shanghai and central chinas hubei province 
the challenge of satisfying the groe committed to using more local 
parts but 
localization is generally only around 2530 percent because of 
difficulty in finding chinese suppliers with quality goods 
michel de riviere deputy manager of the commercial division of 
guangzhou canton peugeot automobile said local content of only 6 
percent in his plant is one reason their small station wagons have a 
price tag of 20000 equivalent to more than 60 years of a chinese 
workers annual pay they hope local parts will reach 20 percent 
next year he said 
riviere said it takes five chinese workers to do the job of one 
in most foreign factories because of low technology levels 
the workers are bright and capable he said but the industry 
is still in a very early stage 
chen acknowledged that the industry which employs 15 million 
people probably has the lowest productivity rate in the world 
chen said china which now sells about 30 million in the 40 
billionayear world autocomponent market hopes to export more 
parts and eventually plans to sell some vehicles abroad 
but he stressed the main purpose of entering overseas markets 
will be to raise chinas competitive levels in cost service and 
quality 
chrysler chairman iacocca during an october visit agreed that 
improved quality is a must for the chinese industry he said he told 
his chinese partners you must get quality up quality comes up 
productivity comes up costs go down and the world will recognize 
you as an exporter if you dont do that you cant play

as mikhail s gorbachev maneuvers between 
conservatives and radicals to shake up the soviet government and 
economy chinas reform experience can serve as both an 
encouragement and a warning to him 
free markets private enterprise and incentives have tremendously 
stimulated chinas backward economy and for the most part ended food 
shortages also goals of president gorbachev 
but a decade into its economic reforms china faces its worst 
inflation in 30 years irrational growth patterns provinces and 
cities that ignore central directives and rampant black marketeering 
chinese leaders say they are at a turning point and that only if 
these problems are overcome can they proceed with more advanced 
reforms in prices wages and other areas 
although china and the soviet union have many differences 
experts from both countries say the chinese experience can yield 
lessons for gorbachev 
it is impossible for them the soviets to avoid all mistakes 
they can only hope to make fewer mistakes than china said liu 
qingjian an economist at chinas institute of soviet and east 
european studies 
china began its reforms in 1978 when the thricepurged 
revolutionary veteran deng xiaoping gained control of the communist 
party following the death in 1976 of chairman mao tsetung 
deng focused on reorganizing the economy breaking up communes 
in favor of family farming 
only in 1987 did china begin systematic government reorganization 
and make limited concessions to democracy such as multicandidate 
balloting in partycontrolled elections political discussion 
remained tightly limited 
gorbachev who rose to power on the death of soviet leader 
konstantin chernenko in 1985 took the opposite approach unlike 
china where the political and economic chaos of the 196676 
cultural revolution left many people open to change the soviet 
union presented him with a suspicious public as well as strong 
political opposition 
gorbachevs method has been to open soviet society to 
unprecedented frank criticism of the status quo while proposing 
constitutional changes in the presidency and parliament that would 
strengthen his hand against opponents 
but soviet experts at chinas institute of soviet and east 
european studies maintained in recent interviews that gorbachevs 
glasnost or openness has succeeded in enthusing only a handful of 
intellectuals 
to win over ordinary soviets they said gorbachev must take a 
leaf from dengs book and offer tangible benefits 
most of gorbachevs economic proposals including leasing farm 
land ton said 
economist liu 
free markets at the heart of chinas new prosperity are 
smallscale and expensive for consumers in the soviet union 
a shopper in a typical chinese city can choose from dozens of 
small vendors private and staterun in buying a wide array of 
fresh fruit and vegetables soviet shoppers often wait in long lines 
for scant selections 
if gorbachev cannot improve the wellbeing of the soviet people 
his position and his reforms will be weakened said political 
scientist zhu ruizhen 
deng tackled his reforms in one area at a time he waited until 
the breakup of communes had been justified by several good harvests 
before making changes in the industrial sector 
but anton vassiliev an economist and first secretary at the 
soviet embassy in beijing said this piecemeal approach has caused 
many of chinas current economic problems 
this is perhaps one of the important exssiliev said 
for example chinese factory owners buy most of their raw 
materials at prices set by supply and demand but face state 
ceilings when they sell their products they have authority to hire 
and fire but only the most rudimentary of labor markets exists 
dozens of chinese provincial and city governments have been 
authorized to borrow money for capital construction projects but 
bankers have no corresponding power to regulate credit 
market confusion flourishing black markets and steadily rising 
inflation now officially pegged at 26 percent are among the 
results 
vassiliev said moscow has put greater emphasis on planning 
coordinated change in various sectors 
china also offers a lesson in the dangers of decentralizing too 
much he said 
cities and provinces given special economic autonomy have 
developed rapidly but they also have duplicated projects 
unnecessarily and competed for scarce raw materials fueling 
inflation 
when chinese leaders this fall ordered a slowdown to curb 
inflation many local governments ignored the order 
in agriculture too china may have decentralized too much 
family farming has been popular but it has hampered the introduction 
of machines and hightech methods needed to increase yields 
the soviet union has no comparable special economic zones 
although some economists have proposed them however gorbachev has 
already witnessed reforms splintering effects as nationalists in 
the soviet baltic states have taken advantage of glasnost to press 
for political autonomy 
chinas soviet experts said the turmoil created by gorbachevs 
political restructuring reveals a volatility in the soviet 
population that may make later economic reforms much more difficult 
than in china 
the chinese people are more obedient said political 
scientist wang qi if the soviet union were experiencing the 
economic problems china has now there would be riots 
both countries have a stake in each others reforms 
chinese intellectuals hope that if gorbachevs political reforms 
work it will give a push to promoters of glasnost in china 
if chinas economic programs succeed said vassiliev it will 
generally show that socialism does have potential for development 
and that the problems that exist now in soviet society can be 
solved

sears roebuck and co says it has extended 
billions of dollars of additional credit to 10 million sears 
chargecard holders in hopes of boosting holiday sales and clearing 
out inventory 
the aggressive move by the nations largest retailer comes amid 
pricecutting by many merchants to spur sales for the important 
christmas selling season 
sears said tuesday that in the past month it has notified 10 
million cardholders or 40 percent of all active searscharge 
accounts that their credit limits had been raised by an average of 
50 percent 
the customers were chosen because they were deemed both 
creditworthy and likely to use the extra credit sears said 
the company said it also lengthened the repayment period for 
those accounts to 36 months from 30 months thereby reducing minimum 
monthly payments by at least 20 percent 
sears had 13 billion in loans outstanding to its store card 
holders or an average of about 515 an account at the end of 1987 
although sears made the move to enable customers to have more 
purchasing power at sears stores in the holidays the extra credit 
is permanent and not just available during the holiday season the 
company said

donald p kelly former chairman of beatrice co 
and a nearlegendary dealmaker has formed a new limited partnership 
designed to acquire businesses that can be bought for as much as 1 
billion 
the investment firm salomon inc will be a permanent partner to 
dp kelly amp associates arranging financing and finding investors 
for kellys new pursuits kelly said tuesday 
we provide the managerial skills kelly said we dont have 
to worry about where were going to get the equity they salomon 
find it we arent involved with all the transactions theyll 
do but theyll be involved with everything we do 
kelly said he wants to start another conglomerate from scratch 
as he did with swift meats in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
he renamed the company esmark as it acquired and sold off 
companies ranging from personal care to industrial products to food 
and automotive products 
esmark was acquired by chicagobased beatrice in 1984 
less than two years later kelly acquired beatrice in a 62 
billion leveraged buyout backed by a new york investment firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
the deal the largest of its kind at the time was financed by 
selling off almost all of the food conglomerates businesses 
kelly said he left beatrice because he ran out of things to do 
there were no major acquisitions or dispositions to do and for 
them to pay me the kind of money they were to sit in my office was 
ridiculous he said 
kohlberg kravis recently acquired rjr nabisco in a 25 billion 
leveraged buyout 
kelly said his plans are much more modest but that kelly amp 
associates might be interested in smaller businesses rjr may spin 
off after that sale is completed 
we now happen to believe there are areas below the multibillion 
deal where we can build a company not too dissimilar to what esmark 
did and not too dissimilar to what beatrice was kelly said 
i would say were looking for acquisitions in the 50 million 
to 500 million range without any problem but were probably skewed 
more toward the 1 billion deal 
kelly 66 retired as beatrices chairman in august though he 
still sits on the board of directors 
he has worked on deals with salomon for 25 years but said the 
new partnership is not going to be a single transaction type of 
relationship like his reportedly stormy one with kohlberg kravis 
at beatrice

car and truck sales in the european 
economic community are likely to hit a record high this year but 
sales might dip in 1989 an auto industry group said wednesday 
president of the liaison committee of the eec motor vehicle 
manufacturing industry gregorio rampa told reporters new car sales 
would probably exceed 117 million in 1988 about 4 percent more 
than last year 
it marked the fourth year in a row demand had increased in the 
12nation trade bloc 
demand was likely to remain relatively strong in 1989 and 1990 
although sales might be lower than in 1988 rampa said 
automakers increased production in 1988 as a result of the strong 
demand in europe while imports remained at about 1987 levels 
japanese manufacturers accounted for around 10 percent of the eec 
market for cars and trucks he said 
the clca represents national associations of vehicle makers in 
spain italy france belgium the netherlands britain and west 
germany the seven eec countries that have vehicle manufacturing 
plants 
rampa said profitability of eec manufacturers was 
satisfactory in 1988 and all major european manufacturers likely 
would make a profit 
but he said debts of some automakers remained high and all 
manufacturers would have to continue investing heavily in order 
to improve international competitiveness

michael boskin the conservative economist who 
will be the chief economic adviser to the bush administration is a 
longtime proponent of farreaching changes in social security and 
other benefit programs that boskin labels welfare for the 
wealthy 
in a book last year boskin wrote that president reagans 
successor can control spending only by a major attack on 
middleclass entitlementse for the wealthy simply can no longer be afforded 
boskin wrote in reagan 
welfarand the economy the successes failures 
and unfinished agenda 
more costconscious spending on these programs will 
preserve benefits for the needy argued boskin named by 
presidentelect george bush on tuesday as chairman of the council of 
economic advisers 
the 43yearold stanford university economics professor is 
certain to be questioned closely about his views on the politically 
sensitive subject of social security during his confirmation 
hearings before the senate banking committee 
boskin in his book cited social security the medicare program 
that pays the medical bills of the elderly and farm subsidies as 
prime targets for cuts 
these programs are hard to curtail precisely beending curbs without 
any higher taxes 
critics have derisively referred to the proposal as a flexible 
fraud but bush has been insistent that he will not raise taxes to 
curb the deficit 
under the flexible freeze plan overall government spending would 
be allowed to grow only at the rate of inflation some programs 
would face sharper cuts to provide money to allow others to grow at 
a faster pace 
in his book last year and in a 1986 book too many promises 
boskin offered far different advice about social security urging a 
sharp curtailment in real growth of future benefits especially for 
higher income retirees 
while boskin has been a prominent critic of the existing social 
security program for more than a decade he parts company with 
conservatives who favor turning the system over to private auspices 
instead boskin has proposed creating a twotiered pension system 
and additional incentives for more private savings for retirement 
in the first tier everyone would receive monthly checks at 
retirement based on a dollarfordollar return on their social 
security payroll taxes and the taxes paid by their employers the 
benefit formula which now provides a proportionally bigger return 
for lowincome workers would be the same for all 
there would be no spouses benefit but husbands and wives would 
share earnings credits equally 
the second tier would be a welfare program for the elderly poor 
financed from general revenues instead of the payroll tax 
boskin credits social security as a major contributor to the 
relief of economic distress and hardship among the elderly but he 
criticized the program for channeling funds to those who could by 
no means be considered needy paid out of taxes partially levied on 
low and middleincome people 
in his review of reagans record on the economy boskin called 
the string of huge budget deficits the major flaw in the reagan 
program 
he wrote that the next administration will need to control 
spending by tackling not only social security but also medicare 
benefits for higherincome people farm subsidies and government 
loans to students and others 
while bush has vowed to leave social security untouched his 
choice as budget director richard darman already has indicated 
that the new administration will be looking for budget savings in 
medicare 
without changes medicare is projected to cost the federal 
government 977 billion in fiscal 1990 which begins next october 
that is a 145 percent increase from the current fiscal year 
reflecting growth that is almost four times faster than the expected 
inflation rate

the stronger prices were not supported by sufficient buying activity 
but the london market rallied again off its lows at late 
afternoon lifted by the news that gorbachev proposed a substantial 
cut in soviet conventional armed forces 
gorbachevs proposals triggered a rise in the dollar but only a 
slight advance on wall street as players focused on the 
implications for the us budget deficit 
the new bush administration should find it easier to cut defense

ministers from the united states and europe raced 
toward a deadline in trade talks wednesday as delegates from the 
third world appealed to them for statesmanship to break a deadlock 
over farm supports 
the united states and the 12nation european ecoomic community 
have been deadlocked for the past four days of ministerial trade 
talks and mediation efforts thus far have failed to break the logjam 
ricardo zerbino chairman of the uruguay round of trade talks 
held informal contacts with the two sides and drafted proposal 
papers he also convened delegation heads from more than 90 
countries late tuesday and expressed his concern about the lack of 
progress in the talks 
the eecus dispute revolves around a demand by the united 
states that all 96 member states of the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade eliminate their subsidies for farmers 
the eec with a much larger rural population and strong farm 
lobbies is only willing to reduce the subsidies but not to cancel 
them 
adopting a proven tactic to generate progress on their last 
scheduled day of talks both sides announced their delegation heads 
would leave montreal by midday thursday 
it always works they sit up all night and get an agreement 
said one veteran observer of international negotiations 
canadian minister of international trade john crosbie told 
reporters late tuesday that after four days of talks no one has 
yet blinked but im hoping to see an eyelid quiver before too many 
more hours go by 
but australian trade minister michael duffy said he was not 
hopeful of progress before the end of the midterm review of the 
uruguay round of trade talks the fouryear round begun in 1986 in 
punta del este uruguay is designed to update the 40yearold 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the midterm review brings together ministers from some 100 
nations who are seeking to emerge from their talks with instructions 
to their negotiators for the final two years of the round 
the stalemate over the farm issue was holding up progress in 
other ministerial groups negotiating over the inclusion of services 
and copyrights in the gatt agreement which regulates international 
trade 
gatt spokesman david woods said some headway was made in those 
groups but it would not be reflected in any final montreal 
statement because of the linkages made by delegates to settling 
the agricultural issue 
jose concepcion head of the philippines delegation said it is 
a sad thing for the world when two powers put developing countries 
at a standstill because of their fight 
we have appealed to them to exercise statemanship that will 
give substance to the act of faith that launched this round in punta 
del este uruguay two years ago 
the agricultural subsidies while of relatively minor value in 
dollar terms in the international market are a volatile political 
issue 
for the united states elimination of price supports would ease 
the drain on the federal budget the government has poured as much 
as 27 million annually into subsidies every year 
for the europeans elimination of price supports would endanger 
the eecs common agricultural policy and incur the wrath of powerful 
farm lobbies 
our common agricultural policy has to ensure a living for 
familyowned farms said chief eec negotiator willy de clercq he 
said the eec has some 11 million farmers compared with 25 million 
in the united states 
the montreal talks are designed to review progress made so far in 
the round and to provide negotiators with instructions for the final 
two years of talks 
developing nations such as the philippines brazil and india were 
apprehensive that the agenda for the uruguay round would be dictated 
by the interests of developed countries and would fail to take their 
concerns into account 
they nonetheless agreed to join the round but significant gaps 
have emerged between their positions and those of the industrialized 
world in the past two years of negotiations in geneva 
the eec on wednesday championed the cause of the developing 
nations saying a usbacked proposal put forth in a group 
discussing trade in services failed to address the third worlds 
concerns 
community officials said the proposal designed to regulate trade 
in such things as transportation and services also does not take 
into account the eecs demand for reciprocal access to gatt members 
markets

the federal aviation administration fined 29 
airlines more than 16 million wednesday for security lapses at 
passenger checkpoints although officials said the violations have 
declined significantly in the past year 
the civil penalties ranged from 1000 against a handful of 
commuter carriers the minimum for a single violation to more 
than 200000 apiece against american airlines northwest airlines 
and united airlines for each having more than two dozen violations 
the penalties stemmed from failures by security guards at airport 
checkpoints to detect 236 mock weapons carried or hidden in carryon 
baggage by undercover faa officials most of the violations occurred 
between april and september of this year 
the agency collected more than 1 million in fines earlier this 
year as a result of violations that occurred in late l987 and early 
l988 as part of a stepped up effort by the government to improve 
checkpoint security at major airports 
despite the latest civil penalties transportation department 
officials said the airlines which are responsible for passenger 
screening at airports have significantly improved their detection 
of weapons at screening points since the matter became a focus of 
concern in late l987 
according to faa figures the airlines in l987 detected 789 
percent of the mock weapons being passed through checkpoints by faa 
undercover agents during the first six months of this year the 
success rate increased to 856 percent and during the julyseptember 
period it improved to 889 percent 
but transportation secretary jim burnley told reporters while 
announcing the latest figures that he is not satisfied with a 
failure rate in excess of 11 percent 
the faa will continue to test the airport security network to 
assure that it provides the protection the american public expects 
and deserves he said although the detection rate has improved 
since last year i will not be satisfied until we achieve a 100 
percent success rate in detecting weapons 
the faa said that the 166 million in fines against the 29 
airlines reflected 236 cases in which mock weapons were undetected 
at airport checkpoints where xray screening devices metal 
detectors and visual checks are used to prevent the smuggling of 
weapons aboard aircraft 
in some cases a single violation resulted in several airlines 
being fined because a number of air carriers shared responsibility 
for a checkpoint fines were either 1000 or 10000 per violation 
for each air carrier involved according to a dot spokesman 
dot spokesman ed ohara said that airlines were fined 1000 for 
each violation that occurred at a checkpoint where the overall 
detection rate was 95 percent or better and 10000 at a checkpoint 
where the overall rate was less than 95 percent 
the faa declined to provide a breakdown of the detection rates at 
various airports or disclose how many airports and which were 
checked 
four airlines were cited for at least two dozen violations 
united 33 violations for 24900 in fines northwest 29 violations 
for 209000 in fines american 28 violations for 208000 in 
fines and usair 26 violations for 179000 in fines 
other airlines and their violations and fines were 
pan american world airways 19 and 154000 delta air lines 17 
and 116000 continental airlines 14 and 85000 eastern

a defense attorney implored jurors today not 
to convict former teen carpetcleaning tycoon barry minkow on stock 
fraud charges merely because they dislike him 
the presumption of innocence doesnt apply only to defendants 
who are likable said defense attorney david kenner as minkow sat 
watching him from the counsel table 
ladies and gentlemen you may well not like barry minkow he 
told jurors in the defenses closing arguments 
you may think barry minkow is a cad emotionally immature 
you certainly wouldnt want barry minkow to go out with your 
daughter he said 
but none of those things removes from him the presumption of 
innocence said kenner 
the attorney then began a pointbypoint answer to the 
governments allegations that minkow swindled big investors and 
small ones out of millions of dollars with his zzzz best 
carpetcleaning company kenner admitted there is no question that 
minkow defrauded investors but he claimed the young man was the 
victim of mobsters who manipulated his every move 
on tuesday a prosecutor delivered a stinging closing argument in 
which he denounced minkow as a pathological liar who was 
compelled by greed rather than mob threats when he bilked investors 
in his zzzz best empire 
he knows how to get sympathy and with all that guile and 
deceit he stole more than a thousand gang members could with his one 
little briefcase assistant us attorney gordon greenberg said 
tuesday 
greenberg was the first lawyer to offer final arguments in the 
fourmonthold securities fraud trial 
after kenners arguments and a prosecution rebuttal today the 
case was to be submitted to jurors 
minkow whose company became a hot wall street item before it 
collapsed in scandal has said he was a naive youth manipulated by 
mobsters who beat him and made death threats to get their way 
minkow who launched his business at 16 in his parents garage 
became familiar to millions of californians through his television 
ads 
he is charged with 57 counts of securities credit card and mail 
fraud in a swindle that cost investors millions major banks and 
securities firms lost money along with individual investors

sears roebuck and co said wednesday it had 
extended billions of dollars in additional credit to 10 million 
sears chargecard holders in hopes of boosting sales for the holiday 
season and the coming year 
sears notified about 40 percent of its cardholders of their 
higher credit limits in letters mailed out during the past month 
said philo holland a spokesman for the sears merchandise group 
the cardholders were selected for both their creditworthiness and 
the likelihood that they would use the extra credit holland said 
sears also lengthened the repayment period for those accounts to 
36 months from 30 months thereby reducing minimum monthly payments 
by at least 20 percent 
holland acknowledged that the credit extension certainly does 
have an effect in terms of the holiday season 
but he called it an ongoing program to provide greater 
purchasing power to our customers not only through the christmas 
season but throughout the year 
the company had 13 billion in loans outstanding to its store 
card holders or an average of about 515 an account at the end of 
1987 holland would not disclose the exact amount of additional 
credit that sears had made available or the average credit line 
prior to the extensions 
the company said it was optimistic about the christmas season 
which retail industry analysts are predicting will be moderately 
strong 
if you look at the rest of the industry were doing pretty 
well sears chairman edward a brennan said in an interview on 
tuesday customers seem in a mood to buy 
the company has attempted to spur holiday sales with heavily 
advertised sale prices including steep discounts on home appliances 
sears which also is a major player in the financialservices 
arena recently announced a major restructuring of its retail 
business that will include a switch to everyday low pricing at 
all of its 825 stores it currently uses a policy of regular prices 
with frequent sales on specific items 
holland said the extracredit program was not designed 
specifically to reduce sears inventory in preparation for the 
pricing switch which begins next spring the company plans to cut 
the number of items it offers in some lines 
this is a program that was considered well before that he 
said referring to the decision to restructure the merchandise group

a federal judge refused wednesday to 
intervene in torchmark corps hostile takeover battle for kansas 
city life insurance co by rejecting a request for a preliminary 
injunction 
the decision was seen as a major setback for torchmark although a 
company lawyer said the birmingham ala firm would pursue its 
offer to kansas city lifes stockholders of 4750 a share or 
approximately 347 million 
us district judge scott o wright refused torchmarks request 
to block kansas city life and its principal owners from buying more 
of the companys stock to force kansas city life to provide 
confidential information about the comany and to require kansas 
city life to hire new financial advisers and set up a special 
committee of directors to review the 4750 offer 
despite the decision of the court today torchmark believes 
that the interest of all involved in our effort to acquire the 
kansas city life insurance co would be best served through direct 
negotiations between our company and the leadership of kansas city 
life torchmark president jon rotenstreich said in a statement 
wednesday 
the court ruling means kansas city life and its principal owners 
the families of jr bixby and we bixby are free to buy more 
shares of kansas city lifes common stock the bixby families 
control 488 percent of the companys stock and could gain a 
majority of the stock by buying several thousand shares the bixbys 
have not publicized their plans 
torchmark had asked the court to prevent the company and the 
bixbys from buying any stock to maintain a level playing field 
while torchmark tries to gain control interest in the company 
torchmark is barred from buying stock on the market until its tender 
offer to all stockholders expires next wednesday 
kansas city life directors met today to consider the 4750 
offer but fred spar a public relations spokesman in new york said 
he was not sure when a decision would be reached 
torchmark sued kansas city life on nov 16 the same day it 
offered 4350 a share for all of kansas city lifes stock kansas 
city lifes directors recommended stockholders reject that offer 
but torchmark countered with the 4750 bid

the european is whitehaired tall full of joie 
de vivre the american is intense people say his name rhymes with 
fighter willy de clercq and clayton yeutter are facing off this 
week for the last time on the international stage 
this weeks brawl over farm subsidies at the gatt freetrade 
talks here is in the grand tradition of the two men who have battled 
each other with relish for four years 
although both men will leave office early next year neither is 
coming across in montreal as a lame duck lions in winter would be a 
better description 
when it is all over though the two may actually miss each other 
de clercq sees this with a bit of nostalgia they have had some 
good fights with each other said his spokeswoman francoise le 
bailelles 
yeutter 57 the us trade representative is the kind of person 
who went from high school through a doctorate without ever getting 
less than an a 
he studied for his doctorate in agricultural economics and his 
law degree simultaneously while also managing a 2500acre farm in 
cozad neb and ranked first in both programs 
yeutter is proudly a freemarketeer in his last job before 
becoming trade representative in july 1985 he was president and 
chief executive of the chicago mercantile exchange the worlds 
second largest futures market 
it was announced early on here that yeutter had asked to have a 
typewriter delivered to his hotel room apparently so he could keep 
working after everyone else had gone to bed 
in contrast to the superachieving yeutter the 61yearold de 
clercq is a gregarious politician whose negotiating instincts grow 
out of his 30 years in the fractious world of belgian politics 
de clercq is the 12nation eecs commissioner for external 
relations and trade policy he is also belgiums deputy prime 
minister and minister for finance and foreign trade 
de clercq who enjoys bantering with reporters said before talks 
started that he hoped us negotiators had come like santa claus 
with a bag of realistic proposals 
the unsantaclauslike yeutter in contrast has not spoken to 
the press when presidentelect bush announced carla hills as his 
successor yeutters praise for mrs hills was delivered by a deputy 
what the two men share is a fierce stubbornness at the bargaining 
table 
theyre both very effective people and theyre both very well 
respected said william crosbie a canadian policy adviser at the 
gatt talks 
neither was available wednesday for an interview 
yeutter enjoys one advantage over de clercq since he represents 
only one government he has more room to maneuver 
de clercq has 12 motherinlaws he has always to listen very 
closely to what his motherinlaws have to say said bernhard 
zepter a deputy negotiator for west germany 
the last official meeting between yeutter and de clercq is likely 
to be this friday in belgium where they will attend a useec 
ministerial meeting 
the directions they will take from here reflect their differences 
yeutter who will leave office along with president reagan has 
held exploratory talks with several companies about high executive 
posts including the wall street firm of drexel burnham lambert inc 
de clercq in contrast is sticking to politics he will run for 
a fiveyear term to the european parliament the election is in 
june and he is almost certain to win

comparable from airline to airline because of differing methods of 
reporting for example some airlines count in their complaint data 
courtesy tracers in which they seek to help people from other 
airlines find lost baggage in addition reporting methods vary for 
problems with carryon baggage and latearriving passengers

the naming of d joseph corr as chief executive 
officer of continental airlines should help the carriers 
performance and it also fits into frank lorenzos strategy for 
maintaining the airline as a separate entity observers said 
wednesday 
lorenzo chairman of continentals parent texas air corp named 
corr on tuesday to replace him as chief of continental lorenzo will 
remain a director of the houstonbased airline while martin shugrue 
will remain as president 
corr 47 is a former president of trans world airlines inc and 
was a close associate of financier carl icahn twas owner 
some airline analysts said they were not sure of the precise 
significance of lorenzos move but they believed it bolstered his 
strategy for continental 
corr brings to continental the ability to squeeze profits out of 
languishing companies the analysts said continental often an 
industry leader in cutting air fares has experienced financial 
turbulence but recently started to show improvement 
corr is a good hardnosed manager said john pincavage who 
follows the industry for the investment firm painewebber inc 
corr and shugrue could complement each other well he said since 
corr is adept at overall company strategy while shugrue a former 
top pan am corp executive is one hell of a daytoday operating 
guy 
in announcing corrs appointment lorenzo called him a superb 
manager who has improved the performance of several companies 
as president of twa beginning in april 1986 corr helped lead the 
carrier from potential bankruptcy back to profitability 
he accomplished the same at acf industries inc a st 
louisbased company controlled by icahn where profits increased 
fourfold between 1983 and 1986 
julius maldutis airline analyst for salomon inc called corr 
a very bottomline oriented pragmatic businessman 
pincavage said that by naming corr as continental chairman 
lorenzo also could be aiming to reinforce the separation between 
nonunion continental and its sister carrier eastern airlines the 
militant unions at miamibased eastern have been pushing for a 
merger of the two texas air carriers which could pave the way for 
the unionization of continental 
in his announcement lorenzo said the selection of corr 
emphasizes texas airs commitment to managing our airlines 
separately

a study that let children play with 19 toys 
for five days before rating them for their playability has found 
the top toy to be a video camera manufactered by fisher price 
the toy companys pxl 2000 camcorder allows children to make 
video recordings and play them back the toy finished ahead of 
another fisher price toy known as star stage which has a 
microphone and stage lights for putting on a show according to 
duracell usa a bethelbased battery manufacturer that sponsored 
the study 
the survey results confirm that children will play with toys 
they can learn from but only if they dont look like school work 
said kendall park njbased toy consultant ruth roufberg who 
conducted the study 
roufberg said the children preferred toys they knew how to use 
without explanation toys that teach geography and deductive 
reasoning were among the topranked toys while toys that dealt with 
optics experiments and fossils were among the lowestranked items 
roufberg said the two lowrated toys both contained schoollike 
booklets which she speculated was a reason for their rankings 
roufberg said her study also found that children disliked games that 
involved rules or concentration 
the six lowestrated toys were science project kits and strategy 
board games however the study found that the ratings of board 
games increased by the final day indicating these toys take more 
time to appreciate she said 
the study involved more than 1700 hours of testing by 352 
children at 15 test sites across the country between oct 3 through 
oct 24 the median age of participants was 75 years with the 
range between 5 and 9 
roufberg prescreened 1000 toys for their educational merit and 
play value to come up with the 19 used in the study 
in the study each child played with the toys for at least one 
hour a day for five days children were then asked in oneonone 
interviews to choose their favorite toys 
the study found that eight of the top ten toys were the same for 
boys and girls 
i didnt think boys and girls would show so much similarity 
roufberg said in a telephone interview wednesday 
the study didnt examine preferences based on age but roufberg 
said that she would like to make that a part of future research 
combining the results for boys and girls the top toys were pxl

the dollar surged and gold prices skidded 
wednesday after soviet president mikhail gorbachev announced his 
country would reduce the size of its military 
the dollar rose more than 2 pfennigs against the west german 
mark while gold dropped more than 4 a troy ounce 
gorbachev told the united nations the soviet union would cut its 
troop strength by half a million and reduce the number of its 
conventional armaments 
the dollar which had moved higher in advance of gorbachevs 
speech soared on foreign and domestic markets after his 
announcement 
james mcgroarty a vice president at discount corp here said 
the markets decided the soviet move would result in a cut in us 
defense spending and therefore help reduce the us budget deficit 
but the dollar gave up some ground after traders began to analyze 
gorbachevs statement to see how significant it really was 
mcgroarty said 
he described the dollars initial surge as a kneejerk 
reaction to the speech 
overseas dealers said the dollar also fell because it had shot up 
too quickly 
people were just reacting blindly said one dealer if 
anything its usually an escalation of hostilities that encourages 
people to buy dollars not a deescalation unless that would 
benefit the us economy 
nonetheless the dollar managed a strong advance for the day 
in london the dollar spurted against the british pound it cost 
18425 to buy one pound cheaper than 18675 late tuesday in 
later new york trading the pound slipped to 18435 from late 
tuesdays 186025 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late tuesdays 
prices included 175975 west german marks up from 17376 14795 
swiss francs up from 145755 60035 french francs up from 59130 
129900 italian lire up from 128250 and 119925 canadian 
dollars up from 119135 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late tuesdays 
rates included 17588 west german marks up from 17290 14790 
swiss francs up from 14480 60025 french francs up from 59015 
19675 dutch guilders up from 19470 129075 italian lire up 
from 127712 11995 canadian dollars up from 11887 
in tokyo where trading ended hours before gorbachevs speech 
the dollar rose 089 japanese yen to a closing 12243 yen later in 
london it rose further to 12325 yen and in new york it rose to 
123525 yen from late tuesdays 121915 
meanwhile gold fell as traders saw signs of peace in gorbachevs 
statement 
in times of uncertainty gold tends to firm said stephen 
platt a metals analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
gorbachevs announcement removed the fear factor from the 
market platt said 
republic national bank of new york quoted a late bid of 42250 
for a troy ounce of gold down from 42675 late tuesday on the 
commodity exchange in new york gold dropped to 42280 from 42750 
on tuesday 
gold fell in london to a late bid price of 42295 a troy ounce 
compared with 42725 bid late tuesday 
in zurich gold finished at a bid 42350 compared with 42775 
bid late tuesday 
earlier in hong kong gold fell 307 to close at a bid 42666 
silver bullion prices rose on the london market where the metal 
was trading at a late bid price of 614 a troy ounce compared with 
612 bid late tuesday but silver skidded on the commodity 
exchange falling to 6140 a troy ounce from late tuesdays 6161

the federal governments first experiment in 
taking over a mobrun union ended wednesday with one of the nations 
largest teamsters locals electing officers allied to the corrupt 
regime ousted four years ago 
i think its a real disaster for the future of the labor 
movement said clyde summers a labor law expert at the 
university of pennsylvania 
but other labor observers said the very existence of a 
legitimately contested election at local 560 justified the interim 
rule by a courtappointed trustee that preceded the vote 
newcomers represent the revitalization of the political process 
in this local said linda kaboolian a fellow at harvard 
universitys kennedy school of government who has researched the 
local 560 trusteeship for a year 
that they didnt win isnt the final word on the future of 
local 560 she said 
the election also could affect the justice departments suit 
against the international brotherhood of teamsters which seeks to 
oust the parent unions board and establish a trustee to keep out 
corruption and establish elections 
certainly its a good example of a potential backlash against a 
trusteeship said goldberg 
the teamsters for liberty ticket which includes two relatives of 
ousted officers of local 560 captured 65 percent of 4530 ballots 
counted tuesday and early wednesday in balloting that brought an 
unusually high turnout among the locals 7600 members 
teamsters for liberty opposed the courtappointed trusteeship 
which was imposed in 1986 after us district judge harold a 
ackerman found in a justice department lawsuit that organized crime 
had ruled the union citybased local for more than a quartercentury 
he ordered removal of the locals executive board 
ballots were mailed on november in the locals first contested 
election in 23 years 
danny sciarra and mark sheridan led the winning slate to become 
the new president and vice president 
they are relatives of former officers michael sciarra and joseph 
sheridan who this fall were barred from running because of ties to 
the old leaders the new officers have said they will rely on and 
consult with their kin in running the union 
the trustee edwin h stier a former prosecutor will monitor 
the local for at least three months after which the new 
sevenmember board must report to ackerman on its activities the 
judge also kept indefinite jurisdiction over the board 
attorney harvey weissbard who represented michael sciarra and 
joseph sheridan said the votes results were a clear vindication of 
his clients and a rejection of the trusteeship 
i think clearly the vast majority of the members really did 
not appreciate having the trusteeship thrust upon them he said 
i just think that the whole concept is illconceived 
summers said the locals history of violence and intimidation at 
the hands of the genovese organize crime family might have helped 
bring about the result 
the opposition an independant rankandfile group that arose 
during the trusteeship had little chance to gain support if members 
saw no guarantee of ones life limb and future work following 
the old leaderships victory summers said 
michael goldberg a visiting labor law professor at the 
university of washington in seattle said the race might have been 
closer if the shop stewards many of whom were beholden to the old 
regime had been replaced 
it just demonstrates how difficult it is for any remedy to 
succeed when you have 30 years of entrenched and autocratic 
leadership goldberg said

college endowments buffeted by the october 
1987 stock market crash still managed to post a tiny gain in the 
last fiscal year a college business group reported wednesday 
the national association of college and university business 
officers said preliminary results from its survey of 100 major 
endowment funds indicated an average gain of 02 percent for the 
year ended last june 1 
that was down from a 138 percent gain for the campus endowments 
in fiscal 1987 the group said it beat the minus71 percent return 
on the standard amp poors 500 during the year government and 
corporate bonds rose 75 percent during the same year 
the business officers have tracked major campus endowments 
annually since 1971 
caspa l harris executive vice president of the association 
said to the extent that one can point to a single reason for the 
sharp decline in endowment returns the october crash is 
responsible 
endowment funds are invested primarily in publicly traded 
securities and history suggests that the market values of such 
securities fluctuate widely based on changes in investor 
psychology he said 
the preliminary report did not list the endowments by name or 
size the final report will be out in february 
almost half the funds in the typical endowment were invested in 
stocks and 29 percent in fixed income securities thirteen percent 
was in cash and cash equivalents the rest was invested in a variety 
of ways including 12 percent put up for venture capital projects
