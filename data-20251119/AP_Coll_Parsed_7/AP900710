a judge tuesday issued a restraining order 
barring an alderman who threatened to disrupt the citys annual 
great circus parade from coming within 500 feet of the parade route 
alderman michael mcgee censured last month by his colleagues 
for threatening violence if inner city problems arent dealt with 
warned monday that he and members of his black panther militia 
planned to disrupt the parade mcgree wrote to parade organizer ben 
barkin that parents should keep their children at home because the 
protest could get ugly he indicated the city had no right to 
enjoy itself while its black community was convulsed with violence 
and poverty 
the city responded tuesday by obtaining the restraining order 
from milwaukee county circuit judge john e mccormick 
the memo to ben barkin in my opinion was a threat of 
violence city attorney grant langley said 
the parade annually attracts 500000 people or more who line the 
twomile route through the downtown area it features restored 
antique circus wagons marching bands equestrienne groups clowns 
and other attractions 
we are very concerned about the potential for disruption 
having an effect on the animals frightening the animals langley 
said noting that mcgees unspecified disruption could involve 
anything from mass whistleblowing to tossing fireworks 
langley said the temporary restraining order applies to mcgee 
and five others named in the order as well as all other members of 
mcgees black panther militia and anyone else acting in concert 
with the alderman 
mcgee censured by the common council two weeks ago was 
unavailable when the associated press attempted to reach him at his 
city hall office and at his home for comment there was no answer 
at those telephone numbers 
doris green one of those named with mcgee in the restraining 
order read a statement at a news conference in which mcgeen said 
it would be an honor to be arrested while protesting at the parade 
mcgee has repeatedly criticized the city for failing to address 
inner city problems he formed the militia earlier this year and 
claims it has 500 members including street gang members who will 
take violent action if inner city problems arent eased by 1995 
the common council censured mcgee june 29 after he announced he 
had received a sausagepoisoning threat from a militant group 
causing a local company to recall thousands of dollars worth of 
meat products 
city officials claimed that mcgee invented the poisoning threat

an infectious strain of hepatitis that can 
cause several liver diseases is spread even more rapidly than aids 
among gay men according to a study announced tuesday 
the hepatitis b virus is contracted 86 times more easily than 
the human immunodeficiency virus that causes aids according to a 
university of pittsburgh study published in the journal of the 
american medical association 
since the beginning of the aids epidemic hepatitis b has been 
pushed in the background said dr lawrence kingsley who led the 
study of 1062 gay men in pennsylvania ohio and west virginia 
the virus infects an estimated 300000 more americans every 
year and 5 to 10 percent of them will develop cirrhosis liver 
cancer or chronic liver disease the centers for disease control in 
atlanta reported 
studies from the early 1980s have shown 50 to 70 percent of gay 
men carry the hepatitis b virus researchers said 
other disease researchers said the pitt study is significant 
because it dramatically shows that the hepatitis b strain is passed 
much more easily than the aids virus through sexual contact and 
exchange of body fluids 
the viruses are linked in their similar patterns of spread 
both by blood and both by sexual contact said dr joseph melnick 
of baylor university in houston 
dr rebecca van dyke of the university of michigan said the 
comparison of the two viruses proves what long was suspected by 
doctors who have treated gay men in the 1980s 
i worked in san francisco and we had hepatitis b all over the 
place and we knew it was transmitted fairly quickly ms van 
dyke said 
she said the emergence of aids has made more people aware of all 
sexually transmitted diseases including hepatitis b but at the 
same time those at risk of getting aids may not pay attention to 
other diseases and seek treatment 
the b strain is the only one of five types of hepatitis that can 
be prevented with a vaccine researchers said about 25 million 
americans received it in 1989 and most of them were healthcare 
workers said the cdcs dr miriam alter the vaccine was developed 
by researchers who studied gay men in new york city because the 
strain was so prevalent among homosexuals ms van dyke said 
the pitt study also said anal intercourse puts men at a high 
risk for contracting hepatitis b other studies have claimed higher 
aids infection rates are linked to anal intercourse 
because hepatitis b is so easily transmitted were trying to 
underscore the need for safer sex the use of condoms kingsley 
said

western leaders gave mikhail gorbachev a warm 
endorsement tuesday and pledged to help in practical ways those 
countries that choose freedom the industrial powers ordered a 
study of the tangled soviet economy and drafted conditions for 
sending financial aid 
prospects for fundamental and longterm economic aid could 
improve if the soviet union comes to a substantial change in 
resources from military to civilian production and ends the 
support to those states which create regional conflict according 
to a foreign language draft of the final communique 
at the midway point of their threeday summit the leaders 
acknowledged recent improvements in beijing by slightly easing 
restrictions on aid to china japan said it intended to move ahead 
on its own with a 5 billion loan package 
diplomats worked late on a controversial us proposal to phase 
out worldwide agricultural subsidies there was no resolution as 
president bush and his six summit partners met for an elegant 
dinner at the houston museum of fine arts 
an administration official said the leaders would endose a joint 
effort to help brazil save its amazon rain forests in a goodwill 
gesture to bush allies did not press a desire for specific goals 
to reduce pollutants blamed for causing the global warming of the 
environment the united states strongly opposes such targets 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said the summit talks were 
held in an atmosphere of constructive help as far as i can see 
there were no fights there were some disagreements 
but bush told his dinner guests to put business aside there 
is no working tonight no communiques no amendments and not 
language to be corrected the president said he improvised a 
brief welcome and aides said later he had left his prepared toast 
in his hotel suite 
earlier the leaders released a joint statement bidding goodbye 
to the iron curtain separating eastern and western europe they 
said they were determined to seize all opportunities to a achieve 
a europe whole and free 
by authorizing the study of soviet needs the leaders blunted 
west german efforts to organize a coordinated program of direct 
aid with support from britain and japan bush insists the money 
would be wasted unless gorbachev can achieve broader reforms he 
also wants the soviets to curtail cuban subsidies and reduce 
spending on the military 
the leaders issued a declaration allowing any of the summit 
nations to aid the soviets on their own west germany has pledged 
31 billion in loans and there was no discussion of putting that 
on hold 
the united states is not willing to provide aid beyond technical 
assistance but it was possible the study to be supervised by the 
international monetary fund and completed by the end of this year 
could lead to a more generous approach 
no promises though even if the study recommends direct aid 
from the west we might still say im sorry said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
aside from west germany france and italy have spoken up for 
fast aid to moscow and canada is releasing some commercial credit 
foreign minister joe clark of canada told reporters there will 
probably be some announcements of fairly substantial action by some 
countries in the next four or five weeks 
looking ahead to wednesdays wrapup communique bush was trying 
to persuade his partners to phase out agricultural subsidies a 
linchpin to ongoing global trade talks america protects its 
agriculture ferociously british foreign secretary douglas hurd 
noted so does europe though to a lesser extent the japanese 
protect theirs perhaps most of all 
in their political statement the leaders toasted the 
replacement of repressive regimes in central and eastern europe by 
governments freely chosen by their peoples 
referring to the economically troubled reformminded government 
in moscow the leaders said we commit ourselves to working with 
the soviet union to assist its efforts to create an open society a 
pluralistic democracy and a marketoriented economy 
secretary of state james a baker iii said i would hope that 
there would be a consensus coming out of this summit that 
technical assistance to the soviet union is warranted even under 
the circumstances that exist today 
the leaders agreed each of us stands ready to help in 
practical ways those countries that choose freedom through the 
provision of constitutional legal and economic knowhow and 
through economic assistance as appropriate 
even in authorizing the soviet needs study there was brief 
discord as the leaders debated which agency would lead the effort 
frances francois mitterrand argued that the imfs role could 
humiliate the soviets by subjecting moscow to the same financial 
scrutiny imposed on developing countries 
the world bank which is to participate in the study issued a 
statement saying the work would take at least a year to complete 
and could provide useful guidance for countries considering 
investing in the soviet economy 
the summit concludes wednesday with a final statement and a 
series of news conferences vice president dan quayle and his wife 
marilyn flew in to join the leaders for the dinner at the museum of 
fine arts 
as the leaders conferred their spouses flew to san antonio to 
tour the alamo and other historic sites margaret thatchers 
husband denis the only male spouse skipped the trip 
in a gesture to japans toshiki kaifu the leaders agreed to 
loosen restrictions on aid to china in recognition of its slight 
easing of repression summit countries pledged to explore whether 
new world bank loans would contribute to reform of the chinese 
economy especially loans that would address environmental 
concerns 
on the other hand the summit refused to lift western sanctions 
we will keep them under review for future adjustments to respond 
to further positive developments in china the political 
communique said 
marking recent developments in moscow the statement said we 
welcome the intention of the soviet union to move towards a 
democratic political system as well as soviet attempts to reform 
their economy along market principles 
the western statement coincided with gorbachevs success this 
week in reshaping control of the communist party in ways that will 
bolster newly elected officials and give the 15 soviet republics a 
bigger share of power 
turning to eastern and central europe where soviet control is 
being supplanted by reformist governments the leaders welcomed 
the replacement of repressive regimes but singled out romania 
for lagging behind 
fitzwater said this was one summit where the leaders were 
wrestling with the main issues themselves not just ratifying the 
work of their diplomatic sherpas and other summit aides 
the language that you see in the final communique on those 
issues i think will be more a product of the actual summit debate 
than what weve seen in many of these former years he said

the louisiana legislatures abortion ban if 
signed into law may provide the test that prompts the supreme 
court to reconsider its 17yearold roe vs wade decision say 
advocates on both sides of the abortion debate 
antiabortion and abortion rights groups were waiting for word 
from louisiana gov buddy roemer on whether he will sign or veto 
the bill passed overwhelmingly after a tumultuous weekend 
statehouse battle 
if it becomes law the measure would be the nations strictest 
antiabortion law and would represent a direct challenge to the 
1973 roe decision in which the court declared abortion to be a 
constitutional right 
theres no question that this is a great bill for us said 
john c willke of cincinnati president of the national right to 
life committee the leading antiabortion group 
this will stop 99 percent of all baby killing in the state of 
louisiana willke said it certainly is a signal to the rest of 
the nation 
the bill was passed overwhelmingly sunday night after abortion 
foes failed to override roemers veto of an even stronger abortion 
ban the new bill includes provisions demanded by roemer to allow 
abortion in cases of reported rape and incest 
however the governor said monday he hadnt decided whether to 
sign or veto the latest version 
national abortion rights groups were stunned by the sudden 
emergence of the revised bill 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league called it the most outrageous and dangerous 
antichoice bill in the nation and urged roemer to veto it 
roger evans director of litigation for planned parenthood said 
his group will file suit to block the measure if roemer signs it 
i dont see how the louisiana law could get to the supreme 
court without forcing a frontal confrontation with roe v wade 
he added 
dawn johnsen legal director of the national abortion rights 
action league said the louisiana bill could be upheld only if 
the court were to overrule roe and deprive all women of the right 
to choose 
other recent cases before the supreme court involved more narrow 
restrictions such as requiring parental notification when minors 
seek an abortion and limits on where and how they could be 
performed the decisions in those cases chipped away at roe without 
directly addressing it 
state legislatures considered a number of antiabortion bills 
this year after the supreme courts 1989 webster decision gave 
states the authority to impose some restrictions 
idaho was the only other state to pass a bill as strict as the 
louisiana measure but it was vetoed by gov cecil andrus guam a 
us territory also has passed an abortion ban but it has been 
blocked by the courts 
willke said he expects the louisiana measure if enacted to be 
challenged in court and blocked during appeals 
then it will go to supreme court and thats two years from 
now and our guess is by then wed have big broad smiles on our 
faces he said 
willke said he believes the courts current membership would use 
a case involving the louisiana measure to strike down all or part 
of the roe decision 
but he said the courts makeup could change by the time the case 
is heard and predicted that could shift the decision even more in 
his groups direction 
however planned parenthoods evans said his group believes the 
currently divided court would stop short of reversing its decision 
on abortion justice sandra day oconnor is considered the pivotal 
vote in any abortion case 
johnsen in a written analysis of the louisiana bill said the 
rape exception was too narrow because it requires a victim to 
report the attack within seven days 
she said it goes further than the idaho bill by imposing prison 
sentences of up to 10 years for doctors performing abortions and 
said it could lead to prosecution of women who selfinduce abortion

both the democrats and the republicans 
are underdogs in the connecticut governors race this year voters 
seem smitten with the thirdparty campaign of a maverick exsenator 
they ousted from office just 1 years ago 
lowell p weicker jr narrowly lost his bid for a fourth senate 
term in 1988 but roared back onto the states political scene in 
march forsaking the gop and declaring his candidacy as an 
independent 
poll after poll has found weicker to be the frontrunner in the 
gubernatorial race far ahead of the two congressmen who are 
expected to claim the republican and democratic nominations 
but weicker who created his own party the connecticut party 
discounts the polls he remembers 1988 when he was favored for 
reelection to the senate and lost by 10000 votes to democrat 
joseph lieberman 
g donald ferree jr director of polling at the university of 
connecticut said weicker is riding almost 20 years of statewide 
support but he predicts the race will tighten as the candidates 
stake out positions and become better known 
because voters arent hearing much and because weicker has 
such a strong advantage in terms of familiarity theres been very 
little movement ferree said it would be a mistake to interpret 
the current numbers as hardened preferences he said 
this is the first time in 20 years that connecticut democrats 
arent favored to win the governors office the party is 
foundering after democratic gov william a oneill was forced to 
raise taxes by more than 1 billion last year 
oneill citing political realities and saying he had no 
stomach for a nasty campaign in march dropped plans to run for 
reelection 
the democratic frontrunner now is fourterm rep bruce a 
morrison who was challenging oneill for the nomination the day 
oneill dropped out littleknown state rep william j cibes jr 
announced he was jumping in 
morrison is expected to receive the partys endorsement at the 
nominating convention this weekend but cibes appears assured of 
getting the 20 percent of convention delegates needed to force a 
september primary 
many oneill democrats have been cool to morrison because of his 
challenge to the incumbent democrat oneill himself remains openly 
resentful questioning morrisons ability to win and refusing even 
to meet with him 
republicans who have won the governors office just once in 35 
years had thought 1990 would be their year the party saw oneill 
as vulnerable on tax and budget issues and believed morrison would 
be an easy target too because of his liberal voting record in 
congress 
in their own candidate threeterm rep john g rowland the gop 
saw a brash young congressman who had won in a democratic district 
and looked like the right new face rowland is poised to accept his 
partys nomination by acclamation at its july 2021 convention 
what the gop didnt count on though was weickers candidacy 
after his 1988 senate defeat weicker said he was leaving politics 
with no regrets no excuses no blaming no griping and no 
comebacks 
in announcing his gubernatorial campaign weicker said he was 
getting back into politics because i miss very frankly fighting 
for connecticut 
weicker who made a brief bid for the republican presidential 
nomination in 1979 was forever battling the party during his years 
in the senate he took on richard nixon during watergate and 
ronald reagan later in his career and he was always on the outs 
with the states gop hierarchy 
he says he bolted the republican party because 20 years of 
trying to lead by example didnt work 
if i was going to run for governor it wasnt going to be a 
philosophical debate with the republicans weicker said ive 
had that what i wanted to spend my time on was the state of 
connecticut 
weickers candidacy seems to be hurting rowland the most the 
former senator has picked up endorsements from several prominent 
republicans including mary boatwright a member of the republican 
national committee 
a recent weicker fundraiser in washington featured some of his 
former senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle including 
former gop senators paul laxalt of nevada and edward brooke of 
massachusetts and incumbent democrat tom harkin of iowa 
morrison and rowland both say they could spend 4 million or 
more on the race weicker who doesnt face the traditional need to 
court delegates and who has no need to boost his name recognition 
hopes to get away with half as much 
ferrees most recent poll had weicker favored by 41 percent of 
those surveyed rowland with 11 percent and morrison with 9 percent

a group of catholic parents in 
queensland state homosexuals should be required by law to wear 
visible identification and be counseled on the depravity of their 
actions 
the call for id cards for homosexuals is part of a 10point 
program presented monday by the queensland association of catholic 
parents as modern minimum health precautions to help stop the 
spread of aids 
the group does not have church backing 
aids activists criticized the id proposal saying it highlighted 
the failure of aids education to have a significant impact on the 
general population 
why dont we just go back to nazism and put a tattoo on our 
heads said john bonello aids council project officer for 
townsville 
the criminal justice commission in queensland will hold public 
hearings on homosexual law reform during the next few months 
the catholic parents group program was described in a 50page 
document submitted to the commission on monday 
michael odowd the associations secretary called on the state 
government to maintain existing antihomosexual legislation he 
described moves to decriminalize prostitution as stupidity in the 
extreme 
odowd did not say how many people belong to his organization 
but claims it represents quite a large group of parents who want 
to keep traditional moral standards current 
the associations other recommendations included quarantining 
aids carriers compulsory aids testing of all male flight 
attendants and known homosexuals banning homosexuals from teaching 
positions and jobs involving food handling and requiring hotels 
and restaurants to use disposable crockery and cutlery 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer there is no known cure 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
the us surgeon general has reported that casual social contact 
will not transmit the aids virus nor has the disease been 
contracted from eating in restaurants or sharing eating utensils

perhaps its fitting the headquarters for the 
economic summits host committee is a historic mansion now owned by 
the government as a result of the sampl debacle 
houston is in the heart of the thrift crisis home to 668 
million in real estate dumped on federal agencies but president 
bush who might be considered chief landlord for all the empty 
office space and dilapidated storefronts isnt showing off any of 
these acquisitions to his economic summit friends 
there arent any summit parties at the skating rink the 
government is trying to sell nor are there any summitrelated 
services scheduled at the athletic clubturned church on the roll 
of the resolution trust corp the federal agency charged with 
selling 1416 billion worth of assets acquired in takeovers of 
failed sampls 
summit guests arent making use of the hotels the government 
owns in houston including the comfort inns dinners arent 
scheduled for rtc restaurants and no blacktie billiards matches 
at the governmentowned pool hall even office space near rice 
university site of the summit meetings remains unused 
and its doubtful the convenience stores now in government hands 
would be of interest to the japanese delegation even though a 
japanese company recently agreed to take over dallasbased 
southland corp owners of the 7eleven chain 
houston has nearly 9 percent of all the sampl properties in the 
rtcs inventory agency spokeswoman theresa mccusic said 
so far 43 sampls in the area have failed and at the end of 
april more than 3100 rtc properties in the city were for sale 
the houston regional office is the largest one we have in 
the southwest she said 
downtown several highrise buildings are available through the 
rtc including a 61yearold bank building which ironically has a 
message of more conservative banking days chiseled in stone over 
the entrance frugality is the mother of the virtues 
near rice university a threestory office building might have 
been available for meetings of the western leaders but the rtc 
catalog notes numerous problems eg parking hvac heating and 
airconditioning asbestos fire sprinklers electrical 
the kirby mansion is in far better shape stately and 
wellmanicured unlike many of the other houston area sampl 
properties it has a tenant the mansion has been the headquarters 
of the houston economic summit host committee a fundraising and 
planning group that made summit arrangements 
i think it is a good thing for the rtc it gives this house 
visibility said peter roussel a spokesman for the host 
committee 
the 36room mansion the last mansion in downtown was built in 
1892 by a lumber oil and banking magnate named john henry kirby 
the house has entertained four presidents including bush from 
1978 until last year it was the headquarters of an oil company 
which fell on hard times 
it makes a statement about houstons history and heritage 
roussel said 
and it makes a statement about presentday houston as well

special agents armed with stopwatches instead 
of guns are trying to clean up the city 
the eight agents hit the streets monday in a new effort to clear 
the air by enforcing a 1972 law against car bus and truck drivers 
who leave engines idling for more than three minutes 
its part of mayor david dinkins plan to let new yorkers 
breathe easier 
nothing else that we can do will bring us an improvement in 
our air quality faster than obtaining general citywide compliance 
with the threeminute idling law dinkins said 
department of environmental protection spokeswoman tina casey 
said eight tickets were issued on the first day including four at 
the jacob javits convention center all eight went to buses she 
said 
needless to say were thrilled at the small number of tickets 
that we had to issue she said they must have gotten the 
message 
around noon monday at a parking lot crowded with buses near the 
convention center a group of drivers said they werent happy with 
the citys enforcement plans 
its like an oven in there said terrence mcintosh a driver 
for short line of mahwah nj pointing to his bus with the 
temperature near 90 he said his passengers were not going to be 
happy to get into a hot bus 
the drivers also complained that the fines which they not 
their employer would have to pay were too high 
first offenders will get a ticket for 220 and the fines can go 
up as high as 880 for repeat offenders 
thats just a little less than what we make said cruz 
quintana another short line driver his company pays about 360 a 
week to starting drivers he said 
transportation commissioner lucius j riccio called the 
penalties commensurate with the violation 
we mean business riccio said 
riccio said that if the operator of a ticketed vehicle is not 
the owner then the owner also is subject to a fine 
were talking about the air that we breathe and the 
environmental and health impacts of that riccio said if 
people want to be selfish and leave their vehicles running then 
that means that other people suffer 
the law does not apply to vehicles that need the engine to 
operate some equipment such as a truck mixing concrete 
richard mendes deputy dep commissioner said more than 200 
summonses have been issued annually in the past for idling

some members of congress say they would go 
along with cutting subsidies to american farmers if president bush 
persuades the europeans to reciprocate but others favor even 
stronger government supports as a defense against cheap imported 
food 
and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas doubts the issue 
will be forced upon his colleagues even as it is a major topic on 
the agenda of the seven western leaders at the economic summit in 
houston 
i would guess they arent going to do much dole said 
citing pressures on the europeans at home to maintain the current 
system 
but dole who would like to see subsidies reduced said it is 
important that the issue is at least being raised 
give us the same markets same opportunities well win our 
share he said of us farmers ability to compete in the world 
market 
the government spent about 11 billion this year in subsidies 
that assure a certain income to producers of wheat corn soybeans 
cotton and rice other government programs maintain the prices of 
products such as honey wool mohair tobacco and sugar without 
direct payments but through market manipulation 
rep leon panetta dcalif said no consensus exists in 
congress on changes in the farm policy 
but i think that most agriculture committee members recognize 
if the european countries and the others agree to reduce their 
subsidies over 10 years that would be a position that would draw 
broad support in the congress said panetta who is chairman of 
the house budget committee and a member of the agriculture 
committee 
in fact farm legislation already approved by the house and 
senate agriculture committees freezes subsidies which considering 
inflation has the effect of reducing income supports over the 
fiveyear life of the bill 
and a coalition of house members is preparing for a floor fight 
to eliminate even more taxpayersupported farm programs 
rep charles schumer dny who is leading that coalition 
said it would be best if all nations eliminated subsidies that 
distort world trade 
it is clear that some of the export subsidies in the united 
states should be eliminated now he said the bush 
administration is taking the right approach but it is an approach 
that also needs to be extended to the legislative arena 
sen bob kerrey dneb takes an opposite view he says the 
united states should use the same approach in agriculture as in 
arms negotiations deal from a position of strength 
congress on both sides of the aisle would love to get an 
international agreement to reduce subsidies said kerrey first 
of all start with a strong overall fiveyear farm bill 
he led senators on the senate agriculture committee who wanted 
to increase farm income supports and is a strong supporter of the 
use of the export programs designed by congress to bring down the 
price of us farm products in the world market 
kerrey says president bushs proposals for the farm bill would 
weaken the us farm economy sending the wrong signals to the 
europeans 
unless he bush assumes the europeans cant read theyre 
saying the united states is not going to play that tough with us 
said kerrey 
dole said the farm bill had a log way to go before it could be 
viewed as specific signal to the europeans 
i dont think it says very much at all we havent agreed yet 
on the contents there still is going to be a battle on the 
floor said dole i think the fact that its a fiveyear bill 
says we are going to continue subsidies

the presidents son neil bush contends he has 
been made a political football in the investigation of his role 
in the failure of a colorado savings and loan 
in a series of newspaper interviews bush contended he had done 
nothing wrong in connection with the failure of silverado savings amp 
loan 
bush conceded in an interview published in the washington post 
on tuesday that he got an incredibly sweet deal in the form of 
a 100000 loan from a denver investor that he wasnt required to 
repay but he said the loan was totally unrelated to his work 
as a director of silverado 
federal regulators have accused bush of conflict of interest 
while a silverado director from 1985 to august 1988 silverado was 
seized by regulators in december 1988 and bailing it out is 
expected to cost 1 billion in tax money 
the allegations against him by the office of thrift supervision 
will be aired before an administrative law judge in denver on sept 
25 
in an interview published over the weekend in the denver post 
the younger bush complained that the administrative charges against 
him are being pursued in a highly political atmosphere republicans 
and democrats seek to blame each other for the savings and loan 
disaster and the case against the presidents son provides 
ammunition to the democrats 
the younger bush said silverado was doomed to die before he 
became a director because it carried 1 billion in commercial real 
estate loans at a time the colorado market was faltering 
regulators say bush failed to disclose a series of business 
deals with developers ken good and bill walters who defaulted on a 
combined 130 million in loans from silverado 
good loaned bush 100000 in 1984 but forgave the loan before 
bush joined the sampls board bush told the washington post 
regulators say bush proposed to his fellow board members that they 
grant good a 900000 line of credit 
bush told the paper that since he got the loan the money was 
basically forgotten its been dormant 
bush told the washington post there was no conflict in his vote 
to approve silverado loans to walters who had in interest in 
bushs oil business he said he failed to mention his business 
connection with walters on required conflictofinterest forms but 
said other silverado officials knew of his ties 
im sure there was a disclosure he told the washington 
post that was looked into by legal counsel

coal lobbyist john harman recently sat down 
with treasury tax official kenneth gideon and tried to convince him 
that new energy levies would be a bad idea 
the only response harman got was a poker face 
he didnt really expect gideon to take a position on energy 
taxes now that president bush has conceded that budget negotiators 
must find new taxes to reduce the deficit 
in fact budget negotiators say the imposition of taxes on a 
broad range of fuels hasnt yet come up during their talks which 
resume today but for harman and other interest groups the 
lobbying battle is on already 
theyve been buttonholing administration officials and members 
of congress involved in the talks deluging them with letters 
petitions studies newspaper articles and other tools of 
persuasion 
the brewing fight over energy taxes is a case study of the 
dozens of tax and spending issues that budget negotiators must 
decide at stake are painful choices over who will pay for 50 
billion in savings being sought for next year 
we want to avoid these taxes and it would be almost too late 
already if it comes out of the budget summit said monica 
mcguire tax director for the national association of 
manufacturers her group which has organized a coalition of 
industries opposed to energy taxes has conducted a study that 
claims such taxes could add up to 20 billion a year to the deficit 
the national coal association is trying to rally opposition to 
new fuel taxes among coal state lawmakers on capitol hill the 
edison electric institute representing the nations electric 
utilities is urging bush and the budget negotiators to reject new 
taxes based on fuel emissions 
institute lobbyist judy boddie and her allies say higher fuel 
taxes would hinder us competitiveness cost jobs and worsen the 
deficit by slowing the economy 
on the other side of the issue the national wildlife federation 
is urging its 78000 members to write to congress in support of 
carbon fuel taxes it also is circulating a petition among other 
environmental groups which will be given to participants in the 
budget talks 
on behalf of our more than 8 million members we urge your 
support of carbon emission fees as an environmentally responsible 
way to reduce the federal budget deficit a draft of the letter 
says 
members of congress also are getting in on the lobbying act 
sens kent conrad dnd and alan simpson rwyo who represent 
states that would be hit hard by energy tax increases have gotten 
35 senators to sign a letter to bush opposing new energy taxes 
look at the politics said conrad theres a chance to 
sell it as a pollution fee and dodge the tax bullet it could come 
up at the last minute and develop a life of its own and then 
become part of a package and be far more difficult to defeat 
at least two types of broad energy taxes are being proposed 
one would base the tax on the amount of carbon an air 
pollutant in the fuel it would tax coal petroleum and natural 
gas but leave nuclear hydroelectric and solar energy untouched 
because they contain no carbon 
bargainers say the bush administration and some republican 
congressional leaders prefer a tax based on the amount of energy 
measured in british thermal units that a fuel contains the 
socalled btu tax would apply to all fuels and is believed to have 
a better chance of adoption 
budget negotiators say the lobbying is not likely to have a 
dramatic effect on their work 
the members of the budget summit have a pretty good feel for 
where the hot spots are said house budget committee chairman 
leon panetta dcalif one of the bargainers im not sure the 
lobbying is going to change those viewpoints

as many as 12000 mail sorting jobs at the 
post office could be shifted to private companies by 1995 under a 
plan announced by the us postal service 
the change could save the mail agency 43 billion over 10 
years assistant postmaster general peter jacobson said monday 
he said that hiring private firms to do specific sorting jobs 
could cut postal costs by 10 to 12 an hour per employee 
the announcement though described as preliminary comes as the 
agency faces contract negotiations with its major unions the 
postal service also has a proposal for a rate increase pending 
moe biller president of the american postal workers union 
quickly denounced the announcement as a disgrace 
they will do nothing with this but create more hostility more 
upset more apprehension among the workers said biller we will 
fight it on the beaches on the hill in negotiations wherever 
jacobson stressed in his announcement that no current postal 
worker need fear for his or her job although he said it is likely 
some will be changed to new duties or transferred to nearby 
facilities 
the focus of the decision is new automated equipment that 
permits letters that cannot be read by machine to be viewed on 
television screens where workers can type in the appropriate zip 
code allowing the letter to be handled by machinery from then on 
test equipment will be installed by bell and howell in nassau 
county ny and by trw in louisville ky this fall with 295 
systems planned across the country within three years 
with the remote video encoding system the workers typing in the 
codes do not have to be in the post office 
thus jacobson said contractors will be asked to bid on 
supplying workers and facilities and the post office will provide 
the equipment the contracts will be based on bids on sorting 
volumes of mail 
jacobson said the postal service projects that in 1992 the 
average postal worker will cost 2985 per hour including salary 
and benefits the cost for a workers in a private firm is expected 
to be 1452 he said with the cost of the building lease and 
telecommunications raising it to about 18 per hour 
the plan is for the sorting contractor to hire people to work 
five or six hours daily mostly in the evening after mail has been 
collected and needs to be sorted before delivery the assistant 
postmaster general explained 
that schedule would also cause problems if postal workers were 
used he said since they normally work eighthour shifts 
while the sorting jobs with a contractor are not necessarily 
fulltime jobs jacobson said the expected mail volume will require 
the equivalent of about 12000 fulltime people 
the postal service now employs about 800000 workers and annual 
attrition is about 20000 he said

unemployment in rural america has eased since 
the harsh times of the early 1980s but an agriculture department 
analyst says there are still pockets where jobs are scarce 
moreover said leslie a whitener of the departments economic 
research service the general improvement in the rural job picture 
apparently has stalled at least temporarily 
after declining for four years the rural unemployment rate 
remained unchanged from a year earlier in the first quarter of 
1990 averaging 66 percent 
this may mean that nonmetro rural employment rates are 
leveling off as rural areas complete their recovery whitener 
said or it may reflect the recent slowdown in the national 
economy 
whitener said current indicators do not point to a substantial 
weakening of the rural labor market although there will probably 
be a more moderate job growth and stable unemployment rates for 
the remainder of 1990 
on an annual basis rural unemployment rose to a peak of 101 
percent nationally in 1982 and 1983 it dropped to 62 percent in 
1988 and 57 percent in 1989 
whitener said that compares with a metro unemployment rate of 
52 percent last year before the slump of the early 1980s rural 
rates were lower than urban rates he said in the july issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine 
nonmetro employment conditions are increasingly important for 
farmers as greater numbers of farm families turn to offfarm 
earnings to supplement farm income he said 
according to the 1987 census of agriculture more than half of 
all farm operators held offfarm jobs that year 
while rural joblessness has declined overall many pockets of 
high unemployment persist whitener said unemployment in 
nonmetro counties in 1989 ranged from 12 percent in faulk county 
sd to 345 percent in starr county texas 
also he said some population groups particularly minorities 
and teenagers continue to dominate the unemployment picture 
in 1989 153 percent of the rural teenagers 12 percent of the 
blacks and 93 percent of hispanics were without jobs rural black 
teenagers were reported at an unemployment rate of more than 32 
percent 
about 2400 of the nations 3000plus counties are classified 
as rural of these 900 or 38 percent showed the brightest 
employment picture in 1989 
these counties were spread throughout the midwest new 
england the mountain states of nevada idaho and montana and the 
eastern seaboard states of virginia and north carolina whitener 
said 
a large proportion of these lowunemployment counties depend 
greatly on farming and farmdependent counties traditionally have 
had lower jobless rates he said even so many of these 
agricultural counties have had sizable population declines and 
little or no employment growth in recent years 
on the other hand more than 600 counties or 25 percent of all 
rural counties had unemployment rates of more than 8 percent one 
and onehalf times the national average last year 
some of these highunemployment counties particularly in 
texas alaska parts of the southeast and the mississippi delta are 
dependent on natural gas and oil production whitener said 
most of these counties have seen some decline in unemployment 
since 1986 but their rates are still high 
high unemployment rates in other rural counties have been more 
persistent over time he said mining areas of michigan oregon and 
parts of appalachia were hit hard during the early 1980s and have 
not yet fully recovered 
the manufacturing timber and resort areas of the northern 
pacific and great lakes states also have experienced persistently 
high unemployment rates largely because they depend on seasonal 
employment whitener said 
chronically high unemployment rates also typify the indian 
reservations of the northern plains and the southwest as well as 
areas of the mississippi delta and southeastern states with 
predominantly poor hispanic or black populations he said 
limited employment opportunities and work forces with low levels 
of education and training characterize many of these counties

a world away in moscow street vendors are lucky 
if they can offer puny plums and oddlooking strawberries consider 
the contrast with houston where summit diners today are feasting 
on mounds of luscious raspberries and rows of fresh shrimp 
food has been on everyones mind at the 16th annual economic 
summit 
for the leaders of the free world it is a question of how to 
help president mikhail gorbachev put enough food on soviet tables 
to calm growing political unrest 
that desire is shared by all the summit partners but they are 
divided over how to achieve it west germany and france favor hard 
cash the united states japan and britain are opposed 
but bush mindful of gorbachevs fragile hold on power may well 
offer the soviets help in distributing food more evenly throughout 
the country to alleviate the shortages which make food rationing a 
way of life for 287 million soviets 
in moscow for example shoppers were told at the end of may 
that each would be limited to 44 pounds of meat 22 pounds of 
sausages 11 pounds of cottage cheese 10 eggs and 44 pounds of 
bread the decree did not specify the duration of the rationing 
although such quantities are usually for one month 
on sunday night at the astrodome complex in houston hosts laid 
on 3 tons of barbecue meat and 1250 gallons of barbecue sauce 
sunday night at a rodeo and country music display for the leaders 
and several thousand guests 
on saturday night there were 4000 fresh oysters 1000 texas 
bobwhite quail 1500 alligator tails and 60 gallons of red beans 
and rice spread around four museums for an extravagant gala in 
which guests shuttled from site to site entertained by bands 
talking parrots and art masterpieces 
the event intended for the 3000 reporters accredited to the 
summit also drew houstons moneyed elite who raised 10 million 
to host the summit 
and then theres the 20000 tons of meat and fish among some 
250000 worth of food at the brown convention center where meals 
will be served continuously throughout the threeday summit to 
reporters and officials for free 
a pianist from the houston symphony plays soothing notes to help 
the diners digest in the 100000squarefoot hall outside 11 
refrigerated semitrailers store the food in the heavy heat 
a drop of that food could save many many lives said 
ytbarek cuddus a representative of the eritrean liberation front 
who is organizing a protest outside the summit site at rice 
university on tuesday 
relief organizations estimate some 15 million eritreans are in 
danger of starving the result of prolonged drought and nearly 30 
years of fighting to secede from ethiopia demonstrators will 
underline their concerns that in the rush to help the new 
democracies of eastern europe western leaders are ignoring the 
poorest countries of africa 
some houstonians too are upset by the summits bounty jon 
matthews host of a popular morning callin show on kprc radio 
said callers were irate at the free food for the media saying 
reporters have expense accounts they can feed themselves 
some suggested the money raised for the summit should have gone 
to feed the citys needy 
the summit caterers heeded the call in part 
the houston food bank which distributes food to 400 charities 
in a 25county area said it had been promised summit leftovers

a senate subcommittee chairman is asking 
whether a former aide to george bush used political influence on 
behalf of a businessman who acquired 15 insolvent savings and loans 
with a 1000 investment 
james m fail a phoenix insurance executive borrowed 70 
million while putting up the 1000 of his own in december 1988 to 
acquire the thrift institutions which now operate as the 
dallasbased bluebonnet savings bank 
fail was represented in the deal by robert j thompson once 
congressional liaison for president bush when he was vice president 
in a dec 5 1988 letter released monday by the senate 
judiciary subcommittee on antitrust monopolies and business 
rights thompson pressed m danny wall then chairman of the 
federal home loan bank board to make a decision on the deal 
time is of the essence and therefore we feel compelled to 
ask for a decision immediately thompson wrote addressing the 
letter to danny and signing it bob 
seventeen days later the bank board which has since been 
disbanded voted to award the thrifts to fail with an estimated 
government subsidy of 18 billion in 1988 dollars 
subsequently fail through bluebonnet and his insurance 
companies lent thompson more than 500000 356250 in a 
mortgage for a home in washington and a 150000 business loan 
according to documents released by the subcommittee 
lance morgan a spokesman for thompson said payments on both 
loans were current 
to what extent did robert thompsons political connections and 
personal friendships influence the outcome of the bidding 
process asked the subcommittee chairman sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio 
wall in a telephone interview said thompsons connections 
played no role in the decision he said he knew thompson as a 
lobbyist not as a friend and had not known him when he worked for 
bush in fact he said he knew a competing bidder weston edwards 
better 
metzenbaum the only subcommittee member present during a 
fourhour session monday said he would push the panel to subpoena 
fail thompson wall and others within the week all declined 
invitations to appear voluntarily 
they have failed to show up until this point we intend to get 
them here they owe the public an explanation metzenbaum said 
fails attorney stanley m brand in a statement released after 
the hearing challenged the subcommittees jurisdiction to look 
into sampl matters 
he said it was misleading to say fail had bought bluebonnet for 
only 1000 because he had pledged his holdings as collateral for 
the 70 million in loans 
it is not difficult to conclude that todays hearing was 
motivated by sheer political opportunism brand said labeling 
metzenbaum a political vigilante 
wall complained that metzenbaum was presenting information 
very selectively and said he had declined to testify only 
because he wasnt given enough time to prepare he said he was 
willing to present his case before the panel 
in the waning months of the reagan administration the bank 
board under wall concluded scores of bailout deals more than 200 
in 1988 over 70 in december alone 
wall said the deals are saving taxpayers money outside 
analysts estimate 1 billion a month compared with the cost of 
liquidating the institutions liquidation was not a practical 
option in any case because regulators did not have the cash to do 
that until congress enacted the sampl bailout in august 1989 he said 
metzenbaum said he would continue to investigate the other 
transactions 
i dont believe this is the only deal that was made that has 
questions surrounding it he said

gen maxwell thurman the field commander in 
charge of the us invasion of panama is being treated for 
suspected leukemia at walter reed army medical center according to 
the pentagon 
thurman 59 will undergo additional tests to determine what 
treatment may be appropriate the pentagon said monday in a brief 
statement 
the fourstar general is head of the us southern command 
based in panama and is in charge of all us forces in central and 
south america 
the general took over the command on sept 30 1989 and was 
dubbed mad max for his feisty and aggressive style 
a native of high point nc and a graduate of north carolina 
state university at raleigh thurman has served more than 36 years 
in the army 
besides his current position he has served as the armys vice 
chief of staff its deputy chief of staff for personnel and 
commander of the training and doctrine unit 
thurman has been widely credited with convincing the pentagon 
leadership and bush administration to use military force in 
response to gen manuel noriegas regime in panama 
he played a central role in drafting the plans for the december 
invasion along with the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen 
colin powell 
the general was scheduled to take mandatory retirement august 
1989 but defense secretary dick cheney insisted he take over the 
southern command and help with the administrations struggle to 
deal with noriega in the wake of allegations the panamanian 
dictator was involved in drug trafficking

thurman pledged he would confront tyranny in all its insidious 
forms 
the general made his mark as an aggressive takecharge 
commander who didnt hesitate to work around the clock said

armys recruiting command at fort sheridan ill where he worked 
to develop the services wellknown be all that you can be

leaders of the worlds seven richest nations 
failed to find a common approach to shore up the sickly soviet 
economy but moved monday toward a summit compromise allowing each 
country to go its own way on financial assistance to moscow 
trade and environmental disputes as well as japans unpopular 
campaign to ease sanctions against china also tested the harmony 
as the 16th annual economic summit began its first postcold war 
session 
at a dinner hosted by president bush at a houston mansion the 
leaders focused on soviet aid and china their foreign ministers 
dining at a restaurant grappled with the same issues a us 
official said the problems have not been put to bed but said 
that some recent liberalization in beijing will be welcomed 
a japanese foreign ministry official said prime minister toshiki 
kaifu told the other leaders he will resume 52 billion in loans 
to china that were interrupted last year 
french presidential spokesman hubert vedrine said there are 
still differences of opinion on how to deal with the soviet aid 
question in a political communique to be issued tuesday 
a tentative draft awaiting final approval by the leaders made 
no direct reference to the soviets plight but prescribed 
economic assistance as appropriate to countries moving toward 
democracy that leaves the door open for summit countries to act 
individually 
very good discussions said president bush as the initial 
talks concluded on the overriding issue no one was pretending the 
leaders had found commond ground but mondays meeting seemed to 
eliminate any formal objections to any of the allies sending cash 
to moscow 
west germany france and italy are ready to send direct aid to 
the soviets while the united states britain and japan are 
pressing for additional economic reform canada is in the middle 
extending commercial credits but not cold cash 
its premature to say they have settled on any one course of 
action white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said after the 
leaders first meeting our feeling is individual countries 
certainly are free to follow their own dictates on these matters 
we must not put ourselves in the position of propping up 
regimes that have only halfchanged so we make it easier for them 
to avoid the full rigors of change said britains margaret 
thatcher emphasizing her opposition to soviet aid 
on the other side frances francois mitterrand said if we 
dont decide now to help the soviet union there is a risk that 
there will be no progress no further reform of the soviet 
political system mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut kohl 
have pushed for a 15billion aid package 
diplomatic sources said six of the nations are inclined to 
maintain trade restrictions against china with only japan poised 
to end the commercial sanctions imposed after last years 
antidemocracy crackdown 
on economic disputes europeans are resisting bushs staunch 
demand for phasing out farm subsidies over the next 10 years and 
together with canada are pushing washington for agreement on new 
steps to halt global warming 
putting the best face on environmental differences fitzwater 
said the leaders would pronounce general agreement on issues such 
as protection against pollution preservation of forests and other 
global problems 
kohl disputed bush saying that decisive measures rather than 
more study are urgently needed to reduce the greenhouse 
effect the gradual warming of the earth attributed to emissions 
from autos and manufacturing 
on trade bush argued very forcefully for phasing out 
billions of dollars of agricultural subsidies but met resistance 
from european leaders the white house fears that global free trade 
talks will collapse without a resolution of the farm dispute 
cannon salutes and military pageantry greeted the leaders of 
west germany britain france italy canada and japan as they 
assembled on the campus of rice university for three days of talks 
in his welcoming remarks as summit host bush challenged his 
partners to bring a new stability and prosperity to the world by 
tapping the power and energy of free wills and free markets 
the summit debate on soviet aid was closely monitored in moscow 
senior soviet officials rejected bushs reasons for resisting 
help for the soviet union the president has expressed concerns 
over soviet military spending its subsidies for cuba and the lack 
of reforms in moscows governmentcontrolled economy 
to dictate conditions to such a country as the soviet union a 
great power is embarrassing said gorbachev staff member georgy 
shakhnazarov we arent taking orders 
reporting on the summit discussion of gorbachevs plea for aid 
french spokesman hubert edrine said there were shades of 
differences but nobody said no 
gorbachev also was seeking a sustained economic dialogue 
between moscow and the summit nations winning support from 
canadas brian mulroney 
in the absence of unanimity on soviet aid the leaders appeared 
ready to send a team of western bankers and other experts to moscow 
to assess needs in transportation marketing and other areas 
diplomatic sources said 
fitzwater predicted the summit would produce a strong statement 
of support for reforms in eastern europe and for mikhail s 
gorbachevs perestroika program of economic reforms and would 
recognize the need of each country to act on an individual basis in 
terms of direct financial assistance 
bush told kohl he understands bonns desire to give unilateral 
support to the soviet union fitzwater said west germany eager to 
remove obstacles to unification with east germany has pledged 3 
billion in credits to moscow 
bush is offering the soviets technical assistance for 
transportation and agriculture and advice on developing freemarket 
mechanisms staff chief john sununu noted that the soviets 
currently lose almost half their grain crop through faulty storage 
officials said the leaders would approve an assessment team to 
recommend applications for western assistance sununu said the 
study might be conducted by a mixture of western financing 
agencies including the world bank and the international monetary 
fund 
a british official said the foreign ministers meeting 
separately agreed there should be a full analysis of soviet 
requirements before a joint decision on aid 
at an outdoor welcoming ceremony airconditioned and shortened 
because of the unrelenting texas heat bush said a new world of 
freedom lays before us hopeful confident a world where peace 
endures where commerce has a conscience and where all that seems 
possible is possible 
so let us begin in good faith to set the stage for the new 
millennium the president said 
after the ceremony the leaders adjourned to a cavernous meeting 
room for talks around a long oval table the meeting was a prelude 
to freewheeling political discussions over dinner at bayou bend a 
stately mansion that once was the home of the late ima hogg the 
oilrich daughter of the first nativeborn governor of texas 
on two other issues unanimity was easy 
the summit leaders will condemn terrorism and deplore the 
proliferation of missiles and nuclear chemical and biological 
weapons technology 
the argument over farm subsidies turned bitter at a may meeting 
attended by us and european officials frans andriessen the 
communitys top trade official said in houston that continued 
pressure by the united states would backfire and make it even 
harder to reach a compromise 
yet sununu said it is crucial it is critical it should and 
must be done the united states believes in that issue so strongly 
that we will continue to make that point to our allies

president violeta barrios de chamorro 
called out the army monday night to quell protests by thousands of 
sandinistas who have blocked streets with barricades and fought 
her supporters with guns fists and rocks 
gunfire could be heard in many parts of the nicaraguan capital 
but reporters could get not close because of the shooting 
police sources who insisted on anonymity said at least three 
people were killed and more than 100 injured in the unrest which 
began sunday night 
mrs chamorro addressed the nation on state radio and television 
as thousands of sandinistas backing a weeklong wave of strikes 
returned to the streets and defying government orders erected 
more barricades 
there was some question however of whether the 
sandinistadominated army would support mrs chamorro 
in the speech the president urged democratic nicaraguans not 
to let themselves be provoked and not to answer violence with 
violence which has already claimed victims 
the speech was delayed for four hours as police cleared 
prosandinista students and workers who had seized a government 
broadcasting center 
mrs chamorro who took office in april after handing the 
sandinistas a stunning electoral defeat said her government was 
committed to national reconciliation that ought to occur in a 
climate of peace and understanding not of fear and intimidation 
nicaraguas economy has been battered by nearly 10 years of war 
between the sandinistas and the now disbanded usbacked contra 
rebels and by an economic embargo by the reagan administration 
mrs chamorro accused the leftist sandinistas of directing the 
nationwide strike and inciting unrest despite their defeat in 
february elections at the hands of her usbacked coalition the 
sandinistas remain the countrys largest political force 
the strikes which have plunged nicaragua into chaos were 
called in part to protest what unions say are massive firings by 
the chamorro government workers also want a greater voice in 
setting economic policy 
daniel ortega who mrs chamorro unseated as president urged 
her government to negotiate 
this conflict cannot be solved by force any attempt in that 
direction is an invitation to chaos he said in a radio interview 
the road to the international airport was blocked monday night 
by barricades made of paving stones police using backhoes had 
cleared debris earlier but the strikers blocked the road again 
the demonstrators burned rubber tires and trash alongside the 
barricades monday night sending smoke billowing over the city 
it was reminiscent of the 1979 revolution when sandinistas 
built roadblocks in their fight to overthrow dictator gen 
anastasio somoza 
electricity and water service to most of this city of about 1 
million were cut off an air traffic controllers strike closed the 
airport 
mail service and operatorassisted phone calls have been 
suspended since last week strike leaders claim more than 80000 
public and private sector workers have joined the walkout which 
began last week with sporadic strikes 
the strikes are directed against government offices public 
transportation telephone and mail services banks and staterun 
agriculture textile and construction businesses 
despite the reports on casualties from police sources dr 
gustavo fletes chief of the emergency ward at lenin fonseca 
hospital said in a telephone interview he had knowledge of only 
one person killed and 20 injured 
manolo morales hospital another center for emergency cases 
said it had no dead but only 10 injured some of them seriously 
other private and public hospitals checked said they had no victims 
from street fighting 
carlos torres an announcer at radio corporacion said four 
guards were wounded when a group of men armed with ak47 automatic 
rifles tried to shoot their way into the privately owned 
broadcasting station 
torres said radio corporacion employees had received anonymous 
telephone threats saying the station would be burned down 
he said radio corporacion went off the air shortly after the 
attack monday night for reasons that i do not know 
mrs chamorro took office amid high hopes she could resolve the 
nations economic crisis and its bitter political divisions 
at least 30000 people died in that conflict 
the government suspended talks with the strikers over the 
weekend saying negotiations must deal only with labor issues not 
political topics 
it declared the strike illegal claiming it was politically 
motivated the declaration allows the government to fire striking 
workers 
thousands of nicaraguans with machetes and clubs swarmed into 
managuas streets sunday night and monday morning to light bonfires 
and build barricades the barricades kept many workers from 
reporting to their jobs 
in the lowincome eastern neighborhoods protesters passed 
paving stones from hand to hand to build roadblocks and burned huge 
bonfires of old tires 
it was in those neighborhoods that some of the most intense 
fighting took place during the 1979 revolution and where sandinista 
support is still strong

new zealand filed a formal complaint to france over the agents 
repatriation and asked unsuccessfully that they be returned to

a parents group is battling charges of 
censorship as its campaign for voluntary warning stickers on 
records promoting bigotry rape and murder wins allies in 
legislatures and within the music industry 
the parents music resource center founded by elizabeth 
tipper gore says it is promoting truthinpackaging to help 
parents and their children deal with an entertainment culture that 
is increasingly violent and sexually explicit 
part of our problem is our culture tends to look at children 
as miniature adults said jennifer norwood executive director of 
the parents group we expect them to handle things theyre not 
ready to handle yet at their age groups like 2 live crew are 
dealing with adult issues 
but some opponents say the labels are censorship because artists 
and record companies are pressured to use them 
the labels are an invitation to be prosecuted and persecuted 
its a guilty plea said dave marsh editor and publisher of rock 
amp roll confidential a monthly magazine 
the arlingtonbased parents group has made big strides since its 
founding in 1985 by gore the wife of sen albert gore dtenn 
four years ago the recording industry association of america 
under pressure from the group added warning stickers to certain 
albums the associations members produce about 90 percent of the 
recordings made and sold in the united states 
that effort led to a wide variety of warnings some smaller than 
a postage stamp before the industry settled earlier this year on a 
standardized sticker that reads explicit lyrics parental 
advisory the records with the black and white labels are due out 
this month 
ms norwood said parents in her group realize from their own 
experience as teenagers that there always will be a musical 
generation gap 
the purpose of rock n roll has always been to a degree to 
shock parents she said 
but the ground rules have changed she said some of todays 
music promotes bigotry rape and murder she and others charge 
five years ago i had transcribed lyrics and a lot of them were 
pretty raunchy and pretty extreme said maryland legislator 
judith toth but what im seeing now is really something else a 
lot of it is racist a lot of it is very clearly against women 
its not just obscene its downright filthy 
for example a song by rigor mortis graphically describes 
cutting off a womans legs arms and head after sex a song by 
nwa uses a derogatory word for blacks and describes gunning them 
down 
opponents of labels say they inhibit artistic creativity 
the american civil liberties union opposes any industrywide 
labeling including the ratings on movies said barry lynn aclu 
legislative counsel in washington 
even if they were really voluntary if there had been no 
pressure to do this from anyone there are still likely to be 
record stores that will not carry stickered material because of 
fear of protest from other pressure groups lynn said 
a federal judge in florida has declared 2 live crews album as 
nasty as they wanna be obscene three members of the rap group 
were arrested june 10 in hollywood fla on charges of giving an 
obscene performance 
record stores in several states including virginia have pulled 
the record and others like it from the shelves or made them 
offlimits to children 
the louisiana legislature passed a bill saturday that would ban 
the sale of labeled records to minors 
greg werkman general manager of the san franciscobased 
independent label alternative tentacles said his label has lost 
sales because it does not use warning stickers he said its sales 
dropped about 20 percent since the stickers came out because stores 
are not selling the records or are putting them in areas offlimits 
to people under 18 
pmrc will tell you its voluntary werkman said what 
theyre doing is putting pressure on us trying to turn us into bad 
guys 
there is a degree of pressure advocates for warning labels 
concede 
but the pressure is being brought to bear by the hundreds of 
thousands of people who say they want this ms norwood said 
several polls have shown that about 75 percent of adults want 
some kind of information on records and tapes describing the 
contents she said 
ava marshall shopping at a richmond record store said she 
thought the labels were a good idea 
it may help with children not purchasing things with explicit 
sex in it said ms marshall 35

gov buddy roemer is not saying whether 
he will sign a bill banning most abortions even though it was 
apparently drafted to his orders 
louisiana lawmakers tacked rape and incest exceptions onto the 
bill they passed late sunday in an attempt to appease roemer who 
had vetoed an earlier version of the bill which did not include 
such exemptions 
but roemer left open the possibility of another veto he said he 
was unhappy the way the bill was amended onto a gutted antiflag 
burning measure only 26 hours before the legislative sessions 
expiration at midnight monday 
its unfortunate that legislation this important would be done 
at the last minute roemer said monday 
and i just want to remind everybody that an option was given 
by me long ago to work this thing out to the satisfaction of the 
vast majority in this state and its unfortunate that some for a 
variety of reasons waited until the last minute to give us a 
bill 
in particular roemer said he objected to a requirement that 
rape be reported to authorities within seven days 
the sevenday provision on rape is a problem he said 
although he called the measure a step in the right direction 
roemer who is up for reelection next year refused to say when 
he would act on the bill he did not receive a copy of the bill 
until monday afternoon 
the new measure was drafted only when it became clear late 
sunday that supporters of the previous bill could not muster a 
twothirds vote in the senate for a veto override 
like the vetoed measure the new one would send doctors who 
perform abortions to jail for up to 10 years with maximum fines of 
100000 
roemer said he was troubled by the way the bill was amended to 
rep james david cains legislation that would have eliminated jail 
terms and lowered the fines under simple battery laws for people 
convicted of beating a flag burner 
louisianas constitution requires that amendments to a bill be 
germane to the original subject matter the language the senate 
added to cains bill after scuttling the flagburner provisions may 
fail that test roemer said 
roemer has 20 days to veto the bill if he issues another veto 
lawmakers would have to use a mail ballot to call themselves back 
into a veto session to attempt an override no louisiana 
legislature has overridden a governors veto this century 
if roemer does not veto the bill or if a veto is overridden the 
bill would become law sept 7

the environmental protection agency is issuing 
new hazardous waste cleanup regulations that it says could cost 
industry as much as 42 billion to comply with 
epa administrator william k reilly on monday called the plan 
a pragmatic approach for correcting existing problems and said 
it will ensure to the extent practical prevention of releases 
that might threaten human health and the environment 
the proposed standards and procedures drafted to carry out 
requirements of the resource conservation and recovery act will be 
published later this month in the federal register 
epa said the new regulations would affect 3000 to 4000 
facilities including several hundred owned by the federal 
government 
the agency estimated it could cost privately owned facilities 
between 7 billion and 42 billion to meet the requirements the 
price tag for federal facilities would total 3 billion to 18 
billion epa said in a statement 
the wide range of the cost estimates is due to markedly varied 
conditions from site to site involving uncertain levels of ground 
water monitoring and cleanup the agency said 
industries affected would include petroleum refiners wood 
preservers metal finishers and auto manufacturers

many temporary census workers may be 
ineligible for unemployment compensation when their jobs end 
because of a change in the law 
the actual number of people affected is hard to estimate because 
rules for unemployment compensation eligibility vary from state to 
state neither congressional or census spokesmen would estimate the 
number affected 
in the past temporary census jobs have counted toward 
eligibility for unemployment compensation just as any other job 
however this year an appropriations bill signed by president 
bush on may 25 set an april 20 cutoff on census workers getting 
credit toward unemployment temporary census work done after that

president bushs son neil says he is fed up 
with sitting on the sideline while being publicly attacked for his 
savings and loan dealings and is coming out of his cage to 
defend himself 
in an eightpage statement issued over the weekend and in a 
series of interviews bush contends he has done nothing wrong in 
connection with the failure of silverado savings amp loan and 
maintains he has become a political football a victim of 
political opportunism and press sensationalism 
in an interview published in todays editions of the washington 
post bush said it would have been much easier to sign a civil 
decree sought by sampl regulators and move on in terms of just the 
quality of my life 
in the consent decree sought several months ago bush would 
have agreed to abstain from further banking activities without 
acknowledging any wrongdoing 
the 35yearold bush said his decision to seek full exoneration 
rather than sign the decree has resulted in negative publicity that 
has dominated my life for six months and also may help 
democrats gain political advantage against his father the president 
still he said he decided to fight because i know i havent 
done anything wrong 
he said he is looking forward to a public hearing on his case in 
september before an administrative law judge in denver that he says 
will offer an unbiased quasilegal forum for his defense 
ive been kind of like a little cagedin animal in an 
unsanitary zoo bush told the post in an interview in his denver 
office now my cage is open and im telling people what my 
side of the story is and i feel good about it 
bush conceded in the post interview that he got an incredibly 
sweet deal in the form of a 100000 loan from a denver investor 
that he wasnt required to repay if the oil business the loan was 
intended to benefit did not turn a profit but he said the loan was 
totally unrelated to his work as a director of silverado even 
though the investor who made the investment loan subsequently was 
granted a line of credit from silverado 
bush noted that the investor kenneth good made similar loans 
to other denver area businessmen under similar circumstances 
including one for 350000 but of course that wont be of any 
kind of interest because his name doesnt relate to somebody 
famous bush said of the 350000 loan 
in an interview published over the weekend in the denver post 
bush said silverado was doomed to die before he became a 
director because it carried 1 billion in commercial real estate 
loans at a time the colorado market was faltering 
regulators say bush failed to disclose a series of business 
deals with developers good and bill walters who defaulted on a 
combined 130 million in loans from silverado 
bush said the same thrift regulators from the federal home loan 
bank of topeka kan who approved the loans that contributed to 
silverados failure are now trying to blame him for the thrifts 
collapse 
its selfserving the regulators are politically motivated 
he said 
in his eightpage statement bush said he was seeking an 
unbiased and unpolitically motivated forum 
i think the administrative law judge will provide that 
forum he said in the post interview the system will work

damage or injuries 
the quake which measured about 66 on the richter scale jolted 
a junglecovered area about 50 miles north of juba in southern 
sudan on monday night 
on may 20 the same area was hit by a quake measuring 75 on the 
richter scale followed by a series of aftershocks 
ezzeldin ibrahim director of the earthquake department at 
egypts national research institute of astronomy and geophysics 
said the quake measured 66 on the richter scale 
the hong kong observatory said today it had recorded the quake 
at 65 on the richter scale the scale is a gauge of the energy 
released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded 
on a seismograph an increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
juba is 750 miles south of the sudanese capital khartoum

grim statistics point to a crisis for the 
nations black men and the black community must do a better job 
nurturing and educating its boy children a panel concluded at the 
naacp convention 
almost one in four black men between the ages of 20 and 29 are 
in jail on parole or on probation according to a recent study by 
the nonprofit sentencing project the same study found that fewer 
young black attend college than are in the criminal justice system 
black men in inner city neighborhoods are less likely to reach 
65 than men in bangladesh one of the worlds poorest nations 
violence is the leading cause of death for blacks ages 15 to 25 
if we cannot turn these numbers around they threaten the very 
existence of this race said beverly cole director of education 
and health for the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
the panel highlighted the first day of activities by the 3000 
delegates to the convention which ends thursday in an opening 
ceremony actress esther rolle became the first woman to be 
presented with the naacps annual civil rights leadership award 
among featured speakers will be gov douglas wilder of virginia 
talk show host oprah winfrey and the rev jesse jackson 
most panel members speaking monday agreed education provided a 
key to salvation for black society 
we need as black parents to get more involved in the 
education of our children said john w diggs an official with 
the national institutes of health weve been turning over the 
education of our children to a white power structure 
in the face of declining numbers of young black men in higher 
education blacks must continue to fight a perception that blacks 
particularly black males are academic underachievers the panel 
concluded 
if being smart is being white then what does being black 
mean asked jawanza kunjufu a chicago school curriculum expert 
if speaking right is acting white what is being black 
he urged black men who have been successful in business 
education and other fields to be role models in addition more 
black men must enter the teaching profession kunjufu said

hikers are being discouraged from 
stopping or straying along a 14mile stretch of the appalachian 
trail in tennessee because of booby traps and suspicious brush 
fires 
forest service officials blamed the incidents including the 
stringing of fish hooks at eye and hiplevel across paths on a 
dispute with landowners who fear their property will be seized to 
create a buffer along the trail 
no injuries have been reported along the route that stretches 
21428 miles from maine to georgiae and no arrests have been made 
congress has mandated that the forest service acquire about 500 
feet on each side of the trail but a forest service spokesman 
bill sweet said the agency does not intend to confiscate anyones 
land in the dispute 
signs encourage hikers not to stop or leave the trail between 
roan mountain tenn and the north carolina border 
hikers have been scared by them and since we dont know what 
were dealing with thats a good thing said brian king of the 
appalachian trail conference a hikers federation 
we havent had any problems there since late april when a 
shelter along the trail was burned down king said no decision has 
been made on when the signs may be removed he said

japans only nuclearpowered ship left port today 
in its first attempt to sail under nuclear power 
the experimental ship mutsu long plagued by technical problems 
and antinuclear protests had attempted a maiden voyage in 1974 
but the bid was cut short by a radiation leak in the protective 
shield of its nuclear reactor 
the 8242ton ship sailed from the sekinehama port 360 miles 
northeast of tokyo in aomori prefecture under conventional power 
it was not to sail under nuclear power until it was 110 miles 
out to sea said yuwao ikezawa spokesman of the atomic energy 
research institute 
police in aomori prefecture said about two dozen antinuclear 
activists protested todays sailing by burning old tires near the 
port but no major trouble was reported 
ocean trials lasting about 20 days will be conducted in an area 
where they will not interfere with fishing ikezawa said the 
spokesman said the reactor would be raised to 50 percent capacity 
in the first week and 70 percent the following week 
the reactor was tested at about 20 percent capacity last week 
while the mutsu was still in port he said 
in the last 3 months tests were cut short five times because 
of technical problems there were no radiation leaks during the 
shutdowns the spokesman said 
the reactor which has an output capacity of 36000 kilowatts 
had been mothballed since the 1974 leak 
when the leak occurred the research vessel drifted for 50 days 
in the pacific because residents did not want it to return to its 
home port then more protests complicated the search for a berth 
where it could be repaired 
institute officials have said that if these tests go smoothly 
the ship will make another test voyage in august then a yearlong 
experimental trip 
it is to be retired after the tests

mobil oil corp has agreed to pump dry an 
underground lake of oil gasoline and naphtha that leaked from a 
creekside terminal during the last halfcentury and collected under 
streets of brooklyn 
the 145 million gallon pool of petroleum products is larger 
than the amount lost in the nations largest onetime oil spill 
the nearly 11 million gallons that leaked from the tanker exxon 
valdez off alaska last year 
while the alaska spill fouled beaches and killed wildlife the 
brooklyn oil remains beneath the surface floating atop an aquifer 
an underground pool of water not used for drinking 
state officials said it will take years and cost tens of 
millions of dollars to remove the oil 
mobil spokesman mark cohen said monday it was unlikely the oil 
once recovered could be used mobil first will try to gauge the 
size of the spill then decide how many wells are needed to pump it 
out and where to put them 
cohen said mobil would pay to have the petroleum products 
disposed of properly but said he did not know how or where that 
would be done 
the state believes mobil is primarily responsible for the spill 
and it may have sued had mobil not agreed to the cleanup said ben 
marvin spokesman for the state department of environmental 
conservation 
under this agreement mobil has accepted responsibility 
marvin said 
cohen said mobil has stated in the past that we will do 
whatever is necessary to remedy whatever were responsible for 
right now we think that the problem deserves attention and were 
going to do whatever we can to accelerate the cleanup thats our 
primary concern 
the oil and other petroleum products leaked from the greenpoint 
terminal a complex on newtown creek where fuel has been stored 
since after the civil war the leaks date at least to world war ii 
marvin said 
while mobil believes the spilled fuel does not endanger health 
the community is concerned about the problem cohen said the 
state is concerned obviously its something that shouldnt be 
there 
authorities have known of the problem at least since 1950 when 
gasoline fumes exploded in a sewer on henry street in 1978 they 
size of the spill was estimated at 17 million gallons of that 
about 25 million gallons have been pumped out in a cleanup program 
that began in 1981 
no fuel is known to be leaking from the greenpoint terminal now 
although authorities cannot be certain about the condition of 
underground pipes marvin said the terminal is still is in use 
and mobil recently paid a 500000 civil penalty for failing to 
report immediately a 50000gallon kerosene spill there in february

two veteran astronauts heirs to a 
daredevil tradition were grounded by nasa for risky flying after 
one was involved in a fatal crash and another flew too close to an 
airliner 
navy cmdr robert l hoot gibson and navy capt david m 
walker both shuttle commanders were disciplined monday for 
violating johnson space center flight crew guidelines 
this is the first time we have removed crew members from 
flights for disciplinary reasons said nasa spokesman jeff carr 
one space expert said the pair may just have had too much of the 
right stuff 
its a special breed of man who wants to climb to the top of 
the heap in the most dangerous profession there is said lloyd 
swenson a space history expert at the university of houston 
swenson said astronauts realize working with highperformance 
aircrafts in a test capacity is putting the human body as well as 
the human mind at risk unfortunately sometimes those people who 
like to do those tests make an error in judgment 
gibson 43 was pulled from shuttle flight assignments and 
barred for a year from making t38 jet trainer flights for 
violating a policy that restricts highrisk recreational activities 
for astronauts named to flight crews carr said 
the move followed a weekend air show race near new braunfels 
texas in which gibsons stunt plane collided with another stunt 
plane sending the other pilot hurtling to his death in a corn 
field gibson landed his plane safely 
walker 46 was suspended for 60 days for infractions that 
included an incident last year in which the t38 he was flying came 
within 100 feet of a pan am jetliner in a nearcollision outside 
washington carr said 
gibson had piloted an eightday challenger mission in 1984 and 
commanded a 1986 columbia mission and a 1988 atlantis mission 
walker piloted a shuttle flight in 1984 and was commander of 
atlantis during a fourday flight in 1989 
walker did not return a call monday gibson has an unlisted 
number 
harlan j smith of the university of texas at austin who has 
taught science to astronauts said they are risktakers by nature 
the work is so fascinating that they volunteer for a duty 
where the know the risk every time the rockets are lit and they 
rather cheerfully take that risk smith said 
but smith said nasa must keep them from daredevil conduct off 
duty because an awful lot has been invested in these people 
swenson indicated the astronauts would understand their 
punishments 
theyre jet jockeys no doubt about that but theyre also 
naval officers who are used to discipline he said swenson 
chronicled nasa history from 1963 to 1973 providing research for 
tom wolfes book the right stuff on the mercury astronauts 
carr said the timing of the two groundings was coincidence the 
decision to ground walker was made a week ago but the announcement 
was delayed while authorities searched for a replacement for him on 
next years pentagon shuttle flight carr said 
air force col frederick d gregory will replace walker as crew 
commander on that flight 
gibson widely regarded as one of the shuttle programs most 
skilled fliers was slated to command a fourth mission late next 
year nasa did not immediately name a replacement 
meanwhile the precise location of the hydrogen leak that 
grounded the shuttle fleet still eludes nasa engineers but 
officials are looking for a test on atlantis later this week to 
provide answers 
a laboratory test in california over the weekend confirmed there 
is a problem in the design or assembly of a liquid hydrogen 
plumbing system on the shuttle the space agency said 
william lenoir nasa space flight director said engineers plan 
a fullscale leak test on atlantis on friday or saturday 
witnesses said space shuttle astronaut s david griggs was 
killed performing aerial stunts when his world war ii vintage plane 
crashed in an arksansas wheat field on june 17 1989

as many as 800 people may have died in ethnic 
clashes last month along the border between the soviet central 
asian republics of uzbekistan and kirghizia a soviet newspaper 
reported today

fighting near the kirghiz town of osh on the border between the two 
republics 
but police maj gen am kotlyarov told the newspaper 
komsomolskaya pravda that about 800 people could not be accounted 
for the report said 
many were thought to have been wounded in the fighting then 
carried by relatives into the surrounding mountains those who died 
from their wounds were buried without notification to soviet 
authorities the newspaper said

committed in fergana azerbaijan and armenia said the major 
referring to ethnic clashes in other republics that have claimed 
hundreds of lives

izvestia said monday a state of emergency was in effect in the 
town of jalalabad where a 20yearold uzbek was killed over the 
weekend 
the suspected killers were in custody izvestia reported but 
crowds of angry uzbeks took to the streets monday demanding more 
members of their ethnic group be included in law enforcement and 
kgb bodies it said 
no fighting was reported but police reinforcements sent to the 
area stopped a truck full of people armed with hunting rifles and 
knives headed toward jalalabad 
both the uzbek and kirghiz ethnic groups are moslem and speak 
turkish dialects the border has been the scene of repeated clashes 
over land and water rights fueled by other disputes

hugh hewitt the librarys director had said for example that 
reporter bob woodward would be barred because he is an 
irresponsible journalist 
woodward along with carl bernstein wrote pulitzer 
prizewinning stories in the washington post that helped uncover 
the watergate scandal and lead to nixons resignation in 1974 
nixons personal assistant john taylor said monday that nixon 
wants scholars wishing to use the library to be admitted without 
regard to their opinions on any subject as long as they are 
qualified and responsible 
an exhibition section at the 21 million library and museum is 
scheduled to be dedicated july 19 in a ceremony to be attended by 
president bush and former presidents reagan and ford the archives 
will open in fall 1991 
taylor said library officials had been working long hours to 
meet the opening deadline and had not had the opportunity to give 
much thought to the access question 
taylor also said community and political groups will be allowed 
to use the library for events which hewitt had said would be 
restricted to republican fundraisers 
i dont anticipate that a lot of democratic organizations will 
want to host events there but former president nixon sees no 
reason why they should be excluded from doing so taylor said 
taylor said every document of importance from the nixon 
administration including many relating to watergate will be 
displayed

a federal judge hearing a challenge to georgias 
election law says its unlikely hell do anything to affect next 
weeks primary because he wasnt asked to until last week 
a group of black officials led by state rep tyrone brooks of 
atlanta charged in a lawsuit in may that a 1964 rule requiring a 
majority vote to win an election is racially discriminatory the 
plaintiffs want to change the rule so the candidate with the most 
votes wins whether its more than half or not 
us district judge richard c freeman said monday that though 
the suit was filed in may a motion asking him to rule in time to 
eliminate the majorityvote requirement in the july 17 primary was 
filed only last week at the last minute 
he indicated he was not likely to agree to the move 
former atlanta mayor andrew young who is trying to become 
georgias first black governor is not supporting the brooks 
lawsuit but political observers say its a strong possibility 
young could win a plurality in the fiveway democratic primary but 
lose a runoff which would be held aug 7 
freeman did not indicate if he was leaning toward either side in 
deciding the lawsuit but when david walbert an attorney 
representing the state asked if todays session could be delayed a 
few hours freeman responded the longer we wait the harder it 
will be to get this done i dont think it will be done anyway 
to be perfectly frank 
walbert would not comment on the judges remarks 
laughlin mcdonald an american civil liberties union attorney 
for the brooks group said that suing prior to the election gives 
the plaintiffs the option if the judge rules against them of 
challenging the election results 
the first witness in the hearing monday was a history and 
political science professor from the california institute of 
technology who testified there were numerous indications that the 
georgia legislature had racial motivations in enacting the 
majorityvote law 
j morgan kousser author of a book on southern politics said 
the law was pushed through the legislature by state rep denmark 
groover a segregationist after national civil rights legislation 
abolished a system that awarded candidates electoral votes by 
county 
kousser said there are other signs that lawmakers in 1964 wanted 
to keep blacks out of public office including an attempt to 
stiffen the literacy test for voter registration 
walbert said the professor was relying too much on secondhand 
information such as old newspaper clippings to draw his 
conclusions

sponsors health programs and development projects in third world 
countries 
speaking on the second day of the threeday summit carter said 
health care and food production programs are not being implemented 
in areas where there are civil wars

bodies like the oau the united nations and the organization of 
american states to intervene in conflicts between revolutionary 
groups and unrecognized governments 
he singled out liberia mozambique ethiopia somalia and sudan 
where populations have been shattered by war 
carter lamented that national budgets in poor countries are 
mostly used to buy weapons and deploy large armies gravely 
affecting food output and economic growth 
last year carter chaired inconclusive peace talks between rebel 
and government representatives from both sudan and ethiopia 
julius nyerere former president of tanzania and a former oau 
chairman said africa is the continent hardest hit by economic

yugoslavias president borisav jovic 
said today the troubled balkan country may soon hold a national 
referendum to decide if the nations six republics should split 
into separate nations 
the right of selfdetermination including the right of 
secession is a natural political right of each nationality which 
no one can question jovic said in a speech to a war veterans 
congress 
this also means that each of our peoples can decide to remain 
in the yugoslav community or leave it said jovic the head of 
yugoslavias eightmember state presidency 
yugoslavias communist party continues to run the country on the 
federal level but its authority has been crippled since 
centerrignt parties won free elections in the republics of 
slovenia and croatia earlier this year 
open clashes among the republics leaderships and rising 
nationalism in the nations six republics two provinces and 
numerous ethnic groups have led to fears of a civil war 
jovic said the outcome of a nationwide referendum on secession 
must be democratic and peaceful since the different nationalities 
will continue to live on these territories and even if they do 
not remain in the same house they must remain friends 
he added i deeply believe that yugoslavia will continue to 
exist because we have no better solution 
his speech was broadcast live by belgrade radio 
newlyelected noncommunist leaderships in slovenia and croatia 
have demanded that yugoslavia transform itself into a loose 
confederation of semiindependent states which would cooperate 
only if common interests were involved 
they have indicated that if their demands are not met by the new 
yugoslav constitution which is currently being drafted they would 
secede 
communist leaders in the largest republic serbia have opposed 
holding free elections and advocate a federal system with strong 
central authority

peaceful demonstrations and strikes throughout the province of 
kosovo to protest serbias virtual abolition of the troubled 
regions autonomy

east german trains stopped operating briefly 
today and gym teachers protested cuts in funding to the physical 
education system that produced one of the worlds mightiest olympic 
teams a news agency reported 
the protests are the newest round in labor unrest following the 
economic merger of east germany and west germany 
east germanys sports teachers and trainers association called 
for nationwide demonstrations next week to protest the financial 
misery of east german sports east germanys adn news agency 
reported today 
gym teachers claim that a lack of money could soon force the 
closure of a string of special sports schools that have helped 
produce east german olympic athletes in areas such as track and 
field swimming and skating 
in the interest of the health of all people help us 
maintain sports as a part of a cultured society said a pamphlet 
distributed by the group 
east germany captured 127 medals in the 1988 olympics in seoul 
the onehour warning strike by locomotive drivers halted 
virtually all rushhour train traffic from rostock in northern east 
germany to dresden in the southeast adn reported 
in the western region of magdeburg alone 33 trains were 
canceled or delayed because of the strike 
similar disruptions were reported in the east berlin area one 
of central europes most important rail transit points

union of german locomotive engineers and apprentices and the east 
german railway system union officials had demanded compensation 
for the loss of some benefits under the july 1 economic merger 
east germany introduced west germanys mighty deutsche mark as 
legal tender july 1 in a prelude to the expected unification of the 
two german states

workers demanding the same high salaries as their west german 
counterparts 
experts have predicted as many as onethird of east germanys 
8000 businesses could fold and up to half of its 8 million workers 
could lose their jobs as competition from west germany begins to 
take its toll on the east german economy

a precise location of the hydrogen leak that 
grounded the space shuttle still eludes nasa engineers but 
officials are looking for a test on space shuttle atlantis later 
this week to provide answers 
a laboratory test in california over the weekend gave 
confirmation that there is a problem in the design or assembly of a 
liquid hydrogen plumbing system on the shuttle space agency 
officials said monday 
william lenoir space flight director for the national 
aeronautics and space administration said the leak found in a test 
at the rockwell international plant in downey calif was similar 
to the one detected earlier on space shuttle columbia 
but he said it did not pinpoint the precise seal pipe or valve 
that is leaking 
it looks like its not out of line from what we saw on the 
pad lenoir told reporters he called the finding good news 
my biggest fear was that we would go through the downey test 
and get no leak at all said lenoir im encouraged 
lenoir and nasa chief scientist lennard fisk were testifying 
today before the senate science technology and space subcommittee 
about problems besetting nasa 
while lenoir was to be quizzed about the space shuttle leak 
fisk faced questions about why the 15 billion hubble space 
telescope was launched into orbit with a irrepairable fuzzy focus 
the telescope flaw was found two weeks ago and nasa has convened an 
investigative board 
others witnesses at the hearing were expected to include 
officials of hughes danbury optical co the firm that made the 
flawed mirrors on hubble 
meanwhile at the johnson space center in houston two veteran 
astronauts were grounded for involvment in hazardous flying 
incidents including one in which another pilot died 
navy cmdr robert l hoot gibson was grounded for a year 
after being involved in a collision during an air race in central 
texas the pilot of the other aircraft crashed and died gibson 
landed safely 
a nasa announcement said gibson will not fly the space shuttle 
or the t38 trainer jet for a year gibson had been assigned to 
command a shuttle mission next year but nasa said a new commander 
would be selected 
navy cmdr david m walker was suspended from flying the t38 
jet for 60 days and replaced as commander of a military shuttle 
mission scheduled for next year nasa took the action officials 
said because walker flew too close to an airliner near washington 
dc in 1988 
air force col frederick d gregory will replace walker as crew 
commander on the shuttle flight 
at his news conference monday lenoir said nasa engineers plan a 
fullscale leak test on atlantis on friday or saturday the test 
will be performed while the space shuttle sits on the launch pad 
and will closely duplicate the conditions that resulted in both the 
columbia leak in may and the leak found on atlantis in june 
after the second leak nasa halted space shuttle launches until 
the problem is fixed 
the rockwell test over the weekend used plumbing hardware called 
an umbilical that had been taken from columbia after its leak was 
found engineers forced liquid hydrogen through the umbilical and 
maintained a pressure of 50 pounds per square inch they then 
measured any hydrogen that leaked 
lenoir said the leak amounted to 5000 to 10000 cubic inches of 
hydrogen per minute the columbia leak in may had been about 90000 
cubic inches per minute 
a hole the size of a pinhole about 40000th of an inch would 
be large enough to create such a leak in the liquid hydrogen 
system he said 
for atlantis test engineers at the kennedy space center in 
florida stripped away insulation and exposed the bare metal of the 
umbilical they are installing special instruments and sensors and 
attaching plastic bags to areas of the pipe assembly that could be 
leaking 
when all is ready hydrogen chilled to a liquid at minus 423 
degrees will be pumped through the pipes at the rate of more than 
80 gallons a minute 
by analyzing gas captured by the bags and readings on the 
sensors the experts hope to find the exact location of the leak 
lenoir said the prime suspect for the source of the leak is 
a ushaped teflon seal that is supposed to keep hydrogen from 
escaping from the disconnect joint 
he said the tolerances for the seal and for the groove that 
holds it are extremely tight and there could be just enough of a 
misfit to cause a leak 
if this is confirmed as the problem lenoir said there is a 
possibility it could be fixed in time for atlantis to fly in august 
but robert crippen director of the space shuttle program said 
engineers still have not pinpointed the leak source 
we really do not know what the problem is yet he said at 
the news conference with lenoir we havent eliminated anything 
yet 
while the leak test on atlantis may give answers crippen warned 
that it could also raise more questions 
we have not eliminated the possibility that we might have two 
different problems on the two different vehicles he said

new yorks madison square garden is too small to serve as both 
convention hall and media center but the city proposed using 
another hall several blocks away as a work area for reporters 
the city also said it could afford the 20 million commitment 
sought by the party and democratic fundraisers in new york

new orleans which hosted the 1988 republican convention was 
the other finalist to emerge from browns site selection committee 
but party insiders said brown appeared set on new york from the 
outset and any hopes for new orleans were undermined by the 
louisiana legislatures passage of a strict antiabortion measure 
last weekend 
the democratic party backs abortion rights and its candidates in 
several 1989 elections successfully used the issue against gop 
opponents brown said last week the louisiana legislation was a 
factor in his deliberations party sources said then that new york 
was the choice unless negotiations collapsed 
the republican party isnt expected to complete its search for 
several months with a decision expected in january the search 
would be moot should bush express a preference but for now the 
competitors include houston cleveland san diego new orleans 
miami anaheim calif and st petersburg fla new york also was 
interested in the gop event and it was not immediately clear if 
landing the democratic convention would affect that bid

gunfire crackled in the streets today 
and backers of a spreading and violent strike rebuilt street 
barricades that police and the army had dismantled overnight 
president violeta barrios de chamorro called on the army to end 
bloody clashes between her supporters and sandinistas backing a 
weekold general strike that is the stiffest threat yet to her 
usbacked government 
at least three people were reported killed in earlier gunfire 
more were reported wounded overnight but the extent of the 
casualties was not immediately clear 
most government ministries and stateowned businesses remained 
in the control of prosandinista strikers today 
bonfires burned at many key intersections and the highway to 
the airport was blocked by barricades of paving stones and other 
obstacles most managuans who went to work walked 
the army is dominated by the sandinistas and it was not yet 
clear whether soldiers would take up arms against compatriots who 
have organized the crippling strikes and fought chamorro backers 
with fists rocks and guns 
armored cars patrolled the streets of managua and gunfire could 
be heard during the night but reporters could not get close to the 
fighting 
the violence began sunday evening and intensified monday 
police said the dead included a man fatally shot in a clash 
between government supporters and sandinistas they said about 100 
people had been injured hospitals reported much lower casualty 
figures 
the strikes and street violence have brought the country to a 
near standstill 
in scenes reminiscent of the 1979 revolution that brought them 
to power the sandinistas built smoky bonfires of trash and tires 
all over managua on monday and erected barricades 
a haze hung over the capital a city of 1 million people 
electricity and drinking water were cut off in most of managua 
mail and operatorassisted telephone calls were suspended 
there was virtually no bus service and staterun cooperatives 
and other agricultural installations textile and construction 
plants were idle 
striking air traffic controllers shut down the the international 
airport and the road to managua was blockaded by protesters the 
police tore down their barricades with backhoes the demonstrators 
put them up again 
mrs chamorro facing the worst crisis of her 10weekold 
presidency made a nationally broadcast appeal for calm on monday 
night she begged compatriots not to answer violence with 
violence which has already claimed victims 
the sandinistas though renewed their strike calls and warned 
the government was courting chaos and a catastrophe 
sandinistacontrolled unions say mrs chamorro is firing too 
many people from government jobs as she tries to reduce the budget 
deficit they also object to her plans to sell dozens of 
stateowned companies and farms that the sandinistas had 
expropriated from the wealthy 
the sandinistas held power for a decade warring nearly all the 
while with the usbacked contras who sought to topple them and 
suffering economic hardship as the result of a us trade embargo 
mrs chamorros 14party coalition unseated the sandinists in 
elections feb 25 and the contras disarmed last month 
the sandinistas remain the single biggest party in nicaragua 
while the presidents coalition has been splintered by infighting 
and weakened by popular discontent over economic hardship 
sandinistacontrolled unions called a strike on june 26 
spiralling walkouts paralyzed government offices and banks and 
curtailed services including transportation telephones water and 
power 
strike leaders claim more than 80000 public and private sector 
workers have joined in the walkouts 
the strikes escalated into street fighting and thats when mrs 
chamorro called out the army to help police restore order 
in her speech mrs chamorro accused the sandinistas of 
engineering the strikes and the unrest 
the presidents speech on state radio and television was delayed 
for four hours when prosandinista students and workers seized a 
government broadcasting center police dispersed them peacefully 
after about two hours 
mrs chamorro said her government was committed to national 
reconciliation but insisted that it occur in a climate of peace 
and understanding not fear of intimidation 
the sandinistas however said the government would be 
directly responsible for creating chaos and a catastrophe if it 
failed to negotiate with the strike leaders talks broke down last 
week 
former president daniel ortega too urged negotiations 
this conflict cannot be solved by force any attempt in that 
direction is an invitation to chaos he said in a radio interview 
monday

the setting was wild but the crowd was 
tame as campers began arriving for an annual gathering of earth 
first a group known for its militant approach to defending nature 
we just wanted to learn more about earth first said 
chiropractor gary robb who hitchhiked about 1000 miles from 
canada with his son travis 15 for a week of music dance and 
environmental activism in a meadow south of cameron 
battered cars bulging with camping gear and volkswagen buses 
carried aging or fledgling hippies to within half a mile of the 
round river rendezvous at beaverhead national forest the campout 
site is in the foothills of gravelly range about 25 miles west of 
yellowstone national park 
up to 500 earth first members were expected for the 11th annual 
meeting of the organization 
police wary of counterdemonstrators and the movements 
reputation for civil disobedience said they will keep an eye on 
the proceedings but no officers were in sight monday 
robert kellog a forest service law enforcement officer said 
earth first meetings have not been a problem in the past and 
theres no reason to expect they will this time 
participants said they were there to learn and enjoy themselves 
its the camaraderie more than anything said mitch 
friedman a biologist from bellingham wash im looking forward 
to the workshops but im really looking forward to seeing my 
friends 
theres a big piece of wild country here and were trying to 
keep it wild said philip knight who helped organize the round 
river rendezvous which opened monday thats why were here 
robb and his son from salt spring island in british columbia 
began hitchhiking more than two weeks ago they painted a house in 
nearby ennis to earn some traveling money and hiked into the 
snowtipped madison range while waiting for the event to start 
the atmosphere was alternately festive and serious at a 
firsttimer meeting about 75 members discussed the groups 
image and the hazards of environmental activism 
even if we are fringe we need to get our message out that 
there are people who would destroy our land for a greasy dollar 
bill said bob kasper a mail carrier from madison wis ours 
is not an evil group that is trying to destroy the country 
some earth first publications have advocated 
monkeywrenching acts of sabotage against those who develop 
the nations wildlands but members say the group takes no official 
stance on such activity and that its members are mostly involved in 
acts of civil disobedience 
a workshop on nonviolent protest tactics is on the agenda 
earth firsters have chained themselves to treecrushing machines 
in texas blocked logging roads in washington and occupied 
roadbuilding equipment in arizona this summer in northern 
california more than 50 have been arrested for blockading sawmills 
and picketing government offices to protest the cutting of 
oldgrowth redwoods 
some authorities say the group is more destructive when nobodys 
looking 
two activists were injured may 24 in oakland when a pipe bomb 
exploded in the back seat of their car 
last year in arizona three other activists allegedly cut 
through the leg of an electric transmission tower and the fbi 
claimed they were practicing for an assault against nuclear 
facilities in california and colorado 
earth first cofounder dave foreman also was arrested on 
charges that he helped plan the scheme all four have denied the

bulgarias first multiparty 
parliament in 44 years held its inaugural session today in the 
absence of former president petar mladenov who resigned after 
admitting he proposed using force to crush prodemocracy protests 
the opening ceremony was held in a woodpaneled hall in this 
ancient bulgarian capital about 150 miles northeast of sofia 
mladenov resigned friday under mounting public pressure for 
suggesting in december that tanks be used to disperse some 50000 
anticommunist demonstrators 
his departure came less than three weeks after his party of 
reformed communists won the countrys first free elections in 58 
years 
mladenov was instrumental in last years ousting of communist 
strongman todor zhivkov prodded by popular demonstrations 
mladenov then played a key role in reforming the party now known 
as the socialist party 
his departure has weakened the ruling socialists and created a 
constitutional vacuum 
the grand national assemblys first task will be to agree on a 
presidential candidate and on how to elect him there is no 
precedent for electing a president in bulgarias parliamentary 
history 
the 400member parliament may either decide to elect the 
president or call a referendum 
the ceremonial opening session held in sweltering heat was 
adjourned after only 40 minutes and will be resumed on july 17 at 
the parliament building in sofia 
the meeting was inaugurated by yosif petrov at 81 the oldest 
deputy 
in a brief speech alexander lilov chairman of the socialist 
party said the time of the totalitarian parliament is over now 
is the time of the democratic parliament 
but lilov also criticized protesters 
we are against chaos and destabilization in the country he 
said everyone has the right to protest but everyone has also 
the obligation to work 
police and special security forces patrolled the area outside 
the meeting but there were no incidents

the american red cross failed to notify 
federal authorities about 230 cases in which patients may have 
contracted aids through contaminated blood transfusions a 
newspaper reported today 
in at least four cases patients died as a result of 
contaminated blood but the federal food and drug administration 
was not informed the philadelphia inquirer said 
the newspaper report did not say how many of the 230 cases 
involved people actually getting aids 
the newspaper said it obtained a report of an fda inspection of 
the red cross national headquarters in washington dc that was 
carried out between april 26 and may 25 
it said the agency found that the red cross lacked procedures 
for reviewing and tracking transfusionassociated aids cases by 
national headquarters to assure all regions are submitting the 
initial reports and followup reports are complete 
the fda report also said that national red cross officials have 
not updated their procedures for handling error and accident 
reports since july 1981 calling those procedures inadequate 
the fda report said the 230 cases occurred in the washington 
dc area and that there were also 380 cases where national red 
cross officials failed to review reports of errors and accidents at 
red cross blood centers nationwide 
the newspaper did not indicate what years the cases occurred 
blood and blood components have been screened for aids antibodies 
since march 1985 
under federal law the fda may require the red cross to correct 
the deficiencies or either suspend or revoke its license to 
collect and distribute blood 
errors at red cross blood centers around the country ranged from 
potentially dangerous donors not being excluded to the release of 
blood that initially tested positive for aids antibodies but was 
later found to be negative the newspaper said quoting from the 
fda report 
a subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee has 
scheduled a hearing friday to investigate the safety of the 
american blood supply 
the red cross supplies more than half of all the blood used by 
american hospitals its 54 regional centers collect and distribute 
more than 6 million units of blood 
diane powers spokeswoman for the red cross in washington said 
this morning that no one was available to respond to the report 
other officials said a staff meeting was under way this morning at 
which the report was discussed

militant cuban exile orlando bosch today rejected a 
government offer to trade prison for a restrictive housearrest 
program that would return him to his family after the past 14 years 
in jails 
bosch said the offer would require him to tell the fbi of any 
contacts with cuban exile groups that advocate violence said his 
daughter myriam 
hes willing to agree to all of the conditions except that 
one ms bosch said hes not going be an informant the fbi 
can do their own work 
ms bosch said her father informed his attorneys of his decision 
this morning and they were to notify immigration officials 
a source with the justice department said the government will 
not negotiate the offer bosch wont accept the conditions and 
he wont be released unless he does the source said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the proposal presented to bosch by immigration officials monday 
night was a departure for the justice department which has 
maintained for years that the anticastro activist would continue 
his terrorist ways if released 
hes just not prepared to send a message out that hes an 
informant said attorney henry adorno he believes that lists 
are kept by people like joe mccarthy and fidel castro 
on monday boschs wife adriana had criticized the conditions 
for his release but appeared to encourage him to accept the deal 
calling the conditions better than jail 
the 63yearold former pediatrician suffers from ulcers and 
declining health after years in venezuelan and us jails 
the conditions would have required bosch to wear an electronic 
monitoring device remain at home for 21 hours a day keep a log of 
visitors and allow his telephone to be monitored said richard 
smith director of the us immigration and naturalization service 
in miami 
smith said bosch also would be subject to unannounced searches 
and lie detector tests and if instructed must present himself for 
deportation within 72 hours 
theyre just messing with his head myriam bosch said 
knowing how they work i think they probably did this knowing my 
father would not accept it 
justice department spokesman dan eramian in washington said the 
government decided to offer bosch parole for humanitarian reasons 
but will continue the twoyear effort to deport him thus far 31 
nations have refused to accept him 
the offer appeared to be an attempt to resolve what has become a 
cause celebre for miamis staunchly anticastro cuban exile 
community which has held rallies and demonstrations on his behalf 
bosch has been held since 1988 when he was arrested for parole 
violations and for reentering the country illegally 
according to cia documents he ran bombing runs on cuba in the 
early 1960s in 1968 he was convicted in a bazooka attack on a 
polish freighter at the port of miami and sentenced to 10 years in 
prison 
he was paroled in 1972 and fled the country in 1974 after he was 
subpoenaed to testify in an inquiry into the killing of a miami 
exile leader 
accused of masterminding the 1976 bombing of a cuban jetliner 
that killed 73 people bosch spent 11 years in venezuelan jails he 
denied involvement in the bombing and was acquitted in three 
separate trials 
the parole conditions would require bosch to wear an electronic 
monitoring device remain at home for 21 hours a day keep a log of 
visitors and allow his telephone to be monitored said richard 
smith director of the us immigration and naturalization service 
in miami

france observed the 50th anniversary of the 
formation of the collaborationist vichy government tuesday and 
honored the parliament members who opposed marshal philippe 
petains ascension to power 
petain a grandfatherly world war i hero was installed as 
allpowerful leader of the vichy regime by a 56980 vote on july 
10 1940 
three of the legislators who voted no survive and two 
attended commemorations at vichys grand casino where the vote was 
taken maurice montel 90 and emile fouchard 88 were joined by 
parliamentary affairs minister jean poperen 
poperen said the 80 lawmakers acting with lucidity and 
courage against all the appearances and the evidence of the 
moment have earned the eternal recognition of the nation 
vichys mayor claude malhuret described the votes against 
petain as one of the first acts of resistance in our country 
malhuret also said france should be vigilant in countering a 
resurgence of racist and antisemitic rhetoric such as we heard 
before the war 
petain who signed an armistice with the germans on june 22 was 
84 at the time but widely respected across france he was 
convinced germany would win the war and that france had no 
alternative but to cooperate with hitler 
frances government including parliament members had fled from 
paris as german forces approached going first to tours on june 10 
then to bordeaux on june 14 and two weeks later to vichy a 
tranquil health spa 
on july 10 the parliamentary majority adopted a text which 
said the national assembly gives all power to the government of 
the republic under the authority and the signature of marshal 
petain for the purpose of promoting a new constitution of the 
french state 
of the 80 legislators who opposed petain 31 were incarcerated 
or put under house arrest during the war two were killed and five 
died in captivity 
since the war vichy has struggled to live down its association 
with nazi collaboration 
in the 1930s the town ranked as frances no 1 mineral springs 
resort now it ranks 14th and unemployment in the town of 30500 
is estimated at 15 percent 
malhuret described as irritating the link between vichy and 
the collaborationists 
if the town of vichy was partly responsible it would be less 
irritating he told the french news agency agence francepresse 
but that isnt the case nobody in vichy went out in search of 
the government and the assembly 
the vichy government received little in return for its 
collaboration exporting goods and labor to germany in exchange for 
the privilege of running daytoday administrative affairs only 
twofifths of france was under vichys jurisdiction the rest was 
occupied territory 
in august 1944 as allied forces swept through france petain 
fled vichy and was arrested then was allowed to leave for 
switzerland 
he returned voluntarily to france in april 1945 was tried for 
treason and sentenced to death charles de gaulle commuted the 
sentence to life imprisonment and petain died in 1951 on the isle 
of yeu off frances atlantic coast 
in paris officials of the french communist party on tuesday 
celebrated the 50th anniversary of an appeal by the outlawed 
communist underground for resistance against petain 
communist legislator andre lajoinie said the men who isssud the 
appeal represented the first resistance base on national 
territory a radio appeal for frenchmen to resist the nazis had 
been broadcast from london on june 18 by de gaulle

sixteen years after a radiation leak halted its 
maiden voyage the experimental ship mutsu set out tuesday for its 
first attempt to sail under nuclear power officials said 
technical problems and antinuclear protests that complicated 
anchorage and repair arrangements for japans only nuclearpowered 
ship accounted for the delay 
local police said 23 antinuclear activists protested the 
mutsus planned test by burning old tires on nearby shores as it 
sailed from sekinehama port in aomori prefecture 360 miles 
northeast of tokyo 
the 8242ton ship used an auxiliary boiler as it headed for an 
area about 108 miles off the pacific coast said yuwao ikezawa 
spokesman of the atomic energy research institute 
tests of its nuclear reactor were to start friday and a series 
of ocean trials lasting about 20 days will be conducted in an area 
where they would not hinder fishing operations ikezawa added 
he said the reactors output would be raised to 50 percent of 
full capacity in the first week and to 70 percent for another week 
to make sure the reactor was working properly 
before this year the mutsus 36000kilowatt reactor had not 
been used since a leak was discovered in its protective shield just 
after it set out in 1974 for its maiden voyage the ship was 
launched in 1969 
after that leak was reported the research vessel drifted for 50 
days in the pacific before residents of its home port in aomori 
prefecture allowed it to return temporarily 
after extensive repairs and remodeling of parts including the 
defective shielding the ship had been anchored at sekinehama since 
1988 
institute officials have said that if the forthcoming tests go 
smoothly the ship will make another test voyage in august and then 
a yearlong experimental voyage to collect data for possible future 
development of nuclearpowered commercial vessels 
following the tests the mutsu is to be retired

using torture murder and mass arrests 
governments trampled the human rights of tens of thousands of 
people in 1989 to suppress conflicts stemming from ethnic or 
nationalist tensions amnesty international said 
despite democratic revolutions in eastern europe reform in 
south africa and signs of change in some black african countries 
amnestys annual world survey of human rights painted a grim 
picture its report was to be released wednesday 
cases cited in the human rights groups 138country report 
ranged from children tortured in iraq to a spaniard sentenced for 
burning the flag from alleged racial bias in american capital 
punishment to the jailing of malawis only neurosurgeon for 
criticizing the president from death squads in el salvador to 
draft refusers in western europe 
the theme of this years report was the suppression of ethnic 
and nationalist groups which amnesty said has often served to 
entrench bitter conflicts dimmed prospects for dialogue and added 
to the toll of suffering and death 
the survey saw this pattern in countries including somalia 
ethiopia sudan sri lanka india burma indonesia the soviet 
union yugoslavia tibet chad mauritania israel iran iraq 
turkey bulgaria guatemala and brazil 
around the world particularly where the tensions erupted into 
violence tens of thousands of people became victims of security 
operations resulting in disappearances and extrajudicial 
executions the report said 
the conflicts ranged from local disputes over the cultural 
rights of distinctive ethnic groups through to fullscale 
confrontation over demands for autonomy or secession it said 
the demands were often nonviolent but in many instances 
violent attacks or armed insurgency were dominant features the 
report said 
amnesty international said it recognized that governments faced 
complex situations and in some cases armed groups which 
kidnapped tortured and murdered opponents 
but it said none of these factors can every justify or excuse 
a government violating the basic human rights of any of its 
citizens or those over whom it exercises control 
it said police and military forces in several western hemisphere 
nations dramatically increased their attacks on political opponents 
in 1989 
in eastern europe it said new governments have emptied their 
prisons of dissidents but it said dissenters are still harshly 
treated in albania bulgaria and yugoslavia 
in the middle east and north africa it said killings mass 
arrests and torture of political opponents continued but there 
were also some signs of improvement 
governments in asia have resorted to mass killings torture 
detentions and unfair trials to repress mass opposition movements 
the report said 
prisoners of conscience in asia ranged from a buddhist monk in 
vietnam to a 52yearold doctor in indonesia it said 
at least 1000 people were killed and thousands were wounded 
when troops fired on crowds of unarmed protesters and bystanders in 
beijing in june 1989 to suppress prodemocracy demonstrations the 
report said adding that an atmosphere of terror prevented any 
accurate count of the number of deaths dozens were publicly 
reported to have been sentenced to death or to terms of 
imprisonment after summary and unfair trials and there were 
reports of secret executions the report added 
only a few dozen executions in connection with the protests were 
reported publicly but unofficial sources estimated several hundred 
people were executed secretly in beijing after june 4 1989 the 
report said 
thousands of people were arrested and held incommunicado the 
report said this year chinese authorities have announced the 
release of at least 784 prisoners 
on a positive note amnesty international noted the release of 
political prisoners in benin ethiopia somalia south africa and 
namibia and significant reductions in executions in south africa 
and nigeria 
but in some cases relaxations soon gave way to renewed 
repression it said

next to the cover page of this book is a 
photograph of president eisenhowers fivestar tie with a stain 
circled and a note informing inquiring readers what the stain is 
the stain came from ikes vegetable soup and the recipe can be 
found on page 40 of this oversized 118page volume 
ike the cook by edward and candace russoli includes 32 
recipes by the nations 34th president and many anecdotes about 
his culinary skills which apparently were considerable 
it also has 172 photographs including many with eisenhower 
donning an apron or eating some of his own creations 
from a young kansan cooking squirrel during a camp out to an 
army officer who believed food was part of a soldiers paycheck and 
finally to a kitchenwise president the russolis tell the story of 
eisenhower life through food 
ed russoli admits it is a novel approach to a presidential 
biography 
were using food as a vehicle throughout the book he said 
in a telephone interview 
russoli is himself a gourmet cook and onetime owner of an 
italian restaurant in his native allentown pa 
the recipes in the book came from secret service agents who 
guarded eisenhower columbia university in new york where 
eisenhower briefly served as president and from the eisenhower 
library in abilene 
in fact eisenhowers recipe for homemade vegetable soup created 
quite a stir when it was published in a 1948 campus cookbook at 
columbia university while eisenhower was president 
he later said he got more reaction from his recipe for 
vegetable soup than anything else he said while president of 
columbia russoli said 
the secret ingredient in eisenhowers recipe was adding 
about a tablespoon of nasturtium stems to the soup the authors say 
the book is being published this year in conjunction with the 
100th anniverary of eisenhowers birth 
the dinner tables of presidents also prompted last years the 
white house family cookbook written by henry haller executive 
chef at the white house for five first families and virginia 
aronson 
it tells such tidbits as what president nixon ate for his final 
white house breakfast poached egg and hash how the fords 
scrimped to help fight inflation no first courses and few 
desserts and the recipe for the monkey bread the reagans eat 
at holidays 
the eisenhower book gives a curious reader a look at the 
presidents palate for example eisenhower was a firm believer in 
the values of red meat and he believed that it prevented stomach 
trouble 
his diet called for beef every day and when on vacation he 
revealed that he might eat it 12 times a week because he loved 
having little breakfast steaks russoli said steak in general 
was on ikes top 10 list 
the president also liked to grill 3inch steaks by placing them 
directly on whitehot coals 
russoli said he began researching the book in 1986 while working 
on yet on another volume this one about republican presidents and 
their dietary habits 
that book called grand old party fare includes hundreds of 
the favorite recipes of 17 republican presidents and seven gop 
alsorans that book will be completed soon russoli said 
the recipes in the book vary from the basic kansas squirrel 
stew with leftovers to sergeant moaneys ontario northland 
railway roast wild goose a recipe fit for white house receptions 
and theres also the world war ii favorite inapinch baked 
beans 
ikes interest in cooking was a godsend to white house 
reporters the book says 
kids and pets in the white house were always good copy but a 
cooking president was sensational the russolis wrote quotes 
like i mix my batter at night and let it stand until morning 
perked up even the most blase veteran newsmen who were sure they 
had heard everything before

the department of energys plan to reopen a 
plutonium production plant as part of a nuclear cleanup program 
is like saying we need crack houses to fight drug addiction an 
environmental group said today 
the institute for energy and environmental research said in a 
study commissioned by the hanford education action league of 
spokane wash that the plant on the departments hanford 
reservation in eastern washington is unsafe 
the study also said that closing the 35yearold plant could 
save 300 million to 400 million over the next 10 years 
timothy tomastik a public affairs officer for the energy 
department said an environmental impact study of the plan to 
restart the plant is under way 
tomastik said he had not seen the study but the organizations 
news release made it sound like we are trying to make the restart 
completely a cleanup operation which is totally untrue we 
have never maintained that at all 
the plant was closed in december 1988 because of what the study 
described as environmental and safety concerns 
in a fiveyear environmental cleanup plan issued last week the 
department said the plant is needed to dispose of hanfords 
remaining nuclear fuel rods 
the plant known as purex is a nuclear reprocessing facility 
that extracts plutonium and uranium from the used rods for use in 
nuclear weapons and research 
approximately 2100 tons of highly radioactive used rods are now 
stored in pools of water on the hanford reservation and some are 
leaking radioactivity into the water the environmental group said 
saying that plutonium production at purex is needed for 
environmental cleanup is like saying we need crack houses to fight 
drug addiction said scott saleska staff scientist with the 
environmental group and chief author of the study 
the organization said storing the rods under a dry inert gas 
such as helium or argon might be the safest way to handle them 
until a longterm disposal plan is worked out 
failing this the study said storage in capsules in water 
basins is likely to be preferable on environmental grounds to 
the existing plan 
it is true that the existing situation with hanfords used 
nuclear fuels is a real mess but that is largely because doe 
ignored the situation and let the problem fester instead of 
encapsulating the leaking fuel a decade ago saleska said 
the study recommended that funds for the purex operation be 
canceled it also recommended authorizing the 4 million to 5 
million that westinghouse the principal contractor for the plant 
has estimated that it would cost to encapsulate the rods 
in a report issued july 3 doe said it would cost about 6 
billion in each of the next five years to store and clean up waste 
from nuclear weapons plants this is nearly 50 percent more than 
had been estimated earlier

from a friendly class photo to a highminded 
declaration on world peace and prosperity public shows of harmony 
come easy to the economic summit partners but major items on the 
agenda set each apart from the others 
that goes double for the united states this time president bush 
stands in the minority in arguing against western aid to the soviet 
union and hes greatly outnumbered in refusing to set new goals 
for cutting global pollution 
but that didnt shrink bushs smile as he and his six summit 
partners marched shouldertoshoulder through an extravagant 
ceremony monday 
harmony after all is a chief priority of these summits 
after some choreographed posing for news cameras the leaders 
disappeared into a rice university hall for two hours of formal 
talks then it was back before the cameras this time for the 
traditional group photograph and some lighthearted banter 
it was clear before the houston summit began that bush would not 
be converted to the majority view on providing emergency financial 
aid to moscow so the real challenge behind the scenes was to find 
a way to move the issue down the diplomatic road to leave it for 
later when the publicity stakes were lower 
the us position on aid to moscow illustrates how on some 
issues each summit country has special reasons for marching to a 
different drummer bush says the american public wont accept 
giving money to moscow until gorbachev ends soviet support for 
cuba a communist nation that is a political thorn in the american 
side but of relatively little concern to most of the other summit 
countries 
on the key environmental issue at the summit how to respond to 
the threat of global warming caused by polluting industrial plants 
bush worries that european and canadian ideas on cutting 
pollution could damage the us economy 
perhaps the most telling case of national interest concerns 
japan on the one hand it is alone among the participating 
countries in wanting to resume lending to china the others in 
houston say china has not moved far enough toward democratic 
reform and yet japan is staunchly against aiding the soviet union 
agreeing with bush that its better to wait for more democratic 
reforms 
history explains why japan takes what appear on the surface to 
be contradictory stances while the japanese have a tradition of 
close business ties to china they are still bitter that josef 
stalin seized the kurile islands from them after tokyo was defeated 
in world war ii 
taizo watanabe the japanese foreign ministry spokesman said 
tokyo has a unique perspective on china and that this special 
experience explains why it wants to resume lending despite the 
chinese crackdown last year on a prodemocracy movement 
we know more than anyone about what is going on there said 
watanabe 
france too travels a lonely path on at least one summit issue 
it wants the rich western governments to forgive more of the 
foreign debt of the worlds poorest nations the us position 
accepted by most of its summit partners is to consider debt relief 
only on a casebycase basis 
for west germany aid to the soviet union is the issue that sets 
it apart from the united states and several other nations in 
houston together with its push for more ambitious goals in cutting 
global pollution 
the germans face a unique political challenge in trying to win 
soviet acceptance of nato membership for a reunified german nation 
the bonn government has decided to do this by encouraging a huge 
western aid program for moscow and by extending generous loans on 
its own 
as with most tough issues put on the economic summit agenda 
these problems wont be fully resolved in houston but if past 
practice holds the leaders will find a way to keep their 
differences from spoiling their show of unity

an energy department plan to restart a 
plutoniumproduction plant to reprocess used nuclear fuel rods 
would create unnecessary radioactive waste and increase the danger 
of an explosion an environmental group said tuesday 
the institute for energy and environmental research in a study 
commissioned by the hanford education action league of spokane 
wash recommended that the plant on the departments hanford 
reservation in eastern washington be permanently closed 
the plant was completed in 1955 and used to extract uranium and 
weaponsgrade plutonium from spent fuel rods from the nreactor a 
nuclear powerproduction facility both plants were shut down in 
1988 because of safety concerns 
about 2100 tons of used fuel rods are stored in two tanks one 
has leaked and been repaired but could leak again releasing 
radioactive material the study said 
the department has asked congress for 34 million in the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 to restart the plutoniumproduction plant 
next year 
arjun makhijani a scientist with the environmental group and 
one of the studys authors told a news conference we think 
reprocessing is a dangerous technology in itself and you should not 
be creating liquid waste 
the study said that the process would increase the risk of an 
explosion in the waste tanks makhijani conceded that this risk 
might be small but said it should be guarded against because 
the consequences would be huge 
the department and westinghouse hanford company the principal 
contractor for the plutonium plant have denied that a resumption 
of processing would increase the risk of an explosion 
timothy tomastik a public affairs officer for the department 
said an environmental impact study of the restart is under way 
tomastik said he had not seen the study but he added the 
organizations news release made it sound like we are trying to 
make the restart completely a cleanup operation which is 
totally untrue 
the study also said leaving the plant closed could save 300 
million to 400 million over the next 10 years

jesse jackson eulogized mitch snyder today for 
his work on behalf of the homeless and told mourners at snyders 
funeral we will not surrender the work continues 
jackson was joined by mayor marion barry and entertainers martin 
sheen and cher at a funeral service attended by about 1000 people 
at the shelter for the homeless founded by snyder barry attended 
during the noon recess of his trial at the nearby us district 
courthouse on drug and perjury charges 
jackson urged the crowd to continue snyders work saying we 
will not surrender the work continues the crowd responded by 
chanting mitch mitch 
hug someone next to you and say i love you jackson told the 
mourners 
margaret moore who lives in a shelter about two miles from the 
one where snyders funeral was held said earlier i always liked 
what he did 
i didnt know anything about homeless people until i became 
one i thought they all were bums but i listened to him and it 
helped me to learn that the homeless are people too 
moore who lost her apartment last month because she used rent 
money for drugs said snyders commitment to the downtrodden helped 
her regain control over her life 
he made you feel like you were somebody moore said quietly 
i never met him but it was clear from seeing him on tv what he 
felt for the homeless a lot of love real christianlike 
snyder 46 was found hanged last thursday inside his room at 
the shelter an apparent suicide a note nearby outlined 
difficulties he was having in his relationship with carol fennelly 
his companion and coworker for 13 years 
he was a great man perhaps a bit too selfless said ronald 
williams a volunteer at snyders shelter he learned how to love 
everybody but himself 
inside the shelter security guard mike hughes remembered snyder 
as someone who gave everyone a chance 
you came here and as long as you didnt get a fat head and 
get lazy you could get a chance mitch was someone who gave 
everyone a chance said hughes who came to the shelter five 
months ago after a drug problem cost him his job his marriage and 
his apartment 
now hughes works in the shelters kitchen and then pulls a 
shift as a security guard at night 
another thing mitch would always be real friendly ask you 
how you are doing hughes continued but if you used or sold 
drugs you were out in the last few months theyve made real 
headway getting rid of crackheads here 
outside the shelter williams ushered quiet bands of mourners 
from the heat into the airconditioned shelter basement where the 
viewing was held 
were expecting about 3000 williams said its going to 
be a long day 
snyders death will be a blow to the homeless movement but it 
also may serve as an inspiration williams said 
i think it is going to make people who have become a bit 
complacent stand up williams said sometimes it takes a jolt 
to make you realize that you have to do a lot yourself and he was 
the prime example of how one man can make a difference

have enough skeletons in the closet in hollywood already 
the mediterraneanstyle home built in 1924 was the site of the 
johnsonfoster funeral home for 30 years the city paid 15 
million earlier this year to buy it for the art and culture center 
the purchase sparked an investigation by the broward county 
state attorneys office which filed a noncriminal charge against 
the former city attorney of violating the states open government 
laws 
anderson said a widow who had her husbands funeral at johnson 
foster told her she also found the proposal very distasteful 
jared anton head of the kiwanis clubs halloween committee 
said the club did not intend to cause a controversy 
club members simply thought the 12000squarefoot home would 
offer plenty of parking and an ideal location for a haunted house 
he said 
i wouldnt insult anyone by having coffins and corpses in 
there he said itll have moaning and witches and a cauldron

western leaders will take a step toward 
resumption of world bank loans to china according to a draft of 
the houston economic summits final political declaration 
the leaders of seven major industrial nations six western 
democracies and japan were to call for exploration of additional 
international loans to promote reforms in china the draft said 
the world bank has approved only 580 million in loans to china 
in the past year all linked to human need 
at a postmidnight briefing a japanese government spokesman had 
said japans prime minister toshiki kaifu told other leaders at a 
working dinner session that his country would gradually lend more 
than 5 billion to china 
but the draft declaration does not address that issue 
in general it reaffirms a position taken by the seven countries 
at their 1989 meeting on holding back economic cooperation with 
china but also taking into account changes that have taken place 
since the violent suppression of the prodemocracy movement last 
year 
the issue of resuming assistance to china dominated a working 
dinner session among the leaders at the greekstyle bayou bend 
mansion at the end of the summits first day monday said japanese 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe 
the seven nations participating in the summit all suspended aid 
and loans to china last year after condemning the bloody 
suppression of prodemocracy demonstrations and the arrest of 
suspected dissidents 
we believe that assistance would support economic and 
political reform in china said kaifu according to the foreign 
ministry 
the japanese loans are to be for irrigation infrastructure and 
other nonmilitary projects that will be open to international 
bidding and not necessarily built by japanese companies the 
spokesman said 
we are not doing this for the benefit of our country kaifu 
was quoted as saying the japanese government has said it believes 
the economic stability of china is essential to regional stability 
japanese officials have been talking about the possibility of 
restoring the final third of the 15 billion loan agreement but did 
not confirm that such action would be taken until the bayou bend 
meeting 
watanabe said the summit leaders almost unanimously 
recognized that china must not be allowed to drift into isolation 
the spokesman declined to disclose any comments by participants 
other than kaifu 
he said however that some leaders drew a comparison between 
japans plan to restore loans to china and its refusal to give 
economic assistance to the soviet union 
others he said viewed this as an unreasonable comparison 
because there is no danger of the soviet union drifting into 
isolation 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and french prime minister 
francois mitterand have been pushing for economic assistance to 
moscow 
president bush and prime minister margaret thatcher oppose aid 
to the soviets but have not opposed bilateral action by japan to 
help china 
others attending the dinner session at the 29room mansion 
donated as a museum by the late philanthropist ima hogg included 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney italian prime minister 
giulio andreotti and jacques delors president of the commission of 
the european communities 
watanabe who has held several sessions with reporters to 
explain the japanese position on summit issues said progress on 
human rights and political reform in china will be closely 
monitored as the loans are restored 
the japanese made no attempt to get other summit leaders to join 
in a resumption of assistance to china he said maintaining that 
japans historic and geographic closeness to china give it a better 
understanding of developments in the country 
we are not almighty but we may know more about certain 
aspects he said 
the chinese have made progress in lifting curfews and releasing 
political prisoners and those in chinas government who support 
reforms need to be encouraged he said 
he said the loan committed to by former prime minister noboru 
takeshita is not something which can be sort of thrown away

comparatively tiny distance of 3 million miles today scientists 
said 
the asteroid estimated at 300 feet to 1000 feet in diameter 
made one of the closest crossings of earth orbit observed in 50 
years the jet propulsion laboratory said 
the rocky object dubbed 1990 mf was located on june 26 by jpl 
planetary scientist eleanor helin at palomar observatory 
helin heads the palomar planetcrossing asteroid survey a 
project to systematically search for asteroids crossing near earth 
the asteroid was 8 million miles from earth and traveling 
approximately 12500 mph when spotted it was then tracked last 
week by arecibo observatory in puerto rico and by the national 
aeronautics and space administrations deep space network at 
goldstone calif 
initial calculations indicate the asteroid has an elongated 
orbit of 161 million miles and takes two years and four months to 
complete each orbit 
scientists continued to track it from siding spring australia 
mount john observatory new zealand the infrared telescope 
facility at mauna kea hawaii and harvard observing station at oak 
ridge mass 
the asteroid brightened and accelerated as it approached earth 
it was expected to surpass 22000 mph at closest approach

western leaders today welcomed the political and 
economic change that has swept eastern europe and urged romania to 
join its neighbors in adopting reforms 
europe is at the dawn of a new era president bush and 
leaders of six other rich democracies said in their final political 
communique 
we welcome enthusiastically the profound and historic changes 
sweeping the european continent the leaders said on the second 
day of their annual economic summit 
they said they will use every opportunity to push for a united 
and free europe and expressed pleasure at the impending merger of 
the two german states which they said would offer a major 
contribution to stability 
they urged romania where there has been violent repression of 
antigovernment demonstrators to join in the positive trend 
under way in neighboring countries 
the western nations already have promised billions of dollars in 
loans food and other assistance to moscows oncestaunch allies in 
eastern europe but they are still undecided about what to do for 
the soviet union 
their decision could be crucial for soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev who is trying to save his embattled economic reform 
program of perestroika 
a year ago at their summit in paris the leaders tapped the 
european community the 12nation trading bloc to find ways to 
help poland and hungary which were just beginning to revamp their 
backward economies 
since then the community has scrambled to bring together 
twodozen western countries and drum up commitments of more than 
12 billion in a variety of aid for poland and hungary 
the assistance is making a major contribution to reviving 
the stricken economies of poland and hungary said the community in 
a report on the yearlong program 
it has underpinned a radical stabilization program in poland 
which might otherwise have proved too risky and helped both 
countries to begin modernizing their economies it said 
because of the riches promised by the program other nations in 
eastern europe have appealed for help 
last week the foreign ministers of the group of 24 the 
western nations taking part in the program admitted 
czechoslovakia bulgaria east germany and yugoslavia romania was 
temporarily refused membership because of the recent violent 
repression of antigovernment demonstrators there 
no specific sums were promised to the new members but their 
addition to the program will likely mean billions of dollars in 
help 
to gain admittance the emerging democracies must commit 
themselves to the rule of law respect for human rights introduce 
multiparty political systems hold free and fair elections and 
impose economic reforms 
leaders in central and eastern europe who seek radical change 
in their countries political and economic systems accept the 
conditionality attaching to western assistance as a spur to 
reform said the communitys report 
it is also a guarantee to their peoples that the international 
community is paying close attention to the respect for political 
and economic freedom in their countries it said 
in setting conditions western officials hope to avoid pouring 
money into the economies only to have it squandered they contend 
loans granted to poland in the 1970s were wasted because of a 
poorly functioning economy poland now is having problems paying 
back its foreign debt of about 40 billion 
east european officials say the toughest part of their work is 
changing their centrally planned economies into the freemarket 
models practiced in the west 
to do that the countries must start from scratch 
they have to phase out government subsidies to farmers and 
others stabilize prices strengthen their virtually worthless 
currencies and allow private citizens to own property 
they also must create banking systems and develop labor markets 
complete with social security measures 
these are welcome indeed indispensable changes but they may 
well create transitional problems said the communitys report 
the soviet union could try to buy more goods from western 
nations rather than its neighbors in the east it said 
a further contraction in trade among the east europeans could 
exacerbate economic difficulties just as the reform process enters 
a critical phase the report said 
such drastic changes will likely cause at least temporarily 
higher unemployment and falling living standards 
the removal of subsidies and of guaranteed lifetime employment 
will test the social fabric and the libertarian values of the 
peoples involved the report said 
the western nations want their money to be used to overcome some 
of these obstacles

the state supreme court has rejected a challenge 
to colorados official english law which hispanic opponents call 
insulting and discriminatory 
the challenge to the 1988 ballot initiative did not address the 
official english issue directly but questioned the way election 
laws are applied 
the proponents of english only were shown repeatedly to have 
racial motives involved in their movement said attorney kenneth 
padilla who represented plaintiff rita montero they had an 
election which should never have been held 
montero a member of the national coalition against english 
only alleged that secretary of state natalie meyer improperly 
allowed backers of official english to collect new petition 
signatures after failing to present enough valid ones by deadline 
but meyer barred opponents from challenging the new signatures 
saying the challenge wasnt timely the lawsuit said 
the high court on monday ruled 63 that state regulations 
affecting voter initiatives should be read liberally to prevent 
thwarting the publics right to create laws 
the law which was approved by 64 percent of voters amended the 
colorado constitution to declare english the states official 
language sixteen other states have similar laws 
proponents of the law said their main goal was to force the 
government to use english but the governor of colorado and mayor 
of denver issued executive orders allowing the government to 
provide official information such as voting regulations in 
english and spanish 
the law has been blamed for some instances of discrimination 
against hispanics and asian immigrants in colorado including one 
where a public school bus driver ordered students to stop speaking 
spanish on the bus 
montero said she was unsure whether the coalition would continue 
to challenge the law 
state rep barbara philips who sponsored the initiative was 
unavailable for comment 
but philips lawyer shannon robinson said the ruling defends 
peoples access to the ballot 
theyre not saying its unconstitutional nothing about the 
amendment itself warrants reversal she said we feel the 
election laws were properly qualified by the secretary of state and 
they opponents had their day in court

the bush administrations push for mideast 
negotiations was delayed tuesday as israel sent word its foreign 
minister was not well enough to meet next week in paris with 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
the foreign minister david levy is recovering at home from 
surgery for a circulatory ailment levys physicians concluded 
after baker proposed the meeting that his health would not permit 
him to travel to france the state department spokeswoman margaret 
d tutwiler said 
baker attending an economic summit meeting here called again 
for israeli negotiations with palestinian arabs he said all seven 
democracies assembled here had concluded such talks offered the 
greatest potential for a mideast settlement 
us efforts to promote negotiations went into a tailspin in 
march with the collapse of the israeli government over bakers 
formula for the negotiations prime minister yitzhak shamir 
objected to arabsponsored provisions to include palestinians 
deported from the west bank and others with homes in east jerusalem 
the israeli leader viewed the provisions as a challenge to his 
nations retention of the entire city of jerusalem as its capital 
and advancing arab demands to recover the west bank 
but now that israel has formed a new government the bush 
administration is eager to try again baker has met in washington 
with egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid and wrote levy 
last thursday proposing the paris meeting 
baker already had plans to go to the french capital for sessions 
on germany and a talk with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze 
his letter to levy complimented the foreign minister as a 
problemsolver while describing himself as one as well 
diplomatic sources said at the same time baker restated the 
provisions that israel had opposed 
spokswoman tutwiler stressed levys health was the only reason 
for not holding the meeting she said baker would try to reschedule 
it later

two plumbing fixtures were installed on the 
space shuttles despite failing initial tests for leaks sen al 
gore dtenn said today they were among seven such fixtures that 
did not pass tests he said 
gore said the hydrogen plumbing fixtures called umbilicals 
were tested with liquid nitrogen using a simulated spacecraft part 
on one side when the units failed the test they were retested in 
another way he said 
nasa spaceflight director william lenoir denied that the parts 
failed the test he said retesting in a different manner was a 
normal part of the procedure 
lenoir said the umbilicals were first tested against what isunit which 
simulates where the umbilicals would 
called a slave be 
attached to the space shuttle orbiter 
the slave unit is not flight hardware therefore it is more 
likely to be the source of a leak than is the flight hardware 
said lenoir 
he denied that the test was redesigned in order to assure that 
the umbilicals would pass 
when leaks were detected in the first test lenoir said the 
slave unit was removed and a blank plate was substituted this was 
done he said because it was assumed the leak was from the rnings were 
2000 or 30 an hour after expenses 
that compares to the 7 an hour from the legitimate jobs that 75 
percent of the probationers reported holding 
we came to this study from an employment perspective said 
karen hastie williams chairwoman of the committee on strategies to 
reduce chronic poverty one of the groups that commissioned the 
study 
we hoped to identify employment and training strategies to 
convince drug dealers to end their involvement in the underground 
economy and join the legitimate work force 
but conceded economist peter reuter even creation of 
considerably higher paying legitimate jobs probably wouldnt get us 
very far dealers would still have smaller total incomes than they 
can earn now by supplementing their regular wages with drug 
selling also many of them have expensive drug habits 
reuter the reports principal author said in an interview 
that while most streetlevel sales were by blacks the 
availability of drugs in washington affects not just the citys 
predominantly black population 
our figures show that there are 79000 cocaine addicts in the 
washington metropolitan area and over 78 percent of them live in 
suburban areas he said therefore a lot of people who are 
involved in drug transactions may not be black but are suburban 
whites who come into the city to make purchases and who take the 
drugs back to their communities for sale or use 
while a typical city street dealers earnings arent enough to 
finance flashy cars and lavish lifestyles it is the image of such 
luxuries that draw many young men into selling drugs reuter said 
in an interview 
people such as rayful edmond iii a convicted city cocaine 
kingpin send the wrong messages to many people who are considering 
getting involved in selling drugs they see that people like 
edmond who was able to create a large illegal drug organization 
living what they believe to be a high lifestyle but they never 
see the downside the consequences that can result from such 
activity 
edmond on trial on a murder charge has already been sentenced 
to life in prison without parole on a string of drug convictions 
the study found that dealers active at least two days a week 
face a 22 percent chance of going to prison a 7 percent chance of 
severe injury and a 14 percent chance of being killed a fatality 
rate 100 times that of the general work force 
given those risks the report said long periods of steady 
earnings are unlikely to be common 
looking at black men born in 1967 the study found that up to 
one in six had been charged with selling drugs by the time he 
turned 20 for the future the researchers said the ratio is 
likely to be closer to one in three before that age group reaches 
30 
the study held out some hope among the youngest group surveyed 
the 387 ninth and tenth graders while one in six was selling 
drugs only about 11 percent were using them 
that could mean that antidrug messages may be getting through 
to the younger population in the city reuter said adding 
however the downside is that many juvenile sellers are involved 
in other delinquencyrelated offenses

issues given tuesday at the 1990 economic summit of industrialized 
nations 
terrorismequals 
we the heads of state or government reaffirm our condemnation 
of terrorism in all its forms our commitment to make no 
concessions to terrorists or their sponsors and our resolve to 
continue to cooperate in efforts to combat terrorism we demand 
that those governments which provide support to terrorists end such 
support immediately we are determined not to allow terrorists to 
remain unpunished but to see them brought to justice in accordance 
with international law and national legislation 
we welcome the recent release of several hostages but remain 
deeply concerned that hostages are still being held some for more 
than five years their ordeal and that of their families must end 
we call for the immediate unconditional and safe release of all 
hostages and for an accounting of all persons taken hostage who may 
have died while being held we call on those with influence over 
hostagetakers to use their influence to this end 
we note with deep concern the continuing threat presented to 
civil aviation by terrorist groups as demonstrated by such 
outrages as the sabotage of civil aircraft over lockerbie 
scotland on dec 21 1988 above niger on sept 19 1989 and over 
colombia on nov 27 1989 we reiterate our determination to fight 
terrorist assaults against civil aviation 
accordingly we will continue our cooperation to negotiate a 
convention requiring the introduction of additives into plastic 
explosives to aid in their detection we pledge to work to 
strengthen international civil aviation security standards 
consistent with this objective we note the importance of making 
available training and technical assistance to other nations we 
support initiatives undertaken through the international civil 
aviation organization icao regarding this issue we will work 
together with icao to expand such assistance

nonproliferationequals 
we discussed the threat to international security posed by the 
proliferation of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and of 
ballistic missile weapons delivery systems 
with regard to nuclear proliferation we take special note of 
the recent declaration issued by the european council in dublin on 
that subject that document underscored the great importance 
attached to the maintenance of an effective international nuclear 
nonproliferation regime and the need to make every effort to 
contribute to strengthening nonproliferation and encouraging the 
participation of further countries in the regime the treaty on 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons npt is an important element 
of that regime we further endorse the ecs call for all states to 
apply iaea safeguards on as universal a basis as possible 
we also urge all nuclear suppliers to adopt nuclear export 
control measures equivalent to the nuclear suppliers group 
guidelines 
whether npt parties or not we commit ourselves to working 
actively to secure a satisfactory outcome to nuclear 
nonproliferation discussions in the forthcoming months including 
those at the fourth review conference of the npt 
we hope that these discussions will contribute to the 
achievement of as broad a consensus as possible in favor of an 
equitable and stable nonproliferation regime such a regime should 
be based on an indispensable balance between the nonproliferation 
of arms and the development of peaceful and safe uses of nuclear 
energy 
the global community has focused for decades on nuclear 
proliferation especially when combined with advanced missile 
delivery systems today we also face new and growing problems from 
the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons 
with regard to chemical and biological proliferation we commit 
ourselves to pursue efforts to prevent the diversion of chemical 
precursors at a national level as well as in the relevant western 
fora we similarly commit ourselves to be vigilant about the danger 
of potential diversions in the field of biological technologies 
we endorse a complete ban on chemical weapons through an 
effective and verifiable treaty as the only longterm guarantee 
against the proliferation of chemical weapons we believe an 
important step toward achieving such a treaty was made in the 
recent ussoviet agreement on destruction and nonproduction of 
chemical weapons and the recent declaration of intent by nato 
states to become original signatories to the chemical weapons 
convention we reiterate our determination first expressed at the 
1989 paris conference on chemical weapons to redouble the effort 
at the conference on disarmament in geneva to resolve the remaining 
issues and to conclude the convention at the earliest date we also 
urge all states to become parties as soon as it is concluded 
similarly as the 1991 review conference on the biological weapons 
convention approaches we call on all nations that have not become 
party to the convention to do so and to participate in 
confidencebuilding measures designed to strengthen its 
effectiveness 
we wish to highlight the importance of dealing with the related 
threat of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear 
chemical and biological weapons we note especially the 
contribution of the missile technology control regime mtcr to our 
joint efforts to control missile proliferation we applaud the 
recent decisions of additional nations to adhere to the mtcr and 
we call upon all nations to observe the mtcr guidelines

the flaw with miss washington 1990 lies not in 
her intelligence talent or beauty its in her hometown which 
happens to be in oregon 
local contest officials in washington contend that lynnae marie 
thurik should be declared ineligible because she didnt spend 
enought time in the state 
contestants have been known before to hop states in the pageants 
that lead to miss america this years rules for the national 
pageant require contestants to either have lived in the state for 
six months be attending school there or work there a minimum of 
half of a full work week 
thurik who is busy working out studying and giving mock 
interviews in preparation for the miss america pageant on sept 8 
said she was clearly eligible for the contest 
i wouldnt have been on the stage if i wasnt qualified she 
said tuesday in a telephone interview from vancouver wash just 
across the columbia river from the her home in lake oswego a 
portland suburb 
thurik 26 sells advertising for oregonbased this week 
magazine and her territory includes clark county wash 
patti belik president of the washington state association of 
local scholarship pageants said monday that her group asked 
national pageant officials to examine thuriks sales logs to see 
how much time she actually spent in washington 
going back two years in issues there is very very little in 
this week from clark county belik said 
phyllis goldhammer head of the miss washington scholarship 
pageant said thurik qualified for miss clark county by employment 
and her enrollment in photography and fitness courses at clark 
college a twoyear school in washington 
miss america officials in new jersey would not confirm that they 
had received the associations letter and referred all questions 
to the miss washington office 
thurik who graduated in 1986 with a degree in fine arts from 
pacific lutheran university in tacoma said she has entered 14 
pageants and has competed for miss oregon three times finishing as 
second runnerup last year 
she said winning miss america has been her dream since age 5 
ever since i was a child i looked up to her and molded my life 
after her i would not even steal a cookie from the cookie jar 
because i told myself miss america would not do that she said 
last years miss america winner debbye turner won the miss 
missouri pageant but her home was actually in jonesboro ark 
said larry webber chairman of the board of the missouri contest

mikhail s gorbachev handily won reelection 
tuesday as soviet communist party leader from a congress that 
assailed him for eight days but concluded the party could not 
survive without him 
although opposition appeared to melt away as the delegates 
considered electing a new general secretary a sizable 
antigorbachev sentiment was evident in the balloting 
delegates at the 28th congress of the soviet communist party 
voted 3411 to 1116 to keep gorbachev as general secretary his 
opponent teimuraz avaliani a siberian party leader received 501 
votes to 4026 
under congress rules delegates are required to take a separate 
vote on each candidate it was the first time a general secretary 
was elected by a congress and not a plenary meeting of the central 
committee 
gorbachev nodded silently at the results but did not smile as 
the delegates responded to his victory with loud applause 
in a brief acceptance speech the 59yearold president and 
party leader expressed gratitude for enormous support and trust 
the congress had placed in him i thank you for this he said 
he said he would take into account the criticism leveled against 
him and would take the most serious farreaching conclusions 
from it 
he then adopted a serious tone of voice and said you elected 
me after hearing my positions i take my election as support for my 
positions 
many had expected the congress could pose a challenge to 
gorbachev but delegates approved gorbachevs proposal to 
reorganize and expand the party politburo transferring greater 
power to the government that gorbachev heads 
the top party job carries no fixed term of office but the 
meeting changed party rules to require that the general secretary 
be elected by a congress which traditionally meets every four or 
five years rather than by the central committee which meets 
several times a year the change will make it harder for opponents 
to oust gorbachev as party leader a post he has held since 1985 
in march gorbachev was elected to a fiveyear term as president 
with authority newly strengthened at his initiative 
gorbachev was nominated as general secretary in a secret vote at 
the grand kremlin palace a short walk from the hall where the 
congress is being held 
he received warm applause as he stepped up to the congress 
podium to accept the nomination 
i carry the most responsibility for what has been done he 
told the delegates accepting the nomination you have the 
possibility you have a lot of information its right that you 
should decide 
gorbachev and seven others were nominated for the top communist 
party post 
amnog those nominated from the floor of the congress for the 
party leaders post were interior minister vadim a bakatin 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and gorbachev adviser 
alexander n yakovlev all withdrew their names except for 
gorbachev and avaliani party leader in the siberian city of 
kiselyovsk 
i do not see a stronger more experienced candidate than 
gorbachev shevardnadze said 
vladimir kalyuta a worker from the coalmining region of 
kemerovo nominated gorbachev on behalf of the congress council of 
representatives a committee made up of delegates from major 
geographical regions 
avaliani 58 was also head of a strike committee in a labor 
protest for higher pay and better working conditions in the 
kuznetsk coal basin last summer 
the nomination of the stocky whitehaired avaliani came on the 
eve of a oneday miners strike protesting the governments 
inability to fulfill promises it made to end last years strike 
miners are demanding the government resign 
in his address avaliani said he favored continued government 
control of key enterprises and supports strikes only on a 
casebycase basis 
although nominations were open to the floor conservatives did 
not nominate politburo hardliner and key gorbachev critic yegor 
k ligachev 
the congress did not nominate him that says it all said 
moscow party boss yuri prokofiev asked if he thought ligachevs 
political career was over prokofiev replied yes i think so 
prokofiev told reporters that vladimir ivashko president of the 
ukraine the soviet unions secondlargest republic and a key 
agricultural and energyproducing region was the favorite for the 
new post of gorbachevs deputy 
selection of ivashko could be a bid to quiet separatist trends 
in the ukraine 
at the opening of tuesdays session gorbachev lashed out at his 
conservative critics 
you can never go back to yesterday by any path and no 
dictatorship solves anything he said jabbing his hands in 
the air for emphasis 
if any of the delegates came to the congress with the hope of 
returning the party to old conditions comfortable or 
uncomfortable this is not a question he said they were 
seriously mistaken 
more than 40 percent of the 4700 delegates to the congress are 
officials in the party apparatus

a television reporter told a judge the name 
of a confidential source today and was immediately freed from the 
jail where he had served two weeks of a sixmonth contempt of court 
sentence 
i want to see my wife and my son and have a pizza and beer 
said kmol reporter brian karem moments after he was freed by state 
district judge pat priest 
karem was jailed june 27 for refusing to say who arranged a 
telephone interview with jailed capital murder suspect henry 
hernandez hernandez and his brother julian are charged in the 
march 1989 shooting death of a san antonio police officer gary 
williams 
karem today identified the source as deborah ledesma a cousin 
of the hernandez brothers 
he said he decided to reveal the name after ms ledesma who now 
lives in california agreed to relieve him of his promise to 
protect her identity 
during todays hearing priest asked karem about the extent of 
ms ledesmas involvement when told she had simply arranged the 
interview priest said i dont understand then what would be 
the need for anonymity on her part she never had anything to 
do with the statements that you ran on the air is that correct 
karem replied yes then priest said he is released 
karems attorney larry macon said he and other lawyers 
obtained a telephone deposition monday night from ms ledesma who 
has been living in santa clara calif since may 1989 
in the deposition the woman confirmed that she helped arrange a 
threeway telephone conversation that also involved karem and henry 
hernandez macon said 
attorneys in the murder trial of the hernandez brothers have 
said they need to know who arranged the interview to assure a fair 
trial and determine whether the interview should be admitted as 
evidence 
henry hernandez said in the interview that he shot the officer 
in selfdefense 
in a telephone interview carried live by kmol monday night 
karem indicated he would be out of jail soon and contended that 
the defense has known for some time who the source was 
im kind of upset that it took 13 months for the district 
attorney and the defense to do their job theyve been playing a 
game he said 
earlier monday the supreme court voted 72 to reject karems 
emergency request that he be freed pending his appeal of the 
judges contempt order that led to his jailing

a 95yearold man who is believed to be the 
oldest murder defendant in city history is back in the apartment 
building where he allegedly bludgeoned a neighbor to death 
the slaying of 88yearold norma marks has tenants at the 
building on manhattans upper west side demanding the immediate 
jailing of oliver barre he was arrested after being found covered 
with blood on the floor of the dead womans apartment on june 16 
authorities said 
barre told police he beat mrs marks to death with a metal pipe 
in selfdefense he was released without bail by two judges over 
the protests of residents and the prosecution 
i was quite concerned to have a person in that condition 
walking around the building said cyla guerwicz a 23year 
resident he could snap at any moment its a reasonable 
concern 
more than 140 residents signed a petition demanding barre go to 
jail pending his trial the petition said they feared for their 
collective safety and wellbeing 
barre a navy officer during world war i was released on his 
own recognizance by criminal court judge laura drager who also 
turned down prosecution requests that he be held for psychiatric 
tests 
another judge ordered barre to hire a roundtheclock home 
attendant to keep an eye on him 
barre told a police officer who responded to the slaying that 
mrs marks was a murderer who had poisoned 15 to 20 people in the 
building court documents indicated 
barre who had minor scratches claimed mrs marks had tried to 
strangle him and she was killed in selfdefense the document said 
mrs marks was struck repeatedly with a metal pipe suffering a 
fractured skull jaw and ribs along with massive cuts and bruises 
two officials of the prosecutors office dismissed barres 
defense as well as a published report that the killing was 
prompted by a love triangle involving a third woman age 86 the 
officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the case is 
before a grand jury 
the manhattan district attorneys office says it knows of no one 
older than barre ever charged with murder in the city 
assistant district attorney bridget brennan told acting state 
supreme court justice george roberts on tuesday that the grand jury 
could decide on an indictment by the end of the week 
barre who appears solidly built attended the brief court 
session in a wheelchair wearing a baseball cap that read us 
submarine veterans he sat silently as brennan addressed the 
judge 
defense attorney john bb lewis assisted by a nurse pushed 
his client out of the courtroom and into an elevator without 
commenting on the case the attorney also did not return a phone 
call to his office

it was the dinner party of the year the hottest 
ticket in town but houstons power set found itself playing social 
secondfiddle at tuesday nights official summit dinner 
the local moneyed set were relegated to the wings until after 
the hickorygrilled veal medallions were served on tiffanydesigned 
china to president bush his fellow summiteers and top government 
officials including vice president dan quayle 
most of houston society which griped early on about too much 
business and too few parties at the economic summit was simply 
left out 
bush who calls houston his home town invited about 80 power 
brokers contributors and friends to the fine arts museum for 
afterdinner entertainment and a chance to mingle with the mighty 
quick social diplomacy by bush kept feathers from getting too 
ruffled over the lack of a meal 
the president sent word early this was to be a substantive 
meeting a serious meeting retired bank president ben love said 
of the dinner 
i have not heard anyone in houston question to what degree we 
are to participate in anything that is the call of the 
president said love a major contributor to houstons host 
committee 
those lucky enough to even make the blist were mostly 
republican heavyweights and business tycoons socialites werent 
invited 
it was ridiculous for them to think theyd be invited said 
houston chronicle society columnist maxine messenger this is a 
threeday business meeting not a social playground 
mexican restaurant maven ninfa laurenzo a bush friend said she 
planned to wear a conservative black silk suit to the afterdinner 
entertainment because its not a sparklingtype evening its 
sparkling in its own way 
and as far as missing out on the meal 
we have plenty of tacos thank god she said i think its 
just an honor to be in the same room with all these world leaders 
county judge jon lindsay was one of only 14 houstonians to make 
the alist for dinner because hes both the elected head of harris 
county government and a bush friend 
other than being a member of the exclusive group of western 
leaders itself this is the next best thing he said 
lindsay said his wife planned to wear the same dress she wore to 
a dinner last friday no one knows her at this dinner so no 
ones seen the dress before he said 
we are excited needless to say lindsay said this is a 
great event for a little ol guy like me

manuel noriegas longtime personal banker and 
five codefendants formed a partnership in crime to launder 32 
million in drug profits through worldwide financial transactions a 
prosecutor said tuesday 
the defendants five bank of credit and commerce international 
employees plus a colombian airplane broker knew the huge sums of 
cash they were trying to disguise were proceeds of cocaine sales 
but didnt care assistant us attorney mark jackowski said in 
closing arguments 
in fact they even offered helpful laundering hints to an 
undercover agent to skirt ladea which stood for the drug 
enforcement administration he said 
from the evidence there should be no doubt in anyones mind 
the funds that were picked up on the streets of this country were 
from the sale of cocaine jackowski told the jury in summing up 
the governments case in the sixmonth trial 
a us customs agent posing as a wellconnected highstakes 
launderer during a twoyear sting told the bankers his clients were 
dope dealers who dont like mistakes jackowski said 
drugs smuggled into the united states were sold on the streets 
and the cash was converted into certificates of deposit that first 
were used as collateral for loans then to pay them off as they 
matured the government maintained 
the drug profits hidden through these elaborate transactions 
involving bcci subsidaries in panama luxembourg france and 
switzerland eventually were to wind up back in the hands of drug 
dealers to finance the next haul according to prosecutors 
what the government must prove is that the defendants acted in 
bad faith and that they didnt do so by some kind of mistakes 
or accident the prosecutor told jurors what it really is is a 
partnership in crime 
charged with conspiring to launder drug profits for the medellin 
cartel and with various laundering counts are five officers of the 
luxembourgbased bcci including amjad awan banker for deposed 
panamanian leader noriega 
on trial with awan who was miamibased assistant director of 
bccis latin american division are askbar a bilgrami a director 
of bccis latin american division syed aftab hussain bccis 
operations officer of the bank in panama sibte hassan an officer 
in the paris branch ian howard french country manager based in 
paris and rudolf armbrect of medellin colombia 
the bankers claim they never intentionally violated the law and 
were entrapped by the undercover agent 
the six defendants face a possible penalty of five years on the 
conspiracy count plus 20 years on each of the 30 laundering 
charges all are charged with conspiracy and various combinations 
of laundering

a typical young poorly educated black man 
selling drugs on the streets of the nations capital can count on 
earning 2000 a month tax free the rand corporation said 
tuesday 
not enough for a mercedes or great fortunes but more than 
four times as much an hour as drug dealers can expect to make from 
legitimate jobs 
researchers based their conclusions on information supplied by 
the city government about the 24000 people arrested for selling or 
possessing drugs from 1985 through 1987 interviews with 186 men 
aged 18 to 40 who said they had been involved with drugs and were 
on probation during that time and a survey of 387 boys aged 15 to 
18 
the report estimated that in 1987 alone an estimated 24000 
city residents were selling drugs on the street for the three in 
eight who were dealing daily the median monthly earnings were 
2000 or 30 an hour after expenses 
that compares to the 7 an hour from the legitimate jobs that 75 
percent of the probationers reported holding 
the study found that dealers active at least two days a week 
face a 22 percent chance of going to prison a 7 percent chance of 
severe injury and a 14 percent chance of being killed a fatality 
rate 100 times that of the general work force 
given those risks long periods of steady earnings are 
unlikely to be common the report said 
we came to this study from an employment perspective said 
karen hastie williams chairwoman of the committee on strategies to 
reduce chronic poverty one of the groups that commissioned the 
study 
we hoped to identify employment and training strategies to 
convince drug dealers to end their involvement in the underground 
economy and join the legitimate work force 
but conceded economist peter reuter even creation of 
considerably higher paying legitimate jobs probably wouldnt get us 
very far dealers would still have smaller total incomes than they 
can earn now by supplementing their regular wages with drug 
selling also many of them have expensive drug habits 
the estimated median income of streetlevel drug dealers was 
higher than the average 12898 retailtrade workers made in 
198788 according to the city government 
construction workers made 24879 on average while 
serviceindustry workers made 26545 the average annual salary 
for all privatesector workers was 25857 while government 
employees made 32118 
reuter the reports principal author said in an interview 
that while most streetlevel sales were by blacks the 
availability of drugs in washington affects not just the citys 
predominantly black population 
our figures show that there are 79000 cocaine addicts in the 
washington metropolitan area and over 78 percent of them live in 
suburban areas he said therefore a lot of people who are 
involved in drug transactions may not be black but are suburban 
whites who come into the city to make purchases and who take the 
drugs back to their communities for sale or use 
while a typical city street dealers earnings arent enough to 
finance flashy cars and lavish lifestyles it is the image of such 
luxuries that draw many young men into selling drugs reuter said 
in an interview 
people such as rayful edmond iii a convicted city cocaine 
kingpin send the wrong messages to many people who are considering 
getting involved in selling drugs they see that people like 
edmond who was able to create a large illegal drug organization 
living what they believe to be a hig lifestyle but they never see 
the downside the consequences that can result from such activity 
edmond on trial on a murder charge has already been sentenced 
to life in prison without parole on a string of drug convictions 
looking at black men born in 1967 the study found that up to 
one in six had been charged with selling drugs by the time he 
turned 20 for the future the researchers said the ratio is 
likely to be closer to one in three before that age group reaches 
30 
the study held out some hope among the youngest group surveyed 
the 387 ninth and tenth graders while one in six was selling 
drugs only about 11 percent were using them 
that could mean that antidrug messages may be getting through 
to the younger population in the city reuter said adding 
however the downside is that many juvenile sellers are involved 
in other delinquencyrelated offenses

liberian rebel leader charles taylor 
said tuesday his forces will refuse to observe a ceasefire and 
predicted he would capture the city of monrovia by the end of the 
week 
taylor speaking in a telephone interview with the british 
broadcasting corp was responding to published reports that he had 
accepted a ceasefire and the rebels march on the capital was 
suspended 
there will be no ceasefire taylor said 
taylor whose men appear to have made little progress since 
reaching the outskirts of monrovia a week ago said his national 
patriotic front is progressing carefully because of the massive 
loss of life 
we are only proceeding with caution while we evacuate people 
into safety zones to receive food and medical treatment he 
said this is why we have not stormed the capital as we should 
he conceded the final assault was taking a long time saying 
i understand that and i regret the long time but if we were to 
move in and tear that city apart the whole world would be jumping 
all over us 
he added my troops are exchanging fire right now in monrovia 
i think that monrovia should be down by the weekend 
the french news agency agence france presse which has a 
reporter with the rebels reported tuesday that the insurgents were

state water officials are searching 
for the cause of a fish kill in a river behind an arco chemical co 
plant where 17 workers died last week in an explosion and fire 
although an exact count had not been completed texas water 
commission spokesman bill colbert said quite a few fish were 
noticed drifting in the water or along the shore near bear lake an 
inlet of that river 
colbert said monday the commission was awaiting test results of 
water samples from the san jacinto river to determine the cause of 
the fish kill 
but preliminary tests pointed to a combination of factors 
including a sudden change in water temperatures and the possibility 
of caustic substances such as firefighting foam in the water 
first reports of the kill came several hours after a fire and 
explosion late thursday decimated an area the size of a city block 
at the plant colbert said and a field evaluation was initiated 
the next day

foreign companies operating in the united 
states chalked up 686 billion in us sales in 1987 but paid a far 
lower federal income tax rate than the average middleincome 
family the internal revenue service said tuesday 
the us subsidiaries together paid 56 billion in tax a rate 
of less than 1 percent of their income by contrast the typical 
35000ayear family paid at the rate of about 10 percent during 
the same period according to irs estimates 
the irs submitted the new information to the house ways and 
means oversight subcommittee which for nine months has been 
investigating the extent of tax dodging by some of the nearly 
45000 foreign companies that operate subsidiaries in this country 
the subcommittee zeroed in on 36 us distributors of foreign 
cars motorcycles and electronics which accounted for a combined 
35 billion in retail sales in 1986 
some of the companies investigated have been operating in the 
united states for years and have never sent a check to uncle sam 
for one thin dime in corporate income taxes said rep jj 
pickle dtexas chairman of the subcommittee 
they have failed to pay taxes despite the fact they have 
profited from selling billions of dollars of cars motorcycles 
stereos televisions vcrs microwaves and other products to the 
american consumer pickle said 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr agreed that foreign 
corporations may be substantially understating their tax liability 
but you cant jump too fast he said there may be other 
causes such as corporate structure and an inordinately high 
number of new and thus less profitable companies among the 
foreigncontrolled subsidiaries 
he agreed with the subcommittee investigators conclusion that 
the irs often is outmanned by corporate experts in such complex 
cases he asked congress for the authority to hire expert witnesses 
without competitive bidding and urged higher pay scales for irs 
employees 
subcommittee investigators said the main factor in the 
companies ability to avoid taxes was transfer pricing a 
practice in which a subsidiary typically pays an artificially 
inflated price for goods purchased from its overseas parent the 
result is a lower taxable profit in the united states 
government officials have known for some time that foreignowned 
companies generally pay a considerably lower tax rate than domestic 
corporations about 13 billion of additional taxes assessed 
against us subsidiaries because of transfer pricing is pending in 
appeals at the irs and in the courts 
members of congress are eyeing that money and even greater 
amounts they say could be obtained with stiffer enforcement as 
one way to cut the federal budget deficit 
before congress acts to raise taxes on the average citizen in 
order to reduce the deficit we should be sure that us 
subsidiaries are paying their fair share of the current tax load 
rep richard schulze rpa said at the hearing tuesday 
congress acted last year to strengthen the irss hand in 
investigating noncompliance by foreign corporations a pending 
bill would go even further 
pickles investigators found that 
over a 10year period more than half the foreign companies 
they investigated paid little or no us income tax 
one electronics distributor paid more than 150 million in 
taxes over six years a second company with similar products 
assets receipts and distribution operations paid no tax at all 
both are us subsidiaries of foreign corporations the difference 
transfer pricing 
for tax purposes one company sold television sets to an 
outside distributor for 150 but charged its own distributor 250 
one foreign carmaker charged its us distributor 800 more than 
its canadian distributor 
some foreignowned subsidiaries have engaged in kickbacks and 
imposed illegal freight and insurance charges as part of their 
taxavoidance schemes 
one electronics company grossed 4 billion over seven years and 
reported tax liability of 15 million over 10 years the irs told 
investigators the company paid no tax because it used operating 
losses to get refunds of what little tax it had paid during 
profitable years 
ten of the 18 car distributors investigated grossed 38 billion 
in 1987 and paid 366 million in tax again less than 1 percent 
but when operating losses are carried back the rate will drop even 
lower 
the irs said that while japanesecontrolled companies accounted 
for 27 percent of receipts of us subsidiaries in 1987 they paid 
only 21 percent of the taxes britishcontrolled subsidiaries had 
15 percent of the sales but paid 31 percent of the taxes west 
germanowned companies rang up 9 percent of sales and paid 77 
percent of the taxes

a coalition of consumer health and insurance 
groups said tuesday that more federal leadership and money are 
needed to help prevent 600000 deaths that result each year from 
consumer products 
in releasing a status report the coalition for consumer health 
amp safety said 80 percent or more than 480000 of those deaths 
involved cigarettes and alcohol 
stephen brobeck chairman of the coalition said that while 
there are hopeful trends many improvements are needed 
particularly discouraging is the recent rise in motor vehicle 
and household product deaths and the two most dangerous products 
cigarettes and alcohol still take a horrendous toll he said 
federal agencies must increase their efforts in all of these 
product areas to do so they must be adequately funded said 
brobeck executive director of the consumer federation of america 
which formed the coalition 
brobeck did not say how much money should be added to the effort 
overall but with respect to the consumer product safety 
commission he said its 35 million budget for this year should be 
increased to 75 million 
politically that wont happen but it should he said 
more money also needs to be channeled to the national highway 
traffic safety administration and to combat aids and alcoholism 
brobeck said but he did not specify how much 
the report focused on seven areas of concern motor vehicle 
safety home and product safety cigarette smoking indoor air 
pollution food safety and nutrition alcohol consumption and aids 
among the findings 
47093 people were killed in motor vehicle accidents in 1988 
an increase of 15 percent from 1987 when 46390 died on the 
nations roadways and a 06 percent rise from the previous years 
toll of 46087 
falls were the leading cause of fatal accidents in the home 
accounting for 6500 deaths in 1988 fires were the secondranked 
cause followed by suffocation poisoning firearms and drownings 
cardiovascular disease one of the key factors for which is 
diet killed nearly 1 million americans in 1987 while nutritional 
deficiencies caused a reported 2890 deaths in the united states 
that year 
cigarette smoking was responsible for 390000 deaths in the 
united states in 1985 between 1965 and 1987 the proportion of 
american adults who smoked dropped by 40 percent for men and 21 
percent for women about 49 million americans still smoke 
cigarettes 
alcohol was involved in 90991 deaths in 1986 up from 88935 
the previous year 
the coalition of 37 groups includes 16 insurance companies and 
associations as well as health groups such as the american academy 
of pediatrics and the american college of preventive medicine and 
consumer groups like the center for science in the public interest

thousands of albanians seeking asylum in foreign 
embassies in tirana will be ferried to italy under an agreement 
being worked out between albania and the united nations the 
foreign ministry said tuesday 
we hope the operation can begin by the end of the week a 
foreign ministry spokesman said in rome he spoke on condition of 
anonymity another source said it could begin as early as thursday 
a representative of un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar was in the albanian capital tirana negotiating the 
departure procedures on behalf of the almost a dozen embassies 
where albanians have taken refuge he said 
under the agreement the asylumseekers would be ferried from 
albanias adriatic port city of durres to either brindisi about 85 
miles away or otranto on the italian coast the spokesman said 
the italian government is working on contracting commercial 
vessels to bring out the albanians the official said adding he 
expected that several trips would have to be made to evacuate them 
all 
the italian red cross was preparing to provide assistance to 
refugees arriving in italy 
although foreign diplomats have estimated the number of 
albanians in the embassies at 5000 the italian spokesman said 
there are about 3000 including about 800 in the italian embassy 
more than 2000 are believed to have taken refuge in the west 
german embassy alone 
the asylumseekers began taking refuge in the embassies on june 
28 in a bid to escape europes last hardline communist regime 
some dodged police bullets as they climbed over embassy gates 
the albanian ambassador to italy dashnor dervishi said tuesday 
the albanians in all the embassies were free to go the problem 
is resolved he told a reporter without referring to the news 
that italy is preparing to evacuate the asylumseekers 
if there is a delay its because of the governments that 
maintain these people like guests dervishi said he described 
those seeking asylum as hooligans 
the first 51 albanians allowed to leave tirana landed in 
czechoslovakia tuesday czechoslovak president vaclav havel sent 
his official airplane to tirana for the refugees 
italian officials reported tuesday that six albanians who fled 
their country in a small boat were picked up in the adriatic during 
the night by a west german sailboat after their outboard motor 
failed they were brought to lecce 
capt francesco nistri of the port captains office said the 
six aged 21 to 25 described themselves as political dissidents 
and added they want to go to west germany 
in a telephone interview with the italian news agency agi 
italys ambassador in tirana giorgio de andreis said the embassy 
has completed paperwork to obtain exit permits for the albanians in 
his embassy 
he said the situation inside was calm because the albanians 
finally see the light at the end of the tunnel 
nothing is decided yet he said we hope to resolve it 
soon 
he told the news agency that most of the albanians in the 
embassy eventually want to go on to the united states canada and 
britain 
conditions in the dozen or so embassies harboring the albanians 
continued to be grim food water and medicine were in short supply 
because the albanian leadership refused to allow foreign aid to 
reach the missions 
a baby was born saturday in the west german embassy the most 
crowded and czechoslovak officials said they had heard of a second 
birth there 
in prague the arriving albanians were apparently unwilling to 
talk about their experiences they evaded reporters questions upon 
arrival saying they feared for the safety of relatives back home 
some shouted long live havel before boarding buses at the 
airport for a dormitory 
one albanian who made his way to yugoslavia told reporters that 
despite modest reforms the albanian government still was 
oppressive and economic hardship was a part of daily life 
ari ferhate gjani 36 told yugoslavias state tanjug news 
agency that police had been ordered to cease stopping people on the 
street without reason still he said many albanians especially 
the young longed for more freedom 
many other albanians seeking to emigrate have said they seek 
better economic conditions 
antonio bernardi an italian sales representative returning from 
a business trip from tirana told a reporter at the yugoslav border 
crossing that many of the asylumseekers were teenagers or people 
in their early twenties 
despite a police cordon around embassy row parents of the 
youths were allowed near the missions to try and persuade them to 
return home bernardi said 
bernardi who said he was a frequent traveler to tirana said 
the capitals streets appeared peaceful away from the embassy 
district 
albanias communist leader ramiz alia began this year to 
institute some economic reforms in the nation of 32 million and 
sought to establish limited ties with other countries 
for 45 years travel for average albanians has been virtually 
impossible but a package of new regulations entitles all albanians 
over age 16 to have a passport

the chief of the astronaut corps said tuesday 
that shuttle commander david m walker was suspended for more than 
flying his jet trainer within 100 feet of a pan am airliner 
it was an incident that was considered you might say it was 
one of the more severe incidents donald r puddy director of 
flight crew operations said in a telephone interview from houston 
at the same time it was not the only one and not necessarily the 
principal one 
he declined to elaborate saying only that the space agency had 
become concerned about some things in the manner which he was 
flying 
walker a navy captain who had flown in space twice was 
replaced on a defense department mission set for march 1991 and 
suspended for 60 days from flying nasas t38 jet trainers 
at the same time nasa announced a oneyear suspension for navy 
cmdr robert l gibson who took part in a civilian air show race 
last saturday in which a pilot was killed 
the suspensions are the first for nasa in nearly 30 years of 
manned space flight 
neither gibson nor walker has had any public comment about the 
suspensions which were announced monday 
puddy said he had no reason to believe that dave is not going 
to stay with the program and no reason to believe he will not 
eventually be put back on t38 flying status 
he said he had not talked with gibson 
my personal feeling is that other members of the astronaut 
corps understand that there was a violation of policy and they also 
understand we had to take the action said puddy 
until two years ago nasa had no written guidelines for 
astronaut behavior and tolerated some dangerous outside activities 
gordon cooper one of the mercury seven astronauts was fond of 
fast cars and was about to make his professional driving debut when 
nasa stopped him fourtime space flyer james lovell fractured his 
arm and shoulder while skiing apollo 7 astronaut walter cunningham 
fractured a vertebra on a trampoline 
in 1988 however puddy issued an order prohibiting astronauts 
in training for flight from taking part in risky recreational 
activities where there exists exposure of major or even fatal 
injury 
he cited examples auto boat airplane or motorcycle racing 
parachute jumping and snow skiing 
gibson a threeflight veteran was considered to be one of 
nasas star commanders 
walker has a reputation as a hellraiser one space veteran 
said hes in the old mode of the mercury astronauts he likes 
flying fast and he likes to race people 
the national transportation safety board has not completed its 
investigation of the walker incident which occurred may 15 1989 
as he was flying his t38 to dulles international airport to take 
part in a white house ceremony 
the pilot of the pan am airbus reported the incident as a near 
collision ntsb spokesman michael benson said that the factual 
report of the incident is due in about a week and that the 
boards ruling on the probable cause of the incident will follow 
the ntsb also is investigating the airshow death at new 
braunfels texas 
the safety board is particularly interested said warren wandel 
supervisory air safety investigator in the dallasfort worth 
regional office because it was the third air show fatality in four 
weeks in his region there have been seven deaths in seven 
accidents nationwide this year 
nasas astronaut corps has 85 members 62 of whom are in 
training for 12 future shuttle flights 
the rationale for our rules is to preserve the assigned 
crews said puddy we do not have enough people in the 
astronaut office to provide backups for every single crew member 
for all aspects of training 
it is been just over a year since astronaut s david griggs was 
killed while performing aerial stunts in his world war ii vintage 
plane at an airshow 
at the time nasa spokesman jeff carr said the agency could not 
police the astronauts 
you cant lock these guys in their houses he said these 
guys have thousands of hours flying experience they take a greater 
risk driving down the gulf freeway in houston than by flying 
air force col fred gregory who has been assigned to take 
walkers place on the 1991 mission said its easy for astronauts 
to stray from the rules 
all of us are pilots and all of us are very aggressive 
pilots he said its sometimes difficult for us to separate 
our outside activities and our piloting skills and just the thrill 
of flying its unfortunate in this particular case 
both dave walker and hoot gibson are terrific pilots but this 
is just a temporary activity and basically its a wrist slapping 
sometimes we have to do it to get somebodys attention

teimuraz avaliani the longshot challenger to 
mikhail s gorbachev for leader of the communist party led 
siberian coal miners in a strike last summer and has a history of 
challenging central authority 
alone among seven people nominated to face gorbachev avaliani 
refused to withdraw his candidacy for his trouble he was buried 
in a gorbachev landslide 
despite his rebellious background avaliani was cautious in a 
speech before the vote 
the nearly 4700 delegates to the 28th congress of the soviet 
communist party listened quietly as the whitehaired avaliani 
wearing a gray suit no tie and a white shirt open at the collar 
said strikes were not always the best means of resolving disputes 
when people dont have any clothes to wear when they have 
tried everything and have appealed two or three times to the 
highest authority and the authorities dont do anything i dont 
see any choice in this country but to strike he said 
but conditions varied by region he said and i have different 
approaches to the strike movement in different concrete 
situations 
he also advocated a strong army kgb and police recommended a 
gradual rather than an abrupt shift to a market economy and said 
major businesses should remain under government control rather than 
private ownership 
on security issues he said that the army police kgb and so 
forth should be strong in no case should the government allow 
uncalled for attacks on them 
gorbachev sat impassively through the speech leaning on the 
green felt dais with his arms crossed and intently watching 
avaliani 
the former strike leader received little applause and few votes 
under the soviet system in which voters cast positive and negative 
ballots for each candidate avaliani received 501 votes for and 
4026 against 
gorbachev received 3411 votes for and 1116 votes against 
avaliani first entered the national scene early last year when 
a central newspaper reported that in the early 1970s he had 
written to then soviet leader leonid i brezhnev suggesting that 
he resign 
instead avaliani was forced out of his job as a plant director 
in the kuznetsk basin of western siberia the secondlargest soviet 
coal field 
in march 1989 avaliani was elected to the congress of peoples 
deputies the national parliament that selected from its members 
the supreme soviet legislature and this march voted gorbachev a new 
fiveyear term as president 
a year ago avaliani led a regional strike committee in the 
kuznetsk basin leading negotiations in which the government gave 
in to virtually all the strikers demands 
he is popular in kuznetsk and on april 4 was elected first 
secretary of the communist party organization in kiselyevsk 
alexei solovyev a member of the strike committee said in a 
telephone interview that miners were surprised at the moderate tone 
of avalianis speech 
i think that he betrayed our principles consenting to run for 
this high position said solovyev whose committee is organizing 
a oneday protest strike wednesday in defiance of pleas from 
gorbachev and the party congress 
i am sure that this will have a negative effect on his 
prestige down here he said in a telephone interview from the 
town of kemerovo in the kuznetsk basin

a magistrate who believes the legal drinking 
age should be lowered skirted sentencing rules to let a group of 
underage drinkers off the hook 
district justice jacob williams ordered youths cited for 
underage drinking to perform 30 hours of community service a state 
law requires a 90day drivers license suspension for the first 
underagedrinking offense 
i am going to get hung by the bosses in harrisburg for doing 
this williams said after sentencing monday i believe the 
penalty is too stiff a sentence for what they have done it is not 
my prerogative to secondguess the legislators but the sentence is 
too stiff 
cynthia scopetti a spokeswoman for mothers against drunk 
driving disagreed claiming alcoholrelated accidents among 16 to 
20yearolds had decreased since the law was passed in 1988 
madd agrees that the pain of losing a drivers license is hard 
on a youth but it is a small price to pay when you compare it to 
even the loss of one life she said 
sixtysix youths were charged with underage drinking after a 
rock concert at the civic arena in june 
williams has disposed of about 20 cases by throwing out the 
charges or declaring the defendant guilty but not recording the 
verdict thereby skirting the mandatory sentence 
about 40 cases are pending 
williams said the drinking age should be lowered from 21 to 18 
because when they are 18 or older we give them the right to vote 
and serve in the armed services

textron lycoming agreed tuesday to pay the 
government 179 million to settle a fraud investigation focusing 
on the companys problemplagued coast guard helicopter engines 
the settlement is the largest ever reached under the justice 
departments whistleblower lawsuit program 
robert c ballew a procurement official for the prime 
manufacturer of the coast guard hh65a dolphin helicopters will 
receive 27 million for his role in filing the original suit 
against textron in may 1988 
textron based in stratford conn was under investigation for 
providing engines that failed to meet their operating 
specifications and for fraudulently billing the coast guard for 
repair work according to the justice department the helicopters 
are used in searchandrescue and drug interdiction missions 
former coast guard commandant paul yost once referred to the 
engine as a lemon 
separate investigations by the national transportation safety 
board have shown according to published reports that at least 14 
deaths are attributable to failures of the lts101 engine 
manufactured by textrons lycoming williamsport pa plant the 
engine is used in private helicopters as well as air ambulances 
commercial choppers and air national guard helicopters 
this settlement sends a clear message that the government will 
simply not tolerate fraud perpetrated against the american 
taxpayer said stuart gerson assistant attorney general for the 
justice departments civil division 
textron also agreed to maintain the engines and supply parts for 
the next six years and be paid a fee based on the engine flying 
time that provision could save the coast guard an estimated 60 
million according to the justice department 
this arrangement will increase textron lycomings incentive to 
improve the engines longevity since textron lycoming will now 
bear the costs of the replacement parts gerson said 
the twoyear government investigation showed that the engines 
were operating at higher temperatures than was called for in their 
initial design as a result the engines were deteriorating faster 
than expected the engine was supposed to fly for 2400 hours 
between overhauls it usually lasted less than 600 hours before 
expensive repairs were required 
the probe also turned up evidence that textron charged the coast 
guard for work related to repairing engine defects even though the 
coast guard had stated it would not pay the charges 
textron issued a written statement that admitted no wrongdoing 
but the company said it hoped to normalize relations with the coast 
guard and pledged to maintain the reliability and mission 
availability of the engines 
textron said it had set aside money for the settlement and that 
the 179 million payment will have no material impact on the 
companys bottom line

helicopter corp a french firm that makes the dolphin he said in 
a telephone interview that he filed the suit because he feared he 
could be sent to jail when aerospatiale was unable to cure problems

opposition politicians said tuesday the prison 
escape of one of perus top guerrilla leaders was highly 
suspicious and suggested the possibility of government complicity 
in the breakout 
victor polay a leader of the procuban tupac amaru 
revolutionary movement and 47 other suspected members crawled to 
freedom early monday through an elaborate blockandahalflong 
tunnel built under the miguel castro castro prison in northeastern 
lima 
polay whose brotherinlaw paul caro is health minister 
escaped 18 days before the administration of president alan garcia 
is to leave office at the expiration of its fiveyear term alberto 
fujimori is presidentelect 
the garcia government has been hobbled by high inflation and a 
protracted guerrilla war primarily involving the shining path a 
violent maoist organization that operates mainly in the northern 
and eastern andean highlands 
criticism of the prison escape was quick senatorelect alberto 
borea of the centerright fredemo coalition said its quite a 
coincidence that in the governments final days the terrorist 
victor polay should escape he was a close friend of many aprista 
party members and i find it highly suspicious 
polay 38 is the son of one of the founders of the centerleft 
aprista party now headed by garcia in the early 1970s polay 
studied in europe with garcia 
leftist congressman manuel dammert called on interior minister 
agustin mantilla to resign 
its unheard of that one of the most dangerous terrorists in 
the country has escaped from what is supposed to be the countrys 
most secure prison dammert said 
former interior minister gen luis cisneros said in a television 
interview monday night he learned that police intelligence 
personnel had information six weeks ago that there would be an 
attempted breakout he called the mass escape inexplicable 
police captured polay on feb 3 1989 he was facing charges of 
terrorism in connection with the deaths of more than 100 policemen 
and his trial was expected to conclude in a few weeks 
the day after his arrest he received a private visit by 
thenprime minister armando villanueva villanueva was roundly 
criticized over the visit which he said he did as a friend of the 
polay family 
investigators said the sixfootwide escape tunnel was built 
nearly 20 feet underground they said it had its own lighting and 
ventilation system and probably took six to 10 months to build 
the exit opened into an adobe shanty 500 feet from the prison 
walls neighbors said a young couple who lived in the house have 
disappeared 
in statements to the press garcia called the escape 
scandalous and promised a complete investigation of 
corrections department personnel who were on duty 
police said monday night they had detained 20000 people in a 
massive sweep through lima for the escapees most were later 
released 
the tupac amaru revolutionary movement took up arms against the 
government in 1984 and is believed to have about 1000 combatants 
in january three tupac amaru guerrillas assassinated former 
defense minister enrique lopez in the parking lot of a lima 
shopping center in october the group kidnapped hector delgado a 
prominent businessman who was an adviser to garcia delgado was 
released in april but no details of the negotiations surrounding 
his release were released 
some officials and newspaper editorials suggested tuesday that 
polay could have been allowed to escape as part of a trade that 
also involved delgados freedom 
the tupac amaru group takes its name from an 18th century 
revolutionary who led a successful revolt against spanish colonial 
rule in the andes which run north to south through peru 
in a communique distributed monday the guerrillas pledged to 
continue their fight after fujimori takes office on july 28

a woman who falsely accused a man of raping 
her is appealing an unorthodox perjury sentence that requires her 
to pay for advertisements apologizing to the man 
the appeal filed monday in dawson county district court claims 
that elizabeth irene richardsons sentence violates her rights to 
free speech due process and protection from cruel and unusual 
punishment 
the sentence also is an improper delegation of judicial 
authority and not a permissible condition of probation the appeal 
said 
ms richardson 24 accused gary nitsch 44 of raping her in 
september 1988 he was arrested and charged with sexual assault 
ms richardson testified that nitsch raped her but the case was 
dropped for lack of evidence 
word later reached authorities that ms richardson told friends 
the rape was a hoax she was convicted of perjury in february 
county attorney john marsh said the womans motives centered on 
trying to get the attention of her husband a truck driver who was 
often away from home 
a hearing has been set in county court july 17 before the same 
judge that sentenced ms richardson she will ask district judge 
john murphy to suspend her sentence and allow her to remain free on 
bail until the nebraska supreme court rules on her appeal 
murphy ordered ms richardson to apologize to nitsch in a 
halfpage advertisement in every newspaper and a primetime spot on 
each radio station in this county of about 22000 in central 
nebraska 
the media campaign was expected to cost about 1000 she also 
was sentenced june 8 to 180 days in jail and placed on two years 
probation 
tod mckeone ms richardsons attorney said he has found no 
precedent to support the appeal 
weve got a long way to go he said since we had to file 
the appeal 30 days after the sentence there was not enough time to 
dig in and find favorable precedent you just have to hope you run 
into some things too that will help

barbara bush says an enormous rat swam by her in 
the white house pool recently but president bush came to her rescue 
and drowned the beast 
the rat she encountered in the incident several months ago did 
not look like a walt disney friend ill tell you that she said 
in an interview published by newspapers in houston and san antonio 
on tuesday 
mrs bush who was back in texas for the economic summit said 
her husband came to her aid at the outdoor pool 
i swim with a mask so as it went right by in front of me i 
mean it was enormous said mrs bush a mileaday swimmer 
fortunately george bush was there and drowned the beast it was 
horrible 
the white house grounds attract rats she said because were 
surrounded by parks and people drop food 
or she theorized it was an effort to get rid of the rodents 
that may have led this one to find its way into the white house 
pool 
they put some stuff out that only bothered rats and what it 
did is make them very very thirsty and this rat went for the 
biggest water it saw she explained 
she also credited her english springer spaniel millie with 
helping reduce the local rat population 
for a long time afterward she said she insisted that her 
guards check to make sure there wasnt a rat in hiding before 
she entered the pool 
on another subject she said her husband was absolutely 
exhausted when he got to houston friday night from the nato 
summit in london but she added that they have both been delighted 
by the warm reception houstonians have given their international 
guests 
after viewing the friendly crowds along a motorcade route to 
rice university i told george that this is the first time ive 
gone that far in a car back and forth where everybody waved and no 
unfriendly gestures she said 
she said houstons heat was not too much for the summit spouses 
all of these ladies have been in hot places before she 
said ive been to malaysia on state trips and you just learn to 
glow in public how much are they outdoors nothing twenty 
minutes at the most

a century of statehood was celebrated 
tuesday in wyoming with free buffalo burgers and a reminder that 
the state was the first to give women voting rights 
under mostly sunny skies state officials and dignitaries in 
cheyenne reenacted the statehood ceremonies led in 1890 by francis 
e warren wyomings last territorial governor and its first 
elected governor 
the thousands who jammed the statehouse lawns to watch the event 
cheered time and again at the mention of womens rights 
gov mike sullivan reciting warrens speech generated cheers 
when he got to the section noting that wyomings constitution 
granted free and equal suffrage to its citizens regardless of 
sex 
that section had troubled us senators who on june 27 1890 
were shocked by the idea that this frontier territory seeking 
admission into the union wanted to give women the right to vote a 
senator from alabama said women were too dainty to dabble in 
politics 
but when the issue came to a vote the senate gave its approval 
2918 on july 10 1890 president benjamin harrison signed the 
bill admitting wyoming to the union as the 44th state and the 
first to grant women the right to vote 
this rich history was lost on 9yearold steve miller of 
cheyenne who came downtown at 6 am so he could be first in line 
for one of the 10000 buffalo burgers being given away free 
five hours later steve had a burger pickles and potato chips 
on his plate and he found a spot on the lawn to enjoy the meal he 
would have gone back for seconds but they got to serve the other 
people he said matteroffactly

democratic political system as well as soviet attempts to reform 
their economy along market principles we commit ourselves to 
working with the soviet union to assist its efforts to create an

in mongolia and nepal in the philippines the government continues 
to engage in courageous efforts to consolidate democracy

by renewed political and economic reform particularly in the field 
of human rights we agree to maintain the measures put into place 
at last years summit as modified over the course of this year we 
will keep them under review for future adjustments to respond to

bulgarias first freely elected 
parliament in 58 years faced a constitutional crisis on tuesday as 
it convened its inaugural session without a president 
petar mladenov resigned the presidency last friday after 
admitting he suggested in december that tanks be used to disperse 
tens of thousands of demonstrators rallying against communist power 
mladenov had been instrumental a month earlier in toppling 
bulgarias hardline leaders but the communist party remained in 
control of the government the party later renamed itself the 
socialist party 
meanwhile the student protesters who forced mladenovs 
resignation continued a sitdown strike in front of the 
presidential palace in sofia the capital 
the students camped in about 150 tents near the palace said 
they had collected nearly 9000 signatures on petitions demanding 
the new president be a nonsocialist and that premier andrei 
lukanov resign the official bta news agency said 
the petitions also called for a public and televised trial of 
ousted communist strongman todor zhivkov 
the students began their sitin to protest alleged manipulations 
in last months parliamentary elections in which the socialists 
won a majority of seats 
the new parliaments opening ceremony was held in a woodpaneled 
hall in this ancient bulgarian capital 150 miles northeast of 
sofia 
the opening session a ceremonial affair held in sweltering 
heat was adjourned after only 40 minutes and will resume july 17 
at the parliament building in sofia it was opened by yosif petrov 
at 81 the oldest deputy 
in a brief opening speech alexander lilov chairman of the 
socialist party said the time of the totalitarian parliament is 
over now is the time of the democratic parliament 
but he added we are against chaos and destabilization in the 
country everyone has the right to protest but everyone has also 
the obligation to work 
as the parliament convened three small rightwing nationalist 
parties organized demonstrations in veliko turnovo and other cities 
to protest the representation of ethnic turks in the legislature 
bta said antiturkish protesters staged fiveminute strikes in 
the northern city of razgrad and the southern city of kurdzhali 
where almost half the population are ethnic turks 
the news agency said nationalist demonstrators also staged a 
twohour blockade of the highway linking ruse near the romanian 
border and the black sea port of varna 
the protesters were demanding the new parliament invalidate the 
election of 23 ethnic turkish deputies representing the movement 
for rights and freedoms 
they accused the primarily ethnic turkish party of cherishing 
panturkish and panislamic aspirations bta said 
the partys leader ahmed dogan who was attending the opening 
parliamentary session refused comment on the protests 
the movement for rights and freedoms is the third largest party 
in the 400seat grand national assembly or parliament the 
socialists have 211 seats and the union of democratic forces the 
main opposition coalition have 144 
the grand national assemblys first task will be to agree on a 
presidential candidate and elections there is no precedent for 
electing a president in bulgarias parliamentary history 
the parliament may either decide to elect the president or call 
a referendum 
mladenovs departure came less than three weeks after his party 
of reformed communists won the elections 
mladenov was instrumental in the ousting of zhivkov prodded by 
popular demonstrations mladenov then played a key role in 
reforming the party 
his departure has weakened the ruling socialists and created a 
power vacuum 
in another development the chief prosecutors office announced 
that it will complete its preliminary investigation of zhivkov on 
july 18 the prosecutor would then have one month to decide whether 
to put zhivkov on trial and if so set a date for the proceedings 
zhivkov has been under investigation for alleged abuse of power 
incitement to ethnic hatred and misappropriation of state property 
one of the ousted leaders defense attorneys protested the 
announcement of a date for concluding the investigation saying it 
created the impression that zhivkovs defense is being ignored

western leaders paid tribute tuesday to east 
europeans who have overthrown repressive regimes to bring about 
political and economic changes on their continent they urged 
troubled romania to follow the example of its neighbors 
president bush and the leaders of six other rich democracies 
attending their annual economic summit hailed the moves in central 
and eastern europe toward democratically elected governments and 
freemarket economies 
europe is at the dawn of a new era they said in a political 
statement we welcome enthusiastically the profound and historic 
changes sweeping the continent 
they said they wanted to seize all opportunities to achieve a 
europe whole and free and welcomed the drive toward unification 
of the two german states the german merger they said should 
contribute to stability in europe 
the leaders called on romania to adhere to the positive 
trend unfolding in neighboring countries the bucharest 
government has been accused of complicity in the recent violent 
repression of antigovernment protestors 
they said they were ready to give fledgling democracies needed 
constitutional legal and economic advice and financial assistance 
as appropriate 
the leaders remarks underscored their efforts to aid the 
countries in eastern europe as they pull away from the soviet 
union long their main support 
at last years summit in paris bush and his counterparts asked 
the european community the 12nation trading bloc to fashion an 
aid program to encourage the changes unfolding in poland and 
hungary 
in just a year twodozen wealthy nations including the united 
states france west germany and japan have promised to give more 
than 12 billion in loans technical advice and food supplies to 
poland and hungary 
reacting to appeals from other east european countries they 
agreed last week to draw czechoslovakia east germany bulgaria and 
yugoslavia into the program romania was temporarily denied 
membership because of the political repression there 
its not known how much the west will be able to raise for the 
four new additions to the aid program but help will likely be 
substantial 
in a report on the program the communitys executive body said 
the assistance is making a major contribution in helping the 
sick economies of poland and hungary 
it has underpinned a radical stabilization program in poland 
which might otherwise have proved too risky and helped both 
countries to begin modernizing their economies it said 
in handing out the aid the western nations insist that the new 
democracies commit themselves to the rule of law respect for human 
rights introduce multiparty political systems hold free and fair 
elections and impose economic reforms 
leaders in central and eastern europe who seek radical change 
in their countries political and economic systems accept the 
conditionality attaching to western assistance as a spur to 
reform said the community report 
it is also a guarantee to their peoples that the international 
community is paying close attention to the respect for political 
and economic freedom in their countries it said 
the money is designed to help east european officials change 
their outdated economies from centrally planned ones to freemarket 
systems 
to do that the governments must build from the ground up 
they need to get rid of government subsidies to farmers and 
others stabilize prices and bolster worthless currencies they 
must develop banking systems and labor markets 
the community said in its report that the changes are 
indispensable but may well lead at least temporarily to higher 
unemployment and reduced living standards

300000 miners would walk out in western siberia he said 61 of 130 
mines would strike for the entire day and the rest would strike 
for part of the day

more pay and improved vacation benefits better housing and better 
supplies of consumer goods

improve conditions for them

moscow and a day after teimuraz avaliani a leader of last years 
strike in the kemerovo region stood against mikhail s gorbachev 
in the election for party leadership 
gorbachev easily defeated avaliani and solovyev said avalianis 
candidacy would hurt his popularity among miners who are highly 
critical of the communist party 
i think that he betrayed our prinicples consenting to run for 
this high position solovyev said i am sure that this will 
have a negative effect on his prestige down here

a television newsman jailed for refusing to 
identify a confidential source emerged free from a courtroom 
tuesday after giving the judge his sources name 
the source released kmoltv reporter brian karem from his 
promise of confidentiality monday night karem said after the us 
supreme court declined his second request to be freed 
i want to see my wife and my son and take a day off and eat 
some pizza and drink some beer and never wear orange again karem 
said after his release 
the 29yearold broadcast journalist who wore an orange uniform 
during his two weeks in jail was held in contempt of court and 
sentenced to six months in jail for refusing to say who helped 
arrange a telephone interview last year with jailed murder suspect 
henry david hernandez 
hernandez and his brother julian are charged in the march 1989 
shooting death of a san antonio police officer henry david 
hernandez told karem that he shot policeman gary williams in 
selfdefense 
lawyers in the hernandez case said they needed to know who 
arranged the interview to determine whether it could be admitted as 
evidence 
karem on tuesday identified the source as deborah ledesma a 
cousin of hernandezs he handed over a notebook page containing 
names and phone numbers of those who helped set up the interview 
the reporter said he would do it again if it meant keeping a 
promise to a source 
i didnt intend to prove anything i just intended to keep my 
promise so i kept my promise he said 
state district judge pat priest questioned the womans need to 
remain anonymous then freed karem from the contempt citation 
outside the courtroom karem kissed and hugged his wife pam 
their 18monthold son zachary who had been carried out of the 
courtroom when he shouted daddy daddy daddy and waved at 
karem slept in a stroller 
karem accused lawyers in the hernandez case of using him to do 
their investigative work 
the press should be the last place that prosecutors and 
defense attorneys go to seek their information not the first 
karem said they never tried anyone else before they came to me 
defense attorneys and prosecutors grilled karem about whether 
bexar county sheriff harlon copeland helped arrange the interview 
although copelands name was in his notes karem said he did not 
speak with him directly in setting up the phone conversation 
last week copeland said he tracked down karems source and 
correctly identified her but karem had refused to confirm ms 
ledesma was his source 
ms ledesma now living in santa clara calif told attorneys 
monday she arranged a conversation in march 1989 between hernandez 
and karem karem said that was one of two phone conversations he 
had with hernandez that night 
karem said he agreed to keep ms ledesmas name secret because 
she feared some of hernandezs family members 
she didnt want her name attached to it and she even said she 
didnt want her employer knowing i was talking to her karem said 
karem lost two supreme court bids to remain free while he 
appealed the contempt of court citation his appeal of the 
citation which was still before the 5th us circuit court of 
appeals now becomes moot

the image of the health and diet 
conscious californian was debunked tuesday by a new study that 
shows twothirds of state residents dont eat enough fruits and 
vegetables 
its part of the myth of california state health director 
kenneth kizer said people are just not aware of the link between 
diet and cancer if people make the link their consumption of 
fruits and vegetables does go up 
now theyre eating too many fruit loops and not enough 
fruit salads with the produce section of a supermarket as a 
backdrop kizer released the 1989 california dietary practices 
survey two years after the state launched a five servings a day 
educational program 
health officials say people should increase their consumption of 
dietary fiber which helps prevent cancer by eating at least five 
servings of fruits or vegetables each day 
but the survey found that fewer than two out of three 
californians actually do so one out of five doesnt eat any fruit 
during an average day the report found and 27 percent eat no 
vegetables 
californians are really not much better than the rest of the 
nation when it comes to their diets said karen bunch director 
of the survey research team we do eat more fruit than the rest 
of the nation but not more vegetables 
nationwide 45 percent of americans dont eat fruit or drink 
juice during the day and 22 percent dont eat vegetables or 
salads ms bunch said 
californians also appear to be less informed than the rest of 
the nation about the importance of eating fruits and vegetables as 
part of a healthy diet the survey found forty percent of 
californians surveyed said they dont believe that what a person 
eats can affect their chances of getting cancer compared to 33 
percent in a nationwide survey in 1987 
the report concluded that fruit and vegetable consumption 
increased with education income and knowledge about the link 
between diet and health 
too many californians are not aware of the link between diet 
and cancer kizer said adding that 150000 californians die each 
year from diseases related to a poor diet he said 35 percent of 
cancers can be prevented by eating more fruits and vegetables as 
can 20 percent of heart diseases 
even when californians do eat fruits and vegetables they dont 
show much imagination their diets dont normally include some of 
the more exotic varieties now available in supermarkets 
of those who eat fruits and vegetables the no 1 choice was 
orange juice 283 percent and green salad 286 percent the 
survey found 
in order of popularity the top 10 fruits consumed included 
orange juice bananas apples peaches oranges cantaloupes 
plums watermelon apple juice and nectarines 
for vegetables the top 10 list in order of popularity 
included green salad potatoes tomatoes lettuce mixed 
vegetables corn carrots broccoli green beans and onions 
people are just not in the habit of eating right and when 
they do eat fruits and vegetables they eat the same things bunch 
said it took kiwi fruit 10 years to catch on there are so many 
varieties out there i mean its not like boring oat bran 
the telephone survey conducted from may through september 1989 
randomly questioned 1000 california residents about what they had 
eaten during the previous 24 hours the survey has a 3 
percentagepoint margin of error

the senate armed services committee chairman 
facing demands for deeper cuts in defense than he has proposed has 
laid out an alternative that calls for a cut of 285000 military 
personnel congressional sources said tuesday 
sen sam nunn dga in closeddoor sessions with members of 
his panel suggested the deep personnel cut to illustrate the 
impact on the military from significant reductions in defense 
spending 
nunn has argued the money would have to come from personnel and 
readiness to meet budget cuts many democrats have demanded saying 
the reductions couldnt come from major weapons systems where the 
money is spent over several years 
to meet the defense total of 294 billion approved by the senate 
budget committee and its chairman sen james sasser dtenn nunn 
said the nations armed forces that currently total 21 million 
would have to be reduced by 285000 said sources who requested 
anonymity 
however to meet nunns defense figure of 297 billion the cut 
in personnel would total 100000 the sources said 
if approved by the committee later this week the full senate 
will then be forced to choose between nunns budget with its 
smaller cut in personnel or the package based on sassers defense 
total 
the senate is expected to consider the two bills just prior to 
the august recess 
the committee began crafting defense legislation for the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 the process has been delayed by the 
inability of white house and congressional negotiators to agree on 
how to reduce the federal budget deficit by 50 billion and at the 
same time decide on a 1991 defense total 
without a single figure for the military nunn decided that the 
committee would draw up two bills one to his total and another to 
the amount approved by the senate budget committee 
in the meetings with his panel nunn spelled out for lawmakers 
how an additional 3 billion cut would result in nearly three times 
the reduction in personnel said the sources who requested 
anonymity 
the panel is also weighing proposals that would slash president 
bushs 22 billion request for the program to place mx nuclear 
missiles on railroad cars said congressional sources 
the plan currently before the armed services committee calls for 
548 million in research and development money and elimination of 
the 13 billion in procurement and 269 million in military 
construction 
meanwhile in the house where congressional sources say 
committee action on the defense bill may be delayed until 
september house speaker thomas s foley dwash met with the 
panels chairman rep les aspin dwis to discuss whether the 
budget summit would hold up work on the defense bill 
foley in an interview with reporters said he wants to see the 
authorization bill completed before the august recess and prior to 
defense appropriations legislation

former threeterm gov arch a moore 
jr convicted of corruption and characterized as remoreseless by 
prosecutors was sentenced tuesday to five years and 10 months in 
prison and fined 170000 
moore 67 pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud extortion 
obstruction of justice and filing false income taxes during his 
1984 and 1988 campaigns and during his third term from 198589 he 
lost the 1988 reelection bid 
he was ordered to report to the federal correctional institution 
near petersburg va by july 31 
us district judge walter hoffman on monday had refused to let 
moore withdraw his guilty pleas 
no governor or other public official of that responsibility 
has ever been convicted for election fraud of this scope 
assistant us attorney joe savage said before sentencing 
arch moore is a criminal he said if there is one thing 
missing from that man its remorse 
moore a republican who also was governor from 19691977 and a 
us congressman for 12 years appeared stoic during the sentencing 
and later declined comment an appeal is pending said defense 
attorney william hundley 
us attorney michael carey said moore likely will serve at 
least 2 years before being considered for parole 
i think it sends a very clear message carey said if you 
violate the public trust you go to jail 
careys investigation into state government corruption also has 
netted the convictions of five legislators three lobbyists and a 
state senate aide 
moore pleaded guilty may 8 to extorting 573000 from coal 
operator h paul kizer in return for a 21 million refund from the 
states black lung fund which provides benefits to coal miners 
moore also pleaded guilty to trying to block a federal grand 
jury investigation into corruption in his administration 
and he admitted filing false income tax returns in 1984 and 1985 
and defrauding the state of his salary and benefits by funneling 
100000 in illegal cash payments into his 1984 campaign to buy 
votes 
hoffman sentenced moore to five years for extortion six months 
for mail fraud and two years each for the tax fraud charges all 
concurrent 
moore also got 10 months for the obstruction of justice charge 
which carries that mandatory prison term 
hundley said moores corruption involved campaignfunding 
violations not raids on the treasury and added i submit he 
served well and honorably 
moore is the second west virginia governor to be convicted on 
federal charges 
ww wally barron a democrat who served from 19611965 was 
convicted of bribing the foreman of a jury that acquitted him of 
bribery in 1968 he served three years and four months of a 12year 
sentence 
moore was acquitted in 1976 of extorting 25000 from a 
financial holding company trying to get a state bank charter 
hoffman rejected a separate state petition seeking to recover 4 
million from moore because of his corruption saying the petition 
was filed too late before sentencing moore was subpoenaed by the 
state bar which is seeking to annul his law license 
he also will lose his 173823amonth pension 
moores 1988 campaign chairman john leaberry was charged 
tuesday with filing a false income tax return for 1988 leaberry 
who has cooperated in the governments case against moore is 
expected to plead guilty

a government official said tuesday that 
colombia will never allow us troops to conduct antidrug 
operations on its territory saying such rambotype actions 
were better suited for american cities 
foreign minister julio londono made his remarks in a radio 
interview with the rcn network in response to an article in the 
july 16 issue of newsweek 
the newsweek article said the us southern command based in 
panama was drawing up contingency plans for us troops to play a 
support role in a dramatic series of antidrug strikes aimed at 
crippling the cocaine cartels in peru bolivia and colombia 
however the magazine said such raids were unlikely to happen 
anytime soon or possibly ever because of opposition in congress 
and the state departments reluctance to offend latin american 
countries 
colombian news media interpreted the newsweek article as 
suggesting us troops might be used in colombia 
but londono said colombia was opposed to any us military 
intervention and said washington could best assist in the drug war 
by helping the local economy 
where these rambotype actions are needed is in the big 
north american cities where big distribution centers are found and 
drugs are sold on street corners with the knowledge of american 
authorities londono told rcn 
if any us aid is needed it should be in the form of 
paying fair prices for our export products and avoiding import 
taxes on our agricultural and industrial products he added 
newsweek said the militarys contingency plans called for the 
forces of colombia peru and bolivia to attack local cartel 
targets while us forces would not be used in actual strikes all 
the logistics planning training and support would be provided by 
the americans the magazine said 
the magazine quoting an unidentified intelligence source said 
the pentagon has plans to use us special forces to capture 
colombian drug lords on orders from president bush 
colombia has a deeprooted sensitivity to a us military 
presence dating almost 90 years to the construction of the panama 
canal 
panama was long a part of colombia but in 1903 the united 
states backed a group of rebels who established a separate republic 
and signed a treaty for construction of the canal 
the us government has repeatedly demonstrated over the years 
that it understands colombias sensitivity about any us military 
role here 
last year president bush sent bogota 65 million worth of 
military aid for the antidrug war 
the us military transport planes flying in the equipment 
stayed only a few hours in bogota and the 150 american military 
technicians spent a few days in colombia to help set up the 
equipment and train troops in its use 
even so the colombian news media ran several stories about the 
presence of us troops in the country at the time

a federal judge tuesday suspended part of a 
wisconsin experiment that cuts the welfare benefits of families 
whose children skip school ruling that recordkeeping errors have 
resulted in cruel treatment 
an recent audit of the program showed that some families were 
being wrongly penalized because of poorly kept school attendance 
records a lawsuit against the program said one family was evicted 
from its home and others had to turn to food pantries for food 
us district judge terence t evans ordered the suspension of 
learnfare in milwaukee public schools at least until an improved 
system of recording school absences in the states largest city was 
devised 
it is an experiment with worthy goals of attempting to reduce 
welfare dependency and provide incentives for children to stay in 
school evans wrote in his ruling but recipients of aid to 
families with dependent children should not be made homeless and 
hungry in the name of social experimentation he said 
evans granted a preliminary injunction requested by the advocacy 
group legal action of wisconsin on behalf of six milwaukee families 
whose afdc benefits were cut by learnfare 
the injunction applies only to the 3200 teenagers attending 
milwaukee public schools who have lost or are in danger of losing 
afdc benefits under learnfare state officials said the program 
would continue elsewhere in the state 
learnfare authorized by the legislature in 1987 allows the 
state to cut a familys monthly afdc benefits if a school reports a 
student has been consistently absent without excuse penalties 
average about 100 a month for an average family receiving 517 a 
month in benefits 
the program applies to teenagers but gov tommy g thompson 
has received permission from the federal government to expand it to 
include elementary school students 
thompson said late tuesday the injunction was not a judgement of 
the merits of learnfare but of administrative problems in 
milwaukees public schools 
theres no question learnfare is a good program its 
working he said whats wrong is some very poor record 
keeping im just happy the injunction was granted in the 
summertime 
the milwaukee lawsuit filed in december charged the program 
violates the social security act and the us constitution it 
named as defendants the state department of health and social 
services and the milwaukee county department of social services 
it cited problems with the administration of learnfare 
especially attendancekeeping procedures in the milwaukee public 
schools and the states appeals hearing process 
evans said he would lift the injunction if the state and 
milwaukee county remedy their problems with monitoring school 
absences 
legal action attorney patricia delessio said 1600 to 2000 
milwaukee students are sanctioned each month under the program 
she said evans injunction did not address all of the legal 
challenges of learnfare pending in the courts 
we focused on the immediate administrative problems which i 
would describe as glaring she said it means welfare benefits 
will not be cut any longer 
assembly speaker thomas loftus a democrat who is challenging 
thompson in this falls governors race predicted the injunction 
would put a halt to learnfare 
i think it will stop it dead in its tracks for the foreseeable 
future loftus said

the wife of fbi director william s sessions 
accompanied her husband on 17 official trips aboard government 
aircraft but paid for only one flight according to a report 
released tuesday 
alice sessions accompanied her husband on a variety of business 
trips from washington to destinations including key west fla 
williamsburg va san francisco and new orleans from aug 11 
1988 through july 31 1989 said the report by the general 
accounting office 
while it didnt question the propriety of the trips the 
watchdog unit of congress criticized the justice department for 
failing to study the cost of using aircraft seized from convicted 
criminals to transport sessions and attorney general dick 
thornburgh 
the gao said it believed the department could save money by 
leasing planes 
fbi spokesman robert davenport said mrs sessions did not 
reimburse the agency for the trips because she was accompanying her 
husband on official business 
davenport said mrs sessions did pay the fbi 280 to cover one 
leg of a trip that included a stopover in san antonio texas for 
personal business 
sessions made 36 trips generally to visit fbi field offices and 
to make speeches to judicial and police groups thornburgh made 39 
trips during the period aboard the governmentowned aircraft 
mainly to give speeches and attend meetings 
five months after the gao began its study thornburgh reimbursed 
the justice department 2128 for eight trips his wife took on the 
government planes the report said 
the payment included 1371 for six official trips that mrs 
thornburgh took during the 12month period reviewed by gao the 
report said thornburgh also repaid the government 1032 in 1989 
for personal trips he and his family members took aboard the 
aircraft 
justice department policy does not require mrs thornburgh to 
pay for trips on official flights if there is an empty seat and 
the government would incur no extra cost said department 
spokesman dan eramian 
mrs thornburgh preferred in the exercise of an abundance of 
caution to reimburse the government for the trips eramian said 
in a letter to the justice department rep bob wise dwva 
criticized the agency for failure to adopt a travel policy 
particularly regarding issues such as what constitutes an 
official purpose or official function and when nonofficial 
passengers should be permitted to fly on government aircraft 
wise who asked for the report said seven months have elapsed 
since he was told a policy was being drafted 
eramian said a policy will be adopted adding it would have 
been silly to put something together until we saw what the gao 
recommendations were 
the gao study said the justice department failed to follow 
government guidelines when comparing the cost of using government 
aircraft seized from convicted criminals with the cost of using 
leased planes to transport thornburgh and sessions 
the justice departments own analysis conducted after the ga0 
began its study showed that the government was saving 500000 a 
year to use the seized aircraft instead of leasing planes 
if we had leased an aircraft and spent an extra half million a 
year we would have received a larger dose of criticism eramian 
said 
the gao report noted concern for the security of both thornburgh 
and sessions quoting from a 1989 justice department memo stating 
that the attorney general had been the subject of 13 threats during 
his first six months in office 
the report also noted that the fbi had received reports last 
year that thornburgh had been targeted by colombian hit squads 
after colombia resumed extraditing accused drug lords to this 
country

white house and congressional budget 
negotiators resumed their closeddoor talks on tuesday with 
bargainers hoping to complete a deal by congress august recess but 
unsure they can do so 
separately the bush administration renewed its call for a 
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget a week before 
the house is scheduled to vote on the proposal democrats predicted 
they would defeat it 
the budget talks aimed at finding enough tax increases and 
spending cuts to save at least 50 billion next year had been on 
hold since lawmakers began their independence day break on june 29 
the negotiations got off to a slow start tuesdays morning 
session was abbreviated because white house budget chief richard 
darman testified at a house hearing on the balanced budget 
amendment 
at a lunch with senate republicans federal reserve board 
chairman alan greenspan said that a multiyear deficitreduction 
package would help lower interest rates participants said 
proponents of serious cuts in the governments 150 billion annual 
shortfalls have long argued that a major benefit would be lower 
interest rates 
some participants in the talks fear that unless they shake hands 
on a deal by the lawmakers august break congress budget work 
could extend into an unusual postelection session but bargainers 
said they still had much work to do 
id be very brave indeed if i told you weve approached a 
number said negotiator rep bill frenzel rminn 
darman told the house judiciary committees economic and 
commercial law subcommittee that the administration supports 
passage of a balanced budget amendment by the house a vote is set 
for next tuesday 
darman argued that the costs of many federal programs are being 
passed on to future generations in the form of government 
borrowing which must be repaid 
although the voters of the present are extremely 
wellrepresented in our democratic system the voters of the future 
are not he told the subcommittee 
but panel chairman jack brooks dtexas complained that the 
amendment requires a balanced budget without addressing how to 
achieve one 
its written in the words of genesis let there be a balanced 
budget said brooks 
no 3 house democratic leader rep william h gray iii dpa 
predicted that conservatives supporting the balanced budget measure 
would fall short of the twothirds vote needed for approval of a 
proposed constitutional amendment

northern outskirts of jerusalem killing one teenager and wounding 
two 
police spokesman uzi sandori said the demonstrators blocked the 
main road near the shantytown of about 8000 palestinians and began 
hurling stones at passing vehicles 
they then assaulted an outpost manned by three policemen who 
fired tear gas rubber bullets and finally live ammunition to drive 
them back he said 
doctors at jerusalems mokassed hospital said 16yearold mumzer 
zuhdi musa adabed was brought in dead with a gunshot wound in his 
chest the 724th palestinian killed by israeli security forces or 
civilians since the 31monthlong revolt began fortyfour israelis 
have also been killed 
in the occupied west bank a palestinian identified as salim 
salah khuly 24 was found stabbed and beaten to death near 
tulkarum residents said the victim was suspected of collaborating 
with israeli authorities 
the army confirmed the death but blamed the slaying on internal 
strife between rival palestinian clans 
since the revolt began in december 1987 at least 233 
palestinians including khuly were killed by fellow arabs most as 
suspected collaborators drug dealers or prostitutes 
in other developments tuesday 
the attorney general ordered police to press charges against 
israeli peace activist abie nathan for allegedly meeting with 
leaders of the palestine liberation organization in violation of 
israeli law israel television said 
doctors advised foreign minister david levy to delay his 
meeting with us secretary of state james a baker iii in paris 
next week pending an improvement in his health levy 52 underwent 
surgery following a mild heart attack last month 
baker has sought for months to arrange israelipalestinian 
negotiations but his efforts have been deadlocked by israels 
insistence on excluding the plo from talks israel views the plo as 
a terrorist group 
police announced the arrest of israelis eli vanunu 33 and nir 
ephroni 27 for the 1984 murder of omar ahamad uda an arab gas 
station attendant they said the killing apparently was to avenge 
the death of an israeli female soldier believed killed by 
palestinian nationalists 
an informed israeli source meanwhile said israel supplied 
intelligence information to washington indicating that an elite 
military unit within the plo was behind the may 28 bombing at a 
jerusalem vegetable market that killed one israeli and wounded nine 
defense ministry spokesman dan naveh declined comment and 
officials in prime minister yitzhak shamirs office said they knew 
of no such information 
the bombing came two days prior to a failed speedboat attack on 
israeli beaches by a splinter plo faction 
plo chairman yasser arafat refused to condemn that raid leading 
to suspension of the 18monthold usplo dialogue launched after 
arafat renounced terrorism 
the israeli source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
bombing was the action of force 17 a military unit set up by 
arafat the source said this information was passed on to the 
united states and likely played a role in president bushs decision 
to cut off the usplo dialogue

held tuesday in moscow 
 
i maintain only one thing the policy that i have chosen i 
will pursue and for me the biggest prize is that my homeland will 
live soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
 
it is an illusion to think that after all dissenters all who 
do not wish to be drive belts and cogs of the apparatus quit the 
party it will retain all the property of the soviet communist 
party and the associated authority it will not be so the 
party will be bankrupt obliged to repay its debts to the people 
if only with its property boris n yeltsin president of the 
russian federation 
 
i dont see another force other than the party which could 
bring progress to our country hardliner yegor k ligachev 
 
our russian thirst for blood is showing its stupid and ugly 
and inhuman inna dementyeva a moscow delegate 
 
 
you can never go back to yesterday by any path and no 
dictatorship solves anything if any of the delegates came to 
the congress with the hope of returning the party to old 
conditions comfortable or uncomfortable this is not a question 
they were seriously mistaken gorbachev

police perusing demonology books as they prepare 
for a feared attack thursday by the zodiac gunman say he may have 
learned some of his victims birthdays from census data or social 
security forms 
all four of the shootings by the gunman so far have been in the 
early morning hours on a thursday the last one came three weeks 
ago thursday and the previous spacing of the attacks has led 
police to focus on this thursday 
tomorrow night is a target night police department 
spokeswoman suzanne trazoff said tuesday 
all of the gunmans victims were defenseless at the time they 
were shot two walked with canes one was inebriated one was a 
homeless man sleeping on a central park bench three victims 
survived the attacks a fourth died 
he has promised in letters to police the new york post and cbs 
to kill 12 people one for each sign of the zodiac his four 
victims all men have been a scorpio a gemini a taurus and a 
cancer 
the gunman scrawled the symbols for his victims astrological 
signs on each of the letters he mailed after the attacks 
increased police patrols were scheduled citywide to try to stop 
the gunman from stalking his fifth victim 
we feel that there is some significance with tomorrow night 
and the police department will be taking precautions and certain 
measures said chief of detectives joseph borrelli 
the astrological pattern of the shootings has police searching 
through books on astrology and demonology authorities also have 
consulted experts in the occult 
the homeless man 30yearold larry parham who was the most 
recent victim recalled telling a stranger his birth date two days 
before he was shot june 21 borrelli said 
the other two surviving victims couldnt recall being asked 
their birthdays by strangers 
police said the gunman may have gotten access to the birthdays 
any place where applications are filled out such as bank tellers 
windows or government offices borrelli also raised the possibility 
the gunman might have gotten information from census takers 
more than 50 suspects were questioned and eliminated so far 
during the investigation borrelli said 
i cant tell you that were now close to a a bona fide 
legitimate suspect yet the detective chief added 
trazoff refused to discuss specifics of the increased patrols or 
to comment on which part of the city has been targeted by the 
50detective zodiac task force as the site of a fifth shooting 
obviously to tip our hand would be counterproductive she 
said 
psychological profiles of the victims have been run through an 
fbi computer descriptions from two people have produced sketches 
of the gunman and some 1800 calls have been made to a 24hour hot 
line 
still detectives remain unsure how the gunman knows his 
victims astrological signs 
the gunman who claimed to be the same zodiac who terrorized 
san francisco during the late 1960s and early 70s is believed to 
have gotten his ideas from a 1986 book called zodiac which 
details the san francisco killings 
but the new york gunman who began his six letters to the media 
with the same phrase used in letters by the san francisco gunman 
this is the zodiac was not believed to be the same man 
author robert graysmith tells of how the san francisco killer 
stalked mostly young couples attacking them near bodies of water 
mostly on saturday nights during a full moon 
a man who called himself the zodiac sent letters to local 
newspapers claiming responsibility for as many as 37 killings and 
taunting the police to catch him 
despite an intense manhunt in the bay area the san francisco 
zodiac was never captured

militant cuban exile orlando bosch rejected the 
restrictive conditions the government had placed on an offer to end 
his 14 years in prison and federal officials said tuesday the 
terms were nonnegotiable 
the government had proposed a restrictive housearrest program 
that would allow officials to monitor boschs telephone 
conversations and require him to log the name and address of 
visitors 
hes willing to agree to all of the conditions except that 
one said boschs daughter myriam bosch its a matter of 
dignity hes not going to be an informant the fbi can do their 
own work 
ms bosch said her father notified his attorneys of his 
decision and they contacted immigration officials 
bosch has become a cause celebre for miamis staunchly 
anticastro cuban exile community which has held rallies and 
demonstrations on his behalf attended by leading politicians 
bosch spent 11 years in a venezuelan prison for allegedly 
masterminding the 1976 bombing of a cuban jetliner that killed all 
73 people aboard in 1968 he was convicted in a rocket attack on a 
polish freighter in miami and sentenced to 10 years in prison 
justice department spokesman dan eramian acknowledged that a 
lawyer for bosch had a number of questions about the terms of 
the proposed parole 
i see very little room to wiggle eramian said if he has 
questions we will be happy to explain the conditions to him 
another source with the justice department said the government 
will not negotiate the offer 
bosch wont accept the conditions and he wont be released 
unless he does the source told the associated press 
george yoss an attorney for bosch said he expected discussions 
with federal officials in washington to continue wednesday 
boschs family criticized the twopage list of conditions for 
the release of the 63yearold former pediatrician who suffers 
from declining health after years in venezuelan and us jails 
the conditions would require bosch to wear an electronic 
monitoring device remain at home for 21 hours a day and allow his 
telephone to be monitored 
bosch also would be subject to unannounced searches and lie 
detector tests and if instructed must present himself for 
deportation within 72 hours 
bosch has been held at the metropolitan correctional center 
south of miami since 1988 when he was arrested for parole 
violations and for reentering the country illegally

a federal suit filed tuesday on behalf of eight 
black children claims they are victimized by a school system that 
teaches minority pupils they are inferior to whites 
the classaction suit filed in us district court asks the 
court to find new york citys curriculum racially discriminatory 
said joseph fleming lawyer for the eight children 
the defendants are us education secretary lauro f cavazos 
new york state education commissioner thomas sobol new york city 
schools chancellor joseph fernandez and the city state and federal 
boards or departments of education 
children suffer irreparable damage from a curriculum of 
exclusion that literally teaches that people of african latino 
and asian descent have made no significant contribution to the 
development of civilization said bob law a radio talk show host 
who helped organize the lawsuit 
even at its most benign the schools eurocentric bias 
sends negative signals to nonwhite children for example referring 
to duke ellington as a bandleader but leonard bernstein as a 
maestro or orchestra conductor law said 
the lawsuit demands the school system adopt a multicultural 
curriculum which includes the existence true participation and 
contributions of african americans and other nonwhites in world and 
american culture sciences history arts and other areas of human 
endeavor 
david powell father of plaintiffs rashida 13 and hasani 9 
said hasani doesnt like history because he says he doesnt see 
himself there only white people 
law told a news conference the suit was filed because sobol is 
stalling on implementing recommendations of his own task force 
which advocated a multicultural approach to education in a report 
last year 
sobol accepted the task force findings but backed off in the 
face of highprofile resistance from two professionals asked to 
review the report law said they were diane ravitch a professor 
at columbia universitys teachers college and historian arthur 
schlesinger a professor at city university 
law said ravitch called the suggested reforms ethnic 
cheerleading 
law whose night talk show is broadcast on stations around the 
country used it to help get plaintiffs to come forward 
the eight children ages 8 to 14 attend public schools in the 
boroughs of brooklyn manhattan and queens 
schlesinger called for comment said im sympathetic to the 
purposes behind the suit but i dont think this is the way to go 
about organizing a curriculum 
ravitchs secretary said she could not immediately be reached 
chris carpenter spokesman for the state education department in 
albany said sobol and the board of regents agree with the task 
forces basic ideas and have not changed course because of 
opposition 
we see extremes on both sides and were trying to chart a 
course down the middle carpenter said we want revision to 
have intellectual and scholarly integrity and thatll take time 
fernandez spokesman james vlasto said fernandez would have no 
comment on the suit which he had not seen but vlasto added that 
since taking office this year fernandez has championed the idea of 
multicultural education 
etta fielek speaking for cavazos in washington said the 
department was unaware of the suit and does not comment on 
litigation

president bushs son neil a former director of 
the failed silverado savings and loan said tuesday he and the 
thrift were victimized by a system that was doomed to fail has 
failed and will continue to fail 
bush who served as a director from 1985 to august 1988 was 
interviewed before being advised the federal deposit insurance 
corp was gearing up to file a lawsuit charging that he and other 
directors acted improperly as board members 
abc news reported tuesday night that the federal governments 
lawsuit will claim silverados losses were due in part to 
negligence on the part of bush and others the suit will claim the 
directors did not act responsibly when they approved dozens of 
questionable loans abc reported 
bush told abc he was not aware of the pending lawsuit 
but he told the associated press he had performed properly and 
that all loans that came before the directors were for projects 
previously approved by others more knowledgeable than he 
bush said the silverado case was insignificant compared to 
abuses found elsewhere in the nations thrift disaster which is 
expected to cost taxpayers more than 300 billion the silverado 
failure is expected to cost 1 billion in tax money 
he said thrift regulators from the federal home loan bank of 
topeka kan who approved the loans that contributed to 
silverados failure are trying to blame him for the thrifts 
collapse 
its selfserving the regulators are politically motivated 
he said 
bush said what angers him as a taxpayer and a citizen is that 
theres a system out there that in retrospect was doomed to fail 
that the federal government insured deposits up to 100000 and 
made our financial service industry a socialized industry 
guaranteeing the business activities of sampls 
with deregulation he said many in the sampl industry tried to 
grow out of problems and were doomed to fail 
and it has failed and it will continue to fail he said 
the only winners are the large corporations that end up buying 
these organizations for incredible terms 
the taxpayers are the ones getting screwed in this process 
he said they are angry and they should be angry 
bush said he might have been apprehensive if not doubtful 
about certain loans approved by silverado management if it werent 
for several factors 
one the federal home loan bank board had approved the 
structure of the loans and the deals that were made that are now 
being questioned by the same selfserving bureaucrats who are 
trying to make the case against silverado 
second we had legal counsel look at every deal and 
transaction to see that it fell within the regulatory rules that 
existed and thirdly we had accountants every year sign off and 
give silverado a clean bill of health at every step of the way we 
had good advice he said 
unfortunately in an economy that absolutely collapsed it 
didnt matter how good the appraisal was in 1985

walter leroy moody jr the target of a 
federal probe into two fatal mail bombings by an avowed racist was 
arrested tuesday with his wife on apparently unrelated charges 
a spokeswoman in the us attorneys office said moody and susan 
mcbride moody were charged with conspiracy obstruction of justice 
subordination of perjury bribery of a witness and tampering with a 
witness 
the moodys home in rex ga was thoroughly searched last year 
by federal agents investigating a series of mail bombings 
including two that killed a federal judge in birmingham ala and 
a civil rights lawyer in savannah letters that claimed 
responsibility for the bombings attributed them to a racist hate 
group 
bruce harvey a lawyer representing moody said tuesdays 
charges were not related to the bombing investigation 
the moodys were charged with trying to illegally induce the 
federal court in macon to issue a writ of error that would vacate 
moodys 1972 federal conviction for unlawful possession of a pipe 
bomb 
moody 56 a selfemployed literary consultant was convicted in 
1972 after a pipe bomb went off in his home injuring his 
thenwife hazel moody spent two years in federal prison 
tuesdays indictment said the moodys persuaded witnesses to sign 
false declarations and give false testimony to vacate the charges 
in hearings at the us district court in macon 
the witnesses julie linn west and her mother joanne ekstrom 
of atlanta provided an alibi for moody by saying they knew the 
macon bomb was planted by someone other than he 
the two women were relocated by the government in april after 
miss west recanted her testimony and claimed that moody paid her to 
lie in court proceedings according to the atlanta constitution 
the indictment said it covers activities during the period from 
1986 to 1988 as well as february and march of this year the search 
of the moodys home took place in february 
prosecutors claimed at the time of his conviction that moody 
planned to send the pipe bomb to an atlanta auto dealer who had 
repossessed his car 
if convicted moody could be sentenced to up to 69 years in 
prison and face fines of up to 12 million mrs moody 28 faces 
up to 64 years in prison

a federal appeals court tuesday upheld the 
random drug testing of an estimated 538000 airline employees and 
air traffic controllers saying public safety needs outweighed the 
employees privacy rights 
the ruling by the 9th us circuit court of appeals is one of 
several appellate decisions in the last year allowing random 
testing in safetyrelated and other sensitive jobs 
the supreme court has denied hearings to employee groups 
appealing the earlier rulings and has not yet ruled itself in a 
random drugtesting case but the high courts decision last year 
upholding drug testing of customs service employees seeking 
promotions to certain jobs that involve drug enforcement or guns 
was the basis of tuesdays appellate ruling 
the government interest in preventing drug use by persons 
holding safetysensitive positions in the aviation industry is at 
least as compelling as the interest in preventing drug use by 
customs officers wrote judge william norris in the 30 decision 
he also said the federal aviation administration provided 
evidence of some drug use by commercial airline employees 
including treatment of a number of flight crew members for cocaine 
overdoses or addiction and the presence of drugs in the bodies of 
two pilots after crashes no similar evidence was offered by 
customs officials who justified their testing program as a 
deterrent to future drug use norris said 
bob marx spokesman for the us department of transportation 
said the department was particularly pleased with the ruling 
because two other major drugtesting cases involving truckers and 
pipeline workers are are before the 9th circuit 
we consider random drug testing to be most effective way of 
keeping the transportation industry drugfree marx said 
the faas program implemented at the end of 1988 requires 
random urine testing of at least half the employees each year in 
safetyrelated jobs in commercial aviation they include pilots 
flight attendants instructors flight testers aircraft 
dispatchers maintenance crews security personnel and air traffic 
controllers 
employees who test positive for illegal drugs after a confirming 
retest and medical review are removed from their jobs the tests 
are conducted without advance warning 
other drugtesting programs involving the same employees 
including preemployment testing and testing based on reasonable 
suspicion of current drug use were not challenged in the lawsuit 
the suit by employee unions did not dispute that most of the 
jobs were safetyrelated but argued that unannounced random 
testing without individual suspicion of drug impairment intruded 
unnecessarily on employees right to privacy 
the constitutional ban on unreasonable searches requires that 
the government not be able to conduct suspicionless searches on 
people who are basically presumed to be guilty of no wrongdoing 
beyond those searches that can be fairly characterized as minimally 
intrusive such as highway checkpoints said walter kamiat a 
lawyer for the unions 
the fact that somebodys safetysensitive doesnt justify 
anything that the state wants to do to them the issue is what 
is the test and how intrusive is it into their privacy sense of 
dignity 
the court agreed that the fact that the drug testing was random 
and unannounced made it more intrusive but said it was not enough 
to outweigh the government interest in an effective testing program 
for safetyrelated employees

a thorough study of soviet economic needs as 
proposed tuesday at the houston economic summit would take longer 
than foreseen by the summit leaders the world bank said 
in a decision that eased a dispute over whether to provide 
emergency aid quickly to moscow the seven summit countries said a 
group of international financial institutions including the world 
bank would study soviet economic requirements 
they said the study to be supervised by the international 
monetary fund is to be finished by years end officials at the 
summit said 
the world bank however said a meaningful study would take more 
time 
a study of this nature would take a long time a year or so 
and could provide a useful basis for countries considering 
providing investment capital it said 
the bank also said that because the soviet union is not among 
its 151 members the banks directors in washington would have to 
approve the banks participation in the study 
france italy and west germany have pushed during the houston 
summit for a joint western package of financial aid to moscow they 
say that to wait would risk ending all momentum toward democractic 
reform in the communist country 
the united states backed by japan argues that moscow should 
make more economic and political reforms before it gets western 
cash the us delegation pushed for western technical assistance 
that would not include cash or financial credits 
as part of a technical aid program already under way the united 
states has sent central bank officials and other financial experts 
to moscow to advise soviet government officials on ways of 
developing a banking system and other capitalist institutions 
soviet officials also have come to washington to consult on 
technical economic matters 
in addition if the soviets drop barriers to emigration the 
united states could waive the jacksonvanik amendment thereby 
permitting normal trade between the two countries 
that step in turn could be followed by us trade credits and 
the easing of high technology exports the soviets may act on the 
emigration question in september 
president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev set in 
motion this type of cooperation at the summit in malta last 
december 
ed a hewitt of the brookings institution a think tank said 
us experts could aid the soviets in overcoming such problems as 
getting food to the market place about a third of all soviet food 
rots before reaching the dinner table because of inadequate 
transportation or storage facilities he said 
both hewitt and richard feinberg vice president of the overseas 
development council strongly support a major role for the world 
bank and international monetary fund in helping the soviets 
financial stabilization and structural changes are sorely needed 
in the soviet union and are precisely the areas the bank and the 
fund have been set up to deal with feinberg said 
the soviets have indicated a desire to join the two 
washingtonbased institutions the united states traditionally has 
opposed soviet membership but officials said the us position may 
be reassessed

be in contact via radio with a team on shore and his family in fort 
william scotland 
the most difficult thing is the first week just getting used 
to it and especially if you have bad weather he said 
should he encounter any storms then you throttle back and 
have a sleep in the fourposter bed onboard he said

prepare ourselves for that it could change so quickly said mrs 
gillham who was celebrating her 47th birthday 
if it wasnt brian i would naturally be disappointed but still 
happy if someone came out it would be a mixture of tears and joy

the justice ministry rejected amnesty 
internationals criticism of israels handling of the palestinian 
uprising as incomplete and misleading and based on information 
from politically motivated sources 
in its global survey released wednesday the human rights 
organization said many palestinian victims in the uprising died 
in circumstances suggesting excessive use of force or deliberate 
killings 
about 25000 palestinians were detained often without charge or 
trial and by years end over 13000 were still jailed amnesty 
said 
it said thousands of palestinians were beaten and kicked 
sometimes for refusing to remove roadblocks and paint over 
antiisraeli graffiti 
there were reports of torture and systematic illtreatment of 
political detainees including beatings on various parts of the 
body hooding deprivation and confinement in coffinsized cells 
said the organization which has its headquarters in london 
in its response the justice ministry said amnesty failed to 
give an adequate picture of violence in the west bank and gaza 
strip where palestinians have carried out a 31monthold uprising 
against israeli occupation 
the territories home to 17 million palestinians were captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
the ministry said amnestys report omits that during 1989 
there were 41161 public disturbances 359 cases of arson 734 
attacks using molotov cocktails 12 grenade attacks and 80 
shootings in the occupied lands 
these resulted in 385 israeli civilians and 909 soldiers being 
hospitalized it said 
as a result of these omissions amnesty internationals 
portrayal of the intefadeh uprising in the administered areas is 
incomplete and misleading the ministry said 
amnesty relies heavily on politically motivated sources in 
describing cases of palestinian detainees it said 
the justice ministry did not directly respond to the amnesty 
statement that 260 palestininans were killed by army gunfire during 
1989 but it denied israel carried out deliberate killings 
according to figures compiled by the associated press 724 
palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians 
during the uprising 
an additional 233 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaboration with israel fortyfour israelis 
have been slain by palestinians 
the army also dismissed amnestys allegation of excessive or 
indiscriminate force by soldiers 
an army spokesman said that in maintaining law and order in the 
territories israel seeks to find the proper balance between 
security and humanitarian requirements 
soldiers have strict orders on the use of force and faced 
penalties for violations said the spokesman who cannot be 
identified by name under army regulations 
force may be used to stop violent activity and to overcome 
resistance to arrest he said force is prohibited as a form of 
punishment or to deliberately inflict injuries 
while some excesses have occurred these have been 
unacceptable departures from policy and have been dealt with 
accordingly

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze has asked his warsaw pact colleagues to prepare a 
joint response to natos offer of a nonaggression declaration 
east germanys foreign minister said tuesday 
the minister markus meckel told reporters after meeting with 
north atlantic treaty organization officials that he received a 
letter from shevardnadze on monday 
in it he said shevardnadze solicited proposals for a warsaw 
pact response regarding what form a nonaggression declaration 
should take 
he said the same letter was sent to the foreign ministers of the 
other warsaw pact countries poland czechoslovakia hungary 
romania and bulgaria 
meckel said shevardnadze suggested in his letter that nato 
representatives be invited to attend some warsaw pact meetings 
perhaps those of its consultative political committee 
however nato sources who requested anonymity said the alliance 
would be reluctant to accept such an invitation since it would 
legitimize the sovietled military alliance in its present form 
at last weeks summit in london leaders of the 16 nato 
countries proposed that the warsaw pact and nato sign a joint 
declaration in which both alliances would declare they no longer 
are adversaries 
they also invited soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
other warsaw pact leaders to address the nato council of ministers 
in brussels and appoint ambassadors to nato 
also on tuesday czechoslovakia invited members of natos 
political committee to visit prague 
earlier in the day meckel proposed limiting the size of the 
unified german army to 300000 troops down from a current total of 
635000 in east and west germany 
i have the impression this is acceptable to nato said 
meckel the fifth warsaw pact foreign minister to visit nato 
headquarters in brussels in recent months 
west germanys military now totals 465000 troops and east 
germanys about 170000 within the west german coalition 
government proposals for troop ceilings for a unified germany 
range from 320000 to 380000

combatant to the pollutants that destroy the quality of our air in 
los angeles mayor tom bradley said in a statement lauding the 
program i congratulate the commitment of this company 
in a pilot program the carrier will operate a fleet of 20 
vehicles on natural gas supplied by the southern california gas co 
if successful the entire los angeles ups fleet of more than 2000 
trucks will be converted in the next five years 
we are looking forward to pursuing this effort in los angeles 
and to sharing the knowledge we gain with the city and its 
citizens said siro degasperis a ups spokesman 
we feel that our efforts will contribute to a safer and 
healthier environment in the los angeles basin he said 
the program follows one in new york in which 10 ups vans were 
converted to natural gas with the help of the brooklyn union gas 
co each of the 10 vehicles cost 3000 to 3500 to convert to 
natural gas 
the new york fleet that took part in the program reduced its 
carbon monoxide production by 85 percent nitrogen oxide by 25 
percent carbon dioxide by 23 percent and hydrocarbons by 13 
percent 
drastic measures have been taken to ease smog in los angeles 
which has more than 75 million vehicles and suffers the nations 
worst air pollution air quality regulators approved a plan last 
year calling for 40 percent of cars and 70 percent of trucks in the 
region to run on cleaner fuels by 1998 
unocal corp is offering free smog checks and emission control 
tuneups for pre1975 cars at participating unocal 76 stations 
shell oil co is selling su 2000e gasoline in nine smoggy cities 
including los angeles and san diego the gas reduces polluting 
emissions 
los angeles has a smog snitch hotline for motorists to call in 
license plate numbers of cars that spew noxious emissions from 
tailpipes

a county prosecutor asked a judge tuesday to 
charge the state attorney general with felony theft for allegedly 
wining and dining private guests on the taxpayers tab and 
falsifying expense claims 
in a 55page affidavit pulaski county prosecutor chris piazza 
asked little rock municipal judge marion humphrey to approve a 
felony theft by deception charge against attorney general steve 
clark 
humphrey said he would rule wednesday on whether there is 
probable cause to file the charge in pulaski county circuit court 
and on a motion by clarks lawyer to keep the investigative file 
closed for fear the publicity could influence any trial 
the lawyer bill bristow said clark would plead innocent if the 
charge is filed 
clark attorney general for 12 years withdrew from the 
gubernatorial race in february after the arkansas gazette reported 
on discrepancies in his expense reports 
piazzas affidavit outlines 56 cases in which state police 
accuse clark of charging the state for meals or drinks with guests 
including judges and fellow attorneys general who said either they 
werent present or that private matters were discussed 
the affadavit which covers july 1986 to feb 9 says police 
found 86 transactions billed to the state for a total of 844827 
in expenses unconnected to state business 
felony theft by deception carries a maximum penalty of five to 
20 years in jail and a 15000 fine piazza said 
steve clark executed an unauthorized control of property that 
belonged to the state of arkansas and that property amounted to 
more than 2500 making the alleged crime a felony under state 
law piazza said 
bristow said clark would be unavailable for comment tuesday 
clark didnt return messages left at his office and calls to his 
home went unanswered 
but bristow said earlier that clark had been willing to plead 
guilty to a misdemeanor charge for falsifying his office expense 
records 
there is a statute in arkansas which makes it a class b 
misdemeanor if you make any kind of false entry in a public record 
if you make a mistake in the public record that statute would in 
my judgment apply bristow said 
he said clark strenuously heatedly denied committing a 
felony and said he doubted clark would resign 
bristow said he couldnt discuss specifics of his talks with 
piazza but indicated piazza held out for a felony plea 
i have told them my views about what took place in this matter 
that mr clark has indicated that there was some recordkeeping 
mistake but he was not guilty of taking any kind of money 
bristow said in a telephone interview 
the state attorney general is not required to itemize 
expenditures clark has said he went beyond the law to be more 
accountable but made mistakes when he tried to itemize expenses 60 
and 90 days after the fact

like wallflowers at a juniorhigh dance the 
rikers island inmates hung back maybe they knew their streetwise 
facades were about to be punctured by puppy love 
for two hours these teenagers could almost forget the 
manslaughter kidnapping or car theft charges that landed them 
behind bars instead they played with seven visiting dogs and 
cats a rare touch of tenderness provided monthly by volunteers 
from the animal medical center 
my friends think im totally nuts but its not dangerous as 
people perceive it said edith mcbean the centers outreach 
coordinator who goes to rikers with casey a jack russell terrier 
puppy and keen a labrador retriever 
for those two hours the machismo is dropped theyre just 
little boys said diane smith coordinator of volunteer visits 
for the rikers health services unit 
the goals of these visits which started three years ago are to 
decrease depression stress and loneliness and to improve 
selfimages social skills and selfcontrol the inmates ages 16 
to 19 were chosen because their families and friends dont visit 
even though theyre not family its something these people 
go out of their way said james a 19yearold inmate who dreams 
of becoming a mechanic and having a cat it makes you feel open 
good inside it gets your mind away from the problems youve got 
it makes you feel special 
were coming in without an agenda were not writing a paper 
not there to save souls said susan cohen a therapist on the 
animal medical center staff pets are an icebreaker otherwise 
what would we say to them do you come here often 
the results havent been analyzed but at least one effect is 
evident 
there are a lot of fights among the adolescents slashings and 
stabbings that sort of thing said smith once theyre put 
into a relaxed mood theres less of a chance of fighting at 
least that day 
on a recent night 10 volunteers arrived in an ebullient conga 
line cats yawning and dogs yapping as they passed through four 
security checkpoints some are employees of the medical center 
some are volunteers there and most bring their own pets 
toys water bowls dog treats and bags of cookies were piled in 
the otherwisedismal visitors room the five dogs raced around 
wagging sniffing and barking 
at first the 16 inmates huddled in knots of three or four 
under the gaze of uniformed officers the volunteers fanned out 
helping the pets introduce themselves the two cats were coaxed 
from their carriers and gently placed on laps 
the prisoners eyes filled with uncertainty masked their 
vulnerability with bravado several bragged that theyd once owned 
the meanest dog on the block some teased the dogs holding toys or 
food out of reach 
i tell them to knock it off in a nice way they stop maybe 
after youve said it five times said mcbean 
eventually everyone started to relax its nice to see how 
they soften up she said 
the beefiest inmates zeroed in on the brawny dogs like teddy 
an appenzeller brought by debra liccardi a dog walker and nick g 
hayden vice president of a real estate company 
teddys got a toughlooking appearance that a lot of guys at 
prison love said hayden 
hayden and liccardi have been going to rikers for five months 
with pets they borrow from her clients she gets the inmates 
acquainted with the dogs he talks to them about other things 
its a matter of sitting there and listening said hayden 
theyre all extremely polite its sometimes hard to keep in 
perspective that theyre not all saints 
at least until he hears their stories 
one kid attempted murder a couple of times another was in for 
possession of a 9mmgun an uzi and vials of crack im sure if id 
seen him on the street id have known he was trouble and walked 
away hayden said but i sat there talking to him for an 
hour 
some inmates sat quietly stroking the more tranquil pets as 
they spoke with the volunteers 
i like to observe them they have their own little world 
said danny 19 i wonder what they think about us 
there are times you do get lonely confessed jamar 18 i 
miss my family girlfriend brothers and sister 
my brothers are facing hard time i pray for them every 
night said james after a visit from the animals its hard 
when you go back to the house 
it wasnt long though before james went back 
an officer bellowed the inmates filed out the dogs panting 
sprawled on the floor the cats hid beneath blankets in their 
carriers a corrections worker searched for the key that would 
return the visitors to freedom 
you spend a couple of hours and feel like you do something 
good for them said hayden but you leave very confused 
frustrated 
still he concluded if we can get one guy out and keep him 
out i think its worth it

youre a legislator facing tough decisions 
bound to be controversial sure to set barn fires no matter how you 
decide 
then someone has a bright idea let the people decide put the 
issue on the ballot and put the question to the people what could 
be more democratic 
is that buckpassing 
or is it direct participatory democracy 
yes it is and yes it is said patrick b mcguigan an oklahoman 
who has been keeping track of ballot propositions at the 
conservative free congress foundation for years 
yes said mcguigan when legislatures put issues on the ballot 
it becomes a way for legislators to avoid doing what we elect 
them to do 
and yes said mcguigan it is an expression of confidence in 
ourselves he said it makes citizens more involved in everyday 
politics more aware of the issues 
every meaningful criticism that can be made against the 
initiative process has an exact corollary in every other aspect of 
our democratic system he said 
in any event ballotbox lawmaking is a growing phenomena 
twentysix states and the district of columbia allow referendums 
issues referred to the people by the legislatures or initiatives 
issues on the ballot at the initiative of voters but only about 
a dozen states use these processes with much regularity 
in 1988 voters decided on 229 statewide issues they ranged 
from repealing a gun control law in maryland no dice said the 
voters to discouraging tobacco use by increasing cigarette taxes 
25 cents in california that passed despite a 15 million industry 
campaign against it 
this year even more issues are likely to be voted upon 
including tax limitation issues tax increases for specific 
purposes and measures to limit the terms of legislators 
you can argue for it it is direct democracy 
you can argue against it citizens are called to make decisions 
without having heard the pros and cons they dont have to consider 
priorities voting money for the homeless might take money from the 
sick or the schools they can be influenced by expensive 
advertising campaigns mounted by special interests 
thomas cronin a colorado college political scientist and author 
of direct democracy the politics of the initiative referendum 
and recall is a middleoftheroader like mcguigan he sees 
both sides 
if citizens dont know what theyre voting on legislators often 
dont either he said they pass a lot of bills in a frantic final 
burst they spend about a third of each session amending or 
otherwise repairing measures passed the previous session and they 
are influenced by political action committees lobbyists and 
special interests too 
on the other hand cronins research found that 10 percent to 15 
percent of the voters who go to the polls often only 50 percent of 
the electorate do not vote on ballot issues and another 10 
percent really dont know what theyre voting on 
so the answer is that both of these processes ought to be of 
concern he said why do we have referendums its because our 
system has become far less democratic in practice tha in the 
textbooks in the ideal type of world we would not have to resort 
to initiativereferendum campaigns because we would have such 
responsible responsive legislatures they wouldnt be necessary 
cronin finds that elected officeholders scholars and 
journalists tend to be opposed to direct democracy devices they 
think the issues are too complicated that issues first should be 
aired at hearings that compromises the essence of democracy 
cant be molded by a citizen facing a yesorno choice 
the argument comes down cronin said to philosophy it is a 
case of the populists who think the people always know best vs 
parentalists who think papa knows best 
he notes that voters sometimes use the ballot to strike back at 
big government massachusetts voters vetoed both a mandatory seat 
belt law and a salary increase for state legislators one year 
mcguigan and cronin share a concern about what happens when too 
many issues crowd themselves onto the ballot in 1988 so many 
questions were on the california ballot that express lines were 
created for voters who promised to spend only five minutes marking 
their ballot 
cronin said the growth in ballot issues is a result too of the 
way incumbents have become almost undefeatable 
regular elections in america are increasingly meaningless 
he said ninetyfive percent of incumbents at the state and 
national level get reelected routinely in colorado only once in 
the 1980s did a state senator get defeated thats not untypical 
if we have no turnover no real competition then the people 
with a grievance have two choices form a pac if they have lots of 
money or get their issue on the ballot if they dont

in partly cloudy skies over floridas 
everglades a cruising cessna 172 suddenly turns and plunges to an 
altitude of less than a thousand feet 
inside the plane david maehr listens to chirping in his 
headphones from one of 17 radiocollared florida panthers roaming 
out of sight below 
this is a female that probably had a litter about a week 
ago maehr yells over the roar of the engine as the pilot pulls 
up 
maehr is a wildlife biologist with the florida game and fresh 
water fish commission three times a week he or an assistant makes 
one of these reconnaissance flight as part of a 10year study of 
the life and times of the florida panther 
the panther a tawny muscled mountain lion that can weigh up to 
150 pounds may be the most endangered mammal in the united states 
only 30 to 50 adults remain and they may not last much longer 
ironically their survival may now be threatened by the very 
people charged with protecting them 
state and federal authorities have proposed a crash program to 
trap panthers breed them in captivity and release them in suitable 
areas 
critics say the program calls for the capture of too many 
panthers too soon they fear it could make panthers extinct in the 
wild 
were moving into this at a level thats potentially going to 
put the natural population at risk said james layne a biologist 
at the archbold biological station in lake placid fla and a 
member of the florida panther technical advisory committee its 
not at the critical level where weve got to pull all the animals 
in 
layne and other critics charge that the highly visible 
captivebreeding program is calculated to distract public attention 
from the panthers greatest need the acquisition and protection of 
the land they live on 
the us fish and wildlife service will issue a final 
environmental assessment of the captivebreeding program shortly 
after august 15 the deadline for public comments on the draft 
assessment the capture of panthers could begin next winter 
we feel this is the only alternative said dennis jordan 
the fish and wildlife services coordinator for the florida panther 
project otherwise i dont think theres any question its 
going to go extinct he said in a telephone interview from his 
gainesville office 
the florida panther known scientifically as felis concolor 
coryi is a fierce solitary hunter it once roamed unfettered 
through the broad crescent made up of eastern texas louisiana 
arkansas mississippi alabama georgia parts of tennessee and 
south carolina and florida 
the panther is now found only in the southern third of the 
florida peninsula it roams through mixedswamp forests hardwood 
hammocks slash pinesaw palmetto woodlands and oakpine forests 
the area is crisscrossed with rivers and swamps that make it almost 
impenetrable 
one of the reasons they survived is probably because the area 
is so remote maehr said in an interview in his naples office 
near the western extent of the panthers range the wetlands offer 
no impediment to panthers which are strong swimmers they move 
freely in pursuit of deer wild hogs rabbits and other prey 
the panther recovery project was established in 1981 it has 
pointed to one overall conclusion the habitat loss is the most 
important problem facing panthers every problem the panther has is 
the result of habitat loss said maehr 
about half of the 4 million acres of known panther habitat is on 
private land where citrus and vegetable farming and urban 
development are a growing threat maehr said its directly 
related to population growth he said floridas population 
increases by 8000 every week maehr said 
the landdevelopment grab and consequent deforestation of 
southern florida is similar to whats happening in the amazon rain 
forest maehr said its the same thing you cut the forest and 
you eliminate the places for these animals to live 
in brazil the culprits are often subsistence farmers struggling 
to feed their families in florida maehr said the forest is being 
destroyed by corporations and ranchers people who have money to 
begin with 
loss of the forest would mean more than loss of the panthers he 
said the loss would make the area less suitable for people to 
live in its important for air quality and water quality and as a 
buffer against so many people if we save the panthers well be 
doing ourselves a favor 
despite the threats to the panthers the population is currently 
holding steady maehr said 
that is why layne and other critics oppose a largescale 
captivebreeding program 
this crash program is based on the assumption this present 
population is in serious decline says layne if you look at 
the reports you would have to conclude the population is 
increasing and theyre kicking out young 
layne thinks a smaller captivebreeding program would be a good 
idea in which only young panther kittens would be removed the 
thing that scares me about the present proposal is taking 
established adults out of the population when you take them out of 
a social organization you disrupt the organization you disrupt 
the behavior 
earth first activists have threatened the fish and wildlife 
service with a lawsuit if it issues permits for capturing panthers 
the humane society the fund for animals and many other 
conservation groups have criticized the plan 
more than 300 organizations or individuals have commented on the 
plan said jordan of the fish and wildlife service most of the 
comments reflected concern about the program he said 
jordan takes a dim view of the wild panthers prospects for 
survival you could have an outbreak of disease that could move 
within the population and render it extinct in a short period of 
time he said when you have a single population in one small 
area like that you have no security against extinction 
whatsoever 
inbreeding among the animals makes it likely they will develop 
genetic abnormalities he said which could make them extinct in a 
few decades 
under the captivebreeding proposal up to 36 kittens and 14 
adults could be captured over a sixyear period capture of the 
older animals is necessary to assure that the captive group will 
share the same genetic variation as the wild group jordan said 
where will the captivebred animals be released researchers 
dont yet know but they will begin searching this year for sites 
and jordan is confident theyll find them 
texas cougars which are close cousins of the panthers will be 
released to determine the suitability of the sites the one such 
test so far was not successful the cougars had to be recaptured 
when one wandered into jacksonville it frightened the wits out of 
a woman who went into her back yard to hang her laundry and saw it 
crouched in a tree above her 
we certainly feel we can reintroduce panthers in the 
future jordan said weve only experimented with one area 
jordan noted that the state and federal governments have 
acquired about 300000 acres of panther habitat during the last few 
years and that more habitat would be acquired soon 
meanwhile the panthers seem to be doing well our 
productivity continues at an encouraging rate said maehr 
weve had two new litters born one in march and one in may 
but their habitat remains threatened the population can only 
increase if theres more habitat said maehr theres just 
nowhere for them to go

imprisoned extremist lyndon larouche and his 
followers are running in scores of primary and general election 
races this year as they try to regroup politically after a string 
of legal defeats 
larouche followers stunned and embarrassed the democratic party 
in 1986 by winning primary nominations for two statewide offices in 
illinois but this time around the organizations candidates 
appear to be having little success 
after running for president four times both as a democrat and 
independent larouche has lowered his sights to a jailhouse 
campaign for congress 
one of his top lieutenants nancy spannaus is waging an 
independent campaign for the us senate in virginia and is the 
only candidate running against gop sen john warner this fall 
state democratic leaders rebuffed her bid for the partys 
nomination deciding instead to nominate no one 
larouche himself is serving a 15year federal prison sentence in 
minnesota for fraud and tax evasion he is running as an 
independent candidate in virginias 10th district in the 
washington suburbs against republican rep frank wolf 
you dont need an analyst to tell you larouche doesnt have 
much popular support but they know the political process said 
university of virginia political scientist larry sabato it 
doesnt constitute an endorsement of larouche or his policies but 
they will inherit votes simply by being on the ballot and they 
will undoubtedly claim some great movement 
aside from a few minor victories in texas and a candidate who 
got 25 percent of the vote in losing a statewide primary there 
larouche candidates havent gained much notice 
we just consider him and his candidates more of a nuisance 
now rather than a threat said ginny terzano at the democratic 
national committee 
the success of larouche candidates in the 1986 illinois primary 
sparked a party effort to warn voters away from larouche and his 
nightmare conspiracy theories which some say carry antisemitic 
themes it also brought new public scrutiny to his financial 
network of corporate shells and highpressure fundraising 
larouche and six of his associates including spannauss 
husband edward were convicted in december 1988 the case stemmed 
from an investigation into more than 30 million in loans raised 
from individuals by larouches organization prosecutors said the 
group used heavyhanded tactics and had no intent to repay the 
money it borrowed 
dennis king who has investigated the larouche organization for 
more than a decade and is the author of a book lyndon larouche 
and the new american fascism says the group receded immediately 
after the convictions but has strongly rebounded 
they have made a rather remarkable comeback king said i 
dont get the impression the democratic party is paying much 
attention to this and they may be in for an unpleasant surprise 
debra freeman larouches spokeswoman estimated that thousands 
of laroucheconnected candidates are running nationally she 
characterized larouches house bid as the organizations flagship 
candidacy 
larouche candidates often fare best in races that attract little 
attention 
some larouche followers have won small uncontested party posts 
in texas and another ran unopposed to win the democratic 
nomination for congress in the states safely republican 22nd 
district 
in texas democratic senate primary larouche follower harley 
schlanger lost to state sen hugh parmer who is seeking to oust 
republican phil gramm but schlanger pulled in 247205 votes a 
number the larouche organization claimed was a victory in itself 
law enforcement officials and others say the larouche candidates 
dont have to win to succeed even losing campaigns generate 
publicity and serve as a source of fundraising 
this business of running for office is one of the techniques 
larouche people use said newbold smith of paoli pa smiths 
son lewis dupont smith is a larouche follower and independent 
candidate for congress in pennsylvanias 5th district 
one to feed the egos of the people thats important this is 
a cult the elder smith said second it does bring the 
publicity they dont care whether the publicity is favorable or 
unfavorable and it allows them to raise money 
newbold smith and other family members won a court order 
declaring the son legally incompetent after the younger smith an 
heir to the dupont fortune turned over much of his money to 
larouches organization 
reports filed with the federal election commission show larouche 
had raised 222348 for his congressional campaign as of april his 
separate national democratic policy committee reported debts of 
486934 
federal prosecutors argued in court during larouches trial that 
his followers raised money by promising it would be used for 
specific purposes such as political efforts when they knew the 
money would be used for other purposes including supporting him 
john b russell jr virginia senior assistant attorney general 
said a state investigation indicates much of the larouche groups 
money is being sent to its foreign operations these include one 
based in west germany where larouches wife helga is believed to 
live 
five of larouches followers have been convicted of or pleaded 
guilty to state charges in virginia and charges against 11 others 
are pending the larouche organization is based in leesburg va 
prosecutors and lawenforcement officials say the larouche 
organization continues to use aggressive tactics to secure large 
contributions from elderly and vulnerable people and that their 
revenues run in the millions

guns rumble in the dark and tracer bullets cut 
across no mans land smoke hangs in the air mingled with the 
smells of cordite and frying bacon 
i thought i was back tommy keele a 96yearold veteran of 
world war i said at the opening last month of a reconstructed 
trench of the western front 
then he added the smell of death thats not here 
keele was among guests invited to the unveiling of the imperial 
war museums latest attempt to convey the atmosphere of war to 
generations that have never known it 
britain is caught up in memories of world war ii this summer 
keele who fought in both wars said his recollections of world war 
i and the slaughter of the trenches were the more vivid 
two of my mates were buried under us by a shell he said 
we dug them out horribly mangled and buried them along the 
trench as i pulled one he fell to pieces the smell of death was 
all over me and i couldnt eat or drink for three days 
a year ago the imperial war museum opened a reconstruction of a 
world war ii air raid shelter 
now we have gone farther back to what it was like for the 
infantry at the battle of the somme in 1916 said dr alan borg 
the museums director 
we tried to get the trench as right as we could we found the 
only machine left which could sew sandbags the way they were made 
in that war because the method of sewing was changed in the 1920s 
and we went to the old somme battlefield in france and brought back 
two bags of earth to get the texture right for the sides of our 
trench 
baron hermann von richthofen the west german ambassador and a 
descendant of the german air ace manfred von richthofen the red 
baron attended the opening ceremony 
the impact of a battlefield is created with lifesize models of 
soldiers carrying real guns bayonets and gas masks there are even 
stuffed rats 
in the freezing early hours of an october morning a soldier in 
a niche in the sandbagged wall fries bacon over a brazier while a 
recorded yorkshire voice reads a genuine letter home 
you asked what life is like in the trenches the soldier 
wrote to his father it is very boring most of the time we sleep 
in the day as theres not much to be had at night you share house 
and home with rats and burn lice out of the seat of your pants with 
candles 
two sentries light cigarettes a lewis gun fires tracers a 
shell has just exploded demolishing sandbags and pouring fumes 
into the narrow trench 
artillery roars in the distance commands and cries ring out 
from a dawn attack going over the top a soldier with head and 
chest wounds groans 
in a dugout lie relics from the western front barbed wire 
cutters gas masks a rattle to warn of a poison gas attack 
ammunition boxes a sniper shield a windup phonograph canned milk 
and postcards 
four periscopes show no mans land from 100 yards to 2 miles in 
a vista created from contemporary photographs 
cyril dennys 93 fought in the 1917 battle of passchendaele he 
recalled that 65000 tons of shells fired in 17 days to soften up 
the enemy also destroyed the drainage system of the level flemish 
plain 
the attack began and raged for weeks in pitiless rain men 
drowned in the mud britain lost 300000 dead 
visitors leaving the trench see a display case containing the 
four penciled sheets of the last letter to his wife lizzie from 
pvt jack mudd of the london regiment and the red poppy he sent 
home from a flanders field 
he put nine crosses for kisses after his signature 
god bless you and my children and may he soon send me back to 
those i love is the wish of your faithful husband jack is the 
last sentence of the letter 
mudd was killed at ypres on oct 26 1917

for decades the ward boys tended to 
the dairy cows on their farm at the end of a dirt road and 
neighbors say pretty much minded their own business 
they live off by themselves but theyre not hermits or 
recluses said emilie stilwell theyre a throwback to the 
pioneer days they stick to themselves but if you were raising a 
barn theyd be the first to arrive and the last to leave 
four brothers four bachelors that all changed forever june 6 
when william ward died of suffocation authorities said and 
delbert ward was arrested on a seconddegree murder charge 
the tiny rural communities of munnsville population 400 and 
stockbridge population 140 have rallied around delbert ward 
local folks say he could not possibly have killed his brother 
supporters collected nearly 900 signatures on petitions calling 
on the county prosecutor to review the autopsy results when a 
judge set bail at 10000 june 25 supporters raised the entire 
amount outside the courtroom in a few minutes 
delbert 59 has been advised by his attorney not to discuss the 
case but at a july 8 banquet that raised almost 1500 for his 
defense he told about 1000 supporters i have a lot of friends 
all over this county i thought id be left in jail but my friends 
brought me home 
said deborah wilson of munnsville who contributed 500 on the 
spot toward delberts bail you have to act on your beliefs when 
something like this happens i just know theres no way he could 
have killed his brother 
state police investigators testified at a preliminary hearing 
that delbert told them the death of his 64yearold brother bill 
was a mercy killing 
investigators say delbert told them he smothered bill while his 
brother slept according to the initial autopsy a benign tumor the 
size of a golf ball was found in bills neck and others in his 
kidney and prostrate could have been cancerous 
bill had trouble with his head he accidentally cut his jaw 
with a chain saw years ago and got blood poisoning said roscoe 
ward at 70 the oldest of the brothers he was doing farm chores 
up to the day he died but he wasnt doing too good hed be 
burning up and the next time hed be shaking all over 
asked if he thought delbert was innocent roscoe ward replied 
i sure do 
the wards run a small hilltop dairy farm overlooking the 
undeveloped stockbridge valley about 30 miles southeast of 
syracuse 
a lifetimes collection of odds and ends old appliances and 
crumbling farm equipment lie sprinkled about the rickety fourroom 
farmhouse where the four brothers spent their entire lives 
theres running water and electricity but no telephone and not 
much else in the way of conveniences in the rough unpainted house 
their parents lived there and they took care of them until 
they died and they just stayed stilwell said 
the wards especially delbert and bill whom friends say were 
inseparable appeared often at the shack the munnsville coffee 
shop where stilwell works they also made frequent trips to town to 
shop and buy new parts for their farm machinery none of the four 
had drivers licenses they would ride a tractor the five miles 
into town 
at the july 8 banquet stilwell sold several pictures of delbert 
and bill riding on the tractor for 3 each 
unvaryingly the wards are described as happy and generous 
neighbors selfeducated and hardworking delbert is the youngest 
bill was called the leader roscoe never stops talking once he 
starts and lyman is bashful 
it wasnt difficult to get townsfolk in munnsville to rally 
around the wards after delberts arrest said grant kroneck a 
local insurance agent 
ive lived in munnsville since 1947 and ive never seen a 
community come so solidly together on one side of an issue that 
like this he said 
within hours after the arrest stilwell and kroneck were 
collecting signatures challenging a medical examiners autopsy that 
ruled bill was killed and asking for a second autopsy 
i knew we had some friends said roscoe ward i just 
didnt know we had friends like that 
madison county district attorney donald cerio jr agreed to a 
review of the original autopsy and has said he will not seek a 
grand jury indictment before that review is completed 
this particular case is quite unique in the intensity of 
emotions stirred by those persons acquainted with the ward 
family said cerio he said he doesnt believe delbert is 
dangerous but he is confident he is being justly prosecuted 
jars and plastic containers were set out at businesses in town 
and within days supporters contributed 1800 said stilwell the 
money was used to hire two private investigators to bolster 
delberts case the total raised since has climbed to almost 3500 
we have such a great love for them we cant believe delbert 
would kill bill who he loved so much said judi colclough the 
village clerk 
the wards are simple honest people said kroneck we feel 
he is being taken advantage of by the system all we want is 
justice we dont think the police are terrible peoples accompanying parent 
or adult 
guardian 
x no one under 17 admitted some states may have higher age 
restrictions

the beginning for sonny grosso was the french 
connection the oscarwinning 1971 film about the famous heroin 
case he helped break he collaborated on the films writing 
i thought of it as a oneshot deal says grosso who at the 
time was a new york city narcotics detective 
but here he is a tv mogul executive producer of top cops a 
new cbs series that premiered july 18 
he also is coexecutive producer of counterstrike a new usa 
network actionadventure series starring christopher plummer in the 
actors first television series 
earlier this year grosso was coexecutive producer of nbcs 
true blue a series about the new york police departments 
emergency services unit alas that one failed to pass nielsen 
muster and expired quickly 
now based in toronto he agrees it is somewhat of a leap to go 
from chasing bad guys as a member of new yorks finest to dealing 
with stars agents screenwriters network executives and other 
such riffraff 
i didnt know how dangerous this business is he says 
halfjokingly of life in film and tv i didnt how how well off i 
was in the police department 
he never expected to be a writer then a producer 
god almighty i still pinch myself says grosso who talks 
rapidfire bouncing from one thought to the next cheerfully 
tossing in an occasional expletive for emphasis 
he retired from the police department in 1976 having put in 20 
years he says since then he has worked on a variety of films and 
tv shows about police work as a writer technical consultant 
story consultant and producer 
being a retired cop he often is asked what police films he 
finds most realistic not many he replies 
a lot of movies are entertaining as hell like the lethal 
weapons of the world but theyre tremendous reaches as far as 
what happens in a cops life most cops never take their gun out of 
their holster 
im shocked at the amount of gore and blood and violence that 
people are looking for i long for the days of mr capra he 
says a reference to film director frank capra who made screwball 
comedies many of them sunny side up 
i wish he could come back and do some movies that make you cry 
a little bit make you feel some emotional involvement 
grossos tv dossier includes kojak the rockford files 
baretta and cbs old latenight night heat with the 
onehour top cops hes entering what is known as reality 
tv 
in each show three real police officers recount the most 
memorable experiences of their careers as each of their stories is 
recreated with actors playing the cops 
the premiere includes the tale of paul ragnese of the new york 
police departments bomb squad and how he felt when helping disarm 
a particularly complex bomb containing 75 sticks of dynamite 
grosso says 
the bomb was found in middecember 1986 in an empty abortion 
clinic in manhattan it had been put there by a madman whose target 
was the bomb squad 
the man later surrendered got a threeyear prison term and was 
out in two grosso says 
im really trying to let people understand what its like to 
be a cop he says and that those streets out there are telling 
us every day something aint working pal 
despite 14 years in the entertainment business grossos heart 
as you might expect remains with cops 
one thing you have going in the police department is that any 
cop no matter who he is can get a call man with a gun or 
family dispute and be right in the middle his life on the 
line he says 
whereas so many people in this business never take a chance 
never go out on a limb and never understand the camaraderie never 
understand what it means to get along with people you work with 
because youre dependent upon them for your safety

july 19 1989 30 minutes before crash radio call from sioux 
city iowa air traffic control to united airlines pilot united 
232 say souls on board and fuel remaining 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
capt alfred c haynes his doomed jetliner wallowing all over 
the iowa sky responded to an air traffic controller in the 
timehonored jargon of his aviation fraternity there were 296 
souls on board including his own 
at 359 cdt on a sweltering wednesday afternoon last july 19 
they all rode a 168ton flying brick down into a cornfield at 200 
miles an hour in the flame and dust unleashed when the dc10 
cartwheeled out of control 112 of the souls on board united 
airlines flight 232 were lost 
but 184 survived and as they prepare to return to sioux city 
for a memorial service thursday they struggle with unanswerable 
questions about life and death guilt nightmares physical 
injuries that may never heal strained relationships with people 
they love and memories that deny them a single good nights sleep 
they shake at some of lifes simplest events afraid that a 
highway bridge might fall on them frightened by the sound and 
smoky smell of a childs cap gun convinced that a washing machine 
has an electrical short that will cause a fire 
mary kahl couldnt feel comfortable at work for six months paul 
olivier like many other survivors wont fly on a dc10 william 
robertson drew up a list of accomplishments and things he wants to 
do in life jerry schemmel quit his job too many reminders rod 
vetter fears driving into downtown chicago what if a car jumps a 
guardrail into his lane 
my life is never going to be the same says upton rehnberg 
53 
they question why they lived when so many others died they 
meet in groups to grieve they call each other at 3 am to sob 
they savor a unique joy with the coming of new mornings the sight 
of sunsets their very survival is a shared miracle 
on the plane as we were going down it didnt matter how rich 
or how poor you were what color you were or what your religion 
was where you came from or where you were going says garry 
priest 24 of denver we all drew strength from each other we 
were all in it together as the plane crashed everybody was 
special 
the dc10 was headed to chicago from denver when it attempted an 
emergency landing at the sioux gateway airport the jet flipped 
once and burst into flames fortyfive minutes before impact the 
crew had lost all steering control when the tail engine shattered 
spewing out titanium fan blades and chunks of metal that severed 
hydraulic lines 
many victims were trapped in the charred fuselage some dazed 
and burned walked or crawled to safety others were found in 
4foothigh corn still buckled in seat belts 
dozens of survivors will gather thursday to pay tribute to 
haynes crew and to the rescuers and townsfolk who opened their 
hearts and their homes to them 
though each has a unique memory of that terrible day that bonded 
them for life theyre all amazed they are alive and wonder why

rod vetter a 40yearold former navy flyer who logged more than 
300000 miles with united before the crash now hesitates before 
commiting to a business trip even everyday trips downtown can be a 
strain 
i have a fear of things falling and things happening that are 
out of my control he says 
i never had the fear driving on the interstate of a bridge 
collapsing when i was driving underneath it i have a fear driving 
into downtown chicago wondering what if a car jumps the 
guardrail and goes into my lane just weird things like that 
vetter still thinks of that day frequently 
theres a lot of things that key in the thought of the crash 
whether its black smoke loud noise screeching brakes the smell 
of burning plastic says vetter who owns an importexport 
electronics company in the chicago suburb of arlington heights 
some people are saying they are not letting it out of their 
minds maybe one years time is not enough time maybe it will 
take 10 years to get back to a rational view of life its not 
going to heal in a year

when his broken collarbone broken right foot broken right knee 
broken ribs crushed vertebrae and numerous burns had healed enough 
to allow him to resume running his palmer lake colo 
televisionstudio design business 
olivier wont fly on a dc10 but he has flown to hong kong 10 
times since november on the last trip as the plane prepared to 
land i did everything i could to grab a gulp of air but i just 
couldnt breathe thats the worst it has been i have to force 
myself to get on a plane 
olivier was thrown out of flight 232 on impact and though he 
remembers almost nothing between then and the hospital the moments 
before the crash remain hauntingly vivid 
the girl next to me and i talked about how everything was 
going to be ok we planned how we would exit i told her if the 
plane filled up with smoke she should grab onto my belt 
the girl died

mary kahl doesnt remember the final moments before the crash 
but the tragedy turned her life upside down 
it took me at least six months before i was able to get back 
to my normal frame of thinking i found it very difficult handling 
my job says mrs kahl a teacher who with her husband james 
and son jimmy 15 all survived they live in north huntingdon pa 
her son refuses to talk about the crash 
i still think we have some problems looming here she says 
she too has had trouble discussing it 
its hard to go back and think about what happened to all 
those people we are the lucky ones we dont have the physical 
scars to deal with there are a lot of people out there with a lot 
more pain than what were suffering 
every time i hear about a plane crashing or a plane in trouble 
landing even trains bother me it just seems like a feeling of 
terror that comes over you she says

to save 
sabrina of west chester ohio had been thrown through the air 
and separated from her mother father and two brothers her cries 
caught schemmels ear as he fled 
i was tested a little bit so that has made me feel better if 
id heard the crying and not gone back into the plane i would have 
had terrible guilt feelings but youd be surprised how many people 
would have done what i did says schemmel 30 of denver 
in the past year lori michaelson 36 has turned from survivor 
to crusader lobbying for mandatory infant seats on planes 
im trying just to go on instead of going overboard and 
spoiling your kids you try not to overcompensate in your life 
you try to consciously focus on each day and realize how out 
of control your life is how rapidly things can change you 
think youre creating your own destiny in your life and youre 
not the mother of three says 
major disasters rehash all the hurt she says and even normal 
childs play can cause problems 
the oddest things come out she says a child brought over a 
cap gun once and her son andrew got really upset he didnt

there have been big changes dc10s 
have been modified there have been small developments infant 
seats soon may be mandated for the airlines littlest passengers 
much has happened in the year since united flight 232 came to a 
fiery cartwheeling end in sioux city killing 112 but one thing 
is unchanged heroes still are unwilling to take credit for valiant 
acts that saved 184 lives 
capt al c haynes who with his crew and the help of another 
united pilot on board struggled for nearly 45 minutes to control 
the balky jumbo jet is refusing requests for interviews haynes 
who has returned to flying gets notes from passengers on almost 
every flight now 
he takes it in good stride he doesnt want to be seen as a 
hero it was a team effort said united spokesman rob doughty 
three of four members of the cockpit crew including haynes are 
back in the air as are seven of the eight surviving flight 
attendants 
firefighters emergency medical technicians doctors nurses and 
the townspeople of sioux city lauded for their response to the 
crash its victims and survivors say enough has been said 
there are no heroes said shirley brown sioux citys 
assistant city manager the people genuinely believe that they 
just did their jobs that day they did them well they were 
coordinated and they had rehearsed but they simply did what they 
had practiced 
what were hearing from people is enough is enough 
accolades keep coming more than 100 communities have requested 
copies of sioux citys disaster preparedness plan ms brown said 
for us it was our job said terry schmidt training officer 
for the sioux city fire department but the community it wasnt 
their job it was just the right thing to do were kind of proud 
of that 
a reunion of passengers crew and rescuers is scheduled for 
thursday the anniversary of the crash a memorial has been 
commissioned for those who died 
meanwhile the national transportation safety board has proposed 
something of a living memorial it has recommended infant safety 
seats be required on airliners 
the association of flight attendants has said one of the 
victims 23monthold evan tsau of albuquerque nm might have 
lived if the crash had not wrenched him away from his mother who 
survived 
there are countless other reminders of the disaster from the 
nightmares of the survivors to the balance sheets of uniteds 
insurance carrier which has paid an average of about 45000 in 
damage settlements to more than 40 passengers or to estates of 
passengers who died 
dozens of other passengers have sued saying they want a jury to 
determine damages and others are seeking punitive damages against 
the airline the airplane manufacturer and engine manufacturer no 
trials are scheduled 
the national transportation safety board has not issued its 
official report on the crash but ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
said the titanium fan disk in the rear engine separated throwing 
engine parts like shrapnel through the tail assembly and severing 
all three independent hydraulic systems 
since the crash the federal aviation administration has ordered 
a new kind of engine inspection in hopes of detecting flaws in the 
titanium disk 
the inspection has not revealed any more flaws although six 
disks made from the same titanium billet have been removed from 
service 
all of the general electricbuilt engines were given onwing 
inspections before the end of this year all engines must be 
removed and disks placed in a water bath for separate ultrasonic 
inspections 
of the 287 domestic jets there are 31 disks that have yet 
to be inspected in what we call the immersion tests said bob 
guyotte of the faas regional office in burlington mass none has 
failed to pass he said 
but the ntsb isnt so sure on june 18 it urged the faa to 
order yet another test in which electrical current is used to 
detect cracks united air lines already is using the method every 
time it inspects disks on its fleet 
by july 20 1991 two years and a day after the crash 
domestic carriers must install devices to prevent a catastrophic 
loss of hydraulic fluid in the no 3 hydraulic system the faa has 
ruled 
should the valve kick in pilots would lose control of the 
rudder and the elevators but pilots still would be able to operate 
all wing controls and to control the angle at which the plane 
enters the air stream 
it was tested in a simulator and then actually installed in an 
aircraft and flighttested it was found to work very well said 
mcdonnell douglas spokeswoman elaine bendel 
without those controls flight 232 couldnt be steered to a 
runway and was flying at least 60 mph faster than a normal 
approach haynes accelerated his remaining wing engines to guide 
the crippled plane to sioux city 
the company has sent 84 repair kits to 14 customers worldwide so 
far ms bendel said a total of 428 dc10s still are active 
worldwide united has 55 dc10s and has installed the devices at 
an estimated cost of 37800 per plane in about half of them 
still the debate continues on the safety of the dc10 john 
galipault president of aviation safety institute of worthington 
ohio said its probably got the worst safety record of all the 
widebodies 
using figures compiled by the aviation information services 
limited of london galipault said 17 dc10s have been lost over the 
years twice the rate for boeing 747s and lockheed l1011s 
comparisons on fatalities per million flight hours also are not 
favorable for the dc10 he said with 74 for that airplane 66 for 
the lockheed plane and 61 for boeings 
ms bendel blamed hangar fires terrorist attacks and other 
causes for the 17 lost airplanes saying they had nothing to do 
with the design of the plane galipault has a personal vendetta 
against the dc10 for whatever reason she said 
in the 45 days after the crash only 400 of some 18 million 
united passengers asked to steer away from dc10s but mcdonnell 
douglas no longer makes the plane the last one was delivered a 
week after the crash and the company is concentrating its efforts 
on a replacement the md11 
there still are plenty of dc10s in the air but there is no 
united flight 232 
as is the industry custom after a serious accident united 
changed the number on its afternoon flight from denver to chicago

now you see him now you dont patrick 
swayze that dirty dancing man takes a breather from his hunk 
image by playing a ghost in a new romantic fantasy 
well you do catch a look at the swayze physique in the early 
scenes of paramount pictures ghost but then he is murdered 
and for the rest of the movie he struggles to communicate to his 
fiance demi moore that she is also in danger he finds a 
gobetween in a wacky medium whoopi goldberg 
i had to fight for the role swayze says the director 
jerry zucker wanted kevin kline when he heard about me wanting 
it he said over my dead body will patrick swayze play this role 
they said were not going to offer you the film youll have 
to come in and read i said ok fine i went in and did six 
scenes by the time i was finished i had the role 
have i auditioned before forever when you get to this point 
in a career you dont often have to audition but i sort of feel 
what is the point of all these years of study if youre afraid to 
audition 
swayze who at 37 has the build of a college athlete explained 
that he fought for the role because of bruce joel robins script 
it made me cry four or five times but after he won the role 
he realized the hazard of playing a ghost 
sam was not a real easy character to do he read beautifully 
on the page but when you start playing it you realize hes left 
out in the cold a little bit in a five or eightpage scene it 
would only deal with the characters who are living the ghost would 
be standing in a corner and the stage directions would be sam 
watches sam horrified sam devastated sam growing in anger 
how do you play that kind of stuff what i wanted to do was 
establish a progression while he has a hard time remembering hes a 
ghost the process of portraying a ghost was interesting it was 
like being roger rabbit and working without actors against a blue 
screen he said 
why was he so eager for ghost 
because i had done two action movies road house next of 
kin if i didnt want to be the action dude then i had to go a 
different direction 
more than most of todays film stars swayze seems concerned 
about how fame affects his own stability and well being that was 
part of his motivation to campaign for ghost 
at that time the celebrity stuff was like blowing my mind a 
little bit he said no matter how much you prepare yourself 
for this stardom stuff i dont think you really can until it 
happens 
i had been dealing with it for quite a while after the 
outsiders then red dawn and especially the miniseries north 
and south that sort of blew the lid off my life worldwide 
dirty dancing i dont even know how to catagorize that 
i felt i needed something for my insides i needed a movie i 
could feel proud of promoting in the press one that i didnt have 
to make excuses for because of violence or something like that or 
showing that no im not really the dance guy i really can act 
ghosts just filled the bill 
patrick swayze grew up angry in texas venting his fury on the 
football field and in street brawls his life swerved when he 
studied and danced with the feld joffrey and harkness ballets in 
new york a succession of injuries forced him in 1978 to try his 
luck with acting in los angeles two years later he clicked in a 
modest film skatetown usa it was his first brush with fame 
the film was a piece of fluff but i was reviewed well he 
recalled i had a lot of pictures offered to me and i turned 
them all down i didnt want to be a teen idol 
stuff started happening to me that i didnt know the 
insidious stuff that wants to take over your insides start to 
check out and go 100000 miles away and you dont know it it can 
permeate your whole being before youre even conscious of whats 
going on thats whats killed a lot of people 
i knew something was going on lisa his wife knew something 
was going on she was freaking out because she knew something bad 
was happening and i was going to be mentally lonely rather 
than not deal with it we just kept talking about it bringing it 
out in the open discussing what the feelings were i feel like i 
passed a place that a lot of people dont survive 
tom cruise is facing it now and im really happy that he 
seems to be handling it 
patrick and lisa she is also a former dancer have found 
their own escape a horse ranch up north but he adds you got to 
be careful with that too when you become too reclusive you stop 
living life with real people as george c scott says the first 
thing thats robbed from you as an actor is your ability to observe 
other human beings theyre all looking at you and not being 
themselves 
so lisa and i surround ourselves with people who are not 
yesmen who challenge us who may be better than us we try to 
keep moving forward

the look of the wheeling symphony 
orchestra strikes a distinctive chord but its improved sound 
proves that classical music can have no sex 
its conductor for more than four years rachael worby is one of 
few women comma 
its kind of like having a handful of electricity said ron 
hobbs a wheeling symphony orchestra director she has that sense 
of excitement that is around her all the time 
nding the baton we dont consider her a female conductor shes a 
conductor 
with talent who just happens to be female said agnes 
eisenberger her agent she caught our attention primarily 
because of her talent and ability to get her musical message 
across 
worby 41 also has caught the renewed attention of west 
virginia when she was publicly courted by gov gaston caperton 
they married on may 25 
but long before she became west virginias first lady she 
helped double the wheeling orchestras budget and nearly triple its 
season ticket sales in the same theater that is home to country 
musics jamboree usa radio program 
she also is music director of the young peoples concerts at 
carnegie hall one of lalent teaching 
children about music as exceptional 
at one session with a group of children it was almost like 
they were watching a magician hobbs said 
symphony members agree 
a lot of conductors tend to keep a lot of distance between 
themselves and their orchestra members its kind of the old 
european style of dictator and peon said larry bradford viola 
principal shes not like that at all 
she can be your friend off the podium said carolyn wann 
wheelings associate concertmaster 
worbys love for music stems from a childhood in nyack ny 
filled with culture and music and an idolatry of bernstein 
here was a man who was conducting brahms at lincoln center 
writing west side story and conducting the young peoples 
concerts at carnegie hall worby said he couldnt be 
pigeonholed he was whatever he wanted to be he was eclectic in 
his musical tastes and in addition to that he really stands by 
his principles 
worby who has been called sort of a female leonard 
bernstein also is musically eclectic she loves country music 
and was the lead singer in ragnarock and the fly boys a rock group 
she was the product of two sets of grandparents dramatically 
different in style but equally committed to music and the arts 
when my mothers parents wanted to do something with me very 
special they took me to the threepenny opera i was 9 maybe 10 
maybe younger when my fathers parents wanted to take me some 
place special they took me to radio city music hall to see the 
rockettes 
her father a hardware manufacturer cant read music but louis 
worby can sing and he plays piano from the letters written above 
notes in music books 
there wasnt a night when my father wouldnt go after dinner 
to sit at the piano and sing cole porter george gershwin irving 
berlin worby said he would teach me very simple melodies 
and we would sing it over and over again and suddenly he would 
start singing harmony 
her maternal grandfather also sang to her but in a different 
way 
i very clearly remember my grandfather had a red wheelbarrow 
which he would put me in and wheel me around in a small wooded area 
in the back of the house she said 
while he was wheeling me around he would hum melodies of 
brahms symphonies to me with his russian accent in english if 
youre humming its la la lah la la lah my grandfather it was 
tee rah ruhmmmm tee rah ruhmmmm 
worby credits her mother who has perfect pitch with literally 
devoting a decade of her life to teaching her discipline 
diana worby a literature professor agreed her daughter was 
less than enthusiastic at times when she was 8 10 12 and 
supposed to be practicing piano she was the same as every other 
kid i dont want to practice i dont want to practice diana 
worby said 
before it seemed like every concert when she was supposed to 
perform something generally happened she got a fever or 
sprained her thumb playing softball 
her mothers discipline helped worby through her formal music 
education a bachelors degree from the state university of new 
york at potsdam graduate work at indiana university and a 
doctorate in musicology from brandeis university 
it also shows in her work now 
shes really studying a lot many conductors get to the midway 
point in their careers and they stop learning from other 
conductors other orchestras other approaches bradford said 
it takes time it takes years to peak said milutin 
lazich a bass singer who recently performed mozarts requiem 
under worbys direction there is unused potential there still 
worbys concern is to keep learning 
im a student i wont be happy until i have a sense that i 
have absorbed everything there is to absorb worby said when 
would i be finished studying beethovens fifth symphony its such 
a humbling experience to even say it beethovens fifth symphony 
in the face of it im still an infant 
worby however hasnt lost sight of her goal to be conductor of 
the greatest orchestra she can possibly lead 
i feel inside of me an inexorable forward motion she said 
ill know where the resting place is

christine mcvie was concerned about the new 
fleetwood mac album everyone was getting along so well but all 
the songs seemed so sad something had to be done 
everything was getting to the point of where it was a downer 
album explained the singer and keyboardist who dashed off the 
upbeat skies the limit with its vow the sky is the limit 
now we can hit it on the nail it sounded like this was a 
potential suicide band which it wasnt i decided to write a song 
that was really up it was a rally song 
thats about all the drama involved with behind the mask a 
letdown perhaps to fans used to the breakups freakouts and 
dropouts of the bands 23 years all the heartbreak of this album 
is on the album like the title track written by mcvie or stevie 
nicks the second time 
this is fleetwood mac phase iv an easygoing combination of 
phases i through iii the current lineup original members john 
mcvie on bass and mick fleetwood on drums christine who joined in 
1970 nicks a member of the class of 74 and new guitarists billy 
burnette and rick vito replacements for lindsey buckingham 
and the bands getting all just fine christine insists life 
has become as dramatic as an outdoor barbecue finally living up to 
fleetwood macs sound of endless summer 
it was actually a joyous year there were times when we 
thought that we had to be unhappy to do well but thats a 
fantasy she insisted in a telephone interview from her home in 
los angeles 
rumours was made under great duress with huge emotional 
problems all over the place said mcvie referring to the 
bestselling 1977 album recorded while two marriages in the band 
were breaking up 
thats not the ideal recording situation or the ideal writing 
situation i dont write great songs when im miserable i dont 
write when im miserable 
pop with a twist has long been the secret for fleetwood mac 
authors of go your own way a good oldfashioned rock n roll 
divorce song and tusk which introduced radio to the tribal 
beat of tissue boxes 
then theres hold me a hit single in 1982 as written by 
mcvie its a pretty midtempo ballad with some neat lyrics 
slip your hand inside my glove and a nice fluid rhythm track 
pushing the song along 
but then buckingham steps in for a little additional 
engineering the kind that caused threeyear waits between albums 
harmonies rush in and out like the waves of the pacific mcvies 
voice almost lost underneath a harpsichord jangles in the 
background two lead guitars are used during the break the sound 
of a strummed acoustic guitar pops up and quickly disappears 
tuning and studio distortion make the plucking of strings from 
another guitar sound like a broken cuckoo clock 
it would be trial and error with lindsey mcvie said he 
would take a song and treat it like a huge canvas an oil painting 
he would put down something he thought was good start to erase 
things and paint it blue it would sound nothing like the original 
but i was always close behind lindseys back im something of 
a studio junkie myself i learned a lot from lindsey and tried to 
carry it on into this album trying to make sure that everything 
fit 
mcvie has bailed out the band before in 1970 guitarist peter 
green a founding member quit the thenbritish blues group a month 
before they were to begin an american tour mcvie who had given up 
a promising singing career to keep house was hastily recruited 
i thought the whole thing was really bizarre when i was asked 
to join she recalled i had been a big fan of fleetwood mac 
with peter green and guitarist jeremy spencer on my night off 
id go to see fleetwood mac and ending up dating john 
we were all living in the same house we were all very much 
like a family tiedyed tshirts smoking pot after rehearsing on 
the road the band decided it wanted to augment the sound with a 
keyboard since i was there they just turned around and said 
chris you come along 
four years later it was mcvies turn to make room for new 
faces in 1971 spencer disappeared for five days before the band 
discovered he had joined a california sect called cult of god 
spencers replacement bob welch quit the band another guitarist 
danny kirwan was fired 
reduced to just the two mcvies and fleetwood the band took a 
chance on an obscure california husbandandwife team with an album 
called buckingham nicks christine quickly gave them a tryout 
that was the biggest thrill of my life mcvie recalled of 
their first meeting i had written say you love me i sang the 
chorus to them and immediately stevie and lindsey came to me with 
these amazing harmonies i remember getting these chills inside 
we immediately liked them both and they liked us we were all 
very close we socialized a lot at the beginning did the old 
mexican food runs i shared an apartment with stevie for a while 
were more like family now than friends we get together for 
holidays or ill have a party at my house 
that hardly sounds like a group ready to split nicks who has 
made several solo albums was once considered the most likely to 
leave but now swears shes in for keeps fleetwood and john mcvie 
arent going anywhere theyre best friends and its really their 
group vito and burnette are just starting out still grateful to 
be included 
so half relieved half disappointed christine says the 
longexpected breakup will never come and wonders how life with 
this everchanging band could become so stable so comfortable 
it seems to be like weve grown roots like big old oak 
trees she laughed maybe we should chop it down or its going 
to keep growing 
well never really stop playing with each other unless we 
really couldnt stand up anymore weve barely scratched what were 
capable of doing

dennis mcfarland knows a lot about quitting 
he studied music but gave it up stage fright then came 
writing novels hed stop cold at page 45 he even tried real 
estate hated it and left six months later 
wary of becoming legitimate he again took up writing but 
how long can a husband and father way past 21 tell people hes 
still finding himself still trying to get that first book 
published 
so when mcfarland started on a new novel centered on a man 
whose brother commits suicide the author decided this was one 
project he had to complete 
its sort of like youre doing something in the dark i 
believed in myself and my wife believed but it didnt seem that 
anybody else would be affected if i quit writing said mcfarland 
41 whose novel is called the music room houghton mifflin 
1995 
i had quit on everything else i always thought that something 
had happened to me in the middle but with this book i decided no 
matter what else happens i was going to keep on and rejection 
after rejection i kept on writing 
the music room begins with martin lambert learning that his 
25yearold brother perry has jumped from the window of a 
manhattan hotel room martin 29 flies in from san francisco to 
find out what happened falls in love with perrys old girlfriend 
jane owlcaster and discovers he knew little about his brothers 
life 
now on the surface this has little to do with mcfarland a 
native of mobile ala he never had a brother commit suicide he 
did not come from a musical family unlike the one in the novel 
nor were his parents alcoholics the room that gives the book its 
title is vividly described but also does not really exist 
but this is a story about quitting jobs marriages life 
itself martin like mcfarland has a history of unfinished 
business hes disconnected easily distracted when martin 
receives the call about his brothers death he puts the detective 
on hold moves the french windows that overlook his garden and 
watches a hummingbird dart outside 
later lying in bed next to perrys girlfriend martin thinks 
about the early deaths of his brother and father killed by 
alcoholism at age 42

when i closed my own eyes i thought at once of perry of how 
despite his drive to succeed despite his apparent selfpossession 
he had been in his own way lost and then i thought how surely 
the whole family was lost and father was lost to himself as he 
groped his way towards his absurd early death how often he would 
open the door to a room surprised to find us there oh im 
sorry boys i was looking for the a stray in his own 
home

another link between author and subject martin is in his late 
20s and realizes hes unhappy selling his san francisco record 
company to start a new life in new york mcfarland remembers his 
late 20s as a time when he hated his life hated getting up he 
had given up on music sharing martins distaste for a career of 
teaching ear training to a bunch of college students 
i realized that even i became one of the most successful 
people in the field composing or performing maybe theres 100 
people who would care said mcfarland who studied music at 
brooklyn college and now lives outside of boston 
it was so esoteric i decided i would like a larger audience 
if i was going to do something artistic 
martin drinking heavily accuses jane of hiding information 
about the suicide frightened aware that fullblown sorrow over 
his death still brewing at sea had not yet reached shore he 
escapes to his mothers house in norfolk va 
one day walking in the fields on a warm autumn afternoon he 
has a vision the kind of vision that is the brutal side of 
grief the vision of an impossible future 
he pictures a celebration a birthday party for his father its 
late summer and both parents are sober perry is alive and happy 
playing backgammon with his mother jane resting her hands on his 
shoulders their children are running by the water 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as the squeals of the children fleeing the cool surf and 
the laughter attending the backgammon game reach my ears thinks 
martin i am filled with the faith and quiet confidence that 
belongs to those who were given the heart and willingness to 
survive to those given the great fortune to have continued 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
imagine those words as something mcfarland said to himself at 
one of the many times he was ready to give up the novel and perhaps 
take another look at selling houses thats why the music room 
is a personal novel regardless of how different his life is from 
martins and thats why the author saw no other way to end the 
story than to make sure his character lived 
either you die or you start to go back up mcfarland 
observed i probably will never write the book where it ends with 
the person hitting bottom and staying there thats just not what i 
want my vision to be 
i believe that enormous grief and enormous loss are 
survivable thats the greatest story for me

there was a time when dan seals slept 
under a grand piano at a recording studio at night trying to 
survive after going bankrupt 
but things are a lot better for the country star who grew to 
fame in the 1970s as england dan of the pop duo england dan and 
john ford coley what helped turn around his career was the 
awardwinning bop in 1986 
nine of his last 10 single releases have reached no 1 on the 
country music charts most recently love on arrival in april 
but 10 years ago the 42yearold seals was in dire straits 
financially as the result of what he calls an oversight by a 
business associate an accountant had neglected to pay the 
employers share of federal taxes involving employees seals had on 
his payroll 
they the irs came and got it all cars record royalties 
everything seals recalled i didnt have any place to go so i 
just stayed at the studio under the grand i remember sitting 
around wondering how wed get the money for a hamburger because 
wed used up everything we had i figured id get a job at a 
filling station 
pumping gas wasnt necessary his solo career took off shortly 
thereafter and seals has been one of the steadiest country music 
singers since his first no 1 country hit everybodys dream 
girl in 1983 
his music ranges from frisky tunes such as bop to the 
wistful affection in my old yellow car and weepers such as 
everything that glitters 
his wellcrafted songs tend to be insightful and graphic with 
lofty themes his instrumentation can be adventurous he used horns 
not often heard in country music on his current album on 
arrival 
he also was daring last year in his music video rage on 
when he addressed a topic rare in country music an interracial 
relationship it showed angry youths smashing the windows of the 
car of a young man dating an oriental girl one boy hurled a beer 
bottle at the girls father 
the song itself was about small town values 
when we record songs we take chances the softspoken seals 
said in an interview ive got to the point where we are 
stretching and trying new things not to shock but just to keep 
ourselves alive and interested we feel we are on the cutting edge 
of what we can do 
seals said the video was a reflection of his bahai religious 
beliefs 
i believe mankind is one family and that all religions are 
one he said 
he and coley had the pop hit id really love to see you 
tonight which sold 2 million records in 1976 they broke up in 
1979 to pursue separate careers 
hes an actor in los angeles now seals said im real 
proud for him 
seals older brother jim was half of the pop duo seals and 
crofts whose hits in the 1970s included summer breeze and 
diamond girl seals and crofts are now putting together an 
album as a follow up to their first tour in 10 years 
dan seals who grew up in dallas was surprised at the airplay 
for bop which crossed over to the pop charts 
ive had radio people tell me that when bop was out they had 
to hire people to handle calls to the station asking to hear it 
because they didnt have time he said it was a big jazzercise 
record and a big nightclub song for clubs to play when the band 
took a break 
i thought the song wouldnt do anything because the 
synthesizers we used were too different i was wrong delighted i 
was wrong 
his other hit records include big wheels in the moonlight 
my babys got good timing you still love me i will be 
there and three time loser he and marie osmond teamed up on 
another no 1 record meet me in montana 
his 1986 album wont be blue aymore was no 1 and reached 
gold status for selling 500000 copies 
in june seals was asked by the us state department to perform 
in sofia bulgaria at an outdoor rally for democracy attended by 
an audience estimated at 14 million pop singer art garfunkel also 
sang 
it was the most mindboggling experience ive ever had 
seals said people just went on into the distance ive played 
for 300000 at a festival and you could have lost them in the first 
few rows over there 
there are no words to describe something like that

the business glossies are increasingly using an 
old strategy to hook the listless reader 
fortune and forbes began promoting their latest editions monday 
with the most elaborate lists yet of the worlds biggest companies 
ranked in categories ranging from sales to pofits to nationality 
officials of the twicemonthly magazines which both report 
circulation in well in excess of 700000 said the timing was 
strictly coincidence but it came a few days after business week 
the leading weekly business periodical with 980000 circulation 
produced its own list of leading worldwide companies 
the list phenomenon is certainly not new it just seems like 
its reaching new heights or new lengths said james gentry 
director of the business journalism progam at the university of 
missouri school of journalism 
part of the reason for the profusion of lists he suggested is 
not letting anybody oneup you if business week designs 
something fortune and forbes will do something 
for the first time fortune produced the fortune global 500 
the list of industrial companies replaced its international 500 
ranking of foreign concerns by combining that list and the 
fortune 500 list of biggest us industrial companies the 
granddaddy of rankings first published in 1955 
fortunes new global list ranked general motors corp as the 
largest industrial concern based on 1989 sales of 12697 billion 
followed by ford motor co with sales of 9693 billion and exxon 
corp at 8666 billion 
the highestranking foreign company was no 4 royal dutchshell 
group the anglodutch oil concern at 8553 billion 
at the same time forbes released its annual forbes 
international 500 which ranked the size of big foreign companies 
and put the japanese trading giant sumitomo corp first with 1989 
sales of 158 billion 
the forbes list dominated by japanese companies was 
embellished by an international super 50 ranking described as 
the 50 most powerful foreign companies as measured by a mix of 
sales profits assets and market value the magazine included its 
list of the worlds billionaires in the same issue 
we feel we do it best of all said forbes spokesman ray 
healey we just dont give them the companies we give them the 
billionaires that run these companies we give people a complete 
package our competitors give people a half package 
not so said fortune managing editor marshall loeb who called 
his magazines list the most informative easiest to read and 
uptodate 
i dont want to knock their list i just want to talk about 
our list he said its the only one that presents the 500 
industrial corporations in the whole world by gauging size that 
is the sales of the company 
fortune and forbes have assembled increasingly elaborate lists 
in recent years besides the wealthiest people and the biggest 
companies list topics have ranged from best cities for business to 
highestpaid executives 
both magazines also have peddled their lists more aggressively 
in advance of publication not only as news events to attract 
additional readers but as a selling point to potential advertisers 
the fortune list is in july 30 issues and the forbes list is in 
july 23 issues both were released several days in advance of their 
appearance on newsstands 
in the current climate of weak advertising revenue in the us 
magazine industry the foreigntheme lists have taken on a more 
important role for the business glossies foreign companies 
particularly from japan have enormous amounts of money to spend on 
promotion and actively are sought as advertisers 
the fortune issue for example contains an 81page special 
advertising supplement on japanese businesses magazine spokeswoman 
emma dockendorff called it the single biggest special ad section in 
the magazines history forbes included a 16page supplement on 
usgerman business

magazines contact emma dockendorff fortune at 2125223622 and

other criteria some companies on both lists have differing sales

in an attempt to break a legal gridlock over 
compensating victims of asbestosrelated diseases a federal judge 
is seeking to consolidate tens of thousands of lawsuits into one 
giant class action case 
us district judge jack b weinstein on monday also ordered a 
complete overhaul of the financially ailing manville corp trust 
fund created to compensate victims of diseases such as lung cancer 
and mesothelioma 
but weinstein said the only possible solution to this 
wasteful inefficient war over asbestos may be to group all of 
some 90000 outstanding cases into one classaction lawsuit before 
him 
the judge asked lawyers for about 40 defendant companies and 
thousands of victims exposed to asbestos on the job to agree on a 
converting the cases that would remove cases from the dockets of 
500 state courts and all 96 federal courts 
the courts are now so overloaded with drug cases and other 
matters that the extra burden of asbestos litigation is seriously 
interfering with the administration of justice in this country 
weinstein said 
consolidating the cases also would sharply reduce payments to 
plaintiffs lawyers who have received as much as 40 percent of 
compensation payments to victims 
asbestos a white mineral with natural heatresistance and 
insulation properties was widely used in shipbuilding 
construction and other industries for decades lengthy exposure has 
been found to cause cancer and other serious and often fatal 
diseases 
in his order weinstein also temporarily froze all payments by 
the manville trust citing a severe cash shortage 
constituting a judicial emergency included in the stay are 
payments of any settlements court judgments and legal fees 
ongoing court cases are not affected 
he ordered that the trust created in 1988 as part of manville 
corps bankruptcy court reorganization be restructured and 
refinanced by aug 6 to allow quicker payments to the neediest 
victims of asbestosrelated disease 
the manville personal injury settlement trust is out of cash to 
pay new claims and has said that people who file claims now may not 
get paid until well into the 21st century 
the cash shortage has been induced by more cases larger payouts 
and quicker settlements than expected to date the trust has paid 
974 million to settle more than 22300 cases an average payment 
of about 43000 per claim 
weinstein is involved in the asbestos saga because he is 
supervising along with a state judge 579 cases consolidated for 
trial involving former workers of the brooklyn navy yard 
weinstein called for a new method to compensate workers and 
their families who were most seriously injured by asbestos diseases 
and need money immediately he supported installment payments to 
victims to maximize the trusts available funds 
those workers and their families who were most seriously 
injured must secure compensation immediately weinstein said 
that would replace the system developed in bankruptcy court that 
pays victims on the basis of when they file a claim rather than the 
nature of their disease one of the most highly criticized features 
of the trust 
on refinancing weinstein suggested several steps including 
hundreds of millions of dollars in loans or advances from manville 
sale of control of manville by transferring the trusts assets or 
the trust buying the entire company 
as part of its chapter 11 reorganization denverbased manville 
placed 25 billion in assets mostly stock into the trust the 
company also agreed to contribute 75 million annually starting in 
1991 plus 20 percent of annual net income from 1992 until all 
claims are paid the trust effectively controls 80 percent of 
manville 
weinstein supported an injunction prohibiting asbestos victims 
from directly suing manville a measure he hinted at recently 
because the value of the trust depends upon a healthy viable 
corporation 
david austern general counsel for the washingtonbased trust 
said he would ask the trustees whether to object to the stay of 
payments 
according to court documents the trust has on hand 932 
million to pay 1128 million in claims already settled that money 
is frozen by the judges order

critics say the maker of marlboro cigarettes is 
blowing smoke with its new advertising campaign that warns candy 
toy and apparel manufacturers against using its trademarks on 
products aimed at children 
the campaign by philip morris usa the nations biggest 
cigarette company whose brands also include virginia slims benson 
amp hedges and parliament was disclosed monday amid a crescendo of 
healthrelated complaints against smoking 
the critics said the move against unauthorized use of cigarette 
brand logos on candy cigarettes and video games was a diversionary 
tactic designed to distract attention from what they say are subtle 
industry efforts to hook youngsters on tobacco 
they also said the 500000 philip morris pledged for the 
fiveyear campaign pales next to what it spends promoting its 
tobacco products 
its nothing but a pr effort said dr john w richards 
president of doctors ought to care a physicians group trying to 
reduce teenage smoking 
antismoking forces have succeeded in getting smoking banned on 
most domestic airline flights and in many public spaces and are 
clamoring to extend a ban on broadcast advertising to print and 
promotions such as sporting events 
critics also have accused the tobacco companies of marketing 
their products to children or or tolerating others use of 
distinctive cigarette logos on products for youngsters 
tobacco companies vigorously have denied those charges saying 
their marketing efforts are aimed at adult smokers 
but there have been embarrassing incidents in recent months a 
video game maker for instance used a version of the marlboro logo 
as part of the background for its racing game until it was 
discovered and philip morris objected tobacco companies also 
confirmed they once paid to have their products placed in movies 
popular with teens 
john r nelson vice president of corporate affairs for philip 
morris told a news briefing on monday that the company had taken 
1100 actions to stop unauthorized use of its cigarette logos 
over the past decade with about 10 percent of those cases 
involving products aimed at children 
but he said the company has been able to take those actions 
which range from letters by philip morris lawyers to lawsuits only 
after being notified that the logos are being used 
he said the new ad campaign starting in august in 16 journals 
read widely by lawyers and those in the toy candy video and 
apparel businesses should make philip morris position known in 
advance of products hitting the market 
the company has prepared two ads each listing the companys 
cigarette names and logos one ad says cigarettes are not for 
children while the other says if you use these trademarks 
well see you in court 
we dont want products created for kids carrying our logos 
nelson told reporters 
nelson defended the amount earmarked for the fiveyear campaign 
saying 500000 was sufficient to reach through trade journals the 
people making childrens products 
according to leading national advertisers philip morris spent 
2774 million on cigarette advertising in 1989 others have 
estimated the industry as a whole spends more than 3 billion a 
year on all types of tobacco promotion 
nelson said there were no plans to beef up the companys 
sixperson trademark enforcement division to support the goals of 
the new ad campaign but said that division has no budget cap on 
what it may spend 
he said the company decided last year it no longer would allow 
use of its cigarettes in movies following controversies about 
placing marlboros in a superman movie and lark cigarettes in a 
james bond film 
he said philip morris notified leading product placement 
companies that it no longer will pay for such placements and would 
deny permission if asked 
but he added there was little the company could do to stop 
incidental use of its brands in films 
the new ad campaign wont quiet tobaccos critics 
joe tye president of a group called stop teenage addiction to 
tobacco said he doubts the industry wants to discourage young 
people from smoking he estimated people under 18 bought 125 
billion in tobacco products last year 
they are trying to come up with something to distract from 
what they are really doing trying to get kids to smoke by 
associating with it with athletics excellence independence 
maturity good times and good fun he said

a foodmaker whose bananas were more familiar 
than it was did it so did a bedding company better known for a 
mattress brand 
an investment partnership with all too familiar name did it in 
what appeared to be a chance to make people forget 
they all changed their corporate names in the first half of the 
year 
united brands inc became chiquita brands international inc 
ohio mattress co is now known as sealy corp and ivan boesky amp co 
lp became cx partners lp 
but despite these striking examples of new company calling 
cards a survey released monday said the volume of corporate name 
changes fell 9 percent in the first half of 1990 compared with a 
year earlier 
the consulting firm anspach grossman portugal inc said the 697 
corporate names changes in the first six months of 1990 was down 
from 767 in the first half of 1989 it was the fewest changes for 
the period since there were 579 in the first half of 1986 
joel portugal a principal in the identity consulting firm said 
the decline reflected an overall decline in general business 
activity firsthalf name changes peaked at 931 in early 1988 
the latest dropoff occurred despite an increase in the number 
of name changes stemming from mergers and acquisitions 
that was the single biggest category of name change 
explanations totaling 367 changes or 53 percent of the total 
compared with 351 a year earlier 
prominent among mergerrelated changes were 61 resulting from 
governmentassisted actions related to the thrift industry 
elective name changes accounted for another 125 down from 139 a 
year earlier while divestitures accounted for 93 changes down 
from 108 
elective changes included united brands change as well as the 
switch of international minerals and chemical corp to imcera group 
and amca internationals change to united dominion industries 
other reasons included 44 due to sale of assets 34 for 
corporate restructuring seven for changes to a holding company 
configuration eight for leveraged buyouts or spinoffs and 19 for 
assorted other reasons 
portugal said companies have become more sophisticated in recent 
years about name changes 
he said two decades ago executives often would change a 
companys name in an effort to prime the pump and boost sales 
but he said modern executives make changes for substance not 
appearances sake and said the falloff in name changes this year 
may indicate that companies dont feel their business has changed 
enough to warrant a switch 
with less changes taking place in business there is less 
reason to communicate a change he said 
but he said some companies sought to disassociate themselves 
from names that became infamous in the 1980s 
in addition to the change at the investment firm headed by ivan 
boesky a central figure in wall streets biggest inside trading 
case portugal noted that campeau us corp became federated 
stores inc in the first half 
in the face of financial problems portugal noted campeau 
changed its name to an already wellestablished and respected 
name in the financial and retail communities

a 30day coolingoff period began today after 
contract talks between eastern airlines and the air line pilots 
association reached an impasse 
the latest round of talks started in midmay several weeks 
after a federal bankruptcy court in new york appointed martin 
shugrue as a trustee to take control of eastern from frank lorenzo 
lorenzo is chairman of continental airlines holdings inc then 
called texas air corp the parent of eastern 
after the 30day period the alpa pilots could legally vote to 
strike miamibased eastern but such a move likely would have 
little effect since most of the 1900 pilots at eastern currently 
are nonunion 
flight attendants and alpa pilots at eastern walked out in 
sympathy with the machinists union in march 1989 but called off 
their strikes last november 
most of the pilots were replaced by nonunion hires and only a 
few hundred alpa fliers remained at eastern through the strike or 
later returned to work there many former eastern pilots still are 
out of work 
an alpa strike vote would be a nonevent eastern 
spokeswoman karen ceremsak said monday in miami she said the 
company would work toward a negotiated settlement in the next 30 
days 
ej breen a member of the master executive council of alpa for 
eastern acknowledged that a decision to strike wouldnt shut down 
the airline he warned however that it could hamper the carriers 
operations 
an impasse was declared monday after the talks in washington 
broke off in early in the day the master executive council 
rejected what was described as the companys final contract offer 
a federal mediator proposed arbitration a stronger measure than 
mediation but eastern refused the offer setting in motion the 
coolingoff period 
later at a hearing before us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland in new york eastern withdrew its earlier request to the 
court to impose a new contract on the alpa pilots 
eastern has consistently slammed every door in the pilots 
face said john mazor an alpa spokesman 
in a statement the pilots union called the contract terms 
offered by the company onerous at best the two sides also are 
at loggerheads over the issue of nonworking pilots returning to 
eastern and the order of preference they should be given in going 
back 
in addition alpa objects to easterns insistence that the 
unions lawsuit against continental airlines holdings be dropped as 
a condition of reaching a labor agreement 
when martin shugrue took over as trustee of eastern he said 
that labor peace was essential to easterns survival the alpa 
statement said apparently that was just a stalling tactic 
because what were seeing is simply a continuation of the lorenzo 
approach to labor relations 
nevertheless the union said it was prepared to continue 
negotiations with the company throughout the coolingoff period 
eastern has been operating under bankruptcy court supervision 
since march 9 1989 five days after the start of the strike

ual corps unions are still seeking financing 
commitments for their proposed 438 billion acquisition of united 
airlines although five major banks have expressed a willingness to 
become the lead lenders 
we are talking to a lot of people a source close to the 
labor group said those includes other banks and aircraft 
suppliers said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the unions have disclosed the names of five major us banks 
that have indicated an interest in lending money for the deal the 
development advances the union group toward its goal of securing 
financing for the buyout by an aug 9 deadline 
but none of the banks has yet signed a loan agreement and they 
are insisting that a portion of the financing come from nonbanking 
sources such as aircraft suppliers said the union group source 
im not aware that anything has been signed the source said 
monday they have expressed a willingness to participate 
the five new yorkbased banks are citicorp chase manhattan 
corp bankers trust new york corp manufacturers hanover corp 
and chemical banking corp uniteds pilots union said saturday in 
a taperecorded telephone message to its members 
the banks will be both participating in and leading the 
syndication of the financing according to the message 
the unions need about 45 billion to complete the cash portion 
of the 201pershare buyout refinance existing debt and provide 
working capital for the airline 
the five banks are expected each to offer about 500 million or 
a total of 25 billion 
uals stock rose 437 to 15712 monday in composite trading 
on the new york stock exchange 
the buyout group which includes uniteds pilots machinists and 
flight attendants supplied the names of the banks to uals board 
of directors last week in a progress report the union source said 
the wall street journal reported monday that the board pressed 
the unions to provide evidence of progress after the unions asked 
the board to hold off on placing a large order for new aicraft a 
request the board subsequently honored 
the union source would say only that the unions supplied the 
bank names to uals board after learning the board was readying the 
jet order 
the buyout group is talking with a variety of suppliers 
including aircraft manufacturer boeing corp and jet engine maker 
general electric co about possibly investing in the buyout in 
return for a note or nonvoting preferred stock in the airline 
the union group also has named three people who would become 
directors of an employeeowned ual 
they are robert lanigan chairman of owensillinois inc j 
richard munro chairman of the executive committee of time warner 
inc and donald perkins a former chairman of jewel food stores 
inc a unit of american superstores inc 
the board agreed in april to the buyout proposal which would 
make ual the worlds largest employeeowned company 
two of the banks named by the unions citicorp and chase 
manhattan were the lead banks in an earlier failed buyout bid led 
by uals management and pilots 
that 675 billion deal collapsed in october precipitating a 
190point plunge in the stock market when other banks balked at 
financing it partly because of opposition by uniteds machinists

a federal judge has ruled that georgias penny 
stock law considered the toughest in the nation is legal and 
will not adversely affect legitimate brokers 
in an order filed late monday us district judge jack camp 
said the public interest in having a strong antifraud law 
outweighed pacific southern securities incs contention that it 
would be irreparably harmed by the law 
the company claimed that the law violated its constitutional 
rights to due process equal protection and commerce and that the 
state law was preempted by federal legislation 
gerald schechter president of coloradobased pacific southern 
had testified in a hearing last month that he could not do business 
in georgia under the law schechter said his firm has more than 
1200 georgia customers 
regulating abuses in the penny stock industry is a legitimate 
state government interest camp said in his order limiting the 
effect of the regulations to firms that deal almost exclusively in 
penny stocks is not an irrational or arbitrary exercise of 
government power 
the new law which went into effect july 1 includes several 
provisions to protect investors including a threeday cooling 
off period during which deals to buy the stocks can be canceled 
the law also requires dealers to undergo training to ensure they 
know about what they are selling and the secretary of state is 
given increased power to impose penalties on violators including 
civil fines of up to 500000 for each offense 
the law passed the legislature overwhelmingly following a series 
of hearings organized by georgia secretary of state max cleland 
where investors made allegations of widespread abuse in the penny 
stock industry 
penny stocks are lowprice highrisk securities that 
authorities say are easily subject to fraud the securities are not 
listed on stock exchanges and reliable information on their value 
is not readily available to investors 
federal officials say penny stock fraud causes investors to lose 
2 billion annually 
the reason we have this law is because there were 
significant abuses to the public said george shingler of the 
attorney generals office who represented cleland

sony corp expressed regret today that it was being 
sued for allegedly promoting illegal record copying after measures 
had been worked out to limit the ability of new tape equipment to 
make copies 
at a meeting of the national music publishers association in los 
angeles monday it was announced that an estimated 45000 
songwriters had filed a class action lawsuit against sony claiming 
its digital audio tape machines encouraged copyright violations 
a sony spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
company had not yet received official word from the us federal 
court in new york where the case had been filed or from the 
plaintiffs 
but it didnt come as a surprise the spokesman said adding 
that music copyright holders had indicated they might take legal 
action aimed at preventing the new recording devices from going on 
sale 
unlike current analog tape recording equipment digital 
technology provides for distortionfree recording of music from 
compact discs and of subsequent generations of dat cassettes 
the sony spokesman said it was regrettable that the songwriters 
should choose to sue just as the us congress was beginning to 
debate legislation and after an international consensus had been 
reached on preventing the new technology from violating musicians 
copyrights 
last summer record and audio industry groups around the world 
agreed on a worldwide standard for dat equipment that clears the 
way for widespread marketing but limits the machines ability to 
make repeated copies of cds and other recorded material 
they agreed that the machines would include a system that adds a 
flag signal to the tape when music from cds is recorded to 
prevent any additional copies being made 
the sony spokesman said the agreement had worked to the mutual 
benefit of dat manufacturers record makers and consumers 
it would be a disadvantage to us consumers if it were taken 
away he said 
sony and its american affiliates though not the only producers 
of dat technology were the only firms named in the lawsuit sony 
leads the field 
japanese companies the principal makers of the new machines 
have sold dat equipment in japan and europe since 1987 but they 
had refrained from selling in the united states until last month 
because of opposition by the us record industry and a delay in 
receiving permission from their own government

five semiconductor makers illegally are using a 
process patented by texas instruments inc 13 years ago the 
company claims in complaints filed in court and with the 
international trade commission 
ti is taking these actions to prevent the unauthorized use of 
its technology and protect the significant investments the company 
has made in development of intellectual property that is used in 
integrated circuits around the world company general counsel 
richard j agnich said after mondays filings 
the lawsuit filed in us district in dallas says integrated 
device technology inc in santa clara calif analog devices inc 
of norwood mass cypress semiconductor corp and vlsi technology 
inc both of sa jose calif and lsi logic corp of milpitas 
calif are violating a 1977 patent the suit asks for unspecified 
damages 
a companion complaint filed with the trade commission says the 
five companies also are importing and selling semiconductors made 
using the process without licensing 
the actions are the latest in the dallasbased companys 
4yearold campaign to benefit from its technological advances 
which are protected by more than 5000 patents among the companys 
breakthroughs was the invention of the computer chip in 1958 
ti has earned 574 million in royalty income since 1987 when it 
first challenged nine asian companies for using the same process 
which involves covering computer chips with plastic 
one of the accused companies suggested the lawsuit is a 
farfetched bid to grab revenue 
texas instruments has been demanding some incredibly high 
royalty rates said jack menache general counsel at integrated 
device technology inc i guess theyre not making any money from 
operations 
menache said officials of his company met with ti 
representatives in december to discuss the patents but no 
negotiations have been held since 
menache said the process ti claims rights to a process thats 
been around for a long long time 
officials at the other four companies said they would have no 
immediate comment 
a ti engineer is credited with coinventing the integrated 
circuit in 1958 today the company is the no 2 us manufacturer 
of computer chips behind motorola inc 
it wasnt until 1986 however that the dallasbased computer 
company began enforcing patents prior to that you did not have a 
legal system whose environment was that conducive to intellectual 
property said ti spokeswoman terri west 
in order to remain competitive a company must receive a fair 
return on a research and development investment and that means 
protecting your intellectual property she said 
most of the royalty income so far has come from the patent 
covered in the lawsuits in 1986 ti won claims that one korean and 
eight japanese semiconductor manufacturers were illegally using the 
process 
in addition ti last year won a japanese patent on the 1958 
integrated circuit one estimate puts income from that patent as 
high as 290 million in 1991 alone 
in addition to the plasticencapsulation patent the lawsuit 
claims the five companies are violating a related patent and that 
vlsi and cypress semiconductor are violating two other patents

a bill requiring the music industry to 
label records with questionable lyrics and not sell such records 
to minors may not be constitutional gov buddy roemer said 
roemer said he favors warning labels for recordings with themes 
of rape murder suicide incest illegal drug use child abuse and 
satanic worship but would prefer that the industry adopt a 
voluntary program 
the governor said he did not know whether he would sign the 
measure which also bans the sale of labeled records to minors 
although the labeling bill passed both chambers of the 
legislature with more than the twothirds vote needed to override a 
veto the legislative session ended monday night and a veto would 
kill it until the next session which begins in april roemer has 
20 days to decide on the bill after it reaches his desk 
roemer told a news conference monday that serious legal 
questions about the bills constitutionality had to be balanced 
against concerns about the content of some recordings 
most of the industry was acting responsibly but some portions 
of the industry produce pure trash he said parents dont know 
that until they are brought home and played 
roemer said he preferred a voluntary program similar to the 
ratings system adopted by the movie industry 
well all be better off he said 
under the legislation record manufacturers would be required to 
label recordings with objectionable lyrics retailers would be 
subject to misdemeanor criminal penalties for selling labeled 
recordings to those under 17 
in may the recording industry unveiled a voluntary labeling 
system aimed at halting state campaigns for mandatory labeling 
industry spokesmen said every legislature except louisianas pulled 
back their bills while the voluntary program was tested 
the voluntary program went into effect this month and labeled 
recordings already are showing up in stores said mike cutshaw an 
attorney representing the national association of recording 
merchandisers 
last week capitol records promised to provide legal help to 
store operators who are threatened with arrest for selling its 
recordings that bear labels warning consumers of sexually explicit 
lyrics 
the producers of the grammy awards show have said such a law 
would scuttle louisianas chances of playing host to the event 
also backers of a proposed grammy hall of fame in new orleans say 
the law would end their project and cost the city 100 million a 
year 
the legislation would not take effect until 1992 rep ted haik 
the bills sponsor has said that if the industry implements its 
voluntary program he would push for repeal of the law

prodded by british officials economic summit 
negotiators renewed efforts today to resolve differences over 
president bushs proposal to abolish billions of dollars in foreign 
farm subsidies 
us trade representative carla hills was meeting later in the 
day with frans andriessen the top trade negotiator for the 
european community to discuss ways to break their stalemate over 
the farm subsidy question 
afterwards aides to summit leaders were expected to meet late 
into the night in their search for a trade compromise to include in 
the final summit communique that will be issued wednesday 
british officials urged compromise britain is a member of the 
european community but doesnt have as big a stake in the subsidy 
issue because it has fewer and smaller farms than their summit 
partners 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd warned today that failure 
to reach agreement could be extremely damaging to longterm global 
prosperity 
this negotiation will not succeed unless we are all prepared 
to go for a compromise he said in a bbc interview 
while fights over the arcane language of trade agreements 
usually are left to subordinates to settle this dispute has 
attracted the attention of the leaders of seven major industrial 
democracies because of the huge stakes involved 
the bush administration believes that the united states best 
hope of resolving its 100 billion trade imbalance is to expand 
export opportunities for us farmers and businesses by 
liberalizing the rules governing world trade 
freer global trade also holds out the promise of providing an 
economic lifeline for struggling new democracies in eastern europe 
and latin america by expanding the markets for their goods 
but it is far from clear whether the trade talks known as the 
uruguay round for the country where they began in 1986 will 
succeed given entrenched positions in such areas as agriculture 
the talks are being conducted by the 97nation general agreement on 
tariffs and trade the world body that governs trade 
before coming to houston bush said that without fundamental 
reform in agriculture the united states would walk away from the 
uruguay round bush aides said monday that the president has been 
taking a tough line in houston in his discussions with summit 
colleagues 
the president has been doing a very good job to indicate why 
agriculture is the lynchpin to these negotiations ms hills said 
bush brought up the trade negotiations in a string of oneonone 
sessions with world leaders and then devoted a part of the first 
formal session monday to talking about agriculture 
bush is making the point very forcefully to his summit 
partners that this is an enormously important activity 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter told reporters calling 
bushs discussions a motivating session to get the europeans 
engaged 
in discussions with jacques delores president of the european 
communitys executive body bush took a tough stance telling 
delors that the political leaders needed to exhibit political 
courage to resolve the issue an ec official said 
it was tough it was frank the official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
bush also discussed the farm dispute in separate meetings with 
french president francois mitterrand and west german chancellor 
helmut kohl the two european leaders with the strongest opposition 
to total elimination of farm subsidies 
kohl however indicated that in his discussions he believed a 
compromise proposal on the agricultural issue represented a good 
starting point to trying to resolve the issue 
the document drawn up by aart de zeeuw a former dutch official 
who is chairing the agricultural negotiations strikes a 
middleground between the defensive ec position and the aggressive 
us stance 
in the summits opening session kohl told the other leaders 
that there was a critical need to insure a successful conclusion of 
the trade talks being held under the auspices of the 97nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
he told the leaders that the summit needed to give the 
negotiators a positive signal and a political orientation that 
we all jointly stand for strengthening the gatt 
yeutter said kohls stance was mildly encouraging with other 
officials suggesting that it could represent a breakthrough if 
other european nations follow west germanys lead 
hills told reporters that the united states hoped to achieve a 
commitment from the summit countries to use the de zeeuw paper as 
the basis for working out a final agreement on agriculture 
in addition to phasing out farm subsidies the united states has 
an ambitious goal of expanding global trade rules to include about 
1 trillion in trade not now covered by the gatt 
the us proposal would result in the elimination of barriers to 
trade in the highgrowth area of banking and other services where 
us companies are extremely competitive 
american negotiators are also pushing to extend gatt rules to 
cover better enforcement of trade and copyright piracy which is 
estimated to cost american companies 60 billion in lost sales each 
year 
agriculture is seen as the key to the whole us package because 
third world countries have balked at agreeing to the proposals on 
expanding gatt coverage unless they win expanded markets for their 
farm products

after a partial verdict in the first trial 
stemming from an fbi commodity sting operation the government 
plans to try again to prove that three traders conspired to cheat 
customers 
in addition to a racketeering charge that stumped a us 
district court jury prosecutors also plan to refile scores of 
fraud charges against the defendants 
it is our intention at this point to go forward with the 
remaining charges assistant us attorney mark pollack said 
after the jury ended 11 days of deliberations by returning verdicts 
on only 30 of 116 counts 
the panel convicted two traders on commodity fraud charges and 
acquitted a third us district judge ann c williams who 
presided over the nearly two months of proceedings declared a 
mistrial on the counts the jury didnt resolve 
robert d mosky 34 a floor broker portrayed by prosecutors as 
the leader of a fraud scheme in the mercs swiss franc futures pit 
was found guilty of seven counts of commodity exchange act fraud 
the least serious charges against him 
the jury acquitted him of 20 commodity mail and wire fraud 
charges and deadlocked on 55 other counts including a racketeering 
charge 
independent trader danny l scheck 28 was convicted of one 
count of commodity fraud the jury could not reach a verdict on 19 
other counts against scheck 
david zatz 43 another independent trader in the swiss franc 
pit was acquitted on two commodity fraud counts the jury could 
not decide 12 other counts against zatz 
each commodity fraud count carries a maximum prison sentence of 
five years and a 100000 fine prosecutors said 
the men were the first group of commodities traders to stand 
trial on charges resulting from a continuing fbi probe of 
corruption at the merc and the chicago board of trade the worlds 
biggest commodity futures markets 
two other groups 13 soybean traders from the board of trade 
and 15 japanese yen traders from the merc go on trial in 
september 
assistant us attorney james fleissner is not working on those 
cases but said their structure probably would be similar 
we have certain kinds of evidence the agent will testify 
about what he saw the people who are testifying as cooperators 
will testify about what they saw we will play tapes he said 
in all 48 people have been indicted since last august sixteen 
have pleaded guilty to reduced charges including two swiss franc 
traders who testified against mosky scheck and zatz 
us attorney ira raphaelson asked how mondays verdict might 
affect the trials of other indicted traders said it doesnt 
mean anything 
but defense lawyers said the partial victory was a serious blow 
to the governments investigation 
moskys lawyer elliott samuels had argued during the trial 
that the prosecution represented an overzealous and 
outrageous government attempt to enforce vague trading 
regulations arbitrarily 
id like to think the jury was disturbed about the 
governments theory samuels said after the verdicts were 
announced 
alan blumenthal said that as far as his client zatz was 
concerned the government didnt convince the jury any laws had 
been broken 
they were presented comprehensive evidence and there was no 
finding of proof blumenthal said as it stands right now my 
client is innocent 
the chicago mercs board of governors will discuss what action 
if any to take against the convicted traders during a meeting 
wednesday said merc spokesman andrew yemma 
in the trial which began may 8 the government contended the 
defendants conspired to cheat customers by changing the prices at 
which customer orders were executed or through prearranged and 
offmarket trades that prevented the orders from being offered in 
the open competitive market 
a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity 
in this case a quantity of swiss francs at a price agreed upon in 
advance 
prosecutors said mosky used the stolen customer profits 
sometimes as small as 1250 per trade to pad his own account and 
to repay scheck and zatz for illegally accepting the financial 
liability for his trading errors 
defense lawyers argued their clients had done no wrong they 
contended the governments star witness undercover fbi agent 
randall jannett was so illprepared for his role as a trader that 
in the seeming chaos of the trading pit he mistook the defendants 
legitimate actions for improprieties

the united states and west germany appeared 
headed today toward a summit agreement on environmental concerns 
that sought to obscure their sharp differences over global warming 
negotiators from washington and bonn sought to strike a 
conciliatory deal stressing a united front on protecting tropical 
rain forests and playing down their dispute over what should be 
done about pollutants that contribute to warming of the earths 
climate summit sources said 
details of the forest protection accord were unavailable in 
advance of an afternoon session of the sevennation economic summit 
dealing with the environment the agreement is to be included in 
the final summit communique that will be issued wednesday 
word of the negotiating bid for harmony on the environmental 
issue emerged one day after west german chancellor helmut kohl and 
white house chief of staff john sununu exchanged critical jabs over 
their countries divergent approaches to global warming 
sununu accused the west germans of being leaders in global 
warming rhetorics kohl took aim at president bushs call for 
further study of the problem rather than hasty action that might 
cause needless economic damage 
us officials had gotten the impression in presummit talks 
that the germans might take a flexible stance at the summit on 
their calls for specific goals for reducing emissions of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases blamed for an increase in 
the earths temperatures 
although environmental policy was not scheduled for summit 
discussion until this afternoon the french and german leaders 
pointedly addressed it in their opening presentations on monday 
and east european environmentalists appealed to the summit 
leaders at a news conference to help their countries clean up 
in the past money was pumped into the government without 
economic or environmental concern said zbigniew bochniarz a 
member of the polish ecology club now we must create a new 
approach and build conditions that will modernize outdated 
pollution standards 
kohl said in his opening session pitch that decisive measures 
are needed to reduce the greenhouse effect a term referring to 
the gradually warming climates around the world 
a lack of scientific knowledge about the causes and effect 
cannot justify slowing down the taking of concrete measures kohl 
told his colleagues at the summit 
the statement was clearly aimed at bush who contends that more 
study is needed on global warming before taking dramatic steps 
urged by germany and other europeans to cut the carbon dioxide 
emissions from burning of fossil fuels said to be the principal 
cause of global warming 
kohl said however that what is foremost required is drastic 
reduction of carbon dioxide emissions 
the houston summit should give a clear and concrete signal for 
the effective protection of mankind and environment kohl said 
french president francois mitterrand joined kohl in calling for 
specific steps according to his spokesman hubert vedrine 
mitterrand said the summit leaders should not be satisfied with 
simply a general declaration on the environment there should be 
specific commitments to reduce pollution and save forests the 
spokesman quoted mitterrand as saying 
earlier sununu was asked about an environmental groups 
scorecard which rated west germany much higher than the united 
states regarding steps to protect the environment sununu replied 
that west germany got a lot of good grades for rhetoric 
if you take a good look at what the united states has actually 
done in terms of cleaning up our environment i dont think the 
united states has to take a back seat to anyone he said 
sununu and others in the administration contend that committing 
to carbon dioxide reduction goals would devastate the us economy 
because of the heavy dependence on fossil fuels 
he told a news conference that the administration is concerned 
that specific reduction targets amount to a perpetual 
stabilization and that continued economic growth requires 
that you continue to use energy and that any growth at all then 
would not be permitted 
the germans have led the way in europe by pledging to cut carbon 
dioxide releases by 25 percent by the year 2005

who said there is no quicker way to kill 
prosperity than to raise taxes 
perhaps a clue would help hes the person who also said when 
the government raises a dollar in revenues congress spends a 
dollar fifty and who said the surest way to kill the recovery 
is to raise taxes 
george bush isnt being let off easily by those who thought they 
had read no new taxes on his lips economist daniel mitchell 
for example reminds us that bush is the author of all three quotes 
mitchell is a fellow of the heritage foundation a conservative 
think tank whose ideas have been listened to by officials in both 
the reagan and bush administrations mitchells words suggest his 
fury to wit 
if george bush had pardoned willie horton or burned old glory 
on the lawn of the white house it would hardly have rivaled the 
flipflop committed on taxes 
to him the battle over taxes is a battle not only for the 
economy it is a battle for the integrity and character of the bush 
presidency 
only slightly less upset were david makarechian and bryan riley 
of citizens for a sound economy who followed bushs explanation 
for his apparent change of mind the need to reduce the deficit 
with an explanation of their own 
president bushs june 26 announcement that tax revenue 
increases must be included as part of the deficit reduction package 
now being negotiated in the budget summit is superfluous they 
stated no qualifications whatever 
the sole purpose for including tax increases in a deficit 
reduction package they said is to allow faster spending growth 
than if the government relied upon spending restraints alone 
the wall street journal observed that it was impossible to 
determine which of several wacko tax proposals are likely to be 
enacted and suggested president bush was losing control of his own 
economic policy 
the last time a national leader lost control of economic 
policy it said in an apparent reference to former president 
carter we suffered a malaise not suffered in this country for 
more than a decade 
the journal seemed especially upset at what seems to be a 
contradiction in regard to stock transactions a cut in the capital 
gains tax rate on stocks that are sold after having risen in value 
but a new tax on stock transfers 
the bush administration has not formally proposed the latter 
but rumors have circulated that it is considering doing so it 
prompted the journal to comment that we are tempted to dismiss 
this proposal as patently absurd except that with lip reading out 
of style we can take nothing for granted 
the intensity of feeling is noteworthy because most of it comes 
from those who have endorsed the presidents reluctance to add to 
the tax bill and most seem to offer the same rationale that new 
taxes simply mean new spending 
at the same time the presidents stance is not a surprise to 
them two weeks before the presidents comment about tax revenues 
increases the tax foundation a private research organization 
issued this comment 
only 10 of the last 62 budgets paid their own way without 
deficit spending and in none of the last 21 years has the budget 
been balanced 
unfortunately by the light of recent budget summit history 
any deficit reduction deal could be a bad deal for taxpayers

saudi arabia oil minister hisham 
nazer held a meeting for four of his opec counterparts on tuesday 
to discuss ways to ease the oil price slump in preparation for the 
cartels july 25 session 
the gathering followed instructions from king fahd to work for 
the success of the meeting that will be held in geneva at the end 
of the month according to statements issued after the weekly 
cabinet session 
present with nazer in the saudi summer capital of jiddah were 
rashid alameeri of kuwait mana saeed otaiba of the united arab 
emirates sheik abdullah bin khalifa al thani of qatar and issam 
alchalabi of iraq 
the 13member organization of petroleum exporting countries has 
not been able to maintain a lid on the output of member states 
within the 21086 million barrel per day aggregate ceiling and the 
glut has been pushing prices down threatening an oil price crash 
similar to the one that occurred in 1986 
the geneva meeting will provide a forum to discuss future 
production and pricing strategy reports have indicated the meeting 
may be devoted only to the next three months and then be reconvened 
in september 
the main culprits for the overproduction are kuwait and the 
uae iraq has been leading the pressure on both its gulf 
neighbors to conform to the production levels iraq also rejects 
demands by kuwait and the uae to have their opecdecreed 
production ceilings increased 
saudi arabia the dominant party within the cartel is reported 
to be keen to preserve the current ceiling because of its static 
defense for the opec reference price of 18 a barrel saudi arabia 
also is pledged to demand a barrel for a barrel in case quota 
levels are increased insisting its share of opec production 
ceilings must be 2445 percent in line with its huge reserves 
nazers meeting with his four counterparts was preceded by a 
tour he made of each of their capitals to deliver letters to 
respective leaders from king fahd 
nazer has also conferred with the opec chief sadek boussena who 
was recently on a tour of the gulf opec states and demanded they 
adhere to their production quota levels

the pound surged to an 18month high tuesday on 
continuing speculation that britain would soon join europes 
currencysteadying exchange rate mechanism 
the british government is trying to talk up sterling to fight 
inflation and bring the currency into the mechanism at a high 
level analysts said 
the exchange rate mechanism known as erm is built into the 
european monetary system and limits the fluctuations of nine of the 
12 european community currencies britain portugal and greece are 
the outsiders 
joining the mechanism would reduce sterlings volatility and 
help curb inflation the systems proponents say 
the pound which moved higher during the day finished at 
18155 in europe late tuesday up 1 cent from late monday that 
was the pounds highest level since it finished at 18270 on jan 
3 1989 
buying was extremely heavy dealers said 
there has been a lot of good solid investment demand for 
sterling said geoffrey dennis an economist at the london 
investment firm james capel and co 
the pound has gained 215 cents or 13 percent since midmarch 
when it fetched 16005 it also has risen strongly against the 
german mark and the japanese yen 
analysts predicted sterlings fourmonth climb is likely to 
continue 
the pound has quite a lot of room on the upside especially 
against the dollar said paul chertkow chief currency strategist 
at citibank in london dennis said the pound could fetch as much as 
187 in coming weeks chertkow expects it to reach 190 within 
three months 
the pound also has been sustained by britains 15 percent 
interest rates which are nearly double west germanys and are 
designed to fight inflation now running at 97 percent 
speculation about entry into the erm has gotten more and more 
intense dennis said in a series of comments statements 
speeches announcements the government gradually has dripfed the 
market information to encourage them to believe that sterling is 
going to join 
they have talked up the pound specifically to get it at a 
certain level at which they would like to join he continued 
it takes away the downside for sterling 
the pound got an added boost from britains top treasury 
official chancellor of the exchequer john major who said monday 
that the pounds climb was sustainable and that no interest rate 
cuts were planned 
inflation must improve before interest rates come down major 
told reporters at the group of seven meeting of major 
industrialized nations in houston 
he reiterated that britain wouldnt join the mechanism until 
britains inflation is more in line with the european communitys 
that is the major outstanding condition outlined by prime 
minister margaret thatcher who has committed britain to joining 
but has not set a timetable 
analysts expect mrs thatcher to link the pound to the erm in 
the autumn well before the next general election which must be 
called by mid1992 but could come in a year 
the government says that excluding mortgage rates inflation is 
7 percent and closer to the ecs average of 5 percent 
the government is believed to want to enter the mechanism with a 
strong pound so that britain can cut interest rates before voters 
go to the polls 
a stronger pound in effect adds up to tighter monetary policy 
it fights inflation by making it difficult for companies to grant 
wage increases and forcing them to keep down costs to retain export 
markets 
but a strong pound increases pressure on companies already 
struggling with high interest rates stock traders said 
british stocks have fallen in recent days amid concern that the 
pounds rise would hurt british exports and corporate profits

the state supreme court ruled that patients 
have no right to share in profits if their blood or organs become 
the source of lucrative scientific research 
in a major victory for the us biotechnology industry the 
court said that john moore a leukemia victim whose spleen was 
removed for medical reasons could not sue researchers and 
commercial laboratories on the claim that his personal property was 
being misused he did however win limited rights to sue on more 
narrow grounds 
the 52 decision monday said that researchers used the victims 
spleen without his knowledge to develop a blood protein with 
multibilliondollar medical potential 
allowing such a suit threatens to destroy the economic 
incentive to conduct important medical research said the opinion 
by justice edward panelli 
the multibilliondollar industry relies heavily on a plentiful 
supply of human cell lines thousands of which exist in tissue 
repositories throughout the country 
the court unanimously allowed moore of seattle to maintain his 
suit on a more limited basis a claim that the doctor who removed 
his spleen and later withdrew blood samples over several years had 
failed to disclose his personal interests before getting moores 
consent to the procedures 
that part of the ruling should encourage a more open 
doctorpatient relationship in the future said cynthia fruchtman 
a los angeles lawyer and expert in genetic engineering 
its going to facilitate a dialogue between participants in 
research and researchers themselves so that the public knows 
whats going on said fruchtman 
after moores suit was filed she said some research hospitals 
changed their consent forms to specify that tissues removed may be 
used in research 
if nothing else it allows the patient to ask questions about 
whats going on fruchtman said one of john moores 
complaints as i understand his suit was that he wasnt given that 
information and the opportunity to ask those questions 
the disadvantages to moore in such a suit are that he cannot sue 
the laboratories unless he can show that they were involved in the 
failure to disclose facts and that under normal legal rules he 
could recover damages only for whatever losses he suffered without 
sharing in any profits 
it would appear that a justifiable sigh of relief should go up 
from the scientific community said richard d godown president 
of the industrial biotechnology association a trade group of 107 
companies 
a defendant in the case sandoz pharmaceuticals corp had 
warned in papers filed with the court that the field of 
biomedical research will be plunged into a state of chaos for 
years if the court allowed a suit for conversion or use of 
moores property without his consent 
however moores lawyer sanford gage said the limited claim 
allowed by the court could still include a share of the profits 
a doctor who operated on moore without proper consent and 
companies that knowingly took part in nondisclosures over the 
following years could be required to disgorge illgotten 
gains gage said 
he said he considered the limited decision a victory because 
this allows us to proceed and it does protect patient rights 
moore was a 31yearold alaska pipeline surveyor in 1976 when he 
sought treatment for a type of leukemia called hairycell leukemia 
at the university of california los angeles dr david golde 
removed moores spleen a standard treatment and the disease has 
not recurred 
while testing the removed spleen golde discovered it contained 
unique blood cells that produced a blood protein called gmcsf 
which is now in experimental use as a drug to stimulate the immune 
system to fight certain cancers and possibly aids 
for nearly seven years moores suit said golde and others 
brought moore from seattle to los angeles for blood tests and other 
procedures never telling him of his cells value while they 
developed moores cells into a selfperpetuating cell line to 
massproduce gmcsf 
the regents of the university of california patented the cell 
line in 1984 naming golde and a research assistant shirley quan 
as the inventors the same year moore sued golde quan the uc 
regents and the two companies working on the product sandoz and 
genetics institute inc 
the suit estimated the potential value of the product as 3 
billion it said golde and others had gotten 3 million worth of 
genetics institute stock 
goldes lawyer donn dimichele said today that he was pleased 
that the court had rejected moores main claim but uncertain about 
the effect of the section that would allow suits for failure to 
disclose a researchers interests

japanese investments could prove a bonanza 
for southern states in terms of jobs tax revenues and business 
knowhow according to a new study 
japanese investment is a means by which the south can replace 
jobs lost through import competition said the report released 
monday 
transplant companies also have had some positive effects on us 
firms pushing them to match or exceed foreign standards of 
excellence says the study from the southern growth policies board 
a public interstate agency that examines economic issues facing 
the south 
the japanese rank second to the british among foreign investors 
in the united states according to 1988 figures compiled in the 
report japaneseowned assets totaled 450 billion representing 
about 17 percent of all us assets 
japan was only the seventh largest foreign investor in 1980 the 
authors noted if present trends continue through the 1990s japan 
will likely supplant the british as the largest foreign investor 
japanese companies differ from their competitors the report 
said they invest more heavily in training and retraining 
employees allow for more decisionmaking at the point of 
production and tend to use more highly automated machinery 
on the minus side japanese plants create fewer jobs than would 
might because they tend to be highly automated the report said

analysts said stock traders were closely monitoring the bond 
market where prices were down slightly 
bond prices have been under pressure due to an unexpected dip in

reports before making any significant market moves analysts say

dow jones amp co inc said tuesday its 
secondquarter profit skidded 279 percent because of costs related 
to its acquisition of telerate inc and weakness in the market for 
information services 
the company which publishes the wall street journal and 
barrons magazine said it earned 349 million or 3itution 
will be seized by the government 
agency officials plan to test the program with 10 institutions 
over the next two or three months after that they estimate that 
155 to 180 of the 260 sampl failures expected in the next year could 
be handled in the accelerated program 
private analysts are cautiously endorsing the strategy although 
they note that the rtc has yet to deal with nearly 250 institutions 
that failed previously it has handled more than 200 failed thrifts 
in its first 11 months 
i think in principal its a good idea the only question is 
whether they are so overloaded now with all the clearly insolvent 
institutions said robert litan of the brookings institution a 
liberal research group in washington 
youre going to be using scarce resources for marginally 
insolvent thrifts ahead of other institutions that are clearly in 
much worse shape he said 
however litan said taxpayers might save money by bailing out an 
institution on the edge of insolvency when its owners may be most 
tempted to gamble a deeply insolvent sampl under government control 
often is not in danger of further deterioration he said 
if youre in the government the thing to do is not to focus 
on past losses but to focus on how to prevent future losses from 
occurring he said 
economist james barth of auburn university said the program 
might be a better way of handling the loans real estate and other 
assets of a failed thrift 
in the conventional sampl bailouts so far the government has been 
stuck with about half of the assets which it hopes to sell later 
officials hope in accelerated resolution deals the new owner 
rather than the government will get most of the assets 
the rtc has so many assets it has to try new and different 
things to get those assets back into the private sector barth 
said if theyre not careful theyre going to wind up with the 
worlds largest troubled savings and loan and its going to be 
called the resolution trust corp

energy futures ended higher in active trading 
tuesday led by another sharp gain in unleaded gasoline prices 
traders said seasonal demands and concerns about supplies were 
largely responsible for gasolines surge which helped boost other 
petroleum products 
on the new york mercantile exchange the august contract for 
wholesale unleaded gasoline settled up 101 cents to 5786 cents a 
gallon following a 144cent advance on monday other contract 
months also rose in price

cents a gallon up 038 cent 
in natural gas trading the august contract rose to 1500 per 
1000 cubic feet from 1493 on monday 
peter beutel a trader with merril lynch energy futures said 
some dealers were concerned that last weeks explosion at an arco 
chemical co plant near houston might effect gasoline supplies at a 
time when demand is high 
arco was a major producer of methyl tertiary butyl ether a 
highoctane blending component used instead of lead in gasoline 
refiners may have to refine more crude oil to get the same 
amount of octane beutel said 
also lifting energy futures tuesday was speculation that the 
latest american petroleum institute report due out after the 
market closed tuesday would show a drop in crude oil stocks

membership in labor unions that represent workers 
in manufacturing registered its biggest drop in three years in 
1989 according to a forthcoming report by the grant thornton 
consulting firm 
the reason greater demand for hightech workers 
there are fewer unions in the hightech area and those that 
are are not organizing as effectively said selwin price a 
partner at grant thornton hightech workers are better educated 
higher skilled and management might keep them happier 
he divided manufacturing into two categories lowtech such 
as the steel automobile and garment industries and hightech 
such as computers 
grant thornton is a chicagobased accounting and management 
consulting firm its statistics on unions are contained in its 
annual manufacturing climates study to be released aug 16 price 
is in charge of the study 
the studys figures show labor union membership in manufacturing 
fell by 153000 workers last year 
that represents a 32 percent drop from union membership of 
4771 million in 1988 and the largest yearly decline since 1986 
that year there was a decline of 199500 cardcarrying industrial 
workers a 38 percent drop 
by contrast total manufacturing jobs showed a slight increase 
at the same time rising 10 percent in 1989 and 23 percent over 
the past three years the firm said 
grant thornton has been following union membership in 
manufacturing jobs since 1984 when 2726 percent of all workers in 
industrial occupations belonged to unions in 1989 that number was 
down to 2384 percent 
michigan was the only state last year where more than half 517 
percent of manufacturing workers belonged to unions new york was 
second with 4723 percent florida was the only state to register 
an increase adding 700 union members the study found 
states with the lowest percentage of union membership were south 
dakota 234 percent south carolina 295 percent and arizona 
369 percent 
figures for the study were based on average annual fulltime 
duespaying members and gathered from financial reports that unions 
filed with the us bureau of labor statistics 
it surely does not portend good for unionism because weve 
seen a decline every year price said 
this decline has caused unions to realize their future could 
be in jeopardy he said on the other hand maybe if there were 
no unions maybe the companies wouldnt have the incentive to treat 
their employees so well 
rex hardesty an aflcio spokesman in washington agreed with 
some of prices conclusions for one hightech workers are harder 
to organize into unions he said 
theres no strong union tradition in hightech hardesty 
said in addition he said many of those jobs are in the south 
where resistance to union organizing is strong 
but he also said many former industrial workers now earn their 
living in the service industry or in occupations that have no union 
we have twice as many former union members as we have union 
members a former line worker is now a cement finisher with his 
brotherinlaw or putting on seat covers hardesty said and 
that represents a shift from manufacturing mining and 
construction and railroads into the service industry 
hardesty noted that when the aflcio was formed 35 years ago 58 
percent of americans made their living in manufacturing mining and 
construction today that proportion is 25 percent he said

signs of new middle eastern bullion sales triggered an early 
slide in gold futures prices tuesday but the market partially 
recovered after traders learned the amount of physical gold sold 
was relatively small 
on other commodity markets energy futures advanced sugar 
futures rallied cotton slipped further livestock and meat futures 
were mixed and grains and soybeans were mixed 
gold futures settled 270 to 3 lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in august at 35710 a troy 
ounce the lightly traded july contract finished at 35550 
silver futures settled 1 cent to 14 cents higher with july at 
4811 a troy ounce 
gold prices plunged about 5 an ounce early in the session amid 
rumors of new bullion sales from the middle east 
the talk stirred fears that saudi arabia was again dumping large 
amounts of gold onto the market as it is believed to have done on 
three occasions this year the previous events prompted steep 
declines in gold prices which were around 420 an ounce in 
midfebruary 
peter cardillo director of commodity research with the futures 
brokerage jesup josephthal amp co said the middle eastern gold 
sales on tuesday appeared to have originated in the soviet union 
not saudi arabia and the amount of gold offered for sale was 
relatively small 
when fears of another huge saudi sale were discounted i think 
it took away the panic feeling cardillo said 
petroleum futures rose on the new york mercantile exchange after 
saudi arabia oil minister hisham nazer held a meeting for four of 
his opec counterparts to discuss ways to ease the oil price slump 
in preparation for the cartels july 25 session 
crude oil futures also were supported by expectations that the 
american petroleum institutes weekly stocks report would show a 
drop in us crude supplies of more than 35 million barrels 
the report which was issued after the close showed a drop of 
37 million barrels in the latest week 
gasoline stocks fell by a largerthanexpected 17 million 
barrels supplies of distillates rose 26 million barrels which

5786 cents a gallon 
on the new york coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange nearterm sugar 
futures regained a portion of the ground lost monday in a steep 
selloff sparked by signs of increasing supplies 
but sugar for delivery next may and beyond slipped slightly 
sugar ended 04 cent lower to 20 cent higher with october at 
1210 cents a pound 
nearterm cotton futures fell sharply on the new york cotton 
exchange for the third straight day as profittaking continued to 
erode the strong gains posted over the last six months 
cotton settled 191 cents lower to 63 cent higher with october 
at 7483 cents a pound 
nearterm pork belly futures fell sharply on the chicago 
mercantile exchange partly reflecting slack demand for bacon hog 
futures ended narrowly mixed while cattle futures were mostly lower 
amid profittaking 
live cattle settled 08 cent to 28 cent lower with august at 
7407 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent lower to 05 cent 
higher with august at 8527 cents a pound hogs were 23 cent lower 
to 30 cent higher with july at 6102 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 16 cents lower to 1 cent higher with july at 5057 
cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed in lackluster 
trading on the chicago board of trade 
wheat futures ended slightly lower amid selling linked to the 
advancing winter wheat harvest corn and soybean markets were 
narrowly mixed with nearterm soybean futures supported by 
indications the soviet union recently bought up to 100000 metric 
tons of us soybean meal

305 a bushel corn futures were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher

drug use in the workplace appears to be 
declining a private company said in a report released tuesday 
smithkline beecham clinical laboratories said the number of 
workers and job applicants who tested positive had fallen from 18 
percent to 138 percent in three years 
drug experts however said the figure remained too high 
thats still three out of every 20 workers said john tysse 
a washington labor lawyer who specializes in cases involving drug 
use in the workplace 
while a trend downward if there is one is encouraging that 
still is an awfully high percentage tysse said i would take 
little comfort from that that weve licked the drug problem 
a spokesman for william bennett the presidents drug policy 
director called the results unacceptably high but still an 
indication of the positive turn on the war against drugs 
ben banta said smithklines reported decline probably also 
indicates that drug testing is deterring americans from using drugs 
before or during work 
harry groome president of smithkline said attention on drug 
use in the workplace appears to have led to a decline 
smithkline said that of the 1 million workers and job applicants 
it has tested in the first six months of 1990 138 percent tested 
positive for drug use 
of a similar number tested during all of 1987 smithkline found 
that 181 percent tested positive 
in separate tests of about 65000 workers in safety 
sensitive transportation jobs 31 percent tested positive the 
philadelphiaarea company said 
the results reflect findings of tests conducted over the past 
six months since the federal government began requiring testing of 
airline and railroad employees bus drivers and others in the 
transportation industry 
about 4 million american transportation workers fall under the 
new requirements smithkline beecham owns five of the 50 
laboratories the federal government has certified to run tests on 
transportation workers 
transportation department spokesman bob marx said the companys 
31 percent finding appears high based on our own 
experience 
marx said random drug tests of agency employees in safety 
sensitive jobs found that less than 1 percent had tested positive 
after medical review about half of those who test positive are 
found to have legitimate reasons for testing positive for 
prescription drugs 
smithklines figures did not include postmedical review figures 
john mazor a spokesman for the 40000member air line pilots 
association called the companys findings an interesting 
exercise there are a lot of limitations in their data 
he noted that the company had not broken down transportation 
employees into pilots air traffic controllers mechanics and other 
jobs and predicted there would be widely varying drug use among job 
categories in the industry 
the pilots association has filed one of about 20 lawsuits 
challenging the federal governments drug testing requirements 
according to smithkline beecham workers in all industries 
those in transportation and in the general work force who tested 
positive were found most frequently to be using cocaine or 
marijuana the company said 
of those testing positive in the transportation industry 436 
percent showed traces of marijuana while 252 percent tested 
positive for cocaine an additional 20 percent had used opiates 
such as morphine or codeine 
in the overall work force of those who tested positive 39 
percent had used marijuana 218 percent had traces of cocaine and 
95 percent had traces of opiates 
transportation workers were tested for five illegal drugs 
marijuana cocaine amphetamines opiates and phencyclidine or pcp 
workers in the rest of the work force were also tested for 
several other drugs that are often abused such as barbiturates 
valium and methadone

in its lastditch effort to close a 1 billion 
budget gap the legislature has proposed taxing virtually 
everything but the kitchen sink 
taxpayers may be puzzled over some of the 594 new levies on 
services who for instance has ever seen a telephone booth 
cleaner and how many trampoline operations are there 
some professional groups like lawyers lobbied hard against 
the sales tax expansion to their business but fortune tellers and 
vendors of pipedin music who would also be taxed werent much in 
evidence during the tax debate 
david macneill vice president of a company that sells 
background music to malls and supermarkets said he is concerned 
about the tax the waitingroom music industry like everything 
else is feeling the squeeze from massachusetts slumping economy 
things are tight everybodys hustling like hell to keep 
going said macneill of wcrb sound system in waltham 
stella davis a palm reader from saugus was surprised to learn 
she and her colleagues face a 5 percent sales tax on any 
fortunetelling bills that exceed 30 
when you pay a tax and buy butter youre getting something 
this is just a reading theyre not taking anything home except 
just knowledge davis said 
davis said she is unlikely to pay the tax since most of her 
readings cost 10 
but davis remark reflects a potential problem with the sales 
tax a problem gov michael s dukakis wants resolved before he 
will sign the tax bill aimed at raising 13 billion in its first 
year 
under the massachusetts constitution only commodities can be 
taxed opponents of expanding the sales tax say services dont fall 
under the definition of commodities dukakis has asked the states 
highest court to rule on the matter before he signs the bill 
the state culled the list of services to be taxed from a list of 
professions put out by the us census bureau 
the advantage of using it even though it seems silly when you 
list them out is that it puts it all in black and white said 
betsy houghteling a department of revenue spokeswoman 
although she acknowledged it may be difficult to track down 
every last fortuneteller and yoga teacher houghteling said the 
more obscure professions would bring in little money anyway 
if we missed a palm reader and that person didnt come 
forward voluntarily would the commonwealth miss a lot of money 
no houghteling said 
but the lengthy list of services has left the impression with 
some that everything is being taxed 
among the services whose clients would be subject to a 5 percent 
tax sponging textiles for tailors and dressmakers cleaning and 
reglazing of baking pans mattress renovating and repair shops 
tent repair shops 
theres no fortunetelling lobby so they can tax them said 
peter blanchard of shrewsbury how much money can that bring in 
i dont like it but caroline clark who works for an accounting 
firm had little problem with taxing palm readers 
i feel thats fairly frivolous clark said

texas oilman t boone pickens says he seeking 
help at the economic summit of the worlds richest nations for his 
efforts to crack the lineup of a japanese companys board of 
directors 
when i started out 16 months ago i said i wasnt asking for 
help i was just reporting my experience to washington and to 
congress and people in the administration pickens told a news 
conference tuesday about 16 months later i guess i am about 
ready to say i would like to have some help 
pickens said he planned to meet with summit delegation members 
from the united states and japan but admitted that so far he 
wasnt on anyones agenda 
his private investment firm boone co owns 26 percent of koito 
manufacturing co a japanese auto parts maker pickens 
unsuccessfully has tried to gain a voice in the company by landing 
four of koitos 20 board seats 
pickens claims he has been shut out of koito by japans 
keiretsu system in which companies have formed closed links 
through shared stock financial and personnel links and corporate 
strategies he alleges koito is part of the keiretsu surrounding 
toyota motor co which is its second largest shareholder and the 
largest buyer of its parts 
at a june 28 koito shareholders meeting pickens was denied 
board seats and was defeated on other proposals including larger 
dividends and having shareholders vote on salary and retirement 
benefits for board members 
koito claims pickens is trying to greenmail the company into 
buying his stock at premium prices company officials also contend 
pickens is acting on behalf of japanese investor kitaro watanabe 
who they say has twice tried to greenmail them 
when asked if he was in houston seeking the help of japanese 
prime minister toshiki kaifu pickens replied 
theres no doubt about it he could help my cause if he put 
any pressure on the toyotakoito group and said put the guy on 
the board and lets see if he would be a good board member sure i 
would like to see that call made by kaifu but i dont have any way 
to apply that kind of pressure 
pickens said he is more determined to buck the japanese system 
since being told remember pearl harbor and yankee go home 
at koitos annual shareholders meeting last month 
it was very shocking to me to go to a meeting where you own 26 
percent of the company and be told things like that he said 
its obvious the way they feel towards americans they dont want 
anyone seeing how they run their business

a securities analyst fired for making 
neative remarks about donald trumps new casino sued the real 
estate tycoon in federal court tuesday claiming trump made 
defamatory comments about him 
marvin b roffman formerly a vice president with the 
philadelphia brokerage firm janney montomery scott inc is seeking 
more than 2 million in punitive and compensatary damages 
roffman 50 was fired march 23 three days after a negative 
critique in the wall street journal about trumps taj mahal casino 
resort in atlantic city nj his case has raised questions about 
the independence of securities analysts who frequently comment 
about companies and business developments 
roffman told the journal that trumps casino would flourish 
immediately after it opened in april but once the cold winds 
blow from october to february it wont make it the market just 
isnt there 
according to the lawsuit filed in us district court trump 
sent a letter to janney montgomery president norman t wilde that 
said for a long while i have thought of mr roffman as an 
unguided missile 
the lawsuit contends trumps letter contained false and 
defamatory material because roffmans comments were not 
outrageous he is not a unguided missile unprofessional and a 
bad analyst 
martin sobol roffmans attorney said his client believes he 
was fired from his job because he was honest he feels he was 
wronged sobol said roffman declined to comment 
john barry a trump spokesman said the lawsuit has absolutely 
no basis and that trump was free to express himself 
this is still america mr trump is entitled to express his 
opinion he said if mr roffman thought the statements were 
defamatory why isnt he suing the publications in which they 
appear 
the lawsuit quotes publications that reported trumps comments 
about roffman as evidence of defamation 
in the april 2 edition of barrons trump said of roffman 
hes a very unprofessional guy a hair trigger in the may 7 
edition of fortune trump is quoted as saying they got rid of a 
bad analyst a man with little talent the lawsuit said 
trump threatened to sue janney montgomery unless roffman 
publicly retracted the comments or the firm fired the 16year 
veteran securities analyst roffman initially signed a letter of 
apology but withdrew it in a second letter and then was fired 
janney montgomery contended roffman was dismissed because he 
violated company policy by issuing statements to the press that had 
not been cleared or disseminated to the firms clients 
wilde said in a statement that although roffman violated company 
policy about talking to the press he was fired because he 
disobeyed a supervisors orders by sending the second letter to 
trump retracting his apology 
in dismissing mr roffman we took measures to uphold industry 
standards concerning the professional integrity of security 
analysts the statement said 
sobol said roffman also would file a wrongful discharge claim 
against janney montgomery with the new york stock exchange seeking 
arbitration sobol said papers outlining the claim were mailed 
tuesday 
janney montgomery is a wholly owned subsidiary of penn mutual 
life insurance co the firm has 1050 employees and 40 offices 
roffmans firing stirred widespread comment and turned him into 
a highly sought subject for interviews especially after it was 
disclosed in recent weeks that trump faced a cash crunch 
trump made a lastminute deal with bankers june 26 that allowed 
him to meet the 43 million payment to holders of highyield junk 
bonds backing another casino the trump castle

martin marietta corp has sued the intelsat 
consortium over who will pay for the bungled launch of a 157 
million communications satellite 
in the lawsuit filed in us district court martin marrietta 
asks that it not be held liable for the fouled march 14 launch 
involving one of its titan rockets which was sent into a low 
useless orbit 
the company has accused the washingtonbased intelsat of making 
unlawfully coercive demands and says intelsat should be held 
responsible for the mishap 
the contract terms provided that intelsat clearly had the 
financial risk said philip giaramita a spokesman for bethesda 
mdbased martin marietta thats really the heart of the 
matter 
the suit filed friday says intelsat a satellite operating 
company had threatened on july 3 to sue if martin marietta did not 
pay damages for the launch intelsat is expected to argue that 
martin marietta was grossly negligent in conducting the launch 
intelsat spokesman tony trujillo said the consortium would 
comment only in its court reply to the chares which must be made 
within 60 days 
in 1987 martin marietta signed a 112 million contract to 
launch the satellite using a titan booster intelsat paid 
separately for the satellite 
satellite operators often take out commercial insurance against 
a failure but intelsat did not opting instead to set aside funds 
of its own to cover such a contingency 
the rocket lifted off routinely on march 14 but once it reached 
space it failed to separate from the satellite it was stranded in 
a low useless orbit 
intelsat is negotiating with the national aeronautics and space 
administration to have space shuttle astronauts attach a rocket to 
the satellite that would send it up to its proper orbit that would 
cost the company about 90 million 
martin marietta has blamed the failure on faulty electrical 
engineering in its titan booster but contends its financial 
responsibilities ended at liftoff the suit said the contract 
allowed intelsat to request a replacement launch at a stipulated 
price if the first one failed and it has not done so 
the suit said if martin marietta loses the lawsuit if may 
withdraw from the commercial space launch business

a federal jury tuesday convicted usx 
corp and two united steelworkers officials of conspiring to give 
the union officials company pensions in exchange for approval of a 
key labor contract 
usx was convicted of all 14 counts of conspiracy violating 
federal labor law and mail fraud union district 36 director 
thermon phillips and subdirector eb rich each was convicted of 
one count of conspiracy and one count of violating federal labor 
law 
rich 60 was acquitted of 10 counts of mail fraud ten mail 
fraud charges against phillips 62 were dismissed earlier the 
verdict came on the 10th day of deliberations in us district 
court 
usx faces a maximum penalty of 41 million phillips and rich 
each face a maximum 10 years in prison and 500000 in fines at 
sentencing aug 20 
i think it shows the labor community that the public is not 
going to sit still for skulduggery theyre going to demand honest 
upright labor negotiations first assistant us attorney buddy 
kelly said 
usx said it would appeal the verdict to the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals in a statement the company maintained the 
charges were the products of strained and erroneous 
interpretations of complex statutes 
the government claimed at the 17week trial the union officials 
engaged in illegal negotiations in exchange for approval of a work 
contract that cut wages and benefits but allowed usxs fairfield 
works plant in birmingham to reopen 
the government alleged phillips and rich former steel company 
employees illegally negotiated pensions for themselves and four 
other union officials during talks in 1983 
the government said rich received a pension based on about 31 
years of work but only worked there 13 years phillips pension was 
based on about 38 years of employment but he worked for the company 
only from 194651 prosecutors alleged 
defense attorneys contended the pensions were not negotiated 
during the talks and the defendants did not try to conceal them 
they said rich and phillips never made pensions a condition of 
resolving the fairfield negotiations 
in 1984 usx then us steel changed its longstanding policy 
against giving pensions to former employees who became labor 
representatives the company paid more than 300000 in pensions to 
phillips rich and the other four union officers until the practice 
was halted in 1988 
union president lynn williams and the unions top lawyer 
testified that they read and filed a march 1985 us steel letter 
reporting the pension policy change and the granting of six 
pensions to unidentified union officers 
other union representatives testifying for the government said 
they did not learn of the change under which they may have been 
eligible for company pensions until 1987 
the union said in a statement it expected the charges against 
rich and phillips to be overturned on appeal based on numerous 
trial errors williams said the trial was more of an inquisition 
than a search for the truth
