newly born hurricane gustav spun toward the 
northeastern caribbean with 80 mph winds sunday tailed by tropical 
storm hortense in the midatlantic about a thousand miles to the 
east 
the governments of guadeloupe antigua barbuda montserrat 
nevis and st kitts issued hurricane warnings sunday according to 
the national hurricane center in suburban coral gables 
a hurricane watch remained in effect for dominica martinique 
st martin anguilla and surrounding islands said bob sheets 
director of the center 
at 1030 pm edt gustav which reached hurricane strength 
earlier in the day was centered near 157 degrees north latitude 
572 degrees west longitude or about 280 miles eastsoutheast of 
guadeloupe it was moving northwest near 9 mph and was expected to 
maintain that course and speed through noon monday 
maximum sustained winds were near 80 mph and some increase in 
strength was likely during the forecast period the center said 
meanwhile hortense the eighth named storm of the atlantic 
season had gathered top sustained winds of 45 mph and was growing 
stronger its course turning to the north 
at 1030 pm edt hortense was centered near 176 degrees north 
latitude 405 degrees west longitude or about 990 miles west of 
the westernmost cape verde islands it was moving north near 5 mph 
on a course expected to hold through monday morning 
forecaster bob case said the storms were far enough apart not to 
affect each other 
were not seeing interaction between the storms he said 
both storms were born as tropical depressions off the cape verde 
islands on the western tip of africa such storms typical for this 
the busiest time of the atlantic season have been among historys 
worst forecasters note 
case said a tropical wave potential forerunner to a depression 
was shaping up over western africa but wasnt of much concern at 
the moment because of gustav and hortense 
theyre keeping us quite busy he said the two of them 
are plenty 
tropical depressions become named storms when their top 
sustained winds top 39 mph they become hurricanes if those winds 
hit 74 mph

in texas to settle a 5 debt the story goes 
museum curators and other experts discounted the claim 
the fundraising group formed last year had agreed to pay 35 
million if the knife proved genuine but wanted tests to determine 
its age and metal content

were killed in the 13day siege of the alamo legend credits bowie

iraqs ambassador said saturday the wives and 
children of american diplomats who fled kuwait to baghdad are free 
to go but that the diplomats will be treated just like anybody 
else 
summoned to the state department for another us protest 
ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat said we are on the brink of a 
catastrophe american lives are being risked for no reason 
whatsoever 
and yet the iraqi diplomat did not register any direct threat 
to the diplomats or any of the more than 3000 us citizens 
trapped in iraq and kuwait 
specifically almashat said we are not going to use force 
against the us embassy in kuwait where ambassador nathaniel 
howell and a staff of about 10 are defying an order by iraqi 
president saddam hussein to shut down 
we havent touched any embassy there the iraqi said at an 
impromptu news conference after a brief session with david mack a 
deputy assistant secretary of state who had called him in 
iraqi troops appeared outside the us embassy in kuwait city on 
thursday night and according to us officials have blocked entry 
and exit ever since 
us officials said the embassys electricity was cut off 
saturday at about 415 am edt and water was shut off sometime 
later telephone service is sporadic though embassy contact with 
americans in kuwait continues 
a small number of iraqi soldiers remain outside the embassy 
the state department said no attempt has been made by them to 
enter the embassy compound 
almashat said he had no official word on whether that was 
true 
meanwhile us officials said the embassy was operating on 
generator power 
meanwhile the washington post reported in sundays editions in 
a dispatch from kuwait that two americans were detained by iraqi 
troops the paper quoted a spokeswoman at the embassy in kuwait 
city as saying she did not know where the two americans were 
arrested but that they were detained at a local hotel and are 
unharmed 
in washington a state department spokesman who asked to remain 
anonymous said of the report we are not prepared to confirm 
this now 
saddam had ordered the embassy to close on friday and to move 
its functions to the us embassy in baghdad but howell and his 
staff remained to keep in touch with the americans trapped in 
kuwait since iraq invaded the persian gulf country aug 2 
some 100 us diplomats and dependents fled kuwait for iraq late 
thursday arriving in a 33car caravan after more than 19 hours on 
the road 
according to the bush administration their safe passage out of 
the area was assured by iraq 
but while they were en route iraq imposed new regulations 
prohibiting the departure of diplomats whose embassies had not shut 
down as ordered by saddam 
this left the diplomats and their families stranded in the iraqi 
capital 
late friday the iraqi news agency said the dependents would be 
permitted to leave but us officials said they had not been 
notified 
the dependents are going to be released almashat said 
saturday 
in fact he said some of them will be leaving soon 
but asked why the diplomats could not join the 60 or so 
dependents about 30 of them children the diplomat said because 
they dont have diplomatic status they are considered ordinary 
citizens just like anyone else 
he then admonished the four reporters questioning him you 
people should be concerned with the major problem we are on the 
brink of catastrophe unnecessary without any reason american 
lives are being risked for no reason whatsoever 
a us official speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
macks conversation with almashat focused on the welfare of 
americans and other foreign nationals who are in iraq and kuwait 
including their very basic freedom to leave those countries if 
they desire to do so

the united nations on saturday gave the worlds navies the right 
to use force to stop vessels trading with iraq and baghdad cut 
supplies to some embassies in kuwait but did not carry out its 
threat to close them by force 
iraqs us ambassador meanwhile said the families of american 
diplomats who fled kuwait to baghdad can leave but that the 
diplomats will be detained he also said iraq will not use force 
against the us embassy in kuwait 
in another un initiative the world bodys secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar announced on saturday he has invited the 
iraqi foreign minister to open urgent talks aimed at resolving the 
persian gulf crisis 
perez de cuellar said the talks could begin this week in new 
york or geneva but he did not say whether iraq had accepted the 
offer 
even as the security council took steps to enforce its 
sanctions evidence mounted saturday that the embargo is already 
squeezing iraqs citizens 
reports filtering out of baghdad described panic buying 
shortages of cooking oil flour and fruit the start of a national 
rationing program and housetohouse sweeps by militiamen hunting 
food hoarders 
the official iraqi news agency reported that hundreds of iraqi 
children gathered outside the us embassy in baghdad on saturday 
carrying signs complaining that the international trade sanctions 
are depriving them of milk the protest was likely to have had 
official iraqi sanction 
the united states and its allies praised the un security 
council for voting early saturday to allow military action to 
uphold the embargo aimed at punishing iraq for invading kuwait on 
aug 2 
iraq has evaded resolutions of the security council and 
thumbed its nose at all humanity us ambassador thomas r 
pickering said following the unanimous vote at the united nations 
this has prompted the council to take one of the most important 
decisions in its history 
the white house said the vote further strengthens the world 
resolve to force iraq out of kuwait although us warships have 
been shadowing iraqi vessels in the persian gulf they have not 
forced them to stop 
president bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft 
said the united nations has given the bush administration a free 
hand to enforce the economic embargo on iraq but he sidestepped a 
question of how much force america was willing to use 
scowcroft said on cable news network that the un action 
means no commerce should go in and out of iraq by sea and that 
means that vessels will be stopped and inspected effective 
immediately 
iraqs un ambassador abdul amir alanbari immediately 
denounced the security council vote and said it could lead to war 
this use of force by the united states or any of its allies or 
puppets will lead inevitably to a number of explosions which will 
burn all in their path he said at the united nations in new york 
iraq meanwhile carried out its threat to cut supplies to 
embassies in kuwait shutting off power at the italian british 
austrian and french missions power and water at the us east 
german and norwegian embassies and power water and telephone 
service at the japanese mission 
italys foreign ministry said that iraqi soldiers were knocking 
down a wall at the french mission in kuwait in an apparent effort 
to cut off the water supply there but france could not immediately 
confirm the report 
but iraqi troops stationed outside the canadian embassy 
retreated saturday canadian press news agency said 
iraqi soldiers some armed with machine guns and mortars 
remained outside many embassies in kuwait city but made no effort 
to remove diplomats by force according to reports reaching foreign 
ministries in several countries 
us officials said an electric generator was being used at the 
us embassy and that other supplies remained adequate for 
ambassador nathaniel howell and his staff of about 10 diplomats 
thousands of american troops and dozens of us warships are 
within striking distance of iraq and kuwait but president bush has 
given no indication how he will respond if iraq attempts to overrun 
the us embassy 
earlier this week the united states reduced its staff at the 
embassy in kuwait by sending about 100 us diplomats and 
dependents to baghdad where they have been stranded iraqs us 
ambassador said in washington saturday that the wives and children 
of the american diplomats can leave 
the dependents are going to be released said mohamed 
almashat who had been summoned to the state department for 
another us protest 
some of them will be leaving soon however he said the 
diplomats will be treated just like anybody else meaning they 
will be detained he said that although iraq and the united states 
are on the brink of a catastrophe baghdad is not going to 
use force against the us embassy in kuwait 
although international law says embassies must remain inviolable 
even in times of war baghdad ordered all embassies in kuwait to 
close and threatened to detain as hostages any diplomatic personnel 
who defy the decree 
the many other countries that have refused to close their 
embassies include canada sweden romania hungary spain greece 
bangladesh switzerland poland czechoslovakia and yugoslavia 
moscow has evacuated its embassy but says it remains technically 
open 
many governments believe that closing the missions could be 
interpreted as the first step toward recognition of iraqs claim of 
sovereignty over kuwait 
as the embassy standoff continued 96 austrian hostages were 
freed in iraq an austrian official said austrian president kurt 
waldheim secured their release in a meeting with iraqi president 
saddam hussein in baghdad saturday 
meanwhile japan announced that some of its nationals had been 
rounded up 
and two more americans were detained by iraqi troops the 
washington post quoted a us embassy spokeswoman in kuwait city as 
reporting saturday it was not clear when they were detained or 
where the spokeswoman said the two were being held at a hotel and 
were unharmed 
a state department spokesman said of the report we are not 
prepared to confirm this now 
waldheim said later in amman jordan that he had raised the 
issue of us and other western citizens stranded in iraq and 
kuwait with saddam but had received no commitments from the iraqi 
leader 
about 21000 westerners including 3000 americans are being 
held hostage in iraq and kuwait

been stationed in the us embassy in kuwait an additional 54 or 
55 personnel mostly men who had been stationed in kuwait are 
still in baghdad and we have not secured their release ms 
heileman said 
earlier this week iraq gave a friday deadline for nations to 
close their embassies in kuwait claiming its oilrich neighbor as 
part of iraqi territory iraq annexed kuwait six days after its 
aug 2 invasion of the emirate 
but the united states most european nations and many other 
countries have refused to close their embassies in kuwait city 
instead reducing personnel there to a minimum 
the us embassy sent about 100 diplomats and their dependents 
to baghdad where they were stranded when iraqi president saddam 
hussein reversed an earlier promise and refused to let them leave 
but on saturday iraqs us ambassador said in washington that 
the wives and children of the american diplomats would be allowed 
to leave

irans foreign minister said sunday that 
foreigners fleeing iraq and kuwait can do so through iran 
according to tehran radio 
the report came after jordan and turkey complained that they are 
overburned by thousands of refugees and said they may have to close 
their borders 
syria iraqs main arab rival announced on saturday that it 
will allow foreigners to cross the syrian border with iraq 
most of the people who have fled iraq and kuwait since baghdad 
invaded its oilrich neighbor on aug 2 have entered jordan 
forcing it to feed and shelter them until they can afford to 
continue on to their home countries 
iran has condemned the invasion of kuwait and said it will 
enforce an international trade embargo against iraq 
but iran also recently settled disputes over territory and 
prisoners of war left unsettled by its long war with iraq and that 
allowed iraq to transfer thousands of troops from the iranian 
border and move them to occupied kuwait 
the tehran radio broadcast monitored in nicosia quoted foreign 
minister ali akbar velayati as saying that for humanitarian reasons 
iran agrees to foreign evacuees from iraq and kuwait transiting 
in its territory 
iran shares a 730milelong border with iraq 
velayati agreed to let foreigners leave through iran after 
philippines foreign minister raul manglapus who is visiting 
tehran asked that thousands of his countrymen trapped in iraq and 
kuwait be allowed to cross into iran 
velayati did not specify if tehrans offer included only asians 
or whether thousands of western hostages in iraq will be able to 
cross the border too 
tensions between iran and iraq have lessened since baghdad 
settled a border dispute with tehran last month pulled out troops 
from occupied iranian territory and initiated an exchange of 
prisoners of war 
however the border is still heavily fortified on both sides 
and foreigners will likely be allowed to cross only at certain 
points 
about 50000 iranians living in kuwait have returned home 
through the iraniraq border and hundreds more continue to stream 
in every day 
food water and a place to sleep are provided for the refugees 
according to the tehran radio report

with austrian president kurt waldheim whether he would agree to 
meet with the united nations secretarygeneral in iraq 
of course saddam replied the un secretarygeneral is 
always welcome although saddam did not mention perez de cuellar 
by name it was assumed he was extending the invitation to him 
perez de cuellar called for peace talks hours after the un 
security council authorized the use of military force to uphold the 
trade embargo imposed on iraq in a bid to force it to withdraw from 
kuwait 
i believe that after the resolutions adopted by the security 
council the time has come for the secretarygeneral to begin 
diplomatic efforts to alleviate the present crisis in the gulf in 
all aspects through the process of dialogue perez de cuellar 
said 
in kennebunkport maine white house spokesman roman popadiuk 
said saturday he had not heard about perez de cuellars proposal 
but that washington welcomes a discussion by all un members in 
the context of the complete and immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait 
the saddam news conference which was broadcast by cable news 
netrowk came at the end of a oneday visit by waldheim who flew 
out of baghdad with 100 austrian nationals who had been stranded in 
the country 
about 3000 americans and 4500 britons remain stranded in 
kuwait

roughly 60000 american soldiers airmen and 
sailors have moved to battle stations in the persian gulf since 
president bush ordered us firepower into the area to thwart 
iraqs saddam hussein sources say 
in addition to the massive troop movement the pentagon has 
built a virtual armada in the regions seas and rushed in hundreds 
of fighter jets and support aircraft 
the deployment the largest since the vietnam war is far from 
complete 
within a few weeks about 45000 marines are expected to have 
arrived in the area by then the total us combat force in the 
region may number well over 100000 military sources said last 
week 
the final elements of the 7th marine expeditionary brigade were 
arriving in saudi arabia over the weekend after a 7000mile flight 
from their home base at twentynine palms calif and the 1st 
marine expeditionary brigade was heading for the gulf from its home 
base at kaneohe bay hawaii one source said 
a third marine unit the 4th marine expeditionary brigade from 
camp lejeune nc was preparing for deployment but was not 
expected to arrive for at least another two weeks 
over the past week the bush administration added significantly 
to not only the us ground forces in saudi arabia but also the air 
and sea power in the area including 
a squadron of 22 f117a stealth fighterbombers the 
radarevading planes on their first overseas deployment are 
specially designed to operate at night they can slip deep behind 
enemy lines to lead an offensive strike on vital targets 
the aircraft carrier uss saratoga arrived in the red sea by way 
of the suez canal it is accompanied by the aegis missile cruiser 
philippine sea and the missile cruiser biddle it is to be joined 
soon by three other members of its battle group the missile 
destroyer sampson and frigates elmer montgomery and thomas c hart 
the aircraft carrier uss eisenhower which had been on patrol in 
the red sea headed back into the mediterranean 
the aviation brigade of the 101st airborne division an air 
assault unit based at fort campbell ky began arriving in the 
saudi desert it is armed with apache helicopters the backbone of 
the armys tankkilling arsenal the aircraft are equipped with 
laserguided missiles that can hit moving targets at night 
the first deployments of us forces from nato bases in europe 
elements of the us army europes 7th medical command based in 
west germany headed for saudi arabia as did c130e hercules 
transport airplanes of the 435th tactical airlift wing from west 
germany 
also the strategic air command acknowledged saturday that b52 
bombers were dispatched overseas two weeks ago from two undisclosed 
us air bases 
bush last week authorized the pentagon to call up military 
reserves for the first time in 20 years defense secretary dick 
cheney on thursday approved plans to activate as many as 46700 
members of the national guard and armed forces reserves and the 
first callups came friday 
cheney said nearly 10000 reserves would be called to active 
duty by the end of august and the total would reach 46700 by oct 
1 
most of the reserves are to be sent to the arabian peninsula 
others will fill vacancies left by us troops deploying to the 
middle east from the united states or europe 
one of the least publicized features of the enormous 
mobilization of us forces is the marine corps operation 
for years the marines have organized what they call marine 
prepositioned ships at three strategic points on the globe along 
the atlantic coast near diego garcia in the indian ocean and near 
guam the idea is that in time of crisis any or all of these three 
units each with four or five ships could move quickly into an 
area of conflict with enough firepower and supplies to last 30 days 
the marine prepositioned ships from diego garcia and guam were 
among the first forces to get the word to head for saudi arabia 
the first group took just six days to get there 
its been a very substantial projection of combat force and 
this is important both air and ground said marine corps lt 
col stuart wagner a pentagon spokesman 
among the weapons each marine expeditionary brigade brings to 
the field are m1 tanks fa18 attack aircraft 115mm howitzers 
and a6e ground attack airplanes 
some army airborne units were deployed quickly to saudi arabia 
but they were unable to bring as much firepower and supplies with 
them as the marines which are virtually selfsustaining in food 
water fuel trucks weapons and ammunition

president bush and iraqi leader saddam hussein 
are both learning that cultivating the right image through 
television can be a tricky business 
saddams lesson came in his failed attempt to ease international 
fears about the safety of western hostages in iraq and kuwait 
instead he provoked outrage by releasing a videotape that showed 
him patting the heads of cringing british boys 
the relentlessly vacationing bush set out to show that the 
persian gulf crisis wasnt holding him hostage in the white house 
but he has faced criticism that his golfplaying and motorboating 
in kennebunkport maine were inappropriate when us soldiers were 
preparing for war along the kuwaitisaudi border 
saddam hussein must have figured that these tapes would play 
wonderfully all over the world said philip robbins chairman of 
the journalism department at george washington university 
the reaction is almost completely contrary to that 
robbins said if it was meant to change world opinion i think 
its failed miserably 
its pretty clear that this was total theatrics that they had 
put together to win the sympathy of some people somewhere said 
rodger streitmatter an american university specialist in 
presidential public relations 
but he added it certainly is not going to convince very 
many americans that this is a humanitarian undertaking 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater also denounced saddams 
venture into video 
the iraqi film of saddam hussein posing with british hostages 
shows the cynical and inhumane view that he holds for human life 
fitzwater said to hold men women and children up for viewing as 
targets for destruction is sick beyond expression 
it only serves to confirm and justify the world condemnation 
of iraqs aggressive ambitions 
bushs problems stem from his determination to avoid appearing 
to be a hostage in the white house of the middle east situation 
president jimmy carter was accused of that after the iranian siege 
of the us embassy in tehran in 1979 and the taking of american 
hostages 
bush proceeded with vacation plans even as he ordered the 
deployment of us forces to the gulf region and continued frequent 
telephone contact with other world leaders 
reasonably thinking people would realize that this man 
continues to be in touch with whats going on in the world and with 
communication the way it is today could react to anything that 
happened said streitmatter 
but we tend to remember more what we see than what we 
hear and what we see is him playing golf he said here we 
have these images of these troops preparing to go off to 
potential combat and leaving their families behind juxtaposed 
against these images of our president playing golf 
robbins said bush apparently was trying to present a picture 
of the presidency being able to handle the situation without 
anything abnormal taking place so everybody should stay calm cool 
and collected but i dont think its worked that way 
i think most of the public when they see the troops going 
to saudi arabia and the reservists being called up and the 
discomfort the downright inconvenience and the possible fate that 
all of these service people are meeting i dont think they like it 
very much robbins said i think its going to turn out to be a 
publicrelations disaster not just a mistake 
streitmatter noting that bushs golfing had sparked criticism 
from women demonstrators in jordan said international television 
added a further dimension to the problem 
at a time when were dealing an international crisis and we 
need some of these other nations dealing with this crisis with us 
it does make sense for the white house to be more sensitive to 
cultural differences he said 
stephen hess of the brookings institution a former adviser to 
democratic and republican presidents said however that bushs 
publicrelations mistake was only of the most modest sort 
it really isnt that troubling out in the hinterlands thats 
what were finding out hess said 
george bush is notably not a frivolous man he said 
nobody thinks that he isnt paying proper attention sure he 
shouldnt have answered reporters questions while he was on the 
golf links and maybe they should have made greater efforts to 
pretend that presidents are working night and day while theyre on 
vacation but george bush is doing what a president is supposed 
to be doing 
streitmatter said longterm damage from bushs image problems 
would occur only if a disaster such as a number of soldiers being 
killed were seen to coincide with his playing golf 
this sort of thing is so ephemeral that theres no way its 
going to stick to the ribs said hess the president comes back 
to washington in another 10 days and thats the end of this as an 
issue whats really hurting him is not so much the fact that 
hes on vacation but all we ever seem to see is him on vacation

east germany is about to disappear 
to be swallowed up by its rich western neighbor and the universal 
enthusiasm of a few months ago has waned 
polls say the vast majority of east germans favor unification 
which is barely a month away but appearances dont always 
reinforce that conclusion 
the we are one people banners that hung from trees 
factories and homes during the prounity frenzy of early 1990 are 
gone 
there are no cheering crowds and no convoys of motorists 
blasting their horns in anticipation of full unification on oct 3 
reality has set in especially since the economic merger 
officially began in july the issue foremost in the minds of east 
germans is how to tackle the huge challenges facing them as their 
crumbling economy is absorbed by west germany 
some show a decided lack of eagerness for unity especially in 
leipzig birthplace of the uprising that ended 40 years of 
stalinist rule less than a year ago 
maybe the gdr east germany could have survived as a newly 
democratized country said maria chudoba who tends bar at the 
cappuccino cafe in leipzig but now its too late to turn back 
heinz weisse 74 and his 70yearold wife gertrud loading 
bales of hay onto a cart outside weimar said they wouldnt have 
minded seeing east germany continue as a democracy 
were happy about unity but it was not a necessary 
development said weisse a retired hairdresser theres a good 
side and bad side to everything 
he said he and his wife had a relatively good life even under 
communism and as pensioners had been allowed to travel outside 
the country 
we had our little house here and we were born here so we 
always came back weisse said 
most east germans seem to see unification as their only 
salvation but have come to realize it will not be an overnight 
cure for such problems as the high unemployment brought on by the 
july 1 economic union 
we had our celebrations last year when the berlin wall came 
down said gisela oswald a 63yearold retired opera singer in 
weimar an east german cultural center 
were glad unity is coming but weve got to get to work now 
on some important problems like putting the economy in order 
east german cities are decaying the bottom has dropped out of 
industrial production and unemployment is soaring 
most of east germanys problems require money in huge amounts 
leipzig has a desperate housing shortage crumbling public and 
commercial buildings and an antiquated sewerage system that has 
become a health hazard 
unification and the resulting west german funds undoubtedly will 
help solve the economic problems over the next few years but also 
will introduce problems new to east germany 
prostitution will come with the joblessness because people 
need money said peter fernau chief of detectives in bitterfeld 
an industrial city were also worried about heroin and the 
possible appearance of criminal gangs there will be totally new 
dimensions to crime 
several aspects of life will change after unity 
west germanys legal system will be extended to the east 
bringing in an entirely new code of laws 
my officers are going to have to learn learn learn fernau 
said 
many east germans fear west germans will make all the decisions 
about their future 
a recent poll by the west german magazine stern indicated 88 
percent of east germans support unification but 70 percent were 
disappointed by how it has been managed the process has been 
largely orchestrated by helmut kohl west germanys chancellor 
with the two germanys united east germans will find themselves 
in stiff competition with west germans jobs and business 
opportunities they worry about coping 
we never learned to persist in the face of adversity because 
in the old system that was of no use said ms oswald the opera 
singer this is something we must learn 
but we also have many good qualities we tend to be very 
closeknit and helpful to each other and thats something we dont 
want to lose she said 
peter heyroth lutheran pastor in bitterfeld said the way unity 
has been managed is demoralizing many people 
they see the trucks rumbling into town at 6 am with goods 
from west germany while goods made in this country go unsold he 
said they see prices climbing and they feel like their job 
training was worthless 
in the small city of saalfeld on the eastern edge of the 
thuringian forest a former member of the disbanded communist 
secret police pondered his future 
he has a new job but things arent going well 
people hoot at me behind my back he said its really 
very difficult 
i was never involved in any heavy intelligence just checking 
passports and that kind of thing but im ashamed of the corrupt 
government we supported said the former agent who asked that 
his name not be used 
then seeming to speak for many east germans he said sure 
mistakes were made during the communist period but should four 
decades of our past really be flushed down the sewer

the barefoot rifletoting 
guerrillas occupying this eastern village hardly seem a match for 
the crisply uniformed government soldiers down the road with 
welloiled machine guns 
but here and elsewhere in sri lanka the tamil tiger rebels 
many of them only teenagers are engaging the army in a long and 
savage civil war 
step by step we will defeat the army said a tiger commander 
who has taken the name newton that seems unlikely in the view of 
observers and western diplomats but the army also seems incapable 
of beating the ragtag guerrillas 
in the north the government launched a major offensive last 
week to relieve jaffna fort a 300yearold colonial outpost 
besieged by the rebels for 10 weeks 
after initial gains the advance bogged down under heavy rebel 
mortar fire and machinegun fusillades from bunkers the government 
said 
on sunday military officials said troops overran the 
guerrillas after a threehour battle on mandativu island a 
stepping stone to the starshaped fortress 
but army troops have failed to meet their aim of reaching the 
trapped 250man garrison in the fort the governments strongest 
outpost on the rebelcontrolled jaffna peninsula 
on the eastern front the guerrillas have once again yielded the 
main towns and most of the roads to the army they have faded into 
the jungles and the villages from where they have launched 
hitandrun raids and mined roads for the past seven years 
newton asked about his tactical objectives in the east had a 
simple answer we are going to kill a large number of army he 
said 
newton and two other tiger commanders known as karikalan and 
nithi spoke in a bare room in the dusty village of karadiyanaru 
on the main road leading to batticaloa 170 miles southeast of 
jaffna 
earlier government officials had earlier claimed all three had 
been killed 
the rebels were contacted by walkietalkie from a checkpoint 
manned by a dozen barefoot teenagers who wore wore fatigue shirts 
and ammunition belts stuffed with rifle clips grenades and a 
toothbrush for cleaning weapons 
the civil war erupted in 1983 over tamil complaints that they 
were suppressed by the sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the 
population and control the government tamils make up 18 percent of 
sri lankas 16 million people 
the tigers who demand independence for their ethnic minority 
are the only tamil group continuing the fight others gave up their 
weapons in 1987 and agreed to negotiate for an autonomous region in 
the north and east 
after a 13month ceasefire the tigers resumed the war on june 
11 by storming 30 police and army barracks in the east 
villagers in karadiyanaru appeared unhappy over the presence of 
the rebels food is scarce commerce has stopped and the area is 
virtually cut off from the rest of the region army patrols 
occasionally come through firing into roadside homes 
all the poor people in this area get no help from the 
government or from anyone else said one village elder 
an army officer commanding a checkpoint 12 miles to the west of 
the village claimed only about 100 tigers were scattered in the 
bush and the rest had fled to the north 
the army checkpoint had four small armored vehicles and the 
troops looked sharp and welltrained 
newton asked whether his forces were retreating only laughed 
about 15 tigers were seen in and near the village 
the tigers heaviest weapons are mortars and most equipment is 
stolen or stripped from the corpses of army casualties newton 
proudly displayed a homemade mortar from a secret armory 
the liberation tigers for tamil eelam grew out of a student 
movement in the jaffna area in the 1970s and emerged into the open 
as a guerrilla force in 1983 
the group is led by veluppillai prabhakaran a school dropout 
who catapulted to the groups leadership when he assassinated the 
mayor of jaffna in 1975 
prabhakaran demands absolute discipline his forces are 
forbidden to smoke or drink he approves every major operation 
according to a source close to the tigers 
western diplomats believe a political settlement is the only 
answer to the war but it may be a long time in coming 
the government has to knock back the tigers a bit 
militarily said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
they cant defeat the tigers or wipe them out the diplomat 
said there will have to be a stalemate for long enough for the 
war fever to wear off

iraq has jammed the voice of americas arabic 
language broadcasts since the persian gulf crisis began but voa 
says the radio programs still can be heard 
in a message sent to us embassies in the gulf region last 
week the agency said it was possible to overcome the iraqi jamming 
in several ways 
embassies were urged to advise listeners who did not hear the 
voa broadcasts on the usual frequency to tune around in the same 
shortwave band because the frequency might have been changed to 
avoid jamming 
also the message said the arabic broadcasts emanate from relay 
stations that are west of iraq and thus are in daylight while the 
iraqi jamming stations are in darkness since the stations still in 
daylight can use higher frequencies listeners were advised to tune 
to the highest frequency after sunset 
voice of america said also that its arabic language broadcasts 
to north africa generally are not jammed and can be heard in the 
gulf region although not as well as those directed toward the 
middle east 
listen in different locations even within the same house or 
apartment the message said shortwave reception can differ 
greatly from within the same room one location may favor voa more 
than the jamming signal 
voa spokeswoman judy jamison said iraq had not previously jammed 
the broadcasts but began doing so within a few days after its aug 
2 invasion of kuwait utilizing a definite warbling sound 
despite the jamming ms jamison said a determined listener 
can hear the broadcasts 
voas english language broadcasts are not jammed she said

elmer booze strides onto the concert stage for 
another virtuoso performance but nobody applauds he shares the 
spotlight but never takes a bow his name doesnt even appear in 
the program 
so what the guy spends most of the evening staring at the sheet 
music and wetting his thumb and forefinger big deal 
any pianist though will say that elmer booze really is a big 
deal he is a professional page turner one of the most 
indispensable and most anonymous figures in the musical world 
booze 57 a small softspoken man who wears goldrimmed 
glasses has turned the pages of musical scores for aaron copland 
rudolf serkin andre watts leon fleisher and bella davidovich and 
hundreds of other musicians for nearly a quartercentury 
he turned pages for opera singer leontyne prices accompanist at 
a white house recital for president carter hes been a consultant 
and resident page turner for the annual summer newport ri music 
festival for the past 14 years 
hes a regular at concert series at the national gallery of art 
the canadian embassy the kennedy center and the library of 
congress in washington he has flown to new york and london to sit 
at the elbow of concert pianists who insisted that only elmer booze 
would do 
an accomplished pianist himself with music degrees from two 
universities booze is content to labor in the shadows of the 
keyboard giants 
a colleague at the library of congress where booze works during 
the day as a senior reference librarian in the music division 
proudly calls him a worldrenowned page turner booze modestly 
dismisses such extravagant praise 
for me its a job that anybody can do he said but 
apparently thats not entirely true ive talked to pianists who 
say they cant turn pages it makes them very nervous 
by contrast booze sits on the edge of his chair with 
unflappable ease as the pianist struggles through stormy 
fortissimos and crashing arpeggios 
pianists want someone with them in their greatest moment of 
need when theyve gotten to the last note on the page he said 
thats the moment when booze shifts into a low crouch and with 
a lightning thrust of the arm flips to the next page and returns 
to his seat his movements are so unobtrusive that one pianist 
calls him the ghost 
a good page turner must be skilled in reading a musical score 
booze says and a rehearsal is helpful to become familiar with the 
pianists eccentricities 
does he memorize the score chamber music is rarely played from 
memory booze says are the pianists jerks and nods a signal to 
turn the page or is he simply getting carried away with the music 
are the pages old and brittle do they stick together 
onstage he says a page turner should keep his eyes on the 
music and maintain a certain decorum to put the pianist at ease 
if theres panic in your eyes you can believe the pianist 
will panic too he said the last thing he needs is a spastic 
page turner 
despite the page turners best efforts disasters do happen 
booze recalls the nightmarish evening of the missing paper clip 
his pianist had promised in the dressing room of the kennedy 
center concert hall to insert a paper clip in the score of a 
devilishly complex work by franz liszt for two pianos at the point 
when booze was supposed to turn back 20 pages for a repeat in the 
second movement the paper clip wasnt there 
it was something to behold he said he was going like a 
bat out of hell his arms were in my way and mine were in his 
trying to find the exact page both pianists stopped playing and 
the whole thing came to a screeching halt it was not a good show 
booze has left his tuxedo jacket unbuttoned during concerts ever 
since he rose from his chair to turn a page for aaron copland and a 
button popped onto the keyboard while the composer was performing 
at the library of congress 
booze turned another anxious moment into a tour de force that 
garnered the first and only ovation he has ever received from an 
audience 
when he and a pianist took their seats at the newport festival 
they discovered that the pianos music rack had been removed and 
was nowhere to be found so booze became a human music rack 
holding up photocopies of each page of the score 
when the piece was finished the festival president leaped to 
her feet lets all clap for elmer she shouted and the page 
turner shyly emerged from the shadows to accept his acclaim

the mayor calls courtrooms in this city a 
bastion of inefficiency but justice no longer will be delayed if 
a fasttrack program continues to cut into heavy courtroom 
backlogs supporters say 
expected to cut a 12200case backlog by 41 percent this year 
its a glimmer of hope for city courts police and prisons which a 
blueribbon task force characterized earlier this year as at the 
edge of a precipice 
optimism has been buoyed in some quarters by four reports this 
year that recommended a new courthouse more prison cells a 
professional court administrator and other changes 
i see light said a leo levin a university of pennsylvania 
law professor and chairman of the 16member philadelphia criminal 
justice task force that produced one of the reports i refuse to 
see the absence of light 
richard f moore projects management coordinator for the citys 
justice facilities and system improvement strategy program said 
that when the reports appeared everybody simply condemned 
everybodys report 
however it seemed that once everybody got all that out of 
their system everybody started reading these reports he said 
things that we wrote started popping up in various proposed 
solutions 
skeptics say philadelphias justice system is so mired in 
politics it can never change 
the fact is that government in philadelphia historically and 
to some extent today operates in a culture of nepotism favoritism 
and corruption said gerald m caplan a law professor at george 
washington university and staff director for a 1987 report on the 
philadelphia police department 
the courts have been engaged in a running battle with city 
government over construction of a new courthouse and who should pay 
the costs of court staff 
our courts which should serve as a bulwark of equity are 
instead a mecca of patronage mayor w wilson goode said last 
week they should stand as a monument of progress but are 
instead a bastion of inefficiency 
he has called for sweeping court reforms before the courthouse 
is built 
an audit conducted as part of a judges lawsuit seeking more 
city funds concluded the courts had enough money to perform their 
constitutional mission but said more money could cut backlogs 
the delays now tolerated are excessive by any standard 
the audit said 
common pleas court had a 10month backlog of criminal cases and 
a 27month backlog of civil cases at the time the audit urged more 
accountability for judges and less control by lawyers of the pace 
of proceedings 
yet a cooperative effort begun jan 2 by prosecutors public 
defenders and common pleas court drew praise in the audit and other 
reports it was intended to speed the processing of less serious 
felonies such as retail theft auto theft forgery and arson 
the backlog is projected to fall to 7263 by dec 31 from 12199 
at the end of last year according to the district attorneys 
office at that rate the backlog would be gone by april 1992 
the program allows defendants to enter guilty pleas earlier in 
the court process than previously to combine pleas if facing more 
than one charge and to reach trial sooner if they plead innocent 
it will be attempted with major felonies come autumn 
this program benefits everyone by eliminating unnecessary 
postponements and by providing trial listings only to those cases 
which cannot be disposed through appropriate plea arrangements 
district attorney ronald d castille said 
another bright spot may be found in plans to expand a 125inmate 
holding cell area on the seventh floor of city hall an average of 
280 prisoners are jammed daily behind plexiglas panels to await 
court hearings 
it looks like a way station to hell when you see the bodies 
lined up in there said allen m hornblum chief of staff since 
may for the sheriffs department 
by december several nearby offices now used for inmate 
psychiatric exams will be converted into more holding cells he 
said 
it will benefit the people we put in the cells as well as the 
deputies who guard them hornblum said its gotten to the 
point where something very explosive could happen that would affect 
public safety in a very serious way 
more crowding exists in the citys four prisons which have a 
federal court cap on population of 3750 but typically have 5000 
to 5200 inmates 
the city was ordered in july to pay 20000 in fines a day 
because of its failure to add more guards nurses and social 
workers and meet other conditions required under a separate lawsuit 
prisons commissioner j patrick gallagher who was hired in 
1989 sees construction of 500 new cells this fall as the beginning 
of the rehabilitation and replacement of prison buildings dating 
from 1893

more than a million israeli schoolchildren will 
get an intensive course in the use of gas masks and other ways of 
surviving chemical warfare to prepare for a possible iraqi attack 
officials said sunday 
the program to begin when school starts sept 2 follows 
threats earlier this year by iraqi president saddam hussein to 
attack israel with chemical weapons if an israeli nuclear attack is 
aimed at iraq 
the children will be instructed how to put on their gas masks 
and walk up to the upper floors of the school to previously sealed 
off classrooms ran levine deputy director general of the 
education ministry told israel radio 
according to officials the instruction will be given to all 
israeli students both jews and arabs between age 5 and 18 
some 5000 teachers will take a course on using the protective 
equipment two teachers from each school will then complete 
instruction for the students by sept 20 each school will receive 
a videotape and 25 gas masks for demonstrations officials said 
dr avigdor klingman the education ministrys coordinator for 
crisis intervention said the course also is designed to quiet 
childrens fears about gas masks 
a child who thinks that he cant wear a mask because it is too 
scary then puts it on with the help of his teacher paints with 
it or does exercises with it then sees that the devil is not so 
bad klingman said 
gas masks will not be handed out at schools but will be 
distributed to families through neighborhood civil defense offices 
despite the recent crisis israeli authorities have decided not 
to distribute the masks to the public now for fear of causing panic 
or sending a wrong signal to iraq 
saddam first warned he would use chemical weapons against israel 
last april during the current crisis he has threatened to attack 
israel in response to a us military strike but he has not 
specifically mentioned chemical weapons 
bomb drills have always been part of israels school curriculum 
in the past four years instruction on protection against 
chemical warfare has been introduced at some 250 middle and high 
schools this year the program is being expanded to all schools

in his first public condemnation 
of iraq pope john paul ii on sunday denounced saddam husseins 
detention of foreigners praying for those unjustly kept far from 
their homeland 
in the first weeks following the aug 2 iraqi invasion of 
kuwait the pontiff made no public statements about the crisis 
on wednesday speaking to a small group of japanese buddhists 
the pope alluded to the crisis for the first time saying peace was 
being threatened although he did not mention any geographical 
area the reference to the persian gulf was clear 
on sunday the pope specifically cited the crisis following his 
noontime prayer from the balcony of his summer palace in the hills 
outside rome where pilgrims were gathered for his blessing 
on this day of the lord i feel the duty to invite you to pray 
for peace in the persian gulf where recently a truly worrisome 
situation has developed the pope said 
we have been witnesses to grave violations of international 
rights and of the un charter as well as of ethical principles 
that must prevail among all peoples he said 
the mistrust of one side versus another is dramatically 
increasing and international order constructed with so much effort 
and at the sacrifice of so many human lives is gravely 
threatened john paul continued 
the pontiff prayed for peace in the entire middle east asking 
god to enlighten those who control the fates of peoples so that 
they will find fair solutions for the existing problems and make 
the star of peace shine strongly on the tried peoples of the 
persian gulf as on all the peoples of the middle east above all 
those who suffer in lebanon and in palestine 
the pontiff ended with a prayer to the virgin mary for the 
foreigners prevented from leaving iraq and kuwait 
mary queen of peace intercede for us and above all for those 
who suffer because they are unjustly kept far from their homeland 
lord give us peace 
saddam has said foreigners caught in iraq and kuwait will be 
used as human shields to protect key iraqi installations about 
21000 of them are westerners including 3000 americans and 3000 
britons

rolex watches gilded badges of wealth and 
luxury have become an emblem of violence and death as robbers who 
covet the expensive timepieces are killing their owners for them 
police say 
sam sabbah was meeting his wife and a painter in his new beverly 
hills home last june when an intruder fatally shot him and took his 
rolex 
a few days later west los angeles transmission shop owner 
melvin thompson broke with his usual routine and wore his rolex to 
work intending to take it to a jeweler a robber hit at closing 
taking the watch and cash and shooting thompson to death 
this month nursery owner donald mckinsey hung on to his 10000 
watch during a robbery and was shot to death by gunmen who had 
posed as customers 
a rolex watch can range in price from about 1000 to more than 
20000 some of the 18karat gold timepieces are encrusted with 
diamonds its not the watch the robbers want but rather the money 
it commands 
the police division covering los angeles affluent west side 
dealt with 49 rolex robberies from september to july beverly hills 
has been averaging one a month according to police lt robert 
curtis 
police say no one individual or group is responsible there have 
been arrests but watch robberies continue 
sometimes the victims were followed home from a shopping mall or 
other public place where an expensive watch on a wrist could be 
spotted police say 
in the mckinsey murder however the killers came to the nursery 
and discussed renting plants then returned the next day to do the 
robbery 
nursery office manager ken steller said later that mckinsey knew 
of the watch robberies but continued to wear the timepiece 
it was his signature steller said 
car salesman bob gordon of santa monica thinks similarly of his 
17750 rolex 
i love that watch its a sign of my success he said but 
i dont think i can wear it certainly not to work its too 
dangerous 
gordon immediately handed the watch over to three robbers who 
entered his office aug 16 a gun was pointed at his heart but the 
trio left him unharmed a police pursuit ended with three arrests 
and the watch was recovered 
last week the district attorneys office charged eric jones 
23 his brother derrick jones 20 and isaac williams 21 with the 
gordon robbery 
williams was also charged with a similar robbery that occurred 
the day before in beverly hills a rolex watch and 140000 in 
jewelry were taken 
those were only the latest arrests los angeles county sheriffs 
detectives and south bay police seized two men in may in a probe of 
watch robberies in which victims were often approached in parking 
structures 
a rolex robbery in december led to the arrest of two other men 
in redondo beach the investigation encompassed similar holdups in 
affluent rolling hills estates and palos verdes estates 
its not clear in every case the robber knew he was getting a 
rolex los angeles police detective dan andrews notes there are 
other kinds of valuable watches and that its the money behind 
the watch thats the target 
andrews investigated the mckinsey murder as well as the killing 
a year ago of restaurateur andre coffyn at a westside bistro 
coffyn was chatting with customers on a patio when a gunman 
barged in and demanded give me your watches coffyn handed 
over a gold omega watch and wallet the bandit shot him to death 
and fled

to gov norm bangerter an impending legal 
battle over the saying of prayers at public school graduations is a 
local issue that scarcely affects predominantly mormon utahs image 
in the global marketplace 
nor does he see the bitterly divisive issue tainting salt lake 
citys bid to be host of the 1998 winter olympics 
i doubt anyone whos going to come to the olympics worries 
whether theres prayer in graduation at high school i doubt that 
its going to cross many peoples minds bangerter said in an 
interview 
but michele parishpixler state director of the american civil 
liberties union is among many nonmormons who believe the 
governors attitude helps perpetuate the outsiders image of utah 
as a narrowminded theocracy 
we spend all this money to promote tourism then we do this 
stuff she said 
perhaps not since nonmormon efforts to permit hard liquor to be 
served by the drink failed in 1968 has an issue so sharply divided 
utah residents along religious lines the battle was joined july 30 
when the aclu filed suit in federal court seeking to ban prayer 
from public school graduations 
bangerter a mormon and a republican said he may ask the state 
legislature for a special appropriation to help the two school 
districts named in the suit defend themselves in court 
i felt local districts were being somewhat intimidated by the 
threat of a lawsuit in doing what they desired to do he said 
the us supreme court banned organized schoolsponsored prayer 
sessions for students in 1962 bangerter believes a legal gray area 
remains for opening and closing prayers at events such as 
commencement 
seventy percent of utahs 17 million residents are members of 
the church of jesus christ of latterday saints and most of the 
graduation prayers are delivered by mormons 
many defend the practice saying critics are taking potshots at 
a faith defenders say is virtually synonymous with a healthy and 
industrious lifestyle 
others decry the churchs influence on daily life in utah 
saying mormons have no conception of the ostracism felt by everyone 
else 
its not just prayers at high school graduation 
parishpixler said the governor brings this down to kids sitting 
through a 30second prayer once in 12 years the people who go to 
school here deal with it at every activity 
this is a state thats reluctant to give up its churchstate 
status that does not play well with people on the outside they 
come stay a couple of years and leave 
they say my kids were so unhappy we had to leave every 
time utah loses somebody that way the message goes out to 
corporate america that this is a hardship post 
to be sure utah isnt the only state to confront the issue 
last month the 1st us circuit court of appeals affirmed a 
rhode island courts ban on graduation prayers iowa courts have 
done the same 
in california the state supreme court has been asked to review 
contrary rulings on whether the practice violates the first 
amendment parishpixler said 
state sen frances farley a nonmormon democrat who moved to 
utah two decades ago is saddened by the dispute 
during a recent bipartisan senate caucus in which the subject 
was discussed she said utah should grow up and in what she 
now considers an intemperate remark she added to be crass its 
not good for business 
what i said on the floor of the senate was more or less a plea 
of understanding for people who move to utah and love it and make 
it their home but are not accustomed to the pervasiveness of what 
seems like the dominant religion she said 
the mormon church has remained silent on the lawsuit 
but elder dallin h oaks a member of the churchs council of 
the twelve apostles and a former utah supreme court justice 
defended graduation prayers in a may column in the wall street

linda ronstadt blames arena concerts and radio 
programmers for the awful state of pop music 
what really ruined pop music is the architecture that its 
presented in ms ronstadt told the pittsburgh press in sundays 
editions any place thats bigger than 11000 is just not a 
suitable environment for music 
describing the sound in such places as swimmy and boomy she 
said i hate playing in them and i will never be in an audience 
at one of them 
of the current music scene the singersongwriter said its 
awful one reason the corporate approach to radio 
programming 
if youre a musician and you come from memphis or nashville or 
new orleans areas that have some of the richest musical heritage 
in the country you have to go to los angeles in order to do it 
ms ronstadt said 
twentyfive years ago regional sounds like memphis 
rhythmandblues and motown found national niches according to ms 
ronstadt 
ms ronstadts next pop album probably will include some new 
orleans tunes by allan toussaint or irma thomas she said her most 
recent album is cry like a rainstorm howl like the wind

former olympic womens marathon champion 
joan benoit samuelson is supporting a campaign aimed at keeping 
guns locked away from kids 
having young children around the house i see them getting 
into everything said samuelson it drives it home that guns 
need to be stored properly and beyond the reach of kids 
a proposed referendum would ask whether adults should be held 
responsible if children under 16 gain unsupervised access to 
firearms such a law would require that guns be stored in locked 
boxes or protected by trigger locks maximum penalties would be 
1000 in fines and a year in jail 
portland police chief michael chitwood began the campaign after 
the maine legislature rejected a bill to keep guns out of the hands 
of children he cited the fatal shootings of eight children within 
a year and a half 
the gunsafety campaign is seeking 50000 signatures on 
petitions to put the question on the november 1991 ballot so far 
about 10000 signatures have been collected said chitwood 
the sportsmans alliance of maine is opposing the measure and 
says that gunsafety programs are more effective than laws in 
protecting people

declaring that young americans shouldnt die 
in battle just to keep gasoline prices low sen bob kerry on 
sunday said the us should abandon the notion of cheap oil 
the nebraska democrat a vietnam veteran and congressional medal 
of honor recipient said he supported president bushs decision to 
send troops to the persian gulf but only as a means of preventing 
an iraqi invasion of saudi arabia 
i question the response that says that were going to go there 
and have our young people die so that we can have cheap oil here at 
home kerry said in an appearance on nbctvs meet the press 
the only justification that i find that is legitimate is that 
were the only nation that could move quick enough to prevent 
an invasion of saudi arabia 
congressional democrats have generally supported bush during the 
middle east crisis although there has been some grumbling that the 
president should clarify his longterm objectives in the persian 
gulf region 
american troops were sent to the area after iraqi forces easily 
conquered kuwait in an aug 2 invasion iraq annexed the oilrich 
emirate six days later 
congressional leaders have asked for a white house briefing next 
tuesday on the middle east developments 
like most members of congress which has been recessed in 
august kerry has been in his home while the tense situation in the 
persian gulf has unfolded he expressed some frustration that bush 
had not provided lawmakers with more details about the 
administrations intentions in the gulf region 
we arent it seems to me being provided a sufficient amount 
of information to really engage meaningfully in a debate about 
whether or not this us deployment of military forces is 
appropriate said kerry who is not among the congressional 
leadership and knew nothing of tuesdays planned briefing 
i know from reading the newspapers that its hot in the desert 
and the chow is bad he added 
kerry suggested that american demand for cheap oil contributed 
to iraqi president saddam husseins rise to power in the middle 
east 
we in general have been blinded by money and as a 
consequence we put into place policy that encouraged hussein to 
become extremely strong he said 
kerry said americans are being very tolerant of higher oil 
prices that have resulted from the gulf tensions even though 
they are grumbling a bit about it

austrian president kurt waldheim who has 
spent much of the past four years in the shadow of his world war ii 
record won warm praise here sunday for his mission to iraq that 
freed about 100 countrymen 
but he was reprimanded outside austria for breaking the 
isolation the western world imposed on iraq after it invaded and 
annexed kuwait 
waldheim in an interview sunday insisted he did not break with 
the wests solidarity against iraqi president saddam hussein 
waldheim returned home early sunday with the austrians who were 
among the thousands of foreigners stranded in iraq because of the 
persian gulf crisis he was the first western leader to meet with 
saddam since the iraqi president sent his army into kuwait on aug 
2 
waldheim took his greatest risk of this job and probably of 
his entire career and he won said the mass daily kurier 
he and the austrian hostages were greeted at the airport by 
family and wellwishers some of whom held signs saying bravo 
waldheim 
waldheim a former un secretarygeneral has spent the four 
years of his presidency as a pariah in world politics and an 
embarrassment to many of his countrymen because of his wartime 
record 
he is barred from entering the united states because of charges 
that he knew about or participated in war crimes as a german army 
intelligence officer in the balkans during the war 
waldheim has acknowledged concealing his past but denies any 
wrongdoing 
his term in the largely ceremonial austrian presidency runs 
until 1992 and he has not indicated yet whether he intends to run 
again 
austrian chancellor franz vranitzky who reportedly was 
skeptical when the visit was announced last thursday told the 
national radio that the most important point is that we are 
enthusiastic of having all our austrians out of the region 
outside austria however officials and the media were less 
admiring 
i think one can sympathize with the leader of a country 
wanting to get his own citizens out us national security 
adviser brent scowcroft said on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley 
however he added it would have been much more helpful if he 
had pleaded for the tens or hundreds of thousands of foreigners who 
find themselves trapped inside kuwait and iraq 
asked if he wished waldheim had not gone to iraq scowcroft 
responded i think he could have done more 
italian foreign minister gianni de michelis speaking to 
reporters in venice expressed his reserve and perplexity about 
the visit 
italys la stampa which comes out in turin carried an article 
headlined a gift to waldheim 76 hostages and subheaded his 
visit breaks iraqi isolation 
waldheim in a sunday interview with british broadcasting corp 
said he realized before his trip that some people would criticize 
his effort but i do not consider that justified 
i made crystal clear that we stick to western solidarity that 
we implement all the resolutions which the security council has 
adopted and that this my humanitarian mission does not in any way 
mean that we are trying to break out of that western solidarity 
waldheim said

media pool sunday saying it is not needed because open coverage is 
now being permitted 
the decision by the government of saudi arabia to allow

a small liberal arts college is giving two 
eastern europeans a taste of us capitalism and competition under 
its scholars for freedom program 
we hope to show them the ways of a market economy and instruct 
them in the ways of a democratic and open system said gilbert 
ghez a roosevelt university business professor who runs the 
program 
peter leidl 21 of czechoslovakia will take undergraduate 
business courses at the university and laszlo pribusz 24 of 
hungary will study graduate computer science ghez said 
many us universities say they cant offer specific financial 
aid to eastern europeans who are taking advantage of freedoms 
recently won in their own countries by seeking to study in the 
united states 
but roosevelt working with scandinavian airlines 
multinational corporations and private groups is offering two 
students 20000 in full tuition room and board for the 199091 
school year as well as roundtrip air fare 
competition for the scholarships was keen about 500 people 
applied before the list was weeded down to 50 students who were

students 
the two students chosen are scheduled to arrive at ohare 
international airport on tuesday 
they will study problems faced by czechoslovakia hungary 
poland and romania alike turning from planned to market economies 
and dealing with rampant shortages and inflation 
the scholars for freedom program hopes to train students in 
capitalism and return them home to use those skills mark 
holtzblatt a roosevelt professor of science and international 
business 
while the university so far has been able to offer students just 
one free year of study ghez said even that experience should prove 
valuable to eastern governments 
im not saying theyll be ceos right away but they will be 
able to take the skills theyve learned here in america and use 
them over there he said 
the university hopes to offer scholarships to as many as 20 
people for the programs second year he added

defiant diplomats in kuwait held out for 
a second day sunday with some embassies guarded by iraqi troops 
and lacking electricity water and telephone service 
there were no reports that the iraqis who had ordered all 
embassies closed by friday were using force against the diplomats 
however the united states britain and france all reported sunday 
that more of their citizens in kuwait had been rounded up 
one of the reasons the embassies defied the iraqi order to close 
down was that they wanted to try to help their citizens trapped in 
the occupied emirate according to reports reaching foreign 
ministries in europe and elsewhere the iraqis cut off electricity 
and other utilities saturday at some missions including the us 
embassy after the diplomats refused to shut down 
iraq which invaded kuwait aug 2 and annexed it six days later 
says kuwait is now part of iraq and thus needs no embassies 
reports sunday said the us british french hungarian and 
danish embassies were among those surrounded by troops 
in other developments 
the british foreign office said contact was still possible 
with the four diplomats holed up in the british mission some other 
governments said diplomats at their embassies were free to come and 
go 
west germanys foreign ministry said its embassys water and 
electricity were cut off sunday the ministry said it still has 
contact with the embassy and west german diplomats were working to 
set up radio communication for the french embassy which has lost 
contact with paris 
the french embassy in kuwait is without water and electricity 
and telephone communication has been severed west german officials 
said the east german embassy also was without water and 
electricity

the japanese foreign ministry said sunday several soldiers 
were patrolling near its embassy and water and electricity 
remained cut off 
denmark said electricity at its embassy was cut sunday and 
shortwave radio contact had been lost only the danish ambassador 
remains at the embassy which has been surrounded by iraqi troops 
the united states the 12 european community states and many 
other countries have refused to close their kuwait embassies 
saying the closing order violated international law 
they say going along with the iraqi order to close could be 
construed as recognition of the annexation 
meanwhile the state department said sunday it had been informed 
that two additional americans have been taken into custody by iraqi 
troops 
department spokeswoman anita stockman said the information was 
relayed to the us embassy in kuwait by telephone although

up eight more britons in kuwait city it said the eight adults

the government said sunday its troops 
overran a rebelheld island and killed more than 80 tamil 
guerrillas in an advance toward a strategic northeast fort under 
siege by the insurgents 
military officials in colombo say government troops are now 
within about two miles of the 17thcentury jaffna fort where about 
250 policemen and soldiers have been trapped for 10 weeks 
vowing to crush the tamil tiger rebels once and for all the 
government has staked its prestige on breaking the siege of the 
fort the sinhalesecontrolled governments only outpost in 
tamildominated jaffna town 185 miles northeast of colombo 
there was no confirmation of the government claim that its 
forces captured mandativu island after a fierce threehour battle 
saturday night 
conventional communications to the jaffna peninsula were cut 
after june 11 when the tigers broke a 13monthold ceasefire with 
the government the combatants use radios to communicate with 
colleagues outside the peninsula 
the last word from the tigers was friday when a guerrilla 
spokesman in geneva acknowledged government forces were trying to 
advance from kayts island to mandativu island government troops 
landed on kayts island on wednesday disloging tamil fighters 
the islands are connected by a causeway that continues across 
the jaffna lagoon and ends just beside jaffna fort but the 
causeway is heavily mined the military officials said 
in the seven years since militants from the tamil minority 
revolted against sinhalese rule the tigers have proved 
devastatingly effective at making and planting mines 
military officials in colombo who under briefing rules cannot 
be identified claimed 84 tigers and only two government soldiers 
were killed in the battle for mandativu island 
they said advancing troops found the bodies of 28 rebels on 
mandativu and killed 16 others who tried to swim to safety another 
40 tigers were killed in strafing from a helicopter gunship as they 
tried to reach the mainland the officials said 
the government says it now expects to reach jaffna fort by 
monday 
since launching its latest offensive against the tigers the 
government says it has stepped up aerial attacks on rebel positions 
around the starshaped fort a legacy of portuguese dutch and 
british colonial rule on this island off the southern tip of india 
the tigers have not acknowledged any losses but have accused the 
government of killing more than 300 tamil civilians in bombing and 
strafing raids and ground fire on the jaffna peninsula where 
850000 people live 
the government says 5000 people have been killed since june 11 
when the tigers broke the ceasefire in northern and eastern sri 
lanka where most tamils live that brings to at least 14000 the 
total number of victims of the 7yearold tamil insurrection 
tamils make up 18 percent of the indian ocean islands 16 
million people they have long complained that the sinhalese 
majority discriminates against them in the jobs education and use 
of the sinhala language militants sought to create a separate 
homeland for tamils in the northeast 
sinhalese who account for 75 percent of the sri lankan 
population have dominated politics and the military since this 
country gained independence from britain in 1949

colombian drug cartels and the mafia are 
building a cocaine empire in western european countries which have 
replaced the united states as the biggest market for the drug a 
bogota newspaper reported sunday 
consumption in spain holland and italy is leaving the north 
american market behind said bogotas el tiempo newspaper citing 
a joint report by the international police organization interpol 
and the colombian intelligence police known as the das 
the bogota offices of both interpol and the das were closed 
sunday and no one could be reached for comment 
the european market will continue to grow because of the italian 
mafias intention to preserve its distribution monopoly and the 
colombian cartels desire to capture part of the market according 
to the study 
it said the cartel and the mafia are likely to form agreements 
to flood the market with cocaine 
el tiempo quoted the report as saying the dramatic growth of the 
cocaine market in western europe is fueled by high prices 
the drug is sold in europe for between 27500 and 115000 a 
kilogram compared to between 10000 and 20000 in the united 
states according to the document a kilogram is 22 pounds 
profits from the european business are enormous the report 
added because distributors receive cocaine that is 90 to 94 
percent pure and sell a product that is only 45 percent pure 
the report cited spain as the principal receiver of cocaine from 
latin america and the main trafficking center for drug destined for 
the european markets 
the report also said cocaine laboratories have been discovered 
in spain as well as in france and italy cocaine processing has 
traditionally been confined to colombia but the countrys war 
against the cartels and its crackdown on imports of processing 
chemicals have reportedly forced drug bosses to move some of their 
operations elsewhere 
although for some the detection of these european processing 
centers has not been alarming the facilities certainly are 
providing a supply of hundreds of kilograms the report said 
the enormous expansion of the cocaine business combined with 
the participation of other criminal organizations has reduced the 
importance of the colombian drug barons especially the medellin 
cartel 
the medellin cartel has begun to lose part of its key members 
and along with them part of the power they exercised over world 
distribution networks said the police report 
it estimated that the cartels share of the world cocaine market 
has been reduced from 75 percent to 40 percent 
in the past eight months several key cartel figures have been 
killed in shootouts with colombian authorities the organizations 
leader pablo escobar the target of a manhunt by police is in 
hiding and reportedly unable to run the cartels daytoday 
operations

china is preparing to enact a law to prevent 
the abuse of press freedom and ensure that the media support 
the communist party hong kong newspapers reported sunday 
the standing committee of chinas legislature the national 
peoples congress was to meet starting tuesday said two 
probeijing papers and one independent daily 
zhang husheng spokesman for the standing committee was quoted 
as saying no major personnel changes in the leadership were 
expected during the 10day meeting in beijing 
the reports said premier li peng would address the standing 
committee on recent international events possibly the current 
crisis in the middle east china has generally supported the west 
during the crisis 
beijing says it opposes the use of military force to enforce the 
blockade on iraq although it endorsed a un security council 
resolution allowing such force to be used 
other reports will concern chinas fragile economy and the 
status of scientific research in the country the probeijing 
papers ta kung pao and wen wei po and the independent ming pao 
said 
the newspapers said the standing committee which controls the 
rubberstamp legislature will also debate drafts of laws on 
copyrights railroads the signing of treaties and the export of 
labor 
spokesman zhang was quoted by the papers as saying a press law 
a publishing law and a maritime commerce law would be enacted soon 
chinas legislature has been debating a press law since 1984 and 
its contents have changed with the political winds 
papers quoted wang qianghua who heads a team drafting the law 
as saying the current version mandates that the press uphold the 
leadership of the communist party marxist thought and socialism 
the law also protects against the abuse of press freedom he 
said 
beijing mayor chen xitong will also report on the status of the 
asian games set to begin in september lack of money the crisis 
in the middle east and apparent mismanagement have hurt chinas 
preparations for the games 
many analysts say the games are important to chinas attempts to 
restore its international image following the bloody june 1989 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
there is speculation in hong kong that more changes in chinas 
government and communist party will come starting within the next 
few months and extending into the first half of next year 
since the june crackdown china has undergone a largescale 
military and political shakeup as conservative and relatively 
reformminded groups compete for power 
so far 11 provinces have lost top officials such as provincial 
party secretaries or provincial chiefs six out of the seven 
military regions have new commanders

have volunteered for a militia known as the popular army to back up 
the army in any persian gulf showdown according to reports from 
baghdad on sunday 
every residential neighborhood in baghdad now has a recruiting 
center for what is billed there as the arabs war against foreign 
invaders 
the move was seen as part of an effort by iraqi president saddam 
hussein to mobilize iraqs 17 million people following his aug 2 
invasion of oilrich kuwait 
it is unlikely that any of the volunteers will be used to fight 
the americans and other countries deploying forces in neighboring 
saudi arabia but they could help free regular troops in iraqs 1 
millionmember armed forces to man frontline positions 
iraqs staterun television has shown film of troops handing out 
automatic weapons to men in civilian clothes in baghdads streets

thousands of slovaks honored 
their former leader sunday in a rally that ended with a strong call 
for independence 
the twoday memorial to andrej hlinka included a seminar on his 
life a mass and the political rally with about 20 speakers 
hlinka was the leader of the slovak national party the 
strongest political force in slovakia he opposed the czechoslovak 
national government and after his death in 1938 his party 
collaborated with hitler within the slovak puppet state 
he was accused of both separatism and fascism and his name was 
taboo in official history books under communist rule 
the newly found freedom that came with czechoslovakias peaceful 
revolution last year is seen by many slovaks not only as an 
opportunity to reassess the countrys history but also a good time 
to demand full independence 
slovakia the countrys eastern part contains roughly onethird 
of czechoslovakias 155 million people partly in answer to 
slovaks reawakening ethnic feelings czechoslovakia officially was 
renamed the czech and slovak federative republic on april 20 
before independent czechoslovakia was founded by president tomas 
garrigue masaryk in 1918 slovakia was dominated by hungarians for 
centuries the czech lands lived under strong german influence 
within the austrohungarian empire 
hlinka once said the 1200yearlong marriage with the 
hungarians failed and i say the 72year old marriage with the 
czechs failed as well vitezoslav moric leader of the slovak 
national party told the crowd of several thousand people sunday 
the slovak national party won 16 seats in the countrys 300seat 
parliament in june elections making it the fourthstrongest in 
slovakia but its popularity has been rising since 
jan carnogursky leader of the christian democratic movement 
the secondstrongest political force in slovakia called for 
keeping czechoslovakia together he was booed off the stage 
participants in the rally adopted a demand that the slovak 
parliament and government take necessary measures to make 
slovakia a sovereign state 
it also called for making the slovak language the only official 
language now both the czech and slovak language are official 
throughout the country 
the memorandum also called for a constitutional amendment giving 
slovakia the right to secede

a top kgb official sunday disclosed the espionage 
arrests of some highranking soviet officials in recent years and 
paid grudging tribute to the cia as a crafty and determined 
adversary 
in the interview in the communist party newspaper pravda the 
kgb official victor f grushko also said the duty of the 
oncefeared secret police is to protect perestroika mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of political and economic reform 
interviews with top kgb officials were once extremely rare but 
they have been appearing in print and even on television recently 
as part of a campaign to revamp the spy agencys image 
these days the kgb emphasizes its role in fighting corruption 
and foreign intelligence agencies it has been playing down its 
history of terrorizing soviet dissidents tapping telephones and 
carrying out the late dictator josef stalins purges 
grushko said that since 1985 the kgb had arrested more than 30 
extremely dangerous spies virtually all were tried and shot 
he said 
those arrested included maj gen polyakov a former top officer 
in the counterintelligence department of the soviet general staff 
he said polyakov whose first name was not given would have been 
one of the highestranking soviet spies in history 
grushko head of the kgbs second chief directorate which is 
responsible for counterintelligence said polyakov had handed 
over important information on the activities of our military 
intelligence 
the kgb official boasted that the soviet spy agency has stopped 
more than 120 attempts to relay secrets to western intelligence 
services in the past five years 
other than polyakov other alleged spies identified by grushko 
were ag tolkachev an engineer in the radio industry ministry a 
kgb agent identified only as vorontsov and a scientific worker at 
the institute of the usa and canada identified only as potashov 
the article did not provide any details on their arrests or what 
they were alleged to have done 
jeffrey t richelson an american who has written about the kgb 
said in a telephone interview from washington that tolkachevs 
arrest and execution previously have been made public but that the 
other cases may be coming to light for the first time 
richelson author of sword and shield a 1986 book about 
soviet intelligence operations said polyakov may have been a cia 
source previously known by the code name donald 
the author also said he believed that potashov had not 
previously been named although it was known that there had been an 
espionage case at the usa and canada institute a leading 
research center in moscow 
in the interview grushko also discussed the operations of cia 
agents in moscow describing the tools of their trade including 
miniature shortwave radio transmitters tiny cameras secret 
message containers that look like pebbles invisible ink and an 
array of disguises 
for example an attache of the american embassy a man with a

cambodian guerrillas sunday claimed 
they repulsed a largescale offensive by that countrys communist 
government 
troops backed by multiple rocket launchers and sovietmade t54 
tanks struck guerrilla defense lines early saturday morning said a 
statement from ok serei sopheak a spokesman for the khmer peoples 
national liberation front 
the front lines remain stable but still tense said the 
statement from ok serei sopheak who had generally proved reliable 
in the past 
the noncommunist liberation front led by former cambodian 
prime minister son sann is one of three guerrilla groups fighting 
the government vietnam installed after invading cambodia in late 
1978 
the statement said the guerrillas repulsed troops who attacked 
near sisophon a strategic crossroads town in battambang province 
and about 30 miles east of the thai border 
after two hours enemy forces retreated back without any 
success it said we maintain all our positions in the south 
attacking government troops were also driven off near svay chek 
a town about 15 miles north of sisophon and ta vong 17 miles 
southeast of thmar puok a district capital in western cambodia 
peace talks between the government and the threeparty guerrilla 
coalition have been stalled by quarrels over who should rule 
cambodia in the period before a general election 
the other rebel groups are noncommunist followers of former 
cambodian head of state prince norodom sihanouk and the khmer 
rouge a communist group that has the most powerful insurgent army 
under leader pol pot the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands 
of people when it ruled cambodia from 1975 until vietnams invasion 
ousted it 
in an interview carried by the official radio hanoi on saturday 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach said cambodia was 
capable of holding free elections as nicaragua did recently 
he reiterated that dissolution of the vietnameseinstalled 
government before an election would only bring chaos and thus 
facilitate a khmer rouge attempt to restore its brutal regime 
the general elections in nicaragua all organized by the 
existing administrations under the supervision of the united 
nations and foreign countries were recognized by the world as 
truly free democratic and fair thach said obviously the 
same thing can be done in cambodia 
a text of the thach interview was seen sunday in bangkok

the federal regulator who oversaw silverado 
banking savings and loan solicited campaign money for a 
congressman charged with supervision of the sampl industry a 
newspaper reported sunday 
the denver post said kermit mowbray former president of the 
federal home loan bank of topeka kan solicited campaign funds 
from other regulators for former sen david karnes rneb then a 
member of the us senate banking committee 
karnes was chairman of the topeka bank before being appointed to 
the senate in 1987 when democrat ed zorinsky died he ran 
unsuccessfully for the seat in 1988 
karnes said he was unaware of campaign contributions from 
mowbray and other regulators 
edwin gray former chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
which in turn governed the topeka bank said mowbrays fundraising 
shows very poor judgment its dead wrong 
if there was any kind of coercion i would say that it is at 
the least highly improper and possibly a violation of the law 
gray said 
federal law prohibits government employees from raising money 
for federal campaigns but does not apply to home loan bank 
employees 
mowbray gave 2000 to karnes campaign in june 1987 and 
suggested to presidents of the home loan bank systems 12 regional 
banks that they also contribute 
i didnt see anything wrong with that mowbray told the post 
the bailout of the nationwide savings and loan industry is 
expected to cost taxpayers at least 500 billion the objectivity 
of thrift regulators has become an issue in the silverado case 
largely because president bushs son neil was a director of the 
denver thrift which failed at a cost of 1 billion to taxpayers 
last month the treasury department began investigating 
allegations that mowbray deliberately postponed seizing silverado 
until after the 1988 presidential election to protect bush from bad 
publicity 
mowbray told the house banking committee in june that he 
received a telephone call from washington in october 1988 ordering 
the delay the thrift was seized in december 1988 after the 
november presidential election he said he did not remember who 
made the call 
shortly after silverado failed mowbray left his job at the 
topeka bank 
during his tenure karnes was a bank board member along with 
silverado chairman michael wise who donated 2000 to karnes 
campaign 
as a member of the senate banking committee karnes proposed the 
thrift charter enhancement act of 1988 which sought to create 
incentives for investors to place additional capital in the thrift 
industry 
federal election records also show that thurman connell 
president of the federal home loan bank of des moines and brian 
dittenhaufer president of the federal home loan bank of new york 
each gave 500 to karnes campaign 
karnes said last week he never discussed neil bush or silverado 
with mowbray

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
will meet iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz this week to discuss 
the persian gulf crisis un and iraqi officials said sunday 
the meeting will be the united nations first formal attempt to 
mediate the international dispute 
the secretarygeneral will meet with aziz on thursday in the 
jordanian capital amman in order to engage in a full exchange 
of views on the crisis said un spokeswoman nadia younes 
she said she could not say whether any other leaders would 
attend the meeting were not ruling anything out she said 
the crisis was set off by iraqs invasion and annexation of 
kuwait which has been condemned by the united nations in a series 
of resolutions the latest came saturday with support for military 
enforcement of the un embargo against iraq 
us and other warships have assembled in the persian gulf 
region since the crisis began american planes and thousands of 
troops have been rushed to saudi arabia which borders kuwait 
aziz said in baghdad on sunday that he planned to meet with 
perez de cuellar this week but he did not elaborate he declined 
to say whether iraq was prepared to compromise on kuwaits status 
but he said his country would listen to any proposal 
we are open to listen to suggestions aziz said in an 
interview with cnn we have not closed the door to any idea but 
this question is complicated by the american threat to iraq 
aziz called the united nations a pawn of the united states 
and said other countries voted for un resolutions against iraq 
because they were under severe pressure from the united states 
kuwaits un ambassador mohammad a abulhasan said he did not 
foresee a breakthrough in the planned meeting in an interview the 
envoy said perez de cuellar was only to gather information 
i dont expect him to negotiate with iraq abulhasan said 
on saturday perez de cuellar said in bogota colombia that he 
had invited the iraqi minister to meet to discuss the situation 
ms younes would not comment on iraqi president saddam husseins 
statement saturday that he would welcome a visit by the un chief 
saddams statement came in baghdad where he was was asked by 
reporters traveling with austrian president kurt waldheim whether 
he would agree to meet with the un secretarygeneral in iraq 
of course saddam replied the un secretarygeneral is 
always welcome he was quoted by the official iraqi news agency 
the news agency said saddam was referring to perez de cuellar 
not waldheim the former secretarygeneral but provided no 
further details 
saddams news conference came at the end of a oneday visit by 
waldheim who flew out of baghdad with about 100 austrian nationals 
who had been stranded in the country 
perez de cuellar made his offer hours after the un security 
council authorized the use of military force to enforce the trade 
embargo against iraq to punish saddam for his aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
i believe that after the resolutions adopted by the security 
council the time has come for the secretarygeneral to begin 
diplomatic efforts to alleviate the present crisis in the gulf in 
all aspects through the process of dialogue the 
secretarygeneral said 
in kennebunkport maine white house spokesman roman popadiuk 
said saturday that washington welcomes a discussion by all un 
members in the context of the complete and immediate and 
unconditional withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait 
saddam has repeatedly refused to withdraw from kuwait which 
iraq annexed six days after the invasion

nobel peace prize winner elie wiesel 
opening an international conference on ways to counter hate 
appealed to iraq on sunday to free thousands of trapped foreigners 
our thoughts go to the most recent victims and prisoners of 
hate those who are being used and manipulated in kuwait and 
iraq wiesel said in his opening remarks 
in the name of humanity we appeal for their unconditional and 
immediate release said wiesel the romanianborn author and 
human rights activist 
a human being is not a shield he said referring to iraqs 
move to place scores of foreigners at military and industrial sites 
as human shields to deter any us air strikes 
the fourday conference on the anatomy of hatehas attracted 
about 70 participants from 30 countries including world 
statesmen nobel laureates thinkers and activists 
among those scheduled to attend are south african antiapartheid 
activist nelson mandela czechoslovak president vaclav havel a 
former dissident playwright french president francois mitterrand 
and lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis 
wiesel the nazi death camp survivor who won the 1986 nobel 
peace prize for his work exposing the horrors of the holocaust 
organized the conference with the oslobased nobel peace prize 
committee to discuss the problem of hate 
last fall when he issued the call to attend the conference 
wiesel said he feared that the new freedoms won by east bloc 
nations would cause smoldering religious ethnic and regional 
hatred to flare 
now he said he wishes that the conference could have been held 
six months ago when it might have helped relax tensions in such 
hotspots of conflict as the persian gulf and south africa 
hate as we know wears many masks said wiesel 61 who is 
now a us citizen and boston university professor 
he asked participants to expose various forms of hatred 
racial hate religious hate ethnic hate fanaticism bigotry 
prejudice and discrimination 
wiesel said he hoped the seminar would end with some kind of 
joint declaration 
yelena bonner the soviet human rights activist and widow of the 
1975 nobel peace prize laureate andrei sakharov said the 
participants must first admit that hate is an emotion given us by 
god 
our conference is opening at time that is not the best for 
calm and clear reason after the august 2 invasion of kuwait 
we are living in a very different reality she said speaking 
through an interpreter 
ms bonner said years of arms sales by the soviet union and 
france to a known assassin like iraqi leader saddam hussein 
prove that firm international rules and not just debates about 
morals are needed to protect human rights 
on monday mandela is scheduled to open a discussion on 
apartheid south africas system of racial separation 
others attending the conference are harvard economist john 
kenneth galbraith actor gregory peck former president jimmy 
carter and chai ling a leader of last years prodemocracy 
movement in beijing

timber industry job losses will be far less 
than originally thought under a plan to protect the spotted owl on 
forest service land in the pacific northwest interior secretary 
manuel lujan said sunday 
lujan and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter are facing a 
saturday deadline to report to president bush with a plan to 
protect the owl as required under the federal endangered species 
act 
environmentalists are not going to like it but you have to 
have balance lujan told reporters you cant throw 21000 
people out of work and not give it consideration i fully expect 
one side or the other to sue me over the plan 
a recommendation by forest service biologist jack ward thomas 
would ban logging on 3 million acres of northwest forests currently 
open to timber harvests 
the government has estimated the move would reduce federal 
harvests in the region by nearly 50 percent at a cost of more than 
20000 jobs by the end of the decade 
lujan while declining to say how the plan might be altered in 
terms of acreage said job losses probably would be scaled down 
thats my aim he said to come out with a substantial 
reduction in job loss 
lujan conceded the spotted owl needs plenty of oldgrowth forest 
to survive but questioned whether it needs as much as 
environmentaists think 
i found an owl last week in oregon and it wasnt in oldgrowth 
timber he said so it showed me that the owls can live outside 
of oldgrowth areas 
lujan was taken by bureau of land management officials on a tour 
last week of a forest 10 miles northeast of eugene ore where he 
got a clear look at a male spotted owl but officials there said 
the owl lived in oldgrowth forest 
later at a republican fundraiser here lujan renewed his 
criticism of the endangered species act saying it has become a 
tool for environmentalists to block economic development and 
multiple use of public lands 
in some cases a particular listing may threaten the jobs of 
thousands throwing entire communities or regions into economic and 
social turmoil he said we must work to ensure that a balance 
is reached between our desire to preserve species while also 
preserving the livelihoods of our citizens 
in june lujan wondered in a published interview if endangered 
species must be protected in every locale where they exist 
do we have to save every subspecies lujan said his 
statement drew the ire of conservationists who insist that the loss 
of any genetically distinct subspecies poses a potentially dire 
threat to the environment 
the government gave permission to the university of arizona last 
week to proceed with construction of a 200 million observatory 
that some say could threaten the habitat of the endangered mount 
graham red squirrel

iraqs neighbors moved sunday to ease 
passage for refugees of the persian gulf conflict in some cases 
setting aside disputes among themselves to do so 
israel plans to ease restrictions at its only border crossing 
with jordan which borders iraq to assist those fleeing the gulf 
region officials in jerusalem said sunday 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted irans foreign 
minister as saying foreigners fleeing iraq and kuwait can do so via 
iran which borders iraq to the east 
later tehran radio said more than 3000 pakistanis who had been 
living in kuwait had crossed into iran along its border with turkey 
but it was not clear whether the iranian promise which came at 
the request of the philippines applied to westerners or was 
confined to asians and arabs 
jordan and turkey which have been the prime escape routes for 
foreigners so far have complained they are overburdened by 
thousands of refugees and have threatened to close their borders 
unless they received international help to cope with the influx 
such aid has begun to flow 
most of the people who have fled since iraq invaded its oilrich 
neighbor kuwait on aug 2 have gone by way of jordan which has 
been forced to feed and shelter thousands until they could afford 
to continue on to their home countries 
a jordanian border official at ruweishid 210 miles northeast of 
amman said 5000 people mostly egyptians crossed there from iraq 
on sunday morning on saturday more than 13000 people entered 
jordan at ruweishid he said nearly all of these refugees are 
arabs or asians 
a group of 31 westerners including french british and us 
citizens arrived in jordan from iraq on sunday all of the 
americans were of arab extraction a senior jordanian official said 
syria iraqs main arab rival announced saturday it would allow 
foreigners to cross its border with iraq for humanitarian reasons 
the border has been closed since 1981 
martin watts a briton who arrived saturday in syria after 
fleeing across the desert with six other britons and an australian 
said the group fled after deciding it was better to face hostile 
border guards than remain in baghdad and risk being detained 
we decided we all preferred risking bullets while escaping to 
remaining in iraq and risking chemical weapons said watts an 
engineer who like his companions worked for a british company 
building a power station near baghdad 
we told people we were going to baghdad for a beer boarded 
our trucks carried a map and our passports and drove west across 
the desert for 43 hours watts said 
the coordinator of israels occupied territories shmuel goren 
said on israel radio sunday that the government was easing 
restrictions on crossing the allenby bridge on the 
israelijordanian frontier he cited humanitarian reasons 
normally tourists who want to cross between jordan and the 
occupied west bank via the allenby bridge must make arrangements 
ahead of time 
last week an agreement that would have allowed tens of 
thousands of egyptian refugees passage home through israel was 
scrapped after it was leaked to the press embarrassing the 
jordanian and egyptian governments 
jordan is officially in a state of war with israel egypt is the 
only arab state to have made peace with israel and is sensitive to 
suggestions it is too close to the jewish state 
most of the refugees crossing into jordan are arabs but some 
have been westerners 
there are about 840000 palestinians working in the persian gulf 
region and many of those in iraq and kuwait are now fleeing 
others in oilrich gulf nations such as saudi arabia and the united 
arab emirates fear a backlash against palestinians for their 
support of iraqi president saddam hussein 
normally palestinians without israeliissued identity cards 
seeking to visit the occupied territories must wait for permission 
from the israeli authorities 
it can usually take up to four weeks for their security 
clearance to come through and they can then only stay up to three 
months an israeli government source said 
now we are doing everything we can to make the process as 
quick as possible and we will allow them to extend their stay on a 
casebycase basis he said 
the government also was dropping the requirement that men 
between 16 and 35 who leave the territories must stay away for more 
than nine months the source said 
that rule is designed to allow students to go abroad but prevent 
palestinian activists making frequent trips in which they could 
carry messages back and forth

sharp differences over abortion regulations 
kept west german political leaders from forging a consensus monday 
on a treaty to merge the countrys laws with those of east germany 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and top members of his 
conservative coalition met for four hours until early monday 
morning with leaders of the opposition social democrats in an 
effort to ensure smooth passage for the treaty in the legislature 
but oskar lafontaine the social democratic candidate who will 
oppose kohl for chancellor in allgerman elections scheduled for 
december said after the meeting in bonn that differences remained 
on the abortion issue 
the leftofcenter social democrats are incensed at a government 
decision that west german women who try to take advantage of east 
germanys more liberal abortion law after unification can be 
prosecuted 
as a result the social democrats have threatened to block 
adoption of the unity treaty which needs a twothirds vote to pass 
in the parliament 
the treaty will cover various issues including distribution of 
sales tax revenues among the german states how to settle claims by 
west germans seeking the return of their former property in east 
germany and abortion 
failure to pass the treaty would not jeopardize the oct 3 date 
set for the unification of the two german states 
but it would mean that most west german laws would go into force 
in east germany after unity takes place a move east german prime 
minister lothar de maiziere has said would not serve the best 
interests of his compatriots 
east germans are increasingly unsettled by the prospect of 
simply being absorbed by their richer neighbor and having to adjust 
to an entirely new economic and legal system 
politicians in both countries womens groups and government 
officials have been debating for weeks over the best abortion law 
for a united germany 
while the social democrats are prochoice kohls conservative 
christian democrats support restrictions on a womans right to an 
abortion 
east german women have a legal right to an abortion within the 
first 12 weeks of pregnancy 
but the west german law is much more restrictive west german 
women must prove the pregnancy is lifethreatening resulted from 
rape or incest or would create severe social and economic 
hardships 
participants in the bonn meeting called by kohl are to meet 
again on wednesday for further talks on the treaty 
they did agree that an allgerman parliament should adopt rules 
governing abortion that would apply throughout the country 
elections for the allgerman legislature are set for dec 2

at pacific presbyterian medical center in san francisco according 
to members of the boulder colobased dharmadatu buddhist church 
called vajradhatu 
julie murray spokeswoman for the hospital could not confirm 
his death saying no one was registered under the tendzin or rich 
names 
a lot of members had difficulty accepting that he was sick 
said one of the church members who refused to give his name 
its been quite difficult for a lot of students of our church 
there have been a lot of different versions of reality 
tendzin was reportedly admitted to the hospital in midaugust 
he was raised in passaic nj after dropping out of fordham 
university he met the venerable chogyam trungpa in 1971 and became 
the tibetan buddhist leaders top student trungpa gave him the 
name osel tendzin or radiant holder of the teachings 
vajradhatu was founded by trungpa who had fled the chinese 
invasion of tibet to settle in boulder trungpa also founded the 
naropa institute an accredited liberal arts college combining 
eastern and western studies

tradition trungpa died in 1987 at the age of 47 
in december 1988 tendzin told vajradhatu members in san 
francisco that he had contracted aids there were reports at the 
time he also had acknowledged putting others at risk through his 
sexual behavior

insisting tendzin should remain as the groups leader and critics 
arguing he must resign because he had betrayed the trust of

fiftytwo of 55 dependents of us embassy 
personnel from kuwait crossed from iraq into turkey late sunday 
but three males were detained by iraqi border authorities the 
state department said 
a spokeswoman for the kuwait task force at state department 
headquarters said the convoy of kuwait embassy dependents 
crossed the border from iraq into turkey about 2 am iraqi time 6 
pm edt fiftytwo of the group of 55 who earlier had permission 
to cross were allowed to leave 
three young men in the group male dependents of kuwait 
embassy diplomats were not allowed by iraqi officials to transit 
the border and are in the company of an american embassy bagdad 
escort officer 
the 52 were met by a party from the american embassy in 
ankara they will rest tonight in turkey and plans are being made 
for their en route journey home 
the spokeswoman who declined to allow her name to be used said 
she had no information on the ages of the three males held back 
nor on what would happen to them state department officials 
previously have described all 55 of the dependents as women and 
children 
she likewise had no details on the whereabouts of the 52 allowed 
to cross other than that they were in safe hands had were moved 
some distance away from the border in buses to spend the rest of 
the night 
the announcement from the state department came a few hours 
after an abc news report that a bus carrying the americans had been 
turned back at the border leaving us officials waiting in turkey 
uncertain for a time as to what was happening 
in a telephone interview with ap broadcast from diyarbakir 
turkey david kostelancik vice consul of the us embassy in 
ankara turkey said the 52 dependents were received by the 
american consul from adana mr harry cole and at a later time 
transportation was arranged for them from the border to dyarbakir 
they were all very very tired but they were all very 
enthusiastic very happy to be in turkey said kostelancik 
they will be transported sometime today monday to the interlik 
air base near adana where they will remain and they will probably 
leave sometime tomorrow tuesday for the united states the 
crossing occurred as previously planned at habur 
meanwhile national security adviser brent scowcroft said sunday 
that iraqi president saddam hussein faced with increasing global 
opposition to his conquest of kuwait is now intent on seeking a 
way out of the box he is in 
scowcroft and a variety of other experts interviewed sunday all 
indicated there was room for hope that the 24dayold persian gulf 
crisis could be resolved short of military conflict 
i can see a peaceful way out of it scowcroft said on 
abctvs this week with david brinkley program saddam 
hussein must now see hes facing overwhelming world opinion 
he is casting about for a way out of the box in which he finds 
himself scowcroft said 
the pressure on saddam appeared to increase dramatically 
saturday when the un security council gave the united states and 
other nations the right to use military power in enforcing the 
economic embargo against iraq 
scowcroft said saddam has shown himself in the past to be a 
realist citing his willingness two weeks ago to bow to irans 
terms for a settlement of their eightyear war among other 
concessions saddam agreed to recognize the prewar boundary of the 
two countries 
meanwhile state department press officer anita stockman said 
sunday the us embassy in iraqioccupied kuwait has been informed 
that two additional americans have been taken into custody by iraqi 
troops 
she said the information was relayed to the embassy by 
telephone although officials had no way of confirming the 
information she said embassy personnel had reason to believe it 
was accurate she had no additional details about those arrested 
assistant secretary of state for near east and south asian 
affairs john kelly said little had changed at the us embassy in 
kuwait city which along with a number of other western diplomatic 
missions was being surrounded by iraqi troops 
appearing on nbctvs meet the press program kelly said the 
embassy is hampered in its efforts to help the estimated 2500 
americans whom iraq is refusing permission to leave the country he 
said less than 10 have been picked up by iraqi troops another 50 
are in iraqi troop custody in baghdad he said 
iraq cut off electricity at the us embassy in kuwait on 
saturday and the power remained off sunday the embassy was using a 
power generator 
iraqi troops were preventing anyone from entering or leaving the 
embassy but kelly said the reduced staff there probably had a 
couple of weeks worth of supplies remaining 
at the pentagon the army on sunday ordered 50 more army reserve 
and national guard units in 25 states to report for active duty by 
aug 31 the defense department also said elements of the armys 
13th support command at fort hood texas had begun to deploy to 
the middle east 
the impetus for a diplomatic solution appeared to increase when 
iraqi ambassador mohamed almashat said his government would 
welcome a mediation effort by un secretary general javier perez 
de cuellar 
perez de cuellar said saturday he was seeking an urgent meeting 
this week with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz in either new york 
or geneva after his television appearance scowcroft said the 
administration would have no problem with a mediation by perez 
de cuellar 
he added that highest us priority was inducing iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait after that he said were prepared to talk 
about anything 
scowcroft was interviewed in kennebunkport maine where he was 
staying with the vacationing president bush the president who 
played golf and tennis and received a briefing from scowcroft 
continued to refuse to answer reporters questions about the gulf 
situation 
bush was to return to washington on tuesday to brief 
congressional leaders on the gulf crisis 
almashat appearing on cbstvs face the nation program 
contrasted iraqs desire for peace with the american design 
to have war he said americas aggressive intentions were clearly 
demonstrated by the dispatch of offensive weaponry including 
stealth bombers to saudi arabia 
the notion that the united states and iraq were moving 
inevitably toward war was disputed on abc by henry a kissinger and 
zbigniew brzezinski both former national security advisers 
i believe that saddam hussein is looking for some way out 
kissinger said if we stay firm we will get it 
the under secretary of state for political affairs robert 
kimmitt said on cbs that saddams hand sooner or later will be 
forced by the economic sanctions approved by the un security 
council

is said to be buried but theres no record of his death because 
mr ed was a horse of course

when the snodgrasses bought the 17acre site north of tahlequah 
in 1981 they didnt give much credence to a cousins recollection 
of visiting the place as a youngster to see mr ed 
but other people around this northeastern oklahoma town told the

roughly 60000 american soldiers airmen and 
sailors have moved to battle stations in the persian gulf since 
president bush ordered us firepower into the area to thwart 
iraqs saddam hussein sources say 
in addition to the massive troop movement the pentagon has 
built a virtual armada in the regions seas and rushed in hundreds 
of fighter jets and support aircraft 
the deployment the largest since the vietnam war is far from 
complete 
within a few weeks about 45000 marines are expected to have 
arrived in the area by then the total us combat force in the

junk bond defaults rose in the first half of 
1990 and analysts say a weak economy and higher oil prices could 
bring the highest default rate in 20 years 
as the economy slows and higher gasoline and heating oil prices 
leave consumers with less money to spend in casinos department 
stores and on new homes businesses will have less cash to make 
interest and principal payments 
in the first seven months of the year 32 highyield bond 
issuers defaulted for an annualized rate of 58 percent according 
to john lonski chief economists at moodys investor service inc 
if maintained the it would be the highest rate since the 
collapse of the penn central railroad accounted for a 109 percent 
default rate in 1970 lonski said 
i dont think weve passed the bottom yet in all likelihood 
especially for the highlyleveraged firms that depend on 
descretionary income lonski said 
prices of issues expected to ride up and down with the business 
cycle have taken a pounding since oil prices rose after iraq 
overran kuwait on aug 2 
numbers compiled by citicorp show total returns on junk bonds 
issued by recessionprone industries suffered the worst in the 
first half of august casinos dropped 78 percent building 
materials fell 71 percent and retailers are off 36 percent 
toilet maker american standard inc which relies heavily on 
energy in making ceramics as well as new homes for sales saw its 
12percent senior subordinated debentures that mature in the year 
2000 skid from 93 to the high 80s last week 
junk bonds are debt securities typically issued by companies 
that lack investment grade credit often used to raise capital for 
expansion they carry high interest rates to compensate for their 
risky nature 
the market is reflecting fears of a recession it was already 
worried about corporate profits weakening said mariel clemensen 
citicorps highyield research director 
a recession would hit steeply leveraged companies particularly 
hard which have huge principal and interest payments among their 
fixed costs lonski said when looking to cut expenses capital 
spending and employment are likely to be hit harder than if a 
company didnt have a high debt obligation 
even industries such as food tobacco and health care whose 
fortunes tend to resist economic downturns could be hurt as 
consumers resist price hikes that heavily indebted companies have 
relied upon to boost cash flow lonski said 
citicorps numbers show total returns on healthcare issues 
dropping 09 percent and broadcasting issues falling 17 percent in 
the first half of august 
you might find some that will escape unscathed lonski said 
particularly utilities that rely heavily on nuclear power to 
produce electricity 
for utilities junk bonds are usually socalled fallen angels 
once highly rated issues that became viewed as risky the more they 
faced trouble with their investments in nuclear power 
but these utilities reliance on nuclear power is what may make 
some an attractive investment during a prolonged oilprice shock 
lonski said arizona public service co and philadelphia electric 
co for example are two utilities with speculativegrade bonds 
that have substantial nuclearpower generating capabilities 
moreover public sentiment about nuclear power could improve if 
the country once again starts looking to alternative fuel sources

a month after reporting a shocking 
second quarter loss us sprint is airing new tv ads and 
strengthening its sales staff to grab business from the the 
nations two largest longdistance companies 
but many think sprint with 10 percent of the market faces an 
uphill battle 
it must compete for residential customers at a time when mci 
communications corp and american telephone and telegraph co have 
established strong telemarketing sales and ad campaigns targeted 
toward the individual buyer sprint must cut costs at the same time 
i think things are going to turn around for them said 
audrey stevoff vice president and telecommunications analyst for 
duff amp phelps in chicago but im not sure how quickly they can 
cut costs fairly easily but getting customers onto your network 
thats the challenge 
other analysts think the 42 million loss that caused the stock 
of sprints parent company to plummet is a sign the fiercely 
competitive longdistance industry is stabilizing 
sprint was late to the dinner table and it is just never 
going to have as large a portion of the pie said robert b 
morris iii analyst for goldman sachs amp co in san francisco 
you will have them as a viable third carrier but they probably 
will never reach the levels of market share that mci will reach 
partly morris says thats because the gobs of market share 
that atampt was losing at one point are no longer available 
you had many investors working on the premise that sprint was 
just mci two years later morris said and would grow just as 
big mci has about 14 percent of the market now that premise has 
been shaken he contends 
sprint officials for their part say the market analysts and 
the media overreacted to the loss they announced july 17 the loss 
caused second quarter earnings of united telecommunications inc to 
fall 55 percent it owns 80 percent of sprint 
the loss also delayed united telecoms buyout of the remaining 
20 percent of sprint owned by the gte corp of stamford conn the 
two companies formed sprint in mid1986 
sprint officials acknowledge costs were too high and revenue 
growth lower than expected basically the company fell behind in 
the fight for residential customers they say it continues to sell 
well to businesses and is getting revenues from its share of a 
large government contract 
weve said very clearly that we did not take action as soon as 
we could have in that part of the market said ron lemay 
sprints president and chief operating officer we realize that 
we have to become more aggressive and what youre seeing now in 
action is a reflection of that 
those actions include eliminating 1300 jobs nationwide mostly 
administrative jobs and putting more people into marketing 
efforts including sales and service jobs targeted toward smaller 
customers 
in addition new tv ads directly confront a recent atampt charge 
that other longdistance companies wont put their promises in 
writing 
its an attempt to very clearly educate customers that we have 
the full range of longdistance possibilities plus the service to 
back it up lemay said 
those are steps in the right direction say analysts who contend 
sprint simply lost track of what its competitors were doing 
i think they thought their blanket commercial about the pin 
would reach all markets stevoff said 
but mci decided last fall to refocus on residential customers 
and began an intense telemarketing campaign and atampt blanketed 
television with commercials designed to attract the average joe 
calling aunt sophie stevoff said 
morris worries that sprint still is just reacting to the market 
instead of leading the way 
these are things that will help you maintain your share he 
said of the new ads but if youre really going to accelerate 
things you have to lead the market rather than follow it 
since the earnings announcement sprint officials also have 
reacted angrily to charges that the billing problems they struggled 
with in the late 1980s have recurred morris said he has heard of 
no new problems 
the federal communications commission says 376 written 
complaints about billing were filed against sprint in the first 10 
months of this fiscal year vs 821 last year 
but sprint does lag in development of the sophisticated billing 
systems that competitors are offering customers 
once again its just an extremely competitive atmosphere 
where theyre struggling to keep up morris said

the steep decline in stock prices this summer 
has left investors staring into the jaws of what some say may be 
wall streets first sustained bear market in nearly a decade 
todays generation of stock traders and analysts is by no means 
unaccustomed to to the phenomenon of falling markets most of them 
were around for the crash of 1987 which provided all the 
conditions you could want for a baptimism of fire 
that debacle produced a 36 percent drop in the dow jones 
industrial average enough to rank prominently on any list of 
modernday market declines 
but almost all the carnage occurred in a span of less than two 
months and stocks began to recover quickly thereafter en route to 
new highs 
many an investor it appeared was still numb from the shock 
when the wounds began to heal 
for an undisputed example of the kind of long debilitating 
slide for which classic bear markets are famous one has to go back 
to 198182 before the big boom of the 80s on wall street was 
ready to start 
from april 27 1981 to aug 12 1982 the dow jones industrials 
tumbled from 102405 to 77692 as the economy struggled through a 
recession exacerbated by rapid inflation and high interest rates 
instead of the sudden jolt of a crash the market in those days 
experienced a kind of slow steady erosion that gave investors 
plenty of time to think about how much money they were losing and 
how bleak the outlook seemed 
the question of the moment now of course is whether stocks are 
in for a similar malaise or just undergoing one of the periodic 
corrections that have punctuated the long bull market since 82 
simple to ask not so easy to answer incipient bear markets are 
notoriously cunning at disguising themselves as shortterm 
corrections and vice versa 
on the optimistic side however analysts point out that 
authentic bear markets have seldom begun with a single event that 
serves as an explanation for the decline in this case iraqs 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
indeed many veteran marketwatchers worry more when declines 
set in that have no readily discernible cause 
past major confrontations such as the cuban missile crisis or 
other military squabbles that were resolved favorably proved to be 
just a blip in the stock markets general trend observes greg 
smith an analyst at prudentialbache securities 
we could be in one of those blips or this could be something 
much more significant 
norman fosback editor of a group of investment advisory letters 
published by the institute for econometric research in fort 
lauderdale fla plants himself squarely on the blip side of 
the argument 
price weakness touched off by the geopolitical crisis does not 
constitute a bear market he declared in the firms mutual fund 
forecaster it does appear to be the 10 percent to 15 percent 
correction that has been long overdue 
midstream bull market corrections are nearly always abrupt 
they shake out the markets weak participants by leading them to 
believe falsely that a bear market has begun 
one big risk behind this view is the chance that the market has 
looked beyond the persian gulf showdown and correctly discerned the 
approach of a recession 
it will take a good while for these overlays of uncertainty to 
sort themselves out observed morton silverman portfolio 
strategist at piper jaffray amp hopwood in minneapolis 
silverman concluded its a time for prudence not 
opportunism

sales of wood stoves are heating up again as 
people worry about the rising cost of fuel for the winter 
wood stoves have been both maligned and romanticized as having a 
certain pioneer mystique while oil price hikes and tensions in the 
middle east fanned sales in the 1970s and early 1980s wood stoves 
also were the target of pollution restrictions and the source of 
fatal house fires 
industry officials say stoves today have more sophisticated 
designs to remedy the old problems now wood stove makers and 
retailers are hoping to cash in on the persian gulf crisis which 
they say demonstrates the risks of depending on oil 
the good news for our industry is that theres been a wakeup 
call on the energy front said jim hermann president of the 
earth stove inc a portland ore company that is one of the 
largest wood stove producers in the country weve been living in 
this artificial world of cheap oil 
stores that sell wood stoves say they saw surging interest in 
their products almost immediately after iraq invaded kuwait this 
month in massachusetts the average price of home heating oil has 
risen 18 cents per gallon since the invasion 
we had twice as many calls right off said peter dormitzer 
owner of the chelmsford fireplace center north of boston 
one day last week his store sold five stoves we havent been 
doing five stoves a month until now he said 
this growing interest comes as a sharp contrast to the 
industrys recent performance 
more than a decade ago the industry was growing so quickly that 
officials had no solid sales numbers they estimated annual stove 
sales exceeded 1 million around the start of the 1980s as large 
and small manufacturers proliferated around the country 
anybody that had a welding shop was putting together a wood 
stove back then hermann said 
but for several reasons the industry shrank quickly annual 
sales are now estimated around 225000 
a big factor was the falling price of oil which meant people no 
longer were looking for another energy source instead wood stoves 
increasingly were bought for aesthetic reasons which meant they 
were competing with a new sofa or vcr said jason densmore of 
lebanon nh president of wood heating alliance a national trade 
association 
wood stoves also had a publicity problem mountain towns in 
colorado where air currents create special pollution problems 
restricted numbers of wood stoves in 1988 the us environmental 
protection agency set new rules for wood stoves forcing sharp 
reductions in smoke emissions 
meanwhile fatal house fires were reported across the country in 
which wood stoves were involved 
industry officials say however these accidents usually were 
due to improper installation of the stoves or poor maintenance of 
chimneys 
but these events have prompted the industry to change for the 
better company representatives say because of the epa 
restrictions wood stoves today burn much more cleanly and they 
are also made under tighter safety guidelines said jiggs 
blackburn research and development director for vermont castings 
inc a wood stove maker in randolph vt 
wood stoves have undergone a remarkable transformation 
blackburn said it is now a very sophisticated appliance 
while the initial investment in a wood stove can exceed 1000 
wood stove representatives say the low price of wood compared with 
oil translates into savings over the long term 
that is part of the sales pitch for people who might otherwise 
prefer the convenience of turning up their thermostats rather than 
gathering wood 
another advantage is simply the independence from foreign oil 
suppliers or local utilities said densmore who noted he uses a 
wood stove to heat his 12room house in central new hampshire 
i think were certainly pleased to see the alternative fuel 
issue raised he said unfortunately it takes something like 
this to create the awareness

opec appeared close sunday to calling an 
emergency meeting to approve an increase in oil production because 
of the persian gulf crisis 
a vote of seven nations is needed to call an emergency meeting 
and the venezuelan oil minister celestino armas said six 
countries already supported the measure 
armas in vienna for informal talks with other opec nations 
said the oil market is suffering from an important disruption 
and we have to do something about that 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 prompting a un oil emargo 
on both nations crude prices have risen from about 20 a barrel to 
more than 30 threatening the global economy 
ministers from 11 of the 13 member nations from the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries were in vienna site of the 
cartels headquarters for the talks 
those supporting an emergency meeting were saudi arabia 
venezuela kuwait qatar ecuador and the united arab emirates 
armas said 
saudi arabia and venezuela tried last week to call an emergency 
meeting on increasing production but were rebuffed saudi arabia 
venezuela the united arab emirates and a few others have the 
ability to pump more crude oil 
some nations like iran have argued that there is enough oil in 
storage to make up for any shortages caused by the gulf crisis 
only iraq and libya were not represented at sundays gathering 
opec sources said on condition of anonymity 
the finance minister of kuwaits exiled government ali khalifa 
alsabah who was the conquered emirates oil minister until 
earlier this summer said sunday he would like to see an increase 
in oil production 
saudi arabia has said it intends to increase production by up to 
2 million barrels a day with or without opecs blessing to make 
up some of the loss of crude caused by the persian gulf crisis 
but clearly saudi arabia the worlds largest crude exporter 
would like the cartels approval to exceed its opec supply quota of 
54 million barrels a day 
analysts estimate some 4 million barrels of crude a day have 
been pulled off the markets because of the international embargo on 
iraqi and kuwaiti oil they said four other opec nations the 
united arab emirates venezuela nigeria and libya also have the 
ability to pump extra oil 
venezuelas armas said his country will boost output to fill its 
stocks because of the possibility that the oil crunch will continue 
for some time 
analysts say venezuela could add as much as 500000 barrels a 
day to its opec quota of 19 million barrels 
opec president sadek boussena the algerian oil minister echoed 
private analysts in saying that the cartel has had little impact on 
prices in recent weeks the oilconsuming nations he said are 
masters of the prices 
last month the cartel agreed to restrain production at 225 
million barrels a day in the last half of the year in an effort to 
drive prices up to a new target of 21 a barrel the benchmark was 
surpassed almost immediately because of the gulf crisis 
opec nations are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

two labor unions hope to tap the booming cable 
industry for new membership in an effort to stem a decadelong 
decline in traditional membership 
as revenue in the cable industry has mushroomed from about 
29 billion in 1980 to 173 billion this year so has 
employment an estimated 101400 people currently work in the 
industry 
the communications workers of america and the international 
brotherhood of electrical workers have begun focusing on organizing 
those workers but it isnt easy 
the cwa failed twice most recently in june to unionize 
united cablevision a subsidiary of united artists entertainment 
inc with roughly 130000 subscribers in metropolitan denver 
though similar efforts at uniteds grand junction office succeeded 
the difficulty you have is that each franchise has relatively 
few employees said morton bahr president of the cwa in 
washington this enables management to divide and conquer 
experts say unions represent workers in no more than 10 percent 
of the nearly 10000 us cable systems by comparison 100 percent 
of the regional bell telephone companies are unionized 
ray mcguire a washington labor attorney said the industrys 
relative youth has helped insulate it from unions 
cable has not been for a very long time a very profitable 
industry he said cash flow was thin at the beginning that 
changed during the 1980s and now mcguire says the unions see 
cables potential 
the united steelworkers of america found a receptive environment 
last fall at american cablevision which serves about 35000 
subscribers in the denver area tim richter and several coworkers 
drew on employees dissatisfaction over wages benefits and working 
conditions last november employees voted for the union and a 
second vote last month confirmed the previous election 
but the cable companies view labor unions warily
