prisoners including a prominent dissident thursday as part of 
president roh taewoos efforts to promote democracy the justice 
ministry said

robert f kennedy award for human rights he was sentenced in 1986 
to five years imprisonment for inciting unrest international human 
rights groups campaigned for his release 
the political prisoners were paroled from prisons throughout the 
country along with 453 common criminals the ministry said 
the political offenders were released in line with the 
governments continuing efforts to promote democracy in an 
atmosphere of national harmony it said in a statement 
the statement said kim and 45 other political prisoners were 
granted parole because they had repented for what they had done and 
promised not to violate the law again 
justice ministry officials indicated the government would free 
more political prisoners in the future if they are eligible for 
parole and show repentance 
despite the governments announcement wednesday that it would 
release the prisoners opposition leaders charged that many more 
dissidents remained behind bars 
how can we talk about reconciliation and political development 
while keeping in prison those patriots numbering more than 600 
who fought for democracy opposition leader kim daejung told the 
national assembly 
kim daejung also urged the government to punish former 
president chun doohwan and his family for alleged corruption and 
confiscate their property 
he demanded the government meet its promise of full democracy 
and accused president roh taewoo of failing to carry out some 
promised reforms 
some opposition groups claim that 1000 people are behind bars 
because of their political beliefs or opposition to the government 
the government contends jailed dissidents committed violent crimes 
or broke national seurity laws 
about 20 relatives of prisoners demonstrated wednesday outside 
the headquarters of the governing democratic justice party to 
demand the release of all prisoners police arrested and held the 
protesters but later released them

cathedral wednesday and stopped dissidents trying to take part in a 
march to chuns home in western seoul a handful of people tried to 
attend the rally but were blocked by police

were deployed across the capital to stop the march about 20 
students who sneaked past police lines hurled firebombs and rocks 
at police from the cathedral compound but authorities did not 
respond 
punish chun and drive out yankees the students 
shouted but passersby ignored the calls or urged protesters not to 
use violence 
chun who stepped down in february after a sevenyear term has 
been accused of corruption and brutality against dissidents during 
his authoritarian administration 
justice ministry officials said thursdays release left only 81 
political offenders in prison on antigovernment charges there 
also are about 480 people awaiting trial for political offenses 
they said 
included in the release were 11 south koreans from japan charged 
with spying for north korea the 11 who had resided in japan were 
arrested while visiting seoul and other parts of the country in the 
late 1970s 
the release coincided with the first anniversary of the grand 
declaration for democracy by president roh on june 29 1987 the 
declaration accepted most opposition demands for sweeping 
democratic reforms 
rohs declaration issued in the midst of nationwide 
antigovernment demonstrations paved the way for the country to 
adopt a new constitution and hold the first direct presidential 
elections in 16 years 
roh running as the government candidate beat the divided 
opposition in the dec 16 elections he then pledged to bring full 
democracy to south korea

a poll on wednesday put gov michael dukakis in 
a dead heat with vice president george bush in the presidential 
contest and a second survey also indicated dukakis was losing 
ground to his republican rival but still clinging to a lead 
a telephone survey of 1013 adults last week by abc news and 
money magazine found 45 percent support for dukakis and 42 percent 
for bush a tie given the margin of error of plus or minus 4 
percentage points 
and a gallup poll of 1210 voters suggested dukakis had the 
support of 46 percent to 41 percent for bush the margin of error 
was 3 percentage points 
by contrast gallup nbc newswall street journal and washington 
post polls conducted since june 9 have found doubledigit leads for 
dukakis the post survey done june 1519 found a 5139 percent 
dukakis margin 
the abcmoney magazine poll conducted june 2225 found support 
for dukakis down 7 points from an abcpost poll in midmay that 
used the same methodology bush rose only from 41 to 42 percent 
support those who didnt know grew from 2 percent to 6 percent 
the rest said they wouldnt vote or would support someone else 
poll analysts have said they expected the race to tighten as 
dukakis came off the crest of his democratic primary victories a 
harris survey early this month found a dead heat 4944 with a 
3point margin of error and a usa todaycnn poll gave dukakis a 
singledigit lead 
the abcmoney magazine poll had dukakis leading among women

of the gifts dublin gave itself for its 
1000th birthday few have provided as much excitement as the lord 
mayor a woman of great heart who fills the old city with 
enthusiasm charm and grace 
so successful was carmencita hederman in making the millennium 
year a hit that although her oneyear term ends july 4 an opinion 
poll in the irish times found 71 percent of dubliners want her to 
have a second 
dublins city elders the paper said should be encouraged 
that such strong views are held about who should be lord mayor in 
most years the majority of citizens couldnt care less 
she is a member of the dublin city council and its 52 members 
choose the mayor whose duties are largely ceremonial mrs 
hederman 48 was the first woman to win the office on her own two 
who preceded her were widows of lord mayors 
the city charter makes no allowance for gender so she has to be 
called lord mayor her husband billy a surgeon is the first man 
to be called lady mayoress says mrs hederman who trained as a 
linguist in europe and has five children 
her married name is a 17th century anglicizing of an irish word 
meaning lightfooted carmencita acknowledges spanish ancestry 
and her maiden name is callaghan 
mrs hederman has been a dublin councilor for 14 years always 
running as an independent because she says i like to paddle my 
own canoe 
she would like a second term in order to see the millennium 
through her chance appears slim but she has not given up 
declaring to the irish times last month all i can say is that if 
i do go down i will go down fighting 
the lord mayor has used her entree with the affluent to enlist 
commercial sponsors for millennium events thus limiting the burden 
on taxpayers her informal style whether cycling to an appointment 
or chatting with a street crowd has won the trust of all classes 
her impact was felt strongly throughout ireland in november 
when a bomb planted by the irish republican army killed 12 
protestants at a war memorial service in the northern ireland town 
of enniskillen 
she opened a condolence book that attracted tens of thousands of 
signatures when a dublin rabbi suggested she take the books to 
enniskillen she agreed without hesitation 
all these people had come in to sign and it was no good 
just sort of putting books up on the shelf and saying thanks for 
coming she said in an interview we had to do something that 
made them feel that their expression of sympathy was reaching its 
destination 
irish hearts everywhere were touched by the woman too choked to 
make a speech when she comforted the bereaved of enniskillen and 
she may have contributed to easing the suspicion northern ireland 
protestants have of roman catholics in the south 
skeptics questioned the wisdom of throwing a yearlong birthday 
party when the country was in dire economic trouble and mrs 
hederman admits it got off to a sluggish start cynics said 
there was no certainty 988 was the year the vikings founded the 
city and suggested it was all a stunt for tourists 
mrs hederman said her original wish was to delay the 
celebration for a year to allow more planning but added im 
glad now that we didnt because i think that the irish are better 
at getting things going in a hurry our temperament seems to like 
the sort of lively rush to boats 
so far the millennium has given dublin literary festivals 
regattas horse races other sporting events and street theater 
still to come are fireworks balloons and a gigantic birthday cake 
a crash cleanup has scrubbed the grime off such landmarks as the 
post office where the 1916 easter rising began a creamy new coat 
of paint gleams on the mansion house the lord mayors official 
residence 
i think the city and country were at a turning point mrs 
hederman said with record unemployment and tax levels wed 
possibly reached an alltime low and the graph was starting to go 
up and so the millennium has come at a good time 
and so say her fans has her mayoral term 
in the nicest possible way she has become the queen of 
dublin kevin b nowlan a history professor at university 
college dublin said in an interview 
in many ways irish public life is short of colorful people 
and she combines tremendous intelligence integrity and great 
personal grace

a 10yearold boy who had helped 
authorities look for his missing playmate for a week finally 
admitting killing him accidentally after the body was found in a 
crawl space under a house police said tuesday 
the disappearance of 10yearold jason daniel powell on june 20 
had aroused fears of abduction and galvanized this community of 
about 10000 some 20 miles northeast of dallas in recent years 
the bodies of several other children have been found long after 
they disappeared in the dallas area 
police and hundreds of citizens combed the rural suburb 
focusing on a wooded area two blocks from where the dead boys 
bicycle was found 
the search ended when carol cade found jasons badly decomposed 
body beneath her house monday police chief bruce beaty said jason 
died of a single gunshot wound to the head authorities said 
mrs cade had smelled a strong odor sunday and monday she 
looked in a small scuttle hole in a bedroom closet and saw jasons 
body beaty said 
after the discovery a boy who was a friend of jasons told an 
investigator he shot jason with a gun that he did not know was 
loaded beaty said in a statement 
police would not elaborate on the relationship between mrs cade 
and the boy who admitted the shooting but friends said it was her 
son no one came to the door at the cade home tuesday evening 
he just panicked he was scared sean powell 18 said of 
the boy who shot his brother he said the boy admitted shooting 
jason while they were playing in the house 
thats the only explanation i can have for it but i do 
believe him sean powell said it must have been hell for a 
10yearold kid to kill his own friend and not even know the gun 
was loaded 
the shooting took place in mrs cades living room said police 
investigator james white the 22caliber handgun apparently 
belonged to mrs cade police said 
the boys body had been dragged from the living room into a 
bedroom and then placed in a hole under the house white said 
jasons bicycle was found in a field some blocks away from the 
cade house the other boy had told authorities that he last saw his 
friend leaving on a bicycle 
the case will be referred to the rockwall county district 
attorneys office and juvenile authorities officials said the boy 
was never arrested and was returned to the custody of his family 
monday night after questioning 
gary watkins who coached the boy last year in little league 
said its just a complete shock everyone is just in disbelief 
you just cant imagine a little kid like him doing a thing like 
that 
he was always a rambunctious kid but not the kind of kid 
youd ever expect something like this from watkins said

from christmas trees to canned peas trouble is brewing 
from cherries in the trees to honey from the bees from tomatoes 
to potatoes the suffocating drought in midamerica is taking its 
toll on scores of smaller crops that could result in huge losses 
for thousands of growers 
it will affect just about everything grown from the rocky 
mountains east to ohio just about anything you consume that 
comes from these parts of the country said neil harl economics 
professor at iowa state university 
while much of the spotlight about the droughts impact has 
focused on the enormous grain and livestock industries the worst 
dry spell since the dust bowl also threatens such foods as fruits 
and oysters 
when everyone talks about programs the usda and the 
government its always corn soybeans wheat cotton and 
peanuts said harry foster secretarymanager of the red tart 
cherry growers in michigan everybody else in the world that 
grows the 200 other things theyre sort of forgotten 
michigan cherries used for baking juices and jams are 
suffering he said and the trees are beginning to show stress 
foster said about 150 million pounds of tart cherries will be 
harvested in the state in the next six weeks about 100 million 
pounds less than normal 
all across the midwest and southeast other crops hit by the 
drought could shrink supplies change diets and raise prices at 
grocery stores restaurants and taverns 
the drought has pushed barley prices higher raising the 
possibility of higher beer costs one analyst said if the price of 
barley goes through the roof the retail price of beer could 
increase by up to 4 percent 
in alabama some farmers are worried they could lose half their 
potato crop much of which is used for chips in louisiana the low 
level of the mississippi river has allowed saltwater to move 
upstream making oysters more susceptible to predators and 
imperiling next years crop said mark chatry marine laboratory 
director at louisianas department of wildlife and fisheries 
a dike is being built to block the saltwater flow 
in north georgia some honey production has dried up in 
wisconsin the pea crop has shrunk and across the midwest 
thousands of christmas trees planted this spring which wont 
mature for several years have been lost 
gene gress who runs a christmas tree farm with his wife in 
polar wis said he lost the 10000 trees he planted this spring 
because of the maturation period though consumers wont likely 
notice until the mid1990s 
other midwest growers already have talked of losses of 30 
percent of this years planting that could rise to 60 percent 
without rain in two weeks said david bauman associate executive 
director of the national christmas tree association 
the arid sunny days also will cut the number and size of 
apples tomatoes cucumbers cabbage beans and peas 
farmer richard sorenson of oregon wis said because of a 
record 40 straight days without moisture he doesnt expect profits 
from 20 acres of peas he planted 
i got 1250 pounds to the acre about a fourth of normal he 
said when i figured out the costs for seed fertilizing and 
hauling i owe 312 
and that ultimately affects canned goods producers 
stokely usa inc could be looking at a 25 percent to 30 percent 
shortfall of its normal year of 25 million cases of corn bean 
peas and mixed vegetables said stephen theobald vice 
presidentadminstration 
everything from green beans to tomatoes its all going to be 
in short supply he said the quality wont be as good the 
prices will be higher 
its one of those situations where everybodys the loser 
from the grower to the processor to the consumer

when she looks out her window lynn 
johansen sees a little boy who reminds her of the teenage brother 
she lost during a navy water training exercise 
the boy is mrs johansens 6yearold son bradley a lookalike 
for his uncle lee mirecki the 19yearold recruit who died in 
march at the navy rescue swimmer school in pensacola fla 
now nearly four months later four instructors are facing 
nonjudicial hearings in the case but mireckis family and a close 
friend said monday they still wonder why the bright young recruit 
died 
i dont think anybody really knows what happened said mrs 
johansen 30 she said she came away from the military hearing 
earlier this month a little more bewildered in trying to separate 
true fact from speculation 
mirecki was described at the investigative hearing as being 
literally scared to death when he was allegedly forced into the 
pool after he tried to quit testimony indicated he was held under 
water after he had escaped once from the pool and clung to the side 
but was dragged back during an exercise known as sharks and 
daisies it was intended to train swimmers how to break the 
strangle hold of someone they were trying to rescue 
the four instructors accepted the navy prosecutors offer for 
the nonjudicial hearings on whether they should be punished with 
pay or rank cuts or other nonjudicial action a courtmartial has 
been recommended for a fifth instructor 
the officer who was in charge of the school rejected an offer 
for a nonjudicial hearing his case will be reevaluated to decide 
whether to drop a charge of dereliction of duty or recommend 
courtmartial 
i did find a lot of things out but i guess the question that 
will always be in my mind is why didnt they let him dor or drop 
on request from the program said mireckis mother elaine kitowski 
of manitowish waters it was through the persistence of the family 
that an investigation into the recruits death was finally launched 
mrs kitowski said she misses most the jokes and humor of her 
youngest of four children lee often taped her scissors together or 
hid her keys 
he was a gogetter a very active boy said mrs kitowski 
an active soccer and baseball player mirecki moved to appleton 
to live with mrs johansen and her family for two years to be 
closer to a high school with more sports activities 
mrs johansen who has collected boxes of information about her 
brothers death said the family never sought to blame any 
individual but she said they wanted to know what had happened 
if he did die what looks to be a horrible terrifying death 
that could have been prevented ill hopefully find out enough to

unable to turn back the advancing sahara 
desert or stop periodic droughts niger has turned to family 
planning to control population growth and reduce pressure on its 
fragile resources 
the northcentral african nation has only 68 million people in 
an area twice the size of france but it cant feed itself and at 
its current growth rate the population will double in 23 years 
three and a half years ago the government strongly endorsed 
family planning an unprecedented move in this largely moslem area 
of africa just below the sahara and in april it legalized 
contraception 
the legalization of contraception is concrete proof of the 
governments support for family planning said dr halima 
maidouka diallo director of family planning in the ministry of 
health 
to counter african traditions in favor of large families and 
avoid potential clashes with some interpretations of the koran the 
moslems holy book the government presented family planning as a 
necessary move to reduce infant and maternal mortality 
nigers infant mortality rate of 135 deaths per 1000 births and 
maternal mortality rate of 7 deaths per 1000 births are among the 
highest in the world 
for a woman to be valued here she must have many children as 
soon as possible children help with work and are considered life 
insurance maidouka said 
women are considered wicked if they do not produce children 
she added 
customarily if a woman doesnt bear children a husband will 
look for another wife 
because many infants die mothers bear many children it is not 
unusual for a mother to have 15 children with only five surviving 
the frequent births become both a cause and effect women become 
pregnant again as soon as possible after delivery without time to 
fully recover and often give birth prematurely to infants who have 
little chance of surviving 
it also creates problems in schools where many young girls 
become pregnant the average age for marriage for women is about 
15 
some women seek abortions clandestinely as they are not legal 
here or go to neighboring countries 
at least once a month there is a case of a baby being 
strangled and tossed in a trash can maidouka said 
she added that suicides are also a problem among women with 
unwanted pregnancies 
the family planning program seeks to offer women an alternative 
a child if i want when i want says a poster displayed 
throughout the countrys main family planning center 
the center built with funding from the united nations has a 
large poster explaining various contraception methods the 
explanations are accompanied by explicit diagrams showing among 
other things how to use a condom 
the diagrams are necessary in a nation where only 44 percent of 
the women are literate and only 20 percent of children go to 
primary schools 
dr voahangi ravao of malagasy a staff associate of the 
columbia university center for population and family health says 
the most common reason given in a niamey survey of women who did 
not use family planning was nobody told me 
opposition by husbands was cited by only 5 percent she said 
she added that she has seen women whove walked 10 miles to pick 
up birth control pills 
she said a survey taken a year ago showed 6 to 10 percent of the 
women were using some form of modern contraception which is a very 
high rate for the sahel the region just below the sahara 
in the west african nation of burkina faso for example a 
similar survey found 4 to 6 percent of women using modern birth 
control methods 
maidouka said radio and television broadcasts in the main 
national languages will be used to reach as many people as 
possible 
the us agency for international development has approved an 
11million fiveyear grant to support the project 
in a report the agency said nigers rapid population growth 
has accentuated the processes of deforestation and 
desertification 
it added wood harvesting which provides 80 percent of the 
nations energy far exceeds the sustainable capacity of the 
forests the forested area has decreased by 30 percent over the 
last 20 years due to pressure from farmers herders firewood 
cutters and drought 
only 12 percent of the country is arable and only 3 percent can 
be used for growing crops the annual per capita income is 240 
the us agencys report concedes that even if couples were 
limited immediately to two children per family the population would 
continue to grow for 40 years because almost half the current 
population are teenagers and the agency says it is likely to take 
30 years to reach the goal of only two children per family 
the familyplanning project however doesnt even talk of 
limiting families to two children 
it focuses on how planning and spacing of pregnancies will mean 
better health for mother and child 
there is much to do maidouka said tradition is a 
problem perhaps our children will have full rights now the man is 
the boss

the mike tysonmichael spinks title 
fight may have been short but casinos are still counting their 
winnings and one owner even publicly thanked a competitor donald 
trump who put on the bout 
trumps casino reaped the big bucks but others collected 
healthy profits by simply buying a section of seats for their own 
high rollers and by selling their rooms to overflow crowds 
in fact the impact of mondays fight which tyson won in 91 
seconds with a knockout was enough to prompt del webbs claridge 
casino hotel to splurge on a fullpage advertisement in the 
atlantic city press that ran the day after the extravaganza 
we may be the smallest house in town but were big enough to 
know that when someone has the guts and vision to do something that 
benefits all of us recognition is in order the ad read so

attorney general edwin meese iii spoke at 
length at a news conference about the pentagon bribery 
investigation but never mentioned that he had removed himself from 
decisions in the case a day earlier because his own lawyers 
represent clients in the probe 
the burgeoning defense department contract fraud investigation 
was the dominant topic at meeses news conference tuesday 
afternoon generating nine questions meese told reporters that 
earlier tuesday he had briefed defense secretary frank carlucci 
who is trying to determine whether to take administrative action 
against any contractors or pentagon employees 
at the same news conference meese volunteered that he was 
recused from a justice department civil suit against the teamsters 
union because they were the main union that endorsed president 
reagan in 1980 and meese was a top campaign official 
but he said not a word about stepping aside in the pentagon 
probe 
in response to questions tuesday night from the associated 
press justice department spokesman patrick korten said meeses 
recusal was relayed to top top justice officials in a memo sent 
monday by edward dennis acting assistant attorney general in 
charge of the criminal division 
korten said meese did not mention his recusal at the news 
conference because there wasnt any particular reason to mention 
it 
korten said the attorney generals law firm miller cassidy 
larroca amp lewin keeps him informed of what clients they have 
that may have business pending before the department and in those 
cases meese recuses himself to be safe 
miller cassidy has two clients with some connection with the 
defense investigation korten said he said he did not know who 
the clients were 
the law firm represents meese in the yearold investigation by 
independent counsel james mckay into whether meese used public 
office to favor friends or companies which may have in turn 
rewarded him or his family 
meese has denied any wrongdoing mckay whose report should be 
released in two weeks is not expected to seek any indictment of 
meese though mckay is expected to refer several matters to justice 
ethics officials to see if administrative discipline is warranted 
james rocap one of meeses attorneys declined to say whether 
the firm had any clients in the defense case but did say it had a 
routine arrangement to get meese recused quickly from any cases 
involving its other clients 
although some democrats in congress have said meeses legal 
troubles including his extensive recusals hamper his ability to 
run the justice department korten said as a practical matter 
he very rarely gets involved in the specific details of any case 
so it has little practical effect 
in many law firms and in the justice department in the past 
recusal from a case barred the affected lawyer not only from making 
decisions but also from receiving briefings for fear he might 
subtly influence decisions 
asked if meese would continue to get pentagon case briefings 
korten said ill have to check with him on that recusal just 
means he doesnt make decisions 
korten said meese answered the new conference questions on the 
basis of what chief prosecutor henry hudson and ed dennis have 
indicated about the way they intend to proceed in briefings he had 
before he was recused 
at the news conference meese was asked when more information 
would be made public he replied from this stage on i expect a 
lot less information coming out rather than more until such time as 
the grand jury investigation is complete 
he added it may take longer than the 30 to 90 days he had 
earlier predicted for the first indictments to be returned 
asked if former reagan administration defense secretary caspar 
weinberger had been lax in policing contract fraud meese replied 
certainly nothing that i know about nor have i seen anything in 
what i know about the case so far that would indicate that there 
was any laxity or lapse on the part of mr weinberger 
meese has been criticized privately by some justice officials 
for applying recusals narrowly they object to his continued 
participation in the case of convicted israeli spy jonathan pollard 
while miller cassidy represents col avi sella an israeli officer 
who is charged with recruiting pollard to spy but who has never 
returned to this country for trial 
justice spokesmen say meese participates in aspects of the 
pollard case that do not involve sella

an appeals court threw out subway gunman 
bernhard goetzs sixmonth jail sentence tuesday and ordered him 
resentenced for criminal possession of a gun in the shooting of 
four teenagers 3 years ago 
the state supreme courts appellate division voted 50 to vacate 
the jail sentence justice stephen crane imposed on goetz last 
october for thirddegree criminal possession of a weapon 
the appeals court let stand the 5000 fine the 280 hours of 
community service the five years probation and the psychiatric 
counseling that crane ordered for goetz 
goetz a 40yearold electronics specialist was acquitted last 
june 16 of all but the gun charge in the shooting of four 
teenagers in a subway in lower manhattan on dec 22 1984 he said 
he shot them after they tried to rob him the young men claimed 
they were just panhandling money 
goetz did not return telephone calls 
one of goetzs lawyers mark baker said he was partly 
pleased by the decision he said he was happy that the court 
found the sentence illegal but he said he planned to appeal other 
issues in the case to the court of appeals the states highest 
tribunal 
both the prosecution and the defense contended that the 
punishment was illegal and that goetz should have been sentenced to 
a year in jail 
the defense wanted a years sentence because that would have 
made goetz eligible for release after two months because of a 
quirk in the law a sixmonth sentence would have meant he was not 
eligible for parole until four months had been served 
the prosecution also argued that the law mandated a minimum 
sentence of one year 
in their opinion the judges wrote that crane could have imposed 
a shorter legal sentence if he had explained why the sentence 
required by law would be unduly harsh 
since the court expressly stated on the record that a definite 
oneyear term or an indeterminate term would not be unduly harsh 
the split sentence was unauthorized and illegal the judges said 
in an unsigned threepage opinion

the roman catholic church is taking a new and 
more vocal role in providing political guidance to its faithful 
ignoring legal restrictions that date back to early this century 
in pastoral letters and statements to the news media bishops 
and priests have begun to attack government corruption and demand 
clean and honest elections 
other letters openly urge mexicans to reason through their 
votes in july 6 national elections and not to feel themselves tied 
to a political party 
the violation by means of fraud or repression of the right 
to to vote is more serious and harmful than any economic fraud 
the bishops of the northern city of monterrey recently said in a 
letter urging catholics to participate more actively in politics 
similar pastoral letters especially in northern mexico have 
been issued by other bishops 
no names need be mentioned 
since the early 20th century mexico has been ruled only by the 
institutional revolutionary party known as the pri and the 
government does not like the churchs new voice because it feels 
itself the target 
according to the mexican constitution written in 1917 after 10 
years of revolutionary upheaval the church does not legally exist 
cannot own any property and priests cannot vote 
to this day comments by priests with a hint of political 
overtones are criticized by politicians as violations of the 
constitution 
we became more a silent than a silenced church said 
monsignor genaro alamilla spokesman for the mexican conference of 
catholic bishops 
but the church lately has begun realizing it has a lot of power 
in the world of mexican contradictions where government leaders 
are officially atheistic but send their children to catholic 
schools marry in the church and maintain a chapel in the 
presidential residence 
outgoing president miguel de la madrid is himself a product of 
catholic schools and his children attend them 
and like other presidents before him he meets occasionally 
albeit privately with mexican bishops to discuss national problems 
during his presidential campaign pri candidate carlos salinas 
de gortari has made it a point to visit bishops in the provinces 
and discuss the countrys problems with them in meetings that are 
not publicized but leaked to the press 
he tried to gain some sort of support from the only real moral 
force in this country the catholic church said antonio alberto 
loyola a catholic lay leader and professor who is also a press 
officer for the conservative national action party the countrys 
second largest party 
loyola and other catholics believe the church is beginning to 
flex its muscle by pressuring the political system to become more 
open and democratic 
the church in mexico is beginning to awaken said manuel 
gomez director of the mexican institute of social christian 
doctrine a 5yearold privately funded organization its new 
leaders have better contact with the laity there is a new 
awareness in defense of human rights of the dignity of the 
person 
a few months ago the bishops conference issued a pastoral 
letter that said elections are a challenge to us all to 
eliminate from our social life the vices of corruption hiding of 
the truth selfishness and all sorts of violence oppression and 
threats 
but despite its increased interest in politics the church has 
been at pains not to take sides in electoral campaigns arguing 
that it is merely trying to do its duty in providing guidance to 
the fold 
the church makes the catholic aware of his human dignity and 
its civic duties and based on that he then votes monsignor 
alamilla said from the government he must demand respect for 
human rights democratic principles the common good and honest 
elections 
in mexico now there is general dissatisfaction and mistrust 
there is a crisis that demands that the citizens get involved 
actively in politics 
the church claims 90 per cent of all mexicans are catholics

every sweltering 
day folks carrying buckets thermoses and jugs turn on the outside 
tap at the ez stop convenience store and fill up 
to leone johnson providing drinking water to her customers and 
neighbors is no big deal to many living on the fort berthold 
reservation indian and nonindian it is a gesture of friendship 
deeply appreciated 
mrs johnsons store gets city water thats been filtered and 
chlorinated many of the nearby wells the only reliable source of 
water for thousands in northwestern north dakota yield brown water 
full of salt and foultasting minerals 
chemically the well water tests safe to drink but it tastes 
almost as bad as it looks said rich schilf natural resources 
director of the three affiliated tribes 
holding up a jug containing water the color of crude oil schilf 
said one of my coworkers brought this in from his house this 
morning and dared me to drink it i decided to pass 
most of the groundwater on the reservation is terrible full 
of sodium added schilf whos tried for years to get a 
longpromised federally funded water system installed on the 
reservation almost everybody hauls their drinking water if 
theyre not hooked up to the new town system 
new town the reservations population center with 1300 
residents has doubled its pumping since drought settled on this 
high parched prairie two months ago 
were pumping 600000 gallons a day to try and meet the 
demand said bill folven at the treatment plant despite new 
towns being within sight of a huge missouri river reservoir the 
town gets its drinking water from three deep wells 
the water plant sells the precious commodity by the 
quarterdollar 
you get 100 gallons for each quarter said folven who 
empties the coin box and says these days its usually full 
many people on the reservation carry big tanks on their pickup 
trucks they drive to the plant park under a pipe jutting from the 
concrete block building put quarters in the meter press a button 
and stand back as the water runs 
elmer rambel has run a commercial water delivery service around 
new town for years 
usually elmer gets his water from a spring but his filtration 
system broke so hes buying it from the city and hauling it to 
us said myrna jacobs a mother of five who deals in real estate 
with the three affiliated tribes 
usually i pay 25 for 2200 gallons to be delivered to our 
cistern but two weeks ago elmer had to raise his price to 31 
she said despite trying to be real careful and conserve water i 
had to have two truckloads of water delivered to the house last 
month and im sure it will be the same for june 
mrs johnson says she gives her water away in small quantities 
because ive lived here all my life and the people who need my 
water to drink are neighbors and friends and customers whose 
business i appreciate 
she says it doesnt matter how much higher her water bill will 
run 
its something i can do that helps she said

president reagans spokesman concedes that 
efforts to pry concessions from nicaraguas sandinista government 
have stalled and the administrations next step wont be decided 
until secretary of state george shultz returns from central america 
amid increasing reports that contra rebel troops are returning 
to base camps and with no new peace talks scheduled white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked tuesday whether reagan had 
decided to submit a new aid package to congress 
we will not have any judgment on the package until sometime 
after shultz returns from the region on friday fitzwater said 
and we dont have a specific schedule even on that 
shultz was leaving today on a trip that will take him to costa 
rica el salvador guatemala and honduras 
shultz told congressional leaders on tuesday that his trip has 
the primary purpose of shoring up the four democracies in the 
region by demonstrating longterm us support according to 
participants in the meeting 
republican congressional leaders met with reagan but house gop 
leader bob michel of illinois said the president gave no hint of 
his plans he said the issue of another contra aid package did not 
come up 
im sure that the administrations position will not be 
formulated until after secretary shultz makes his trip to central 
america and comes back again with some answers michel said 
asked to assess the status of reagan administration efforts to 
force changes in nicaragua michel replied well its 
stalemated theres no question about that 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater acknowledged that the 
administrations efforts have been thrown off stride 
the administration and the president are certainly concerned 
that weve not made any progress in the peace talks he said 
the question before us is where to go i suppose stalemated is a 
good word in that sense 
ambassador max kampelman whom reagan reassigned briefly from 
ussoviet arms talks to provide fresh diplomatic impetus to the 
central america policy joined shultz in briefing house speaker jim 
wright dtexas and other members of congress on tuesday morning 
asked what kampelman learned from the leaders of other central 
american nations about any new us military moves michel said 
they would not like to see a resumption of the war or military 
hostilities but they thought probably economic reprisals or 
pressure were needed to bring about democratic reforms in 
nicaragua 
but he added then you get into real trouble if sanctions 
hurt the common people without forcing governmental changes 
contra leaders abandoned the peace talks in managua which had 
been called for under the central american peace plan 
a ceasefire has been extended until june 30 but the contras 
have said they do not want to return to any negotiations in 
managua saying they felt intimidated by the sandinistas there 
rebel leaders said the sandinistas virtually demanded that the 
resistance lay down its arms without any guarantees for democratic 
reform 
michel said that in the capitol hill meeting wright did 
respond that at some time down the road here he would honor a 
request of the president for whatever move we might want to make 
but he said if i were asked a question you know is it 
possible to get a military package through the house right now i 
would have to be very negative on that at the moment 
wright describing the shultz meeting said the secretary says 
what he really wants to do is to shore up and reinforce our 
commitment to the success of the four democratic countries in the 
region 
the speaker called the discussion a sign of a shift in 
emphasis by the administration

congressional investigators have learned that 
attorney general edwin meese iii is a frequent flier on fbi 
executive aircraft but the bureau wont say where he goes or what 
he does 
rep glenn english dokla who is directing an inquiry into 
meeses use of fbi aircraft says the secrecy raises concern that 
the administration may be trying to keep embarrassing information 
from public view 
english also says that from what hes learned so far it appears 
at least some of meeses travel may have violated president 
reagans mandate to fly on commercial airlines when it is cheaper 
for taxpayers 
at englishs request the general accounting office the 
investigative wing of congress asked the fbi to supply flight logs 
showing where its aircraft had flown and who had been aboard 
the request was part of a larger review by the englishchaired 
government operations subcommittee on government information 
justice and agriculture to determine whether the vip aircraft owned 
by various federal agencies could be put to better use in the war 
on drugs 
instead of the fbi aircraft logs gao was given a summary that 
provided details about aircraft use by fbi and other justice 
department officials but only dates and the notation usag for 
meese 
the entire document was stamped classified keeping it from 
public view 
the report showed that between june 3 1986 and may 11 1987 
meese used an fbi aircraft 40 times compared to 37 trips for all 
other fbi and justice officials according to a committee staffer 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
during this same period fbi director william webster used the 
aircraft only six times one of them a joint trip with meese 
according to the staffer 
patrick korten meeses spokesman said there were no 
improprieties in the attorney generals travels but he would not 
comment on why details of the trips are being withheld from 
congress and the public fbi spokeswoman sue schnitzer said the 
bureau had no comment 
english who has asked the gao to make another attempt to get 
details of meeses travels said he has serious doubts that 
classifying all information about the aircrafts use meets the test 
of protecting us national defense or foreign policy interests 
the questionable use of the classification system to protect 
information relating to the attorney general raises a concern that 
classification is being used to keep embarrassing information from 
public view he said 
the committee staffer said the fbi is refusing even to reveal 
the aircrafts make and model however a separate committee source 
said documents indicated that most if not all of the trips were 
made on the bureaus sabreliner a twinengine executive jet made 
by rockwell 
the use of such government aircraft is governed by circular 
a126 an oct 5 1983 white house policy statement that prohibits 
use of vip airplanes when cheaper commercial transportation is 
available 
the circular requires that when an agency uses one of its 
aircraft to carry passengers it must file a written justification 
showing that the cost does not exceed the price of flying 
commercial 
english said that it is not at all clear that the attorney 
generals use of the aircraft conforms to federal regulations 
it appears likely that some of the attorney generals travel 
utilizing the fbi aircraft could have been accomplished more 
economically on commercial airlines 
it does not appear that the department of justice has complied 
with circular a126 in regards to the use of the fbi aircraft by 
the attorney general he said 
korten said that mr edwards is wrong when he suggests that 
the attorney general may have violated applicable orders whenever 
mr meese travels it is for reasons that comply with the 
applicable order 
asked about meese using the aircraft more than the fbi korten 
said i dont have anything on that

us relations with mexico are never 
harmonious even in the best of times and a recent episode involving 
mexicos handling of a puerto rican separatist wanted by the united 
states is bound to deepen mutual distrust 
mexico ignored a us request for the extradition of william 
morales 37 and instead granted him early release last friday from 
an eightyear prison term he was then deported to cuba 
mexico views morales as a man who was persecuted in the united 
states for his political views the united states sees him as a 
terrorist and says he was involved in more than 50 bombings in the 
us that resulted in widespread death and injury 
morales had been sentenced to more than 100 years in prison but 
escaped from us custody in 1979 he fled to mexico where four 
years later he was convicted in the killing of a police officer 
despite strong us interest in the case mexico did not 
formally notify american officials of morales release and 
deportation until five days after his arrival in havana safely 
beyond the reach of us authorities 
the us ambassador to mexico charles pilliod has been 
recalled to washington for consultations but it seems unlikely the 
administration will take significant retaliatory action against 
mexico 
the main argument against economic sanctions is that they harm 
the united states as much as mexico by increasing the flow of 
undocumented aliens the administrations options appear to be 
limited 
a key role in the morales case apparently was played by foreign 
secretary bernardo sepulveda it was he who formally rejected the 
us extradition request overriding a ruling last december by a 
mexico city judge 
sepulveda ranks as perhaps the state departments most disliked 
foreign minister one official said sepulveda and assistant 
secretary of state elliott abrams have a shoot on sight 
relationship 
sepulveda is not a favorite of secretary of state george p 
shultz either at one point several years ago shultzs aides 
considered contriving an excuse for shultz to back out of a 
scheduled meeting with sepulveda to spare him what promised to be 
an unpleasant encounter but shultz went ahead with the meeting 
anyway 
much of the usmexican hostility is based on mexicos support 
for nicaraguas leftist government and to a lesser extent the 
rebel movement in el salvador mexico and cuba and more recently 
panama are nicaraguas strongest supporters in the hemisphere 
sepulveda is described here as an advocate of selling oil to 
nicaragua at concessional rates even though nicaragua has a 
reputation as a poor credit risk 
this has put sepulveda at odds with mexican ministries 
responsible for economic matters american officials say that on 
two occasions vessels carrying mexican oil to nicaragua were 
called home before reaching their destination on both occasions 
sepulveda was overruled by president miguel de la madrids 
financial advisers 
sepulveda has maintained that the united states made a big 
mistake by supporting an armed insurrection against the sandinista 
government he has said cooperation with nicaragua would make it 
more likely to pursue moderate policies he views with disdain 
president reagans assertion that failure to oppose the sandinistas 
eventually could raise the prospect of a leftist uprising in mexico 
itself 
despite the lack of trust the administration was caught by 
surprise when mexico released morales and allowed him to go to 
cuba white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the decision an 
inexplicable affront 
state department spokesman charles redman said morales violent 
criminal past was so selfevident that his release and deportation 
could only have been taken for political reasons 
the two countries can only hope that a change in administration 
in both will lead to a more harmonious relationship mexico will 
elect a new president next month and the united states will do the 
same in november new teams and perhaps new approaches will be 
in place by early next year

kuwaits ambassador to the united states says 
40 sophisticated fa18 fighterbombers his country plans to 
purchase would be worthless if congress refuses to include 
airtoground missiles in the sale 
this weapon is not a luxury it is a necessity ambassador 
saud n alsabah said in an interview its like buying a car 
without all the equipment that goes with it 
congress is reviewing the administration plan to sell 19 
billion worth of fa18s and armaments to kuwait which says it 
needs the equipment to defend against attacks by participants in 
the nearly 8yearold iraniraq war 
three us allies have been authorized to buy fa18s the 
navys newest and fastest combination interceptorbomber but 
kuwait would be the first arab nation to receive them 
the height of capitol hill concern about the sale is not the 
planes but the 300 maverick antitank and antiship missiles that 
would be mounted on the aircraft 
the 20 senators and more than 50 congressmen who signed a letter 
expressing reservations about the sale say they are worried about 
the escalation of sophisticated weaponry in the region notably 
among countries potentially hostile to israel 
alsabah said he believes the sale will go through but added 
you cannot have an airplane flying without munitions unless 
there is sufficient ammunition to support this hightech equipment 
you would be buying something that in the end would be worthless 
were not buying the aircraft to fly around in our leisure 
he said you could buy a much cheaper aircraft for that purpose 
the defense relationship between the united states and kuwait 
has grown in recent months with the reflagging of kuwaiti 
vessels to put them under the umbrella of us naval protection 
in a visit designed to highlight the extent of the relationship 
kuwaits crown prince and prime minister shaikh saad alabdullah 
alsalem alsabah will come to the united states in early july 
it will be the first state visit by a kuwaiti leader since 
november 1968 and will include meetings with president reagan vice 
president george bush congressional leaders and members of the 
us foreign policy establishment 
when kuwaits emir came 20 years ago he met president lyndon 
johnson and presidentelect richard m nixon there are no plans 
for shaikh saad to meet the expected democratic presidential 
nominee massachusetts gov michael dukakis but the ambassador 
said a gettogether could be arranged if dukakis is interested 
we have been on the front pages for the past 18 months or two 
years now the ambassador said i think the us people have 
the right to find out what kuwait is all about to know the leaders 
of kuwait and to hear what they have to say 
shaikh saad is especially eager to draw attention to kuwaits 
view that the deployment of us and allied vessels in the persian 
gulf does not merely help kuwait but safeguards the worlds oil 
shipments the ambassador said 
the message will be that the united states should stay the 
course as long as the gulf war continues and especially during 
the transition to the next us administration alsabah said 
he predicted that the next administration whether it be 
democrat or republican would maintain the policy but there is 
always a reevaluation 
as for the chance of a peaceful settlement between iran and 
iraq the ambassador said we see no light at the end of the 
tunnel every time our hopes are raised that this war is winding 
down we are faced with a new offensive or counteroffensive

the government is being asked by a national 
consumer group to create a new standard for lowerfat lite ice 
cream 
ellen haas executive director of public voice for food and 
health policy said tuesday the food and drug administration will 
be asked to set up three standards regular ice cream having at 
least 10 percent milkfat lite ice cream 4 percent to 6 percent 
and ice milk 2 percent to 4 percent 
currently an icecream type dessert with less than 7 percent 
fat must be labeled as ice milk and the term ice cream is 
reserved for those having a fat content of at least 10 percent she 
said 
historically ice milk has been the stepchild of the ice cream 
industry haas said few are aware of its comparative 
nutritional benefits yet fda regulations do not permit marketing 
of a product called lite ice cream which could be used to 
stimulate sales of all lowerfat ice cream products 
also the public voice petition to fda asks that manufactures 
who use the new standard would have to provide nutrition 
information on the package and the label would have to state as a 
percentage how much less fat the lite product is compared with 
regular ice cream 
in other words lite ice cream would contain 40 percent to 60 
percent less fat than ice cream and ice milks margin would be 
even greater 
haas said nearly a dozen health and medical groups have endorsed 
the proposal for lite ice cream 
support also came from two trade associations the milk industry 
foundation and the international ice cream association a 
spokeswoman becky davenport said the associations planned to file 
their own petition with fda but would call for a slightly greater 
range of fat in lite ice cream 5 percent to about 7 percent 
the national milk producers federation which represents dairy 
farmers and their cooperatives has not had an opportunity to study 
the proposal by public voice and would reserve comment until later 
said spokeswoman doni dondero 
public voice is tackling ice cream after recently succeeding in 
getting the agriculture department to change the name of leaner 
us good beef to us select as a way of attracting more 
favorable consumer attention 
creation of a lowerfat ice cream standard would be good for 
everyone haas said consumers would be better informed about a 
healthier dessert choice the industry would benefit from the 
increased marketability of a product with clear nutritional 
advantages 
how about the taste of lite ice cream 
ive tasted it and its just as good haas said in a 
telephone interview its a lighterfeeling taste its not as 
rich but i think the american palate has become light and the 
health concerns are more important than the gooey concerns 
lite ice cream would be most distinctive eaten in a cone or 
otherwise unadorned that way she said moving down from ice cream 
with 10 percent to 15 percent fat to 5 percent or 6 percent would 
produce a noticeable difference to the eater 
but if used in a sundae or banana split with plenty of 
toppings lite ice cream becomes one of those gooey concerns 
and probably wouldnt be noticed

melvyn r paisley a central figure in the 
pentagon bribery investigation zipped through a quick senate 
confirmation seven years ago without many questions about his 
background and with nothing but praise from a leading senate 
military expert 
paisley was confirmed to a top navy job after a nineminute 
hearing on nov 18 1981 which was attended by only two of the 17 
members of the armed services committee 
one of those two was the late sen henry jackson dwash long 
one of the senates loudest advocates of a strong military 
jackson who died in 1983 was frequently called the senator from 
boeing because of his military stances 
paisley spent 28 years at boeing before joining the navy in 
1981 after six years in that post he resigned in april 1987 about 
the same time as his mentor navy secretary john lehman 
paisley opened a private business as a defense consultant and 
was hired quickly by some of the nations top defense contractors 
now he is a target of the investigation into allegations that 
defense contractors and consultants many of them former military 
men bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that could 
be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars no charges 
have yet been filed in the case 
soon after president reagan took office paisley was appointed 
assistant secretary of the navy for research engineering and 
systems 
there have been allegations the fbi was told during a background 
check for the appointment that paisley had been involved in making 
questionable payments or gifts while he was at boeing the 
allegations were made by a former associate of paisleys at boeing 
by his exwife and by his exsisterinlaw 
but none of that information is apparent from the brief hearing 
on nov 18 1981 it ended with approval of paisleys nomination on 
a voice vote the full senate approved paisleys nomination five 
days later 
the fbi has refused to release results of the background check 
citing privacy restrictions 
sen carl levin dmich a member of the armed services 
committee has asked the fbi for that record but hasnt yet 
received a reply willie blacklow a spokesman for levin said 
tuesday levin was not on the committee in 1981 
levin also asked the white house for its file on the paisley 
nomination but the request was rejected for unspecified reasons 
blacklow said 
the senate was controlled by republicans in 1981 and former sen 
john tower rtexas was chairman of the armed services committee 
attempts to contact tower were unsuccessful tuesday 
scott maxwell a spokesman for sen sam nunn dga the current 
armed services chairman said committee staff members were unable 
to find a letter from paisleys exsisterinlaw warning against 
paisleys confirmation 
the hearing transcript from paisleys confirmation gives no hint 
of any controversy 
only two senators were present jackson and roger jepsen the 
iowa republican who was acting as chairman of the committee 
jackson who died five years ago said paisleys work at boeing 
had given him the experience and great management skills that are 
essential for research and development work for the navy 
paisley was asked only two questions both of them relating to 
potential future navy problems 
in his brief prepared statement paisley said the navy had too 
many programs in research and said he wanted to reduce that number 
because we are stretched too thin to be able to carry out all 
these programs both efficiently and effectively with the resources 
we can hope to obtain in the years ahead 
in fact the navy was on the verge of four years of sharp budget 
increases as it moved toward a 600ship fleet that was part of 
president reagans record peacetime military buildup 
paisley told the panel that we have too many programs in rampd 
research and development that do not get into production it is 
very difficult to select those programs that are going to continue 
into production and i think we have to prove that process 
having selected a program we must move it rapidly into the 
fleet he continued it takes much too long to put a program 
into the fleet it just takes much too long

former navy secretary james h webb says he 
learned last fall of a massive fraud investigation and deliberately 
kept defense secretary frank c carlucci in the dark figuring the 
fbi would tell him when it wanted to 
webb in a telephone interview tuesday also said he was told 
from the start that former navy official melvyn r paisley was a 
central figure in the probe and that a member of his 
headquarters staff was under scrutiny 
webb said he wasnt told and didnt ask the identity of the 
official on his staff under investigation 
fbi search warrants suggest the navy official is james gaines 
the deputy assistant secretary for acquisition management 
webb said he never attempted to discuss the matter with carlucci 
because that wasnt my job 
this was a very closehold report involving an investigation 
being conducted by the fbi with the nis naval investigative 
service cooperating not the department of defense he said 
my view was that if the fbi wanted to tell carlucci they 
would tell him how should i know whether they wanted to tell him 
why should i get tangled up in all that 
pentagon spokesmen have said carlucci did not learn of the probe 
until june 13 the day before fbi agents began executing search 
warrants at the pentagon and elsewhere around the country 
the former navy chief added he was originally told the 
investigation would probably be completed by last christmas but 
it kept getting delayed because the net kept expanding 
webb a vietnam war hero lawyer novelist and former assistant 
defense secretary became the secretary of the navy in april 1987 
after the resignation of john f lehman jr who had held the post 
for six years 
paisley was an assistant secretary of the navy and one of 
lehmans top aides he left at the same time lehman did and 
established a defense consulting business 
i was in fact briefed about this last fall webb said 
and i was then periodically updated on it by the chief of the 
naval investigative service 
i was told that with respect to the navy paisley was the 
central figure i was also told an individual still on my staff was 
under investigation 
after the briefing webb said he did two things 
i told them i didnt want to know who it was on my staff but 
please try to hurry up and get the investigation done if that was 
the case webb said i didnt like the idea of someone 
committing felonies when im trying to reorganize with new people 
and i also asked the nis to communicate to the fbi my concern 
that if they were investigating paisley it be for substantive 
matters because of paisleys relationship with lehman i didnt 
want it to appear to be a witch hunt 
according to the justice department the nis began the current 
investigation two years ago and then called in the fbi justice 
officials say the inquiry centers on allegations that pentagon 
executives took bribes from private military consultants who were 
seeking classified contract information for defense contractors 
webb said his knowledge of details of the investigation always 
was limited 
asked if he was told there were other central figures 
working for other armed services or on the pentagon staff webb 
replied no comment 
webb also said that long before he knew of the investigation he 
canceled a consulting contract between paisley and the navy that 
allowed paisley to keep his security clearance for supersecret 
black program information 
the consulting arrangement was established shortly before webb 
took over as navy secretary webb said he canceled it as soon as he 
learned of its existence less than a week after assuming office 
the arrangement kind of bothered me the access to black 
information for a consultant webb said

the senate sponsor of a 25 billion child 
care expansion bill says hes willing to compromise on some parts 
of the measure but wont give up on minimum national standards for 
day care providers 
sen christopher dodd dconn told two governors urging 
continued state regulation of day care that they would be shocked 
to find the tremendous disparity in standards from state to state 
dodd later said he would not abandon the minimum health safety 
training staff ratio and other standards called for in his act for 
better child care or abc bill in favor of standards meant to 
serve as models for the states 
you are deluding yourself if you believe model standards get 
used he told reporters theyve got to be more than that 
dodd chairman of the senate labor and human resources 
subcommittee on children family drugs and alcoholism held a 
hearing a luncheon two panel discussions and a reception tuesday 
to discuss the abc bill 
threefourths of the abc money would help pay day care expenses 
for families making less than 115 percent of a states median 
income the remaining money would be for training and salaries of 
child care workers renovation of facilities and referral programs 
for parents 
money would only be available to day care homes and centers that 
met minimum federal standards developed by an advisory panel the 
bill is supported by scores of groups representing women children 
labor and medical personnel 
the leadoff hearing witnesses govs bill clinton of arkansas 
and thomas kean of new jersey representing the national governors 
association said they are anxious for a day care initiative this 
year even if it is less generous than the plan envisioned by dodd 
dont pass nothing just because you cant get as much money as 
you want clinton a democrat told sen tom harkin diowa 
after harkin said child care boosters would never be able to get 
25 billion 
whatever way you can help us we need that help added kean 
a republican whatever money you give us will be put to 
extraordinarily good use 
clinton and kean asked dodd to reconsider several aspects of the 
abc bill most of them the same provisions that have sparked 
criticism from conservative lawmakers and lobbyists 
the governors concerns included the mandatory national provider 
standards as well as eligibility standards for day care aid with 
the cutoff at 115 percent of median state income some families 
making 40000 would qualify 
clinton and kean also said the private sector should be given 
incentives to play a bigger role in day care and states should be 
able to use federal money flexibly perhaps through a broad child 
care block grant 
dodd said he would continue working with the governors on his 
bill he told reporters that it could be argued that weve gone a 
little too high on the income eligibility standards but said he 
wants lower middle income taxpayers to support the program 
were trying to reach up to those people who dont fall 
into the poverty category but still need some assistance dodd 
said theres a substantive need as well as a political 
justification for giving these people some help but its not a 
yuppie bill the bulk of this assistance goes to people who are in 
desperate need of help 
over 100 child care bills are pending in congress introduced by 
lawmakers from all across the political spectrum some offer tax 
incentives to businesses to start child care centers while others 
offer tax credits to all families with preschool children one bill 
would increase the existing social services block grant and 
another would limit provider liability through insurance risk 
pools other proposals involve vouchers for poor families and aid 
to providers for capital improvements

dizzy gillespies big band appearing after 
intermission tuesday at carnegie hall in the jvc jazz festival was 
exciting driving crisp and bright 
gillespie himself in his utterances im in new york now i 
got to show off in conducting with a hip wiggle and in playing 
his bentbell trumpet brought joy to the tuesday night concert he 
followed a brief set by marlon jordan 17yearold trumpeter from 
new orleans and his mainstream quartet and an hour by singer 
carmen mcrae who was in a joyless mood 
gillespies band began on a peak of musical excitement with 
toccata from gillespiana suite composed by lalo schifrin 
the four french horns used in that piece then left the stage to the 
17piece band which sustained the pace with emanon dizzy said 
he composed it for a recording in the 1940s and named it no 
name backwards 
trumpeter jon faddis played exceedingly high and fast with 
absolute definition and clarity in a night in tunisia dizzy 
introduced that one as a tune closely associated with me over 
many many many decades mainly because i wrote it it has 
withstood the visicitudes of the contingent world and moved in an 
odyssy into the realm of the metaphysical 
saxophonist sam rivers was warmly melodic in round midnight 
the concert ended with some bop for big band gillespies 1940s 
things to come 
miss mcrae sang for all we know and inside a silent tear 
with depth of feeling for the lyrics but conveyed a lack of joy in 
what she was doing 
her usual pianist eric gunnison was joined by bassist george 
mraz and drummer al foster who were on an album she has cut of 
thelonious monk songs 
they were joined for seven interesting monk songs by the 
outstanding saxophonist clifford jordan 
most of the monk songs she sang had lyrics by jon hendricks 
they included ruby my dear ugly beauty monks dream

the white men who 
took the wests land and water from the indians promised their 
treaties would last as long as the grass grows and the water 
flows 
this year no grass grows and no water flows on the fort 
berthold indian reservation 
but the summers devastating heat and lack of rain has special 
bitterness for the almost 4000 members of the three affiliated 
tribes who live on the reservation they feel longbroken promises 
by the government helped destroy a way of life that might have 
allowed them to weather the drought 
the elders who are enduring 106degree days and cloudless skies 
atop sunbaked missouri river bluffs remember the 1930s drought 
before the big dams came then mandan hidatsa and arikara indians 
lived in the river bottoms and were nearly selfsufficient through 
the great depression 
we were welloff by the standards of people trying to survive 
off agriculture recalled jim danks an indian rancher we had 
irrigated community gardens meadowlands planted in hay and clover 
and flooded by spring runoff which we used to feed our cattle and 
we mined coal and harvested timber off the riverbanks to stay warm 
in the winter 
we sold vegetables and our homemade jellies and wild fruit to 
white settlers who came down to the river from the upper lands so 
the only things we bought were flour sugar and baking powder 
unemployment was less than 3 percent nearly everybody lived 
on the reservation and the word welfare was unknown to us 
said danks 
those were just dry years for the tribes not devastation 
because of the resources we had from the river now living without 
its blessings we are facing devastation if it doesnt rain pretty 
quick 
today danks like all tribal members still on the millionacre 
reservation must live high above lake sakakawea on the treeless 
flat prairie he has no irrigated hay meadows or clover no 
naturally watered gardens no coal no timber in a year of scant 
but normal rainfall his 300 cows and their new calves barely 
prosper on 6000 acres of owned and rented land 
danks five sons like half the tribes members have had to 
find jobs elsewhere each tried ranching past droughts and 
unrelenting debt doomed them they are now scattered from north 
dakota to arizona collecting paychecks on construction sites 
most of the ranchers my age weve barely managed to hold 
things together said danks 61 i never thought this kind of 
drought would happen again in my lifetime this one could take the 
final equity weve managed to hold onto and flush it down the 
drain i wonder if i can salvage anything 
danks is descended from generations of farmers hidatsas 
arikaras and mandans were riverbottom agrarians when explorers 
meriwether lewis and william clark the first of many white men who 
wanted something showed up seeking food in 1804 
nearly 150 years later washington ordered the tribes to move to 
high ground and abandon their traditional life congress forced 
them out to create lake sakakawea behind the giant garrison dam 
one of five built in montana and the dakotas after world war ii to 
tame the missouri the government said it needed to drown the 
indians bottomlands to halt spring floods downstream create a 
navigable channel through middle america and generate power 
as the dams gates closed and the waters rose the indians 
reluctantly accepted 24 an acre and moved to the bluffs in 
exchange for promises of a vast irrigation system first crack at 
the new reservoirs water cheap electricity a hospital and two 
bridges across the river to keep the tribe united 
today despite attempts by the sons and daughters of dead chiefs 
to force lawmakers to honor broken promises they have one bridge 
no irrigation no hospital and they pay the same electric rates as 
others in the region some residents have no water some endure 
brown turbid stuff pumped from wells and many more must store 
expensive hauled water in cisterns its too expensive for the 
tribes to pump water from the lake below the bluffs 
tribal leaders estimate unemployment on the reservation at 70 
percent they say half the households receive federal assistance 
and women head onethird of the families 
tribal leaders say that of 90 indian families recently involved 
in farming only 40 are active the rest are in foreclosure have 
retired or have given up jim danks is hanging on but for how long 
had the government come through with all its promises we the 
tribes could have made it we could probably have even gotten 
through this drought in pretty good shape said danks we 
absolutely believed it would all come true when we left the river 
but the politicians never even introduced the measures into 
congress 
now ive seen three generations sit out here and not get a 
single drop of water from that reservoir except what we can haul 
away in our buckets to make coffee now i think it was all a hoax 
right from the start 
danks estimates hes got the patience the grass and the water 
to last 60 days longer after that if theres been no rain hell 
have to get rid of his cattle no matter how low the price 
surveying his stunted hay crop his thirsty animals and the 
distant shimmering water of the missouri river danks said 
god i miss those early days down on the river they were 
such good days

a senate committee wants to curtail the 
authority of the presidentially appointed corporation for public 
broadcasting and give much of the federal money for public 
television directly to the tv stations 
senate advocates of the proposal say it would better insulate 
programfunding decisions for public tv from politics and address 
complaints from independent producers who want more of the public 
tv programming money 
the proposal part of a package of changes in the way federal 
money is distributed to public tv stations was approved 
unanimously by the senate commerce committee on tuesday as an 
amendment to cpbs funding for fiscal years 199193 some of the 
changes would take effect earlier 
the measure now goes to the senate floor 
a similar cpb budget bill in the house expected to be approved 
by an energy and commerce subcommittee today contains none of the 
senate panels proposals but the house panel may consider changes 
that would give independent producers greater access to public tv 
funds 
the senate committees proposed changes have divided the public 
broadcasting community cpb says the measure would have dire 
consequences while the public broadcasting service the private 
organization of public tv stations that provides programming to 
members stations supports the bill 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii said he proposed the changes 
because of concerns that cpb funding decisions are not 
sufficiently insulated from political influence since cpb board 
members are appointed by the president 
he also said he was concerned about complaints from independent 
producers that they lack access to the public broadcasting system 
but sen jay rockefeller dwva said he was concerned about 
how the proposal would affect national programming the heart of 
the public television system 
the changes would fund public television in much the same way 
national public radio is financed 
under the measure about 80 percent of the 37 million that now 
goes into cpbs national programming fund would be distributed 
directly to stations for the purchase of national programs cpb 
would be left with about 85 million which it would spend on new 
programs 
committee staff members say that under the proposal cpb would 
have about 2 million more than it now spends on new programs the 
proposal would not be able to support a program for more than four 
years out of this fund 
after four years a program would have to find its support from 
public tv stations and other sources the theory is that if the 
stations like the program they will buy it and continue support 
for it 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said the changes would give local 
public tv stations more control over the programming they broadcast 
and allow them to serve their communities better 
these local stations are much more sophisticated than they 
were 20 years ago he said 
but with the end of cpb as a central funding office the 
stations would have to find another mechanism for pooling their 
money to support national programming posing a risk to the entire 
public tv system cpb said 
cpb said the proposal would leave it with only about 8 million 
of the 19 million it had intended to spend in fiscal 1990 on 
programs for children and minorities and programs by independent 
producers 
we simply wont be able to fulfill promises made in this 
bill cpb president donald ledwig said in a statement 
there is no guarantee that television program funds going to 
stations will be reaggregated at the same level of national program 
support posing a dangerous threat to the longterm identity of 
public television in an increasingly competitive environment 
but pbs president bruce l christensen said the bill would 
enhance the independence of the programming process he said 
the measure reflects the ability of local public broadcasting 
licensees to make programming decisions that best serve the needs 
of their communities

a shortage of staff attorneys is causing the 
federal aviation administration to have more and more difficulties 
following up on the growing number of safety violations its 
inspectors uncover government officials say 
inspector general john w melchner of the department of 
transportation told a house subcommittee tuesday that it often 
takes the faa an inordinate amount of time to process cases 
against people or companies found to have violated safety 
regulations about 45 percent of the cases have been open for more 
than a year he said 
melchner told members of the house public works committees 
investigations and oversight subcommittee that the number of 
violations discovered by faa inspectors has more than doubled from 
28864 in 1984 to 63391 in 1987 
despite that growth the faa added only 17 additional lawyers to 
handle the growing volume of cases he said 
faa administrator allan mcartor agreed complaining that 
although the faa has been building up its force of safety 
inspectors the number of attorneys who handle the problems that 
are discovered has not kept pace 
it will do us little good to continue to increase our 
inspector levels if we cannot attain the necessary complement of 
lawyers to take enforcement actions against safety violators 
uncovered by our inspectors mcartor said 
melchner said the number of faa inspectors has grown from 1320 
in 1984 to 1930 last year and there are plans to hire 1028 more 
by 1991 inspectors examine the operations of airlines and 
privately owned aircraft airports and service companies 
faa spokesman fred farrar said there are 129 faa lawyers 
sixtyeight of them work in field offices across the country and 
handle most of the violations uncovered he said 
mcartor said his agency has probably its highest backlog 
ever of cases its lawyers are trying to pursue he said he did 
not have statistics about the backedup cases 
at the same hearing melchner faulted the faa for inadequately 
investigating complaints from three ryan air service pilots that 
the alaskan airline pressured them to make overloaded flights 
one of the three pilots who unsuccessfully had sought immunity 
from the faa in exchange for testimony about falsified flight 
records was later among 18 people killed in an accident that was 
blamed on an excessively heavy load of passengers and cargo 
as a result of the ryan air crash the faa official who decided 
against granting immunity to the pilots was reassigned the faa 
changed some of its investigative procedures and the government 
halted ryan airs flights 
melchner told the subcommittee that his investigation of the 
faas response to the pilots complaints did not find a 
wellcoordinated aggressive safety enforcement program in place in 
the alaska region 
melchner also said he could not explain why the faas counsel 
who was responsible for alaska donald boberick decided not to 
grant immunity to the pilots 
according to melchner a ryan air mechanic approached faa 
officials in september 1986 on behalf of the three pilots asking 
for immunity for the pilots in exchange for testimony about false 
information they said was being supplied about flight loads 
one of the pilots was killed when a ryan flight crashed at 
homer alaska last nov 23 that flight was later found to have 
been overweight by 460 pounds 
last january the anchorage daily news reported that the three 
pilots had made their offer to the faa the article sparked 
melchners investigation the results of which were sent to mcartor 
in march

house tax writers are moving toward completion 
of a catchall bill that would hand out billions of dollars in tax 
breaks raise corporate levies to pay for them and fix hundreds of 
mistakes in the 1986 income tax law 
the panel on tuesday okd 56 billion in corporate tax hikes 
over the next three years to offset tax breaks the panel plans for 
farmers and others 
the committee is scheduled to decide today on another tax hike 
a proposal to take away some of the tax breaks given for 
singlepremium life insurance 
critics say studies show the policies with taxfree earnings 
and interestfree borrowing back from the premium are a shelter 
for the wealthy but the insurance industry has been lobbying to 
limit any crackdown 
the committee needs to raise taxes to pay for the revenuelosing 
provisions it included in the bill such as repealing the 
requirement that farmers and other offroad users of diesel fuel 
pay the 151 cent per gallon federal tax 
on tuesday the panel voted 
to squeeze 24 billion from defense contractors and some large 
construction companies by repealing an accounting method that 
allowed them to delay taxes until longterm projects are completed 
to raise 15 billion by gradually reducing the tax deduction 
for dividends received by corporations owning less than 20 percent 
of another company 
speed up tax collection from companies with incomes that vary 
widely from year to year raising 869 million 
repeal tax rules that were designed to benefit corporations of 
alaska natives but which the committee said were being abused and 
would cost the government 825 million over the next three years 
the committee also voted to extend with some changes a tax 
formula designed to encourage us corporations to conduct their 
research and development in this country 
the decisions were all made by voice vote according to 
committee staff members who briefed reporters after the session 
the underlying reason for the tax bill this year is to correct 
hundreds of errors included in the massive 1986 tax overhaul many 
of them are technical such as incorrect legal citations

a major defense contractor has developed a 
tiny computer chip that can be used to keep track of potential 
invaders killer bees 
engineers for martin marietta known for producing mx missiles 
and laserguided artillery shells developed the tracking chip at 
the oak ridge tenn national laboratory the bethesdabased 
company said tuesday 
the microchip about the size of a halfcarat diamond and 
weighing about as much as a grain of salt is part of an integrated 
circuit that would be attached to captured bees midsections 
the device powered by nine solar cells can transmit an 
infrared signal that can be picked up by a ground station up to a 
mile away 
what weve done so far is establish that the bee could 
indeed fly with the chip attached said ed aebischer a spokesman 
at the laboratory the entomologists have looked at it and 
theyre convinced that its workable 
a working killer bee transmitter is expected to be in the field 
by next year 
killer bees which are aggressive but generally not deadly are 
the descendants of africa queen bees since escaping from a 
brazilian laboratory in 1957 they have migrated as far as southern 
mexico and are expected to cross into texas as early as next year 
scientists hope that by being able to track the insects they can 
control the migration without using large quantities of pesticides

instead of spending thousands of dollars 
for a surveyor to settle a longstanding border dispute the towns 
of ashford and willington plan to resort to an old new england 
tradition walking the line 
after local officials balked at the 40000 cost for a survey 
an arbitration panel suggested they resort to the method used for 
centuries by new england farmers to reestablish property lines 
each spring after winter weather demolished sections of the stone 
fences dividing their fields 
the three selectmen from each town tentatively plan to walk 
about 20 acres of disputed land on july 6 and decide among 
themselves where the border should be ashford first selectwoman 
paula faulkner said tuesday 
what will happen when we walk the line im not sure 
faulkner said 
poet robert frost immortalized the annual ritual among farmers 
in his poem mending wall connecticut statute once required 
that officials from neighboring towns also walk the line every 10 
years to maintain boundaries said albert fitzback a surveyor and 
member of the courtappointed threemember arbitration panel 
ashford which measures 40 square miles was incorporated in 
1714 and has 3400 residents willington a town of 35 square miles 
with 5000 residents was incorporated 13 years later dairy 
farming is the principal industry in the northeastern connecticut 
towns 
at issue is an 8milelong 1milewide strip that the general 
assembly took from ashford when willington was incorporated 
ashford authorities contend the border originally was drawn as a 
straight line but willington officials have relied on markers 
placed in 1916 that create a slight jog in the line 
the crooked line was used for years in countless deeds and other 
documents apparently without argument from either town 
but in 1985 ashford ordered an aerial survey of the town as 
part of a property revaluation and reverted to the straightline 
border thereby claiming the 20acre wedge as its own the new line 
straddles about a dozen properties and some residents are receiving 
tax bills from both towns 
the towns went to court last year and a superior court judge 
appointed the arbitration panel to settle the dispute 
the panel spend months poring over land records including a 
1726 map stored in willingtons vault the map appeared to show a 
straight line in the disputed area and the panel eventually 
concluded that the line has always been and should remain a 
straight line 
the panel suggested the towns pay for a survey to set the 
border but local officials didnt want to spend 40000 for it and 
asked for another way faulkner said 
douglas vonasek who is now paying taxes to both towns on his 18 
acres of land said he doesnt care which town his property ends up 
in as long as its only in one of them 
id like to see this thing settled once and for all said 
vonasek who figures the dispute is costing him about 100 a year 
in extra taxes 
it remains uncertain whether walking the line will resolve the 
dispute 
willington assessor joan l leblond questioned the accuracy of 
ashfords aerial survey showing the boundary as straight and said 
the crooked border has been accepted since 1916 such longtime 
unchallenged use should constitute the legal boundary she said 
i say let sleeping dogs lie leblond said im sure there 
are many towns where the boundaries jog a little bit theres 
nothing that says it has to be a straight line 
but susan m sibiga a former ashford selectwoman who has 
researched the matter extensively is just as adamant that the new 
straight line should be upheld 
we spent a lot of time on this and the map clearly shows it is

the owners of a possible prison site that is the 
subject of an fbi investigation for its selection deny any improper 
dealings with massachusetts gov michael dukakis or any member of 
his administration 
meanwhile dukakis the likely democratic presidential nominee 
insisted tuesday the state would not pay one dime more for the 
land in new braintree mass than it is worth 
at issue is whether daniel striar and gary jacobson received 
insider information that prompted them to offer to the state for 
95 million in 1986 land they had bought a year earlier for 32 
million 
striar and jacobson said they had no idea until february 1986 
exactly a year after they signed a purchase and sales agreement for 
the 782 acres of property and three months after they bought it 
that the state was interested in the land as a prison 
new braintree residents who have opposed the proposed prison in 
their town for two years have accused striar and jacobson of 
acting as middlemen between the former owner the seventh day 
adventist church and the state which has a severe shortage of 
prison space 
instead of pursuing it in a legitimate fashion new braintree 
residents chose to take a series of trivial and irrelevant facts 
and make them appear as if they were dirty and sinister jacobson 
said 
jacobson 50 lived for several years in dukakis neighborhood 
in brookline during his teens he also has contributed to dukakis 
gubernatorial and presidential campaigns 
but jacobson denied he is a close associate of the governor 
im probably the only citizen of brookline who is not claiming to 
be the closest friend of governor dukakis he said 
striar 52 has been linked to dukakis through a september 1986 
dedication ceremony for a stoughton jewish community center named 
after striars parents dukakis and striar attended the ceremony 
but striar said he uttered one word to the governor hello 
dukakis appearing at a housing promotion event in boston said 
i didnt know striar i didnt have the slightest interest in 
who the owner of the property was he added that i think that 
the business of throwing charges around is absurd 
striar defended the 95 million asking price 
i looked at this piece of property and i felt it was a 
steal said striar who has participated in a number of real 
estate ventures with jacobson 
dr jacobson who is a psychiatrist and i decided to buy the 
property as a real estate speculation striar said he said the 
town stood in the way of their development efforts forcing them to 
entertain the states offer a year later to buy the property for a 
prison 
dorothea thomasvitrac a new braintree selectman said the town 
did oppose some of the condominium and recreational development 
proposals put forth by striar and jacobson but she said the town 
never opposed their original plan to use the land for a psychiatric 
hospital 
striar and jacobson also said they have had no contact with the 
fbi

since ending his second term as pennsylvania 
governor in 1986 dick thornburgh has hardly retreated from the 
public eye 
thornburgh 55 has been heading the institute of politics at 
harvard universitys kennedy school of government he has been 
asked to head the fbi and the agency for international development 
and he has been busier than ever on the political circuit back home 
all that visibility helps fuel talk of thornburgh as a potential 
running mate for republican presidential nomineetobe george bush 
thornburgh also has been said to be considering running for 
governor again when democrat robert casey comes up for reelection 
in 1990 
hes a politician his longtime aide david runkel said in 
a telephone interview he has not closed the door on another 
campaign for something 
the bush campaign has said it is too early to speculate about 
the search for a running mate and thornburgh said there is little 
he can do whether he wants the job or not 
you dont campaign for the office of vice president theres 
only one vote that counts and thats the vote of the candidate 
thornburgh told reporters recently in state college pa 
im sure the vice president is concentrating on his own short 
list of prospective candidates but i think its really quite 
premature for even speculation to be undertaken because of the fact 
that i think he will factor in the choice made by the democrats in 
atlanta thornburgh said 
the republican convention does not begin until august 15 in new 
orleans the democrats meet a month earlier in atlanta 
if thornburgh were asked he says it would certainly be 
something i would give serious consideration to 
thornburghs recent activity has included two fund raisers that 
have netted about 100000 for the governor thornburgh 
committee an account he uses to support his travels on behalf of 
other candidates runkel said 
in addition thornburgh is cochairman of pennsylvanias 
victory 88 a fund that distributes money for phone banks and 
other republican campaign efforts 
victory 88 which has 30000 in the coffers now is hoping 
to raise 600000 by bringing bush to pennsylvania for fundraising 
events in august republican officials said 
the possibility of a bushthornburgh ticket has excited 
pennsylvanias republican convention delegates many of whom have 
named the former governor as their top choice for the second spot 
on the ticket 
hes the most outstanding governor ive served under and ive 
been here for 24 years said republican state rep james gallen 
of shillington who won a delegate spot in the april primary 
gallen said it would make sense for thornburgh to be picked by bush 
since hes from pennsylvania and its a key state 
us rep william clinger rpa said thornburgh would help 
neutralize the support of massachusetts gov michael dukakis in the 
northeast and especially in pennsylvania where democrats enjoy a 
voter registration advantage of more than 500000 
but other delegates said thornburgh might be too similar to bush 
to form a wellrounded ticket both are yale university graduates 
who maintain ties to the northeast thornburgh as a pennsylvanian 
and bush as a parttime of resident of maine 
in 1975 thornburgh served under president ford as assistant 
attorney general in charge of the justice departments criminal 
division 
he was staunchly loyal to the reagan administration frequently 
testifying on capitol hill on behalf of the presidents proposal 
for lineitem veto power and a constitutional amendment to balance 
the budget he turned down offers to head the fbi and aid and was 
considered for margaret hecklers health and human services cabinet 
post in 1985 
as governor thornburgh said his budget proposals held spending 
increases to less than the rate of inflation for eight straight 
years he championed a controversial welfare reform law that 
limited an estimated 68000 people considered ablebodied to 
three months of cash benefits a year

tigrean rebels have claimed that ethiopian 
warplanes killed more than 600 civilians in air raids on an ancient 
market town during the governments twomonthold counteroffensive 
the guerrillas said tuesday that the strikes by four mig fighter 
bombers and two mi24 helicopter gunships were unleashed on 
wednesday june 22 in hauzien 340 miles north of addis ababa the 
capital 
wednesday is market day in hauzien and hundreds of peasants are 
traditionally drawn to the town 
the attack wounded more than 360 people and killed hundreds of 
animals said the rebel communique sent to the associated press 
from the tigre peoples liberation front information center in 
london 
there was no way to independently verify the claim the 
government of president mengistu haile mariam rarely comments on 
rebel claims and both sides often exaggerate reports on the war in 
northern ethiopia 
the communique said much of the town was razed in a sixhour 
bombardment 
most of the buildings over 500 including nine stores and 15 
shops the town mosque and the only school were completely 
destroyed said the rebel report 
they claimed the ethiopian government uses rockets and napalm 
phosphorous and cluster bombs in attacks on numerous tigrean towns 
western diplomats based in addis ababa say they have heard of 
the government using cluster bombs but not napalm 
the dergue government is committing these atrocities in a 
region suffering from starvation the rebels said 
the us government and diplomats from other western countries 
have condemned a government counteroffensive begun in may that has 
crippled relief operations and jeopardized the lives of 32 million 
people threatened by starvation from drought in the neighboring 
provinces of eritrea and tigre 
the war zone is the most severely affected by a drought that 
plagues more than 7 million ethiopians 
but diplomats similarly accuse the rebels of pursuing military 
objectives with no regard for drought victims the rebels launched 
their offensive at the end of last year after the united nations 
warned of impending famine in the region rebels won major 
victories in march capturing several towns and forcing government 
troops to withdraw from others 
mengistu inherited the insurgencies when with a clique of army 
officers he helped overthrow emperor haile selassie in 1974 
both the government and rebels are marxist eritrean 
secessionists took up arms 27 years ago and are fighting africas 
oldest civil war tigrean rebels went to war 14 years ago demanding 
more autonomy

an official disgraced three years ago for 
alleged corruption is back in the limelight as one of cantons 
rising stars yet another example of chinas penchant for reviving 
its politically dead 
lei yu 54 earned nationwide notoriety in 1985 when official 
media accounts said he and other topranking officials on southern 
hainan island were accused of abusing power by importing vehicles 
and consumer goods and reselling them at high profits to the rest 
of china 
lei was demoted from his leading party and government posts on 
the undeveloped tropical island between vietnam and the 
philippines and become a countylevel party deputy secretary in 
southern guangdong province 
but on march 31 the official xinhua news agency announced that 
he had been promoted to vice mayor of canton in charge of foreign 
economic relations and trade assisting economic growth in two 
counties lei had learned among other things never to loaf on 
the job the report said 
on monday the canton peoples congress voted lei one of six 
vice mayors of the guangdong capital a leading city in chinas 
economic reform program 
he received the second most votes of the nine candidates 
newspaper reports appearing in the nearby british colony of hong 
kong said tuesday 
four days earlier the congress chose yang ziyuan as mayor by a 
318153 tally over lei according to newspaper reports in hong 
kong before the vote lei reportedly reminded the congress of his 
mistakes in the hainan affair in a wellreceived speech and threw 
his support yang 
in an interview at cantons municipal offices two weeks ago it 
was clear why lei is back he displayed an agile nononsense mind 
and enthusiastically espoused the marketoriented economic reforms 
of senior leader deng xiaoping 
wearing a welltailored western suit and exuding confidence lei 
seemed cut in the mold of communist party leader zhao ziyang who 
has taken the lead in promoting dengs reforms 
deng and zhao also have experienced disgrace and rehabilitation 
both were purged during the chaotic 196676 ultraleftist cultural 
revolution accused of being capitalist roaders and paraded 
through the streets in dunce caps countless others were purged 
during the decade of disaster 
leis disgrace was different however it resulted not from a 
political power struggle but from economic scandal 
according to official chinese reports the scandal involved the 
illegal trade of 33 million cars color televisions video 
recorders and motorcycles which were imported to hainan island in 
1984 and 1985 then resold throughout china 
under a program to spur development hainan had been allowed to 
import automobiles and 16 other luxury goods the items were 
intended for use only on the island but lei and others decided to 
resell them resulting in millions of dollars in profts the 
reports said 
a western source in canton said he believed lei thought the 
importation scheme could raise money to build up hainans 
infrastructure which is woefully lacking as such many believed 
lei was punished more for his unorthodox methods than for economic 
corruption 
during my stay in hainan i wanted to boost the islands 
economy lei was quoted as saying in the xinhua report but 
things went contrary to my wishes because i did not take hold of 
the state policies 
lei reiterated during his interview with the associated press 
that he did not get one cent out of the importation scandal 
still he acknowledged that he let things get out of hand 
at that time we were short of experience so it was not 
strange that we sometimes made mistakes he said adding with a 
smile i believe ill be a little smarter than before

gerald olsonawski plowed under all but 
300 of the 1700 acres of wheat he planted in the spring the crop 
struggled then withered on minnesotas thirsty prairie the upper 
section of americas breadbasket 
weve gone through all that work and now the whole year is 
shot said olsonawski 39 its like a wasted year its like 
we never turned a wheel 
you should see beautiful fields all you see is black dirt 
ive given up on the grain crop said olsonawski 
last year minnesota produced about 100 million bushels of 
spring wheat worth 246 million second only to north dakotas 189 
million bushels according to the states agricultural statistics 
service spring wheat is the high protein variety ground into 
flour for yeast breads and hard rolls 
this year 85 percent of the crop is rated poor to very poor 
the state said monday damage is even worse in parched kittson 
county in the northwest corner on the canadian border 
county officials estimate a loss of 7 million bushels 90 
percent of the crop already 60000 acres have been plowed under 
an acre that should yield 40 to 50 bushels of wheat is projected to 
produce half a bushel according to insurance appraisers 
lush solid waves of grain should be filling fields now they 
look like desk tops dotted with stubbly stalks and revealing bare 
spots wheat that should be 8 to 12 inches high with grainbearing 
heads have wilted to half that size 
this crop has failed said kelly turgeon the countys 
executive for the agricultural stabilization and conservation 
service its not even feasible to try to harvest it its 
devastating 
a majority of the countys farmers have federal crop insurance 
they are paid damages for what their land is producing and what it 
should have yielded but the payments probably will just cover 
expenses for fertilizer fuel and time 
for grain farmers the nations worst drought in 50 years was 
the last straw in a hectic year they had a killing frost may 13 
and then saw high winds blow away seeds and injure crops 
after a farmer has invested time and money on plowing seeding 
and fertilizing plowing a crop under is hard 
but harold younggren 61 was told his wheat harvest would be 
half a bushel per acre instead of 45 to 60 bushels he and his sons 
looked at the scraggle in the arid fields figured it would cost 
more in fuel and time than it was worth and then plowed under all 
but 40 acres of the 1550 acres of wheat they planted in late april 
there wasnt anything there theres a few spears of grain 
here and there younggren said 
weve never torn up grain like this before said younggren 
a farmer for 40 years the heat burned it right off it dwindled 
to nothing 
statewide the picture is a little brighter but not much 
a 50 percent loss has been projected amounting to 200 million 
to 300 million according to fred hejduk head of the minnesota 
wheat growers association in red lake falls 
the overall situation is very serious and almost beyond 
repair said hejduk some fields are totally devastated it 
doesnt pay to crank up the combine 
a wheat farmer may have spent 150 an acre to plant seed and 
fertilize that acre should return a 75 profit 
plowing it under means theyve failed said bernie penner 
conservation service agent in crow wing county how would you 
feel as a surgeon if all your patients died a farmers expertise 
is raising crops he only gets one chance each year 
wheat is such a part of the lifestyle in the fertile grain belt 
that wallpaper in offices and restaurants is decorated with wheat 
stalks 
and a drought seems incongruous in a state with a license plate 
slogan of land of 10000 lakes and where the mighty mississippi 
begins 
but hot winds and a dry spring meant grain cooked under a 
sweltering sun 
farmers plow under their fields to control weeds get their land 
ready for next season and keep unprofitable plants from using up 
nutrients 
some farm officials wish the farmers would just let the wheat 
stay in the fields instead of risking wind erosion remindful of the 
1930s dust bowl 
were advising them to just leave it there said marlin 
schieffert conservation service agent in clay county its so 
dry its susceptible to be blown by the wind

a cleaning accident at a metal platings 
plant unleashed deadly cyanide fumes that killed four men 
including three who collapsed trying to save coworkers and 
injured 20 others 
the bastian plating co plant remained closed today after air 
samples showed 5 parts per million of cyanide fumes near the tank 
where the workers died tuesday 
ten parts per million can affect the central nervous system 
causing breathing difficulties nausea and confusion said trooper 
robert corkwell a hazardous materials officer for the state 
police a concentration of 300 parts per million is fatal he said 
company officials believe a worker used muriatic acid a 
commercial term for hydrochloric acid and zinc oxide to clean a 
5foottall tank when the lethal hydrocyanic acid formed corkwell 
said an independent lab later determined sulfides also were 
present he said 
investigators have not determined whether the worker used a 
standard procedure that went awry or whether the wrong chemicals 
were mixed corkwell said 
craig fogel 19 was critically injured fifteen of the injured 
were rescuers wearing selfcontained breathing units who were 
affected by the gas because it can be absorbed through the skin 
corkwell said 
the first worker collapsed inside the vat and three others in 
succession apparently tried to pull their coworkers to safety 
police say 
investigators dont know who mixed the chemicals or the order in 
which the victims died auburn police detective david bundy said 
he might be able to tell us when he comes around bundy 
said referring fogel who was in critical condition at parkview 
memorial hospital in fort wayne after undergoing hyperbaric oxygen 
treatment 
bastian vice president dennis fry said he was unsure how many 
workers were in the plant when the accident happened the plant 
employs about 30 people to make dyes and chromate dip used to give 
electroplated products a decorative color 
dekalb county coroner dr william hathaway identified the 
victims as baron w sweet 21 of garrett larry d hensinger 29 
of waterloo william m freeze 29 of garrett and jeffery link of 
auburn links age was not available 
two other workers ron alwood 48 of auburn and patrick cramer 
22 of garrett were listed in fair condition at parkview memorial 
sharon cramer said her son had told her he tried unsuccessfully 
to pull one of his coworkers out of the fumes he was trying to 
help one boy out and he lost consciousness she said 
cramer has worked at the plant as a stacker since january but 
is determined to quit his job she said the first thing he said 
to me was i wont work there anymore mrs cramer said

attracting fairgoers into otherwise routine exhibit halls 
but the idea also attracted criticism by health food advocates 
and some residents who complained that the contest would set a bad 
example for children 
county supervisor helen rudee once a registered nurse also 
criticized the event calling it the dumbest thing ive ever 
heard of 
but engdahl said the winner who will be selected by the fair 
board doesnt necessarily have to eat junk food the main thing is 
to lounge in a recliner remote in hand under the eyes of 
fairgoers 
the true test is if you can talk to the press and watch 
professional bowling at the same time engdahl said

a rift between two east bloc allies 
grew to unprecedented proportions when romania ordered a hungarian 
diplomat expelled in a dispute over romanias treatment of its 
ethnic hungarians 
romania on tuesday ordered hungarys consul general in the city 
of clujnapoca to leave the country within 48 hours and declared 
the consulate closed the official hungarian news agency mti said 
the decision apparently was prompted by a demonstration of about 
50000 hungarians in budapest monday to protest the planned 
demolition by the year 2000 of half of romanias villages 
including ethnic hungarian communities 
it was the largest street demonstration in hungary since soviet 
troops put down a 1956 rebellion 
clujnapoca is in transylvania in northwestern romania where 
most of that countrys 17 million ethnic hungarians live 
hungarians know it as kolozsvar 
ethnic hungarians in romania the largest minority group in east 
europe outside the soviet union long have complained that they 
suffer discrimination and are denied ethnic rights 
romania and hungary neighbors and military allies in the 
sovietled warsaw pact have waged a war of words over the issue 
official hungarian media have given considerable coverage to 
protests by political social and artistic groups against romanias 
village demolition program 
president nicolae ceausescu of romania on tuesday rejected 
criticism of the plan and accused hungarian authorities of actively 
supporting the unofficial protest 
the resettlement plan calls for 7000 of romanias 13000 
villages to be torn down and replaced with agriculturalindustrial 
centers 
romanian staterun media said the goal is to gain more farmland 
for use by the countrys collectivized agriculture which is 
plagued by lack of incentives for farmers and livestock fodder 
shortages 
romania also maintains the plan will raise the living standards 
of villagers who would have access to health care and social 
facilities 
mti said foreign minister ioan totu of romania summoned 
hungarian ambassador pal szuecs tuesday and told him of the 
expulsion order 
all responsibility for this violation of the valid consulate 
agreement between hungary and romania devolves upon the romanian 
government mit said it said the hungarian government would work 
to improve relations with romania and the 20000 ethnic romanians 
in hungary 
hungary has given refuge to thousands of ethnic hungarians who 
have fled romania and also taken in other romanians escaping 
economic hardship 
romania began an austerity program in 1981 that has led to food 
and energy shortages it has reduced its foreign debt from more 
than 11 billion in 1981 to less than 5 billion but at the 
expense of its people 
earlier tuesday hungarian foreign ministry spokesman istvan 
komoroczky told journalists that hungarian authorities had told the 
romanian embassy in advance of mondays demonstration 
the demonstrators marched silently past the romanian embassy 
building which was guarded by hungarian police and there were no 
incidents 
the hungarian government and speakers at mondays rally stressed 
that a change of existing borders is out of the question under the 
1920 trianon treaty predominantly hungarian transylvania became 
part of romania

democrats are trying to figure out how to get 
35000 people slated to attend the partys national convention into 
a hall that will seat only 11000 people 
the democratic national convention committee is hoping to 
peacefully resolve the problem by putting the overflow from the 
omni coliseum into the adjacent world congress center but admit 
the feelings of party hotshots may be hurt in the process 
well have fewer spectator seats in the omni and there are 
going to be people who are disappointed they arent going to be in 
the omni said ruth berry press secretary for the dncc which is 
in charge of organizing the july 1821 event 
the seating problem is one of a series of difficulties in 
preparations for the nominating convention but officials are 
certain all will be right when the opening gavel sounds 
democratic national chairman paul kirk said we knew there 
would be limited space but it is adequate to accommodate all the 
delegates and additional guests it will be a little difficult for 
the media this is not a sprawling complex the omni but its not 
a theater in the round

bernhard goetzs sixmonth jail sentence was 
declared illegal by an appeals court which ordered that he be 
resentenced for criminal possession of a gun in the 1984 subway 
shootings of four teenagers 
the state supreme courts appellate division voted 50 on 
tuesday to vacate the jail sentence justice stephen crane imposed 
on goetz on oct 19 1987 after he was convicted of thirddegree 
criminal possession of a weapon 
the appeals court let stand the 5000 fine 280 hours of 
community service five years probation and psychiatric counseling 
for goetz ordered by crane 
goetz a 40yearold electronics specialist was acquitted last 
june of all but the gun charge in the dec 22 1984 shootings 
goetz who is white said he shot the four blacks after they tried 
to rob him the youths claimed they were just panhandling money 
the case stirred a national debate about vigilantism 
defense attorneys said they were pleased the sentence had been 
rejected but would appeal other issues to the court of appeals the 
states highest court 
we will be asking the judge at this point to grant bernie 
goetz the right of probation defense lawyer barry slotnick said 
hopefully he added the public will write some letters of 
indignation to judge crane indicating that bernie goetz doesnt 
belong in jail whether it be for one day two months or six 
months 
slotnick said goetz cannot come out worseoff under resentencing 
by crane scheduled for july 18 
the prosecution and the defense contended that the punishment 
was illegal and that goetz should have been sentenced to a year in 
prison 
the defense wanted a year sentence because that would have made 
goetz eligible for release after two months under the sixmonth 
sentence he would not have been eligible for parole until four 
months because of a quirk in the law 
the prosecution argued that the law mandated a minimum sentence 
of one year for thirddegree criminal possession of a weapon 
the appeals court judges agreed in part with the prosecutor 
assistant district attorney gregory waples 
an individual who is convicted of this offense must be 
sentenced to an indeterminate period of imprisonment or in the 
alternative a definite sentence of no less than one year the 
judges said 
crane could have imposed a shorter legal sentence if he had 
explained why the sentence required by law would be unduly 
harsh the judges wrote 
since the court expressly stated on the record that a definite 
oneyear term or an indeterminate term would not be unduly harsh 
the split sentence was unauthorized and illegal the judges said 
in an unsigned threepage opinion

pale and tired anwara begum was 
frying grains of wheat while her two small sons hovered around her 
makeshift little stove in a relief center for hundreds of flood 
victims set up at a school 
mummy we are hungry give us food one of the naked little 
boys cried 
their father 45year sanu miah stood by helplessly tears 
welling in his eyes and running down his wrinkled cheeks 
we have had very little to eat since floods destroyed my 
house he told a visiting reporter tuesday the children are in 
especially terrible condition 
his wife anwara had fashioned a primitive stove from an empty 
powdered milk can her children about 6 and 8 were so hungry she 
had not taken time to grind her grains of wheat into flour 
miah clad in a torn sarong was among 500 people who sought 
shelter at the at the syed saiduddin high school after 
monsoonswollen rivers surged through villages and fields around 
noapara little more than a railway stop on the train line from 
dhaka the capital to sylhet 200 miles to the northeast 
an estimated 13 million people more than 10 percent of 
bangladeshs population of 105 million have been stranded or 
displaced by floods 
in the past week at least 39 people have died in this country 
shredded by hundreds of rivers that surge over their banks every 
year when the monsoon rains come about half the deaths were in the 
sylhet area 
in noapara about 95 miles northeast of dhaka the syed 
saiduddin school has suspended classes to offer shelter to people 
whose homes were washed away or damaged by the floods 
a few blocks from the school are the remains of the railroad 
bridge that was swept away on sunday making noapara the last stop 
for travelers from dhaka trying to reach nearby sylhet the 
commercial center of dhakas teagrowing district 
roads throughout sylhet and the surrounding districts of 
sunamganj and moulvibazar in the far northeastern corner of 
bangladesh were also washed out or still under water 
miah who owns no land and hires himself out as an unskilled 
laborer from day to day does not know what he will do next he has 
not decided whether to try to rebuild his house in rasulpur 
village seven miles east of noapara or to seek a new life 
elsewhere 
he said the flash floods arrived with a loud bang and swirled 
waisthigh through his mud and straw house 
but his neighbor 55yearold muzaffar ali has decided to 
return home and try again noapara is a hilly area where flash 
floods cascade through the villages and fields and quickly recede 
as the water surges downstream 
the refugees said thousands of mud and straw houses had 
disappeared in the flood 
i am leaving the camp since water is no more there in 
rasulpur ali said surrounded by his frail 40yearold wife 
and their three sons and two daughters 
what shall i eat and what shall i gather for my children he 
asked a vacant look on his face i have no land to till even 
still the people around noapara appear to have been luckier 
than countrymen in lowlying areas rivers continue to rise in 
flatter areas in the interior of the sylhet and sunamganj districts 
news reports in dhaka say at least 800000 people have been 
stranded by flooding in the sunamganj district alone 
the floods coupled with communication and transportation links 
that are erratic even in dry weather in bangladesh hamper relief 
efforts 
in noapara some private citizens and organizations have tried 
to provide relief according to mohammad ali a shopkeeper at the 
train station no local government officials could be located for 
comment on the situation when a reporter from dhaka visited noapara 
in dhaka officials said earlier in the week that tens of 
thousands of people perhaps more have taken refuge in government 
relief centers 
but the task is daunting bangladesh with a per capita income 
of about 150 a year is one of the worlds poorest nations last 
year more than 1200 people died in floods 
in 1985 more than 10000 people died in hurricanes and tidal 
waves that swept over low islands in the bay of bengal on the 
countrys south coast

a mysterious hearingimpaired boy 
found walking the streets of this border city nearly eight months 
ago is finally going home after a tearful reunion with his mother 
hes very excited and he has already packed his things and is 
ready to go olivia espinosa bermudez director of a child 
welfare agency here said following tuesday nights reunion between 
the boy known to the world as sabath and his mother 
authorities said it would take three days to officially confirm 
through medical records that the little boy is 9yearold jose de 
jesus garcia aguilera but said he and micaela aguilera de garcia 
appeared to be mother and son 
ms aguilera said she plans to take the boy back to his gulf 
coast hometown of tampico mexico where his grandmother and four 
siblings live 
however she said she might later send jose back to the child 
welfare agency where he has been staying the past seven months so 
he can learn to speak and use sign language 
i work and if i take him hell run away again ms 
aguilera 32 told reporters as she hugged the tearyeyed boy 
nicknamed chuy i know that here my boy is safe because hes 
been here all this time 
she said she might allow a juarez couple to adopt her boy but 
just if they give mepermission to see him 
ms aguilera has described jose as a chronic runaway and said 
he last ran away while visiting his father in october in monterrey 
750 miles southeast of juarez 
he was found nov 7 roaming the streets of juarez across the 
rio grande from el paso texas 
workers at the welfare agency the center for the development of 
the integrated family were stumped as to the boys origins because 
he can only speak a few words and communicates mostly through 
gestures and drawings they named him sabath because he was found 
on a saturday sabado in spanish 
reporters on tuesday night watched as mother and son 
communicated through an impromptu sign language ms aguilera 
obviously was familiar with the boy is deaf in his right ear and 
has some hearing in the other 
why do i think this is my son ms aguilera asked because 
of his scars on his leg his head and his left arm 
she pointed to a scar below joses left knee and said it was 
from a dog bite bad dog she said in english bad dog the 
boy answered in a deep voice and the two laughed and hugged 
just before their first reunion earlier in the day jose was 
shown pictures of his mother and grandmother and immediately 
recognized them said mrs bermudez 
when ms aguilera was brought into the room he just ran and 
saw her and cried but he was happy mrs bermudez said 
ms aguilera was accompanied to juarez with her sister marta 
lorena aguilar paredes and an el paso times reporter who found the 
family in tampico the reporter went there last week after learning 
that a woman there had reported a missing son matching the boys 
description 
the times paid for a chartered flight to the el paso area 
tuesday the newspaper offered to fly the family back but ms 
aguilera said she would prefer to take a bus said publisher tom 
fenton 
the search for the boys origins extended into the united states 
and even france after child welfare agency workers noticed the boy 
preferred us food and cartoon characters they notified their 
texan counterparts and the fbi got in on the case 
some of joses drawings seemed to indicate he had survived a 
plane crash but those drawings now seem to be the work of an 
active imagination the family lives near the tampico airport and 
social workers said jose seemed attracted to airplanes and the 
juarez airport

congress is calling on the federal trade 
commission to crack down on fraud in telemarketing sales over the 
telephone which is estimated to cost consumers at least 1 
billion a year 
by a voice vote the house passed a measure on tuesday directing 
the ftc to draft rules governing sales by telephone and to make it 
easier to sue telemarketing companies 
the bill says the agency should consider including provisions 
that establish refund rights for customers and a period during 
which consumers can withdraw their order and set a time of day when 
unsolicited calls can be made 
the ftc estimates that telemarketing sales in 1986 amounted to 
more than 100 billion the agency however has been able to get 
back only about 25 million for defrauded consumers over the past 
four years rep thomas luken dohio said 
no piece of legislation is going to end fraud luken said 
during debate on the bill monday but i think this bill will 
significantly reduce the losses now being suffered by american 
consumers

a federal racketeering lawsuit accusing 
teamsters leaders of making a devils pact with the mafia is a 
shameful attempt at unionbusting teamsters officials charged 
federal prosecutors filed the civil lawsuit against the 16 
millionmember union tuesday seeking to oust members of the 
teamsters general executive board for allegedly allowing mob 
infiltration during the past 30 years 
the lawsuit also sought appointment of a union trustee to ensure 
free and fair union elections 
we are not seeking overall control of the teamsters union 
us attorney rudolph giuliani said adding that his office was 
using the racketeering laws in a surgical way to attempt to take 
back from the mafia the teamsters union 
william doran head of criminal division for the fbis new york 
office cautioned this is not a case of unionbusting but instead 
a case of mobbusting 
but teamsters leaders quickly denounced the lawsuit 
its pure myth that this organization is in any way influenced 
or controlled by organized crime teamsters lawyer john climaco 
told a news conference in montreal where the unions general 
executive board is holding its quarterly meeting 
its totally unamerican and its wrong 
the unions acting president weldon mathis called the lawsuit 
a vicious antilabor attack and a shameful attempt to destroy 
a democratic union it will not be tolerated 
the lawsuit also was denounced on capitol hill where sen orrin 
hatch the ranking republican on the senate labor and human 
resources committee said it sets a terrible precedent 
if there are union officers who are corrupt or are connected 
with the mafia then the government should come down on them with 
dispatch hatch rutah said in a speech on the senate floor 
but i have great difficulty in the trusteeship of an entire 
international union i dont think the government or any court in 
this nation is capable of being a trustee over a union 
sen paul simon dill echoed hatchs remarks i think were 
getting on very very thin ice here he said 
two years ago the government used a similar lawsuit to place 
teamsters local 560 in union city nj under the control of a 
courtappointed trustee 
the former head of that local called the current lawsuit a 
groundless attempt by the reagan administration to break the 
american labor movement 
they want to cripple the teamsters like 560 i dont think 
theyll be successful said michael sciarra president of the 
9000member local from december 1984 to june 1986 
its a dark day for labor he said i believe the 
republicans are out and theyre looking for jobs for their friends 
its all political they always go after the strongest 
dave beck who preceded jimmy hoffa as teamsters president from 
195257 said if there is corruption in the union it has no 
influence over the great mass of the teamster organization 
beck 94 now living in seattle denied the allegations of 
pervasive corruption in the union 
i dont think theres any merit to that at all and if so 
theres been a terrific amount of inefficiency by the factors of 
government from the national level clear on down said beck who 
served 2 years in prison for embezzlement

the english language diminishes 
nationalism among filipinos and tends to turn them into stammering 
secondrate people says a committee ordered by the senate to list 
the qualities of filipinos 
the committees report says a colonial mentality selfishness 
lack of discipline lack of initiative and lack of selfanalysis 
are major weaknesses of filipinos 
it says some of these traits are extremes of filipinos better 
qualities which include caring for others strong family ties 
humor religiosity industry and adaptability 
the report released tuesday was prepared by social scientists 
from the university of the philippines and the jesuitrun ateneo 
university it blames some of the countrys ills on the countrys 
colonial past 
the islands were ruled by spain for more than 300 years until 
the united states took over in 1898 the americans through a 
public education system patterned after their own imparted to 
filipinos the english language 
but the report says the use of english in this country of more 
than 7000 islands and about 80 indigenous languages and dialects 
has caused more harm than good 
english as the medium of education has defilipinized the 
youth and taught them to regard american culture as superior the 
report says 
thinking in our native language but expressing ourselves in 
english results not only in a lack of confidence but also in a lack 
of power of expression imprecision and stunted development of 
ones intellectual powers we ought to use filipino in our 
cultural and intellectual life and filipino should be the medium 
of instruction in all levels of education the report adds 
filipino or tagalog now is the medium of instruction in grade 
school and part of high school but english remains the main medium 
in college 
at the prodding of sen leticia ramos shahani the 23member 
senate directed its committees on education and social justice last 
september to conduct a study on ways of arresting philippine 
societys moral decay 
it said in a resolution that despite hopes of change immediately 
after the february 1986 people power revolution that sent 
president ferdinand marcos into exile graft and corruption 
nepotism lack of patriotism passivity and increasing crime 
continue to plague society 
these social ills instead of being mere memories from the 
past seem to have become even more ingrained in the character of 
the filipino so much so that many have commented that the 
problem has become endemic the resolution said 
mrs shahani said that the report entitled a moral recovery 
program building a people building a nation was the result of 
nine months of research including a nationwide survey of 2000 
people 
philippine society right now is sick mrs shahani said 
we are a society in crisis there are so many silent emergencies 
happening 
the report says filipinos desire to put family ahead of the 
common good is often the root of corruption and abuse of economic 
and political power 
and it says filipinos depend too much on authority and generally 
do not move until told what to do 
filipinos tend to be complacent and there rarely is a sense of 
urgency about any problem the report goes on there is a high 
tolerance for inefficiency poor service and even violations of 
ones basic rights 
in many ways it can be said that the filipino is too patient 
too easily resigned to his fate filipinos are thus easily 
oppressed and exploited 
the report says one way of solving the slide in morality is for 
both government and business leaders to be models of the positive 
traits of the filipino 
it suggests public and private offices organize national 
reflection weekends and encourage employees to attend them 
voluntarily 
on the problem of colonial mentality it says the countrys 
history must be taught from our perspective and the government 
should embark on education programs to instill patriotism and 
national pride

light aircraft suddenly swooped down and landed on the newly formed 
sandbar in the middle of the river the onlookers oohed and ahhed 
as the craft paused on the sandbar for a moment and then took off 
looking like a huge dragonfly as it hovered just a few feet above 
the water 
an almost festive mood prevailed as the crowd combed the bank 
for souvenirs or peered across the water trying to spot a trace of 
a sunken wreck purported to have been sighted on the arkansas side

hours after mikhail s gorbachev said citizens 
should be able to freely express their opinions police broke up 
two demonstrations in moscow in a scene reminiscent of traditional 
soviet intolerance 
homeland was what protesters shouted tuesday as 200 crimean 
tatars gathered to demand they be allowed to return to their 
homeland 
police moved in twice to drag off members of the disgruntled 
ethnic group carting them away in buses 
on pushkin square police arrested seven members of a group 
called the democratic union witnesses said the group advocates a 
multiparty system and an end to the soviet military presence in 
eastern europe 
today participants in the demonstrations said the seven had 
either been fined jailed or summoned to court the fate of the 
arrested tatars was unknown 
in the kremlin on tuesday gorbachev told the first nationwide 
communist party conference in 47 years that the civil rights of 
soviet citizes need to be better respected 
i would like to dwell particularly on the political freedoms 
that enable a person to express his opinion on any matter he 
said in his keynote address the implementation of these freedoms 
is a real guarantee that any problem of public interest will be 
discussed from every angle 
but the soviet leader warned that activities such as redrawing 
borders and establishing political parties to challenge the 
communists political monopoly would not be tolerated 
he also said the soviet legal system should guarantee strict 
observance of the citizens rights to the inviolability of private 
life and the home privacy of correspondence postal and telegraph 
messages 
the system must also ensure he said that a person is innocent 
until proven guilty and that all people get equal treatment before 
the law 
those rights and the right to speak out on the issues before 
soviet society have been violated since the time of dictator josef 
stalin and must be restored he said 
after police carried away about 200 demonstrating crimean tatars 
on tuesday a sobbing woman said they took my husband 
the woman in her 20s was arrested a few minutes later 
two officers told a reporter the protesters were not being 
arrested or taken to a jail but merely removed from the area 
because they were violating public order 
stalin ordered all crimean tatars deported to soviet asia in may 
1944 from their homes in the ukraine they were accused of 
betraying their country while the crimean peninsula was occupied by 
the nazis 
the government dropped the collective war crimes charges in 
1967 but the crimean tatars who number about 300000 were not 
allowed to return home 
on pushkin square after police rounded up members of the 
democratic union several remaining group members addressed 
separate crowds to promote their platform 
yevgenia debrianskaya a group member said today that two of 
those arrested were ordered jailed for 15 days two were imprisoned 
for 10 days and two were summoned to court in a few days she said 
she was fined 161 
in addition a leading democratic union member was arrested 
monday and sentenced to 15 days in jail for taking part in an 
earlier demonstration a spokesman for the group said tuesday 
yuri mityunov said the arrest of igor tsarkov was aimed at 
keeping the group quiet during the party conference 
reshat dzhemilev a crimean tatar who lives in the uzbekistan 
capital of tashkent said today that he did not know what became of 
countrymen arrested during tuesdays protest 
moscow dissident valery senderov said that in previous cases 
the tatars have been shipped home from moscow and no legal action 
taken against them 
dzhemilev said crimean tatars met tuesday in tashkent and 
decided to strike at their workplaces after a reported 
demonstration in the city by about 5000 tatars on sunday

the dollar soared past the 133yen mark today for 
the first time in nearly seven months before falling back in active 
trading in tokyo share prices on the stock exchange also scored 
heavy gains 
the dollar closed the day at 13240 yen up 145 yen from its 
13095 yen finish on tuesday it broke the 133yen level during the 
morning session and briefly peaked at 13340 yen before falling 
back the currency fluctuated mostly between 1324013340 yen 
it was a carbon copy of what happened yesterday tuesday 
said king ogino a dealer at goldman sachs 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa during a regular news 
conference tuesday ruled out the possibility that the bank of 
japan would intervene in the market to prop up the yen 
ogino said the governor of the bank of japan satoshi sumita 
also pushed the dollar up when he said the bank would not change 
its monetary policy for now but would act flexibly if 
necessary he told reporters it was unlikely the dollar would 
appreciate 
the market moved up and down like a yoyo ogino said unless 
the bank of japan is ready to step in he said currency dealers 
were likely to test new highs 
there is spare room for the dollar to go up ogino said 
the us currency last traded at the 133yen level in early 
december when it opened at 13305 yen on dec 8 it closed that day 
at 13278 yen just last friday the dollar finished the week at 
12970 yen its highest level in about four months

075 yen 
the yen was trading as high as 242 to the dollar in september

a study that found cancerous cells in the bone 
marrow of a third of women undergoing breast cancer surgery may 
help lead to identifying women at risk for relapse after the 
surgery a scientist says 
the cells eluded detection by normal marrow examination but 
they were found with a new method for seeking them out said alan 
houghton of the memorial sloankettering cancer center in new york 
women who have had breast tumors removed can get a recurrence of 
cancer if cancerous cells had spread from their tumors before the 
surgery about 30 percent or more of women who show no sign of 
cancerous spread at the time of surgery will nonetheless get a 
recurrence the national cancer institute says 
that prompted the institute to recommend last month that 
followup therapy with hormones or cancerkilling drugs should be 
considered after breast cancer surgery in women with no sign of 
cancerous spread 
such a broad strategy may become unnecessary if a way could be 
found to identify the women at risk of relapse houghton said 
tuesday after speaking at a symposium sponsored by the cancer 
institute and the pharmaceutical firm hoffmannla roche inc 
he cited work published recently in the american journal of 
surgical pathology by richard cote and colleagues at 
sloankettering 
they used monoclonal antibodies a kind of protein that can 
seek out and latch onto cells from breast cancer tumors the 
technology lets a researcher spot a single cancerous cell among 
100000 normal marrow cells houghton said 
cote and colleagues tested bone marrow removed from 51 women who 
were undergoing breast cancer surgery eighteen or 35 percent 
showed evidence of cancer cells in their bone marrow standard 
methods for examining marrow found none of the cells 
evidence of the cancerous cells in marrow appeared in six of the 
22 women who had shown no standard sign that their breast cancer 
had spread twelve of the 29 women who did show cancerous cells in 
their lymph nodes the standard indication of spread also showed 
cells in their marrow 
the big question now houghton said is how well the presence of 
the cancerous cells in the marrow predicts the risk of relapse 
that must still be evaluated he said 
bruce chabner director of institutes division of cancer 
treatment called the work significant but agreed that the 
predictive value of examining marrow has yet to be assessed 
other studies have shown that some 30 percent to 40 percent of 
patients undergoing surgery for colon cancer show tumor cells 
circulating in their blood but those patients do not all get 
cancer recurrances he said 
most women who undergo breast cancer surgery will get followup 
treatment anyway in accordance with the cancer institute 
recommendation he said but a predictive test may indicate who 
should be treated more intensely he said

sixtytwo percent of women age 40 or older have 
never had a breast xray to detect cancer including 17 percent who 
have never even heard of the test a federal survey suggests 
only 17 percent of women in the age group had gotten the test 
during the past year although federal authorities recommend 
getting one every year or two starting at age 40 and annually 
after age 50 
the test called a mammogram and other cancer screening tests 
are not being used enough said maryann roper acting deputy 
director of the national cancer institute 
she described preliminary results of the federal survey tuesday 
at a seminar sponsored by the cancer institute and the 
pharmaceutical firm hoffmannla roche inc 
the survey which asked a variety of questions about cancer 
included interviews with 3297 women and 2426 men 
among the results 
23 percent of women 18 or older had not had a pap smear for 
detecting cervical cancer in the previous three years the 
institute says all sexually active women in that age group should 
have the test annually or less frequently at a physicians 
discretion if three consecutive pap smears showed no problem 
72 percent of women 40 or older reported having a physical 
screening exam for breast cancer a number roper said should be 
higher because the exam is easily included in a routine physical 
the most common reasons people gave for not getting tests were 
that they had not heard of them that they felt they did not need 
screening and that they had experienced no problems that would 
prompt them to get such a test 
screening tests are supposed to be taken before any symptoms 
develop to catch cancers early 
roper said researchers were surprised to find that the cost of 
mammograms was rarely cited as a reason for not getting one done 
she also said the use of mammograms appeared to decline with age 
even though the risk of breast cancer increases with age 
screening must become more widely used to cut overall cancer 
death rates in half by the year 2000 a cancer institute goal 
roper said for example some 80 percent of women will have to 
follow the guidelines for breast cancer screening she said

jesse jackson says the federal government 
should set aside 10 percent of all contracts for minorityowned 
businesses and put a cabinetlevel administrator in charge of 
enforcing affirmative action programs 
the democratic presidential contender speaking tuesday night at 
the annual convention of operation push the civil rights 
organization he founded said laws on the books to help minorities 
in contracting are empty without enforcement 
thats the proclamation without the emancipation he said 
jackson who ran second in delegates in the primaries to 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis said an enforcement official 
should be an economic ombudsman whose job it must be fully 
staffed to demand affirmative action in every phase of government 
every contract 
meanwhile operation push officials at the convention said they 
will examine the hiring and promotion practices of at least six 
companies beginning a process that could lead to an economic 
boycott unless minorities are put in management and ownership 
positions 
the rev willie barrow push executive director said officials 
have targeted firms which she claimed appear to have few blacks in 
top positions and that negotiations will be launched with the 
companies 
boycott is the last resort she said 
mrs barrow said push will examine red lobster restaurants 
payless shoesource shoe stores carson pirie scott amp co department 
stores and toyota automakers 
she also said the organization would look into makers of 
cadillac and mercedesbenz autos and would continue action against 
revlon cosmetics which has been the target of a push boycott 
spokesman for the companies were not available for comment 
tuesday night 
jackson has led battles for agreements with private firms in the 
past in which affirmative action timetables were established he 
told reporters at the convention that he believes strongly in 
negotiating with companies over hiring and promotion practices 
boycotts only occur when negotiations break down he said

mikhail s gorbachevs plan to lease out state 
farmland could give soviet farmers the most control over their 
produce since josef v stalin forced the nations peasants to join 
collective farms nearly 60 years ago 
in a sweeping 3hour televised speech tuesday the soviet 
leader said it was essential to extend as quickly as possible 
successful experiments in leasing land to individuals or family 
farming teams 
the result he said would be to make the farmers the masters 
of the land 
this he suggested would be the quickest way to ease food 
shortages that he called the most painful and most acute problem 
in the life of our society 
gorbachev also proposed to spend 124 billion through 1995 to 
improve the processing storage and transportation of food 
if we manage to reap transport store and process the harvest 
promptly and to deliver to the consumer in good time we will 
increase food production by 20 to 30 percent without increasing 
the productivity of the land itself he said 
the son of a russian peasant gorbachev began his political 
career in an agricultural region and oversaw soviet agriculture 
from 1978 to late 1984 giving him many years of experience with 
the problems of tilling land in the huge state and collective farms 
created by stalin 
since taking over as soviet leader in march 1985 gorbachev has 
signaled his willingness to break down those big units as the only 
way to improve supplies in a nation where meat and milk are 
rationed in many regions 
addressing a national congress of collective farmers last march 
gorbachev called for broader freedoms in the farming industry 
on a collective farm members of a cooperative jointly own farm 
buildings and machinery and share in the farms earnings but those 
organizations have dwindled in recent decades in favor of state 
farms where workers farm the land in brigades and receive a basic 
wage like employees in a factory 
in 1970 there were 33000 kolkhozes or collective farms 
in the soviet union by 1986 the number of such farms had dropped 
to 26300 and the number of collective farmers from 167 million in 
1970 to 126 million 
gorbachev has tried to persuade soviets to return to cooperative 
farms encouraging the system to provide incentives to increase 
production and alleviate the chronic food shortage in the soviet 
union 
now he wants to expand a system that permits families to lease 
land from their collectives and farm it themselves 
to make the system work however the soviet union must revamp 
its state pricing structure to enable people to reap a fair return 
for their efforts gorbachev said tuesday 
one delegate to the conference pointed out the general 
secretarys proposal to expand the leasing system is hampered by a 
deeply ingrained conservatism in soviet society 
the problem is that our people have forgotten how to take 
risks said mikhail bronstein a leading economist from tartu 
university in the baltic republic of estonia 
he said that older people in estonia still remember the 
democracy that existed there until soviet troops seized the three 
baltic republics in 1940 
but even estonians are reluctant to take up these land 
leases bronstein said 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev said tuesday at a news 
conference that food shortages cannot be eased if the attitude of 
dependency on instructions and handouts continues to dominate 
state farming 
we must transform the countryside yakovlev said the 
countryside is in ruins 
he proposed giving state and collective farms more autonomy to 
decide themselves how and by what criteria they are ruled 
farmers long have complained they are not allowed to decide 
themselves how to till the land or rotate crops and are forced to 
follow rules set by local or even national party bureaucrats who 
know nothing about farming 
that system was set up by stalin who collectivized land in a 
brutal upheaval that caused a famine in which millions died in the 
early 1930s in the early 1920s during the formative years of the 
soviet state vladimir i lenin had made the peasantry relatively 
independent by allowing them to grow and sell their own produce 
elderly inhabitants of moscow recall to this day how lenins 
decision improved the food supply in the capital almost overnight

the fbi warned john gotti reputedly 
the nations most powerful mobster he were being hunted by mafia 
hit men officials said in announcing the indictments of 22 people 
in the restaurant rubout of a businessman 
federal indictments unsealed tuesday offer a glimpse into 
feuding between the genovese and gambino crime families 
authorities say the indictments could cripple the new jersey 
faction of the genovese group 
the indictments name 22 people including reputed genovese 
figures construction company executives and union officials 
authorities had no specific information about a link between the 
plot to kill gotti reputed boss of the gambino family and the 
slaying of new york businessman irwin schiff said newark fbi chief 
john c mcginley 
after schiff was gunned down aug 8 over dessert at a new york 
city restaurant law enforcement officials said they believed he 
had ties to the gambino family and was killed in a dispute over 
money 
federal authorities said schiff was involved in up to 40 
million in fraudulent loans and was the target of a criminal 
investigation seven people have been arrested in connection with 
his financial dealings 
at a news conference to announce the indictments state police 
superintendent col clinton l pagano said the new jersey genovese 
faction was fighting efforts by gambino operatives to move into 
northern new jersey and therefore allegedly plotted to 
eliminate john gotti and his brother gene a reputed 
highranking member of the gambino family 
in bugged conversations last year at a hoboken restaurant louis 
a bobby manna 59 of jersey city alleged head of the new 
jersey genovese faction and his lieutenants discussed killing the 
gottis mcginley said 
also at the restaurant were genovese associates richard 
bocci desciscio 42 of bayonne and restaurantowner martin 
motts casella 71 of secaucus the indictment said 
the fbi warned the gottis of the plot last fall and they 
decided to use their own devices to protect themselves 
mcginley said 
the larger indictment contained the gotti and schiff charges a 
labor payoff scheme loansharking and a largescale horse and 
sportsbetting operation said us attorney samuel a alito jr 
a second indictment alleged that seven defendants carried out 
another illegal gambling business 
authorities refused to discuss the details of the gotti and 
schiff allegations 
in raids early tuesday 130 state and federal law officers 
searched homes and businesses in new york new jersey and 
pennsylvania and arrested 21 of the suspects mcginley said 
on defendant was hospitalized with an undisclosed illness and 
was not immediately arrested mcginley said 
an attorney for manna joseph castiglia said his client 
categorically denies the allegations but castiglia said he 
would not comment further until he could read the indictment more 
closely 
desciscio a close associate of john digilio a reputed genovese 
soldier slain last month was especially entrusted with carrying 
out violent assignments for the genovese enterprise the 
indictment said 
desciscios attorney larry bronson called the charges 
nonsense 
we know less than you know thats how ridiculous this is 
said bronson who also represented digilio 
an attorney for casella maureen mantineo did not return a 
telephone message

a slightly increased risk of a severe 
earthquake exists in an area south of san francisco that was jolted 
by a moderate temblor this week say state officials who also 
caution against public alarm 
californias office of emergency services issued an advisory 
tuesday saying that for the next five days the slightly increased 
likelihood for continued seismic activity was possible for the 
region rocked by mondays earthquake which scientists estimated at 
between 50 and 57 on the richter scale 
scientists from the us geological survey university of 
california berkeley and the state division of mines and geology 
say that this activity could involve an earthquake as large as 
65 richter magnitude although its not probable that a quake of 
this size will occur the advisory said 
it was issued to alert officials of santa cruz san benito 
monterey and santa clara counties to maintain preparedness and 
awareness measures 
the chance of a magnitude65 quake on the san andreas fault 
within five days is a very slight possibility but we do feel it 
is our responsibility to make this information public office of 
emergency services spokesman tom mullins said from sacramento 
there is some some concern although no alarm said mike 
guerin a spokesman at the agencys office in ontario 
damage from a 65magnitude quake could be comparable to that 
caused by the 62magnitude morgan hill quake on april 24 1984 
acting state geologist brian tucker said that quake injured 27 
people and caused 10 million in damage 
residents of san jose and the san francisco bay area could 
expect a 65magnitude quake to cause swaying of highrise 
buildings potentially some fires and some localized areas of more 
intense damage to buildings tucker said 
guerin said the advisory which isnt a prediction was issued 
because scientists believe additional stress has been placed on a 
portion of the san andreas fault by mondays quake which swayed 
skyscrapers in san francisco but resulted in no reports of injuries 
or serious damage 
mondays quake was centered on the san andreas fault 16 miles 
south of san jose officials said 
tucker said scientists believe mondays quake added stress to 
the san andreas in part because the section of the fault that 
snapped had been relatively quiet for years and the temblor 
occurred near the junction of the san andreas and sargent faults 
quakes are more likely to start near fault junctions he said 
quake predictions or advisories have been rare in the united 
states 
in april 1985 the usgs predicted that by janauary 1993 an 
earthquake measuring about 6 on the richter scale is highly likely 
to hit the parkfield segment of the san andreas a sparsely 
populated section about 130 miles southeast of the section that 
ruptured monday the prediction remains in effect 
in june 1985 a series of magnitude 25 to 42 quakes near san 
diego spurred the usgs to advise there was a 5 percent chance of a 
magnitude 50 quake within five days none occurred 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale

a 10yearold boy who shot a playmate hid 
the body beneath his bedroom closet and helped police in a weeklong 
search before admitting that he accidentally killed him in an 
argument authorities said 
he put his body down in the scuttle hole and then he came back 
out and cleaned up the blood said police sgt mark chamberlain 
said tuesday he even told his mother later that he had spilled 
some koolaid 
the june 20 disappearance of jason daniel powell 10 drew 
together hundreds of residents of this community of about 10000 
police had searched the other boys house where jasons body was 
found but were unaware of the crawl space beneath the flooring 
at the time we were searching with the idea that he was still 
alive somewhere we thought maybe he was hiding out and that his 
friends were protecting him chamberlain said we were looking 
for a boy not a body 
the youth moved his friends bicycle to a field two blocks away 
from his home and joined in searches in the area chamberlain said 
the search ended monday when carol cade found jasons badly 
decomposed body beneath a closet in her home after smelling a 
stench 
after the discovery the 10yearold admitted to authorities 
that he had shot jason but said he did not know the gun was 
loaded authorities said the dallas county medical examiner said 
jason suffered a single 22caliber gunshot wound to the head 
the boy whose name was withheld by authorities was questioned 
and released to his mother police said the case has been turned 
over to the district attorneys office police chief bruce beaty 
said 
officials would not elaborate on mrs cades relationship to the 
boy but friends said he was her son 
they were in the living room playing video games and he wanted 
to go outside and play but jason said no that he wanted to stay 
inside said jasons 18yearold brother sean powell in an 
account confirmed by police 
he went into another room and came back with a pistol where 
jason was lying on the floor and said if you dont go outside to 
the playhouse im going to shoot you sean said and he shot 
him once in the head he died instantly 
tuesday night the singlestory brick home where authorities 
removed jasons body after cutting away a section of flooring was 
empty mrs cade had permission to return tuesday afternoon but 
stayed away chamberlain said 
authorities and acquaintances said mrs cade lived alone with 
her two sons after a separation from her husband the gun used was 
found in her dresser drawer with one spent shell chamberlain said 
he just panicked he was scared thats the only explanation i 
can have for it but i do believe him said powell who returned 
from his navy station in norfolk va to help lead the search for 
his brother 
it must have been hell for a 10yearold kid to kill his own 
friend and not even know the gun was loaded

the district prosecutors office 
today said it has reopened an investigation of a former nazi ss 
general alleged to have ordered the 1940 massacre in france of 85 
british prisoners of war 
the new probe of wilhelm mohnke dropped for lack of sufficient 
evidence in 1973 was reopened after new names of survivors of 
the massacre turned up said prosecutor spokesman joachim 
boettcher 
the spokesman confirmed the probe when questioned about a report 
presented to the house of commons in london tuesday by a british 
official 
in the report junior defense minister roger freeman said west 
german authorities had agreed to reopen the probe against mohnke a 
77yearold retired businessman 
boettcher said in a telephone interview from luebeck that the 
case was reopened a couple of weeks ago after british journalists 
gave us the new names of survivors 
mohnke allegedly ordered that 85 unarmed british prisoners of 
war be herded into a barn to be shot by nazi ss troops at wormhoudt 
near dunkirk the ss was a quasimilitary special police unit that 
was infamous for its brutality 
a former general who now lives in stemwarde about three miles 
east of hamburg mohnke has repeatedly denied any connection with 
the alleged massacre shortly before british forces retreated from 
dunkirks beaches in the face of the rapid german advance in the 
early stages of world war ii 
in the early 1970s he was also investigated for involvement in 
the execution of 72 unarmed us prisoners of war at malmedy in the 
french ardennes in 1944 west german officials have said that probe 
was also dropped for lack of evidence 
in april after the british magazine world war ii investigator 
traced mohnke to stemwarde home secretary douglas hurd told 
commons that british officials had reopened a secret file on the 
affair hurd is the british cabinet member responsible for law and 
order 
freeman said today that britain had no jurisdiction in the case 
but would hand over all the evidence it has 
he also said an investigation by the war crimes interrogation 
unit just after the war concluded that there was not enough 
evidence to bring the possible culprits to trial 
ian sayer publisher of world war ii investigator told the 
associated press in april that he traced documents showing mohnke 
was wanted by british us and canadian war crimes investigators 
at the end of the war 
but mohnke was captured by the soviets who jailed him for 10 
years and could not be found in 1945 he said 
on tuesday in another case involving alleged war criminals but 
not concerning mohnke nazihunters handed the british government a 
detailed list of 13 alleged war criminals who fled to britain after 
the war 
they said it was new evidence that britain harbored nazi 
collaborators partly to assist with antisoviet intelligence 
the home office said it would try to trace the 13 men white 
russians now aged between 63 and 89 their names and in most 
cases specific addresses in british pow camps were first submitted 
by the soviet ambassador in november 1947 
rabbi marvin hier of the nazihunting simon wiesenthal center 
said researchers stumbled on the list last week while sifting 
through british government records for traces of ss members who 
escaped to canada via britain after the war 
the los angelesbased wiesenthal center which long has accused 
britain of footdragging over fugitive nazis and their 
collaborators also produced a 1983 letter from prime minister 
margaret thatchers government saying britain has not felt obliged 
to deport suspected war criminals since 1950 
now we know why inquiries made about nazi war criminals from 
the beginning were left hanging said hier 
it was the cold war and they were interested in countering 
communism they wanted to play ball with the nazi criminals

federal officials ordered the mock 
evacuations of tens of thousands of people during a twoday 
exercise which pretended that a crippled seabrook nuclear power 
plant was spewing dangerous radiation 
nearly 3000 federal state local and utility officials and 
other workers participated tuesday on the first day of what 
seabrook officials say is the largest test ever of a us nuclear 
plants evacuation plans 
the plans must be approved before the 54 billion plant may 
operate commercially 
although the mock evacuations would have involved people on 
ocean beaches and in new hampshire and massachusetts communities up 
to five miles away most members of the public were unaware that 
the test was underway 
more than half the communities within seabrooks 10mile 
emergency planning zone six of 17 in new hampshire and all six in 
massachusetts are not cooperating in the drill 
as they did in a february 1986 exercise of the new hampshire 
plans state officials under proseabrook gov john sununu filled 
in for reluctant local officials among 55 deficiencies the federal 
emergency management agency found in the first exercise was 
insufficient compensation for noncooperating communities 
the test is the first for evacuation plans that seabrook 
developed for the massachusetts communities massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis the likely democratic presidential nominee 
refuses to submit plans that he said could never work 
its also the first test of procedures for monitoring food up to 
50 miles from seabrook an area that includes parts of maine 
only the tests controllers knew the scenario for the mock 
emergency they also have the power to improvise as they go along 
the exercise began with announcement of an imaginary accident 
and declaration of an ersatz alert the second lowest of four 
emergency classifications for nuclear plants 
seabrook officials opened emergency operations and media centers 
at a power station in newington while the state activated a field 
office there and emergency management headquarters in concord as 
the exercise progressed four reception centers in new hampshire 
and massachusetts also were opened but little other real activity 
was reported in the field 
the concord control center hummed however as representatives 
of various state agencies calmly talked on the phone and to each 
other took notes and marked off checklists about a dozen federal 
evaluators and exercise controllers watched 
officials took imaginary steps like closing some beaches they 
estimated 10000 people were on seabrook and hampton beaches on 
this theoretical cloudy summer day and ordering children kept in 
some schools as the scenario progressed to a site area 
emergency and a general emergency the most serious

a beijing court today sentenced one youth to 
death and gave a second a suspended death sentence in the slaying 
of a student whose death triggered protests for democracy and 
better treatment of intellectuals 
three other youths got prison terms and a sixth defendant was 
found guilty of hooliganism but escaped criminal punishment 
the official beijing evening news said 
all six were tried in the beijing intermediate peoples court in 
connection with a june 1 attack on several beijing university 
students outside an offcampus snackshop and liquor store 
one of the students 22yearold chai qingfeng was shot in the 
head with bb gun pellets and beaten with a shovel he died of his 
wounds the following day 
nearly 1000 fellow students marched that night from campus to 
central beijings tiananmen square to demonstrate their sorrow and 
demand tighter security for students 
over the next week the target of the students anger broadened 
hundreds of posters most anonymous went up at beijing university 
denouncing government corruption and demanding democracy and more 
funds for education 
the unrest subsided after police sealed off tiananmen square and 
intimidated the students into cancelling a second planned march 
the six suspects were arrested within 48 hours of chais death 
in an obvious effort to calm the students the trial which began 
june 18 and was closed to the foreign media also started with 
unusual speed there have been no official media reports on the 
testimony 
as had been expected the court ordered the death penalty for 
wang jian an unemployed young man with a record of theft who was 
identified as the ringleader he was convicted of deliberate murder 
in china executions generally are carried out by a bullet to 
the back of head 
ha enming also unemployed with a theft record was convicted of 
deliberate murder and given a suspended death sentence to be 
reevaluated at the end of two years of labor reform the report 
said he and wang jian hit chai with an iron shovel 
wang jianming and wang yonglian were convicted of hooliganism 
and sentenced to 15 and seven years in prison respectively 
wang li 22 the only woman defendant was convicted of 
harboring a criminal and sentenced to three years original press 
reports claimed she took part in the attack on chai and was charged 
with hooliganism the beijing evening news did not say if she was 
cleared of this charge or give details of whom she hid the sixth 
defendant liu bin was convicted of hooliganism but not sentenced 
wang is a common name in china and reports have not said if any 
of the wangs are related 
the attack was the second killing of a university student in 
beijing in the past year a student at the university of foreign 
economic relations was killed in december in a fight with two local 
youths they also were speedily arrested and tried and one was 
executed 
about 1000 students marched to government offices in central 
beijing to protest that killing

was off its early highs amid worries of central bank intervention 
foreign exchange dealers said

japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa who said the bank of 
japan isnt thinking of intervening to stem the dollars recent 
rally 
the market is being driven by the dollaryen rate and as long 
as this seems headed upward then the dollar will continue to be 
firm said a trader in frankfurt 
however fears that central banks would intervene as they did on 
tuesday were putting a psychological barrier on the dollars climb

a greek terrorist organization blamed for 
previous assassinations of american diplomats claimed 
responsibility today for a carbomb blast that killed the us 
military attache as he drove to work 
in a five page statement published in the left wing athens 
afternoon daily ethnos november 17 said it would attack more 
americans until the last turkish soldier leaves cyprus and the 
last american soldier leaves our country 
us navy capt william nordeen 51 was killed tuesday when a 
boobytrapped car blew up next to his armorplated automobile just 
100 yards from his suburban athens home 
the blast ripped off the cars roof and flung nordeens 
decapitated body into the yard of an unoccupied house 
many greeks blame the united states for failing to prevent 
turkeys 1974 invasion of cyprus after an athensinspired coup 
there 
about 30000 turkish troops are stationed in the northern third 
of the eastern mediterranean island divided into northern turkish 
cypriot and southern greek cypriot sectors 
the november 17 statement described the 3500strong american 
military presence in greece as a force of occupation and said 
we will strike against anyone of its members or agent of its 
secret services 
police said the statement appeared to be genuine 
i dont think anybody except november 17 had the expertise to 
pull off something like this a senior police officer said on 
condition of anonymity 
nordeen and his british wife patricia were due to leave next 
month after completing a threeyear tour at the us embassy in 
athens 
premier andreas papandreou said he was deeply grieved over 
the killing and pledged to fight terrorism 
we really cooperate with the countries of the european 
community and others to face terrorism which we condemn 
unequivocally papandreou said 
in the past papandreous socialist government has been 
criticized by the united states for laxity in battling terrorism 
police said the carbomb attack was immaculately planned and 
detonated by a remote controlled radio device 
witnesses told police they saw two darkcomplexioned men roaring 
away on a motorbike immediately after the explosion a police 
spokesman said a stolen motorcycle was later found in the area 
november 17 is named for the day in 1973 that troops and tanks 
crushed a student rebellion against the 196774 dictatorship the 
group has claimed responsibility for the assassinations of athens 
cia station chief richard welch in 1975 and of us navy capt 
george tsantes in 1983 
the group also claimed responsibility for a failed carbomb 
attack last october against a bus carrying american servicemen 
none of its members has ever been arrested 
the killing came four days after greek and american negotiators 
wrapped up a seventh round of slowmoving talks for a new bases 
accord officials have said the talks are making little progress 
but havent reached an impasse 
a fiveyear accord signed by the papandreou government expires 
in december this year papandreou has said he is willing to 
negotiate a new agreement but that it must be approved in a 
referendum before taking effect 
since the 1950s the united states has operated two bases near 
athens and two on the island of crete along with a dozen 
mountaintop communications installations in return greece gets 
military credits totalling more than 340 million every year 
neighbors said nordeen set out for work around 8 am every day 
driving down the treelined street where several western diplomats 
live to the main athens highway 
the minnesota native had earlier served as assistant naval 
inspector in washington and with the us fleet in the pacific 
ocean

a former university professor convicted of 
murdering a teenage male prostitute and dismembering his body with 
a chain saw will seek a new trial his attorney says 
max bernard franc 58 was found guilty of firstdegree murder 
tuesday by a jury that deliberated less than three days 
ive never been as disappointed in a verdict as ive been in 
this verdict deputy public defender mark kaiserman said adding 
he would appeal the conviction 
franc was accused of shooting tracy leroy nute 18 cutting up 
the body in a bathtub and distributing the parts across 200 miles 
of california franc claimed a man named terry adams committed the 
gruesome killing last august the prosecution contended adams does 
not exist 
i think the jury did the right and justifiable thing said 
deputy district attorney sterling norris 
sentencing was scheduled for july 29 
the prosecutor said he would seek the maximum possible sentence 
of 25 years to life in prison which would make franc eligible for 
parole in 12 years 
after the verdict kaiserman said he remains convinced of 
francs innocence 
i would describe him as a very passive individual who does not 
have an assaultive bone in his body and would not be able to commit 
this type of crime the attorney said 
a ruling by superior court judge john h reid excluded critical 
evidence from the trial regarding a potential suspect kaiserman 
said 
jurors were never told that the man peter krizek had been 
charged in a similar dismemberment case eight years ago the last 
of his four trials ended in a jury deadlock krizek testified 
during francs trial that he had nothing to do with the nute 
killing 
franc a native of de pere wis was a public administration 
professor at california state university in fresno until his arrest 
last august 
jurors were told franc lived a double life a conservative 
professor in fresno but a homosexual voyeur about 210 miles away in 
west hollywood who paid young men to be photographed in sexual 
poses 
nute a runaway from kansas city mo who came to california to 
be a movie star wound up working as a prostitute 
franc was arrested after a chain saw he rented was returned with 
blood and flesh in its works 
the case against franc was circumstantial forensic experts 
found traces of blood throughout his west hollywood apartment as 
well as in his car the murder weapon was found in francs 
university office a motorist identified franc as the man he saw 
sitting in a car near a freeway offramp where body parts were found

northeast of baltimore have been addressed 
the grand jury indicted william dee 49 robert lentz 50 and 
carl gepp 51 all were top managers between 1983 and 1986 when 
the alleged violations occurred at the armys chemical research 
development and engineering center 
the indictment alleged the three intentionally stored chemical 
wastes such as ethyl acetate hydrazine picric acid and ethyl 
ether in deteriorating containers in an army building without a 
permit 
the first four counts of the fivecount indictment including 
the illegal storage dumping and handling of hazardous wastes are 
felonies the fifth count a water pollution charge is a 
misdemeanor 
the three men who are to be arraigned in the next week or two 
face up to 21 years in prison and 11 million in fines each if 
convicted on all charges 
this case is not one of technical or minor violations 
willcox said rather it concerns the willful intentional and 
deliberate failure to comply with the law over a period of years by 
the managers of the armys chemical weapons testing program 
the army like everyone else is required in this district to 
obey the law said willcox the top federal prosecutor for 
maryland 
according to the indictment chemicals leaked into the bases 
sanitary sewer and canal creek which leads into the bush river and 
eventually chesapeake bay 
investigators have said they do not know whether any people were 
adversely affected but willcox said the alleged dumping caused a 
major fish kill on a chesapeake bay tributary 
the fbi and the environmental protection agency cooperated in an 
18month investigation in the case willcox said 
the defendants are chemical engineers and longtime government 
employees none was available for comment but attorney richard 
karceski said they would plead innocent and go to trial and win 
their case 
there is not a scintilla of criminal intent among these three 
men karceski said 
acknowledging that hazardous waste problems may have existed at 
aberdeen karceski said the three defendants are people who tried 
to do their best to correct alleged defeciencies 
this was not an individual problem but a problem of the 
army he said

investigators tried today to reconstruct the 40 
minutes between the discovery of brake problems on a parisbound 
commuter train and its collision with a crowded train which killed 
59 people 
the staterun rail company sncf said the engineer realized his 
brakes werent working when he was more than a mile away from the 
busy gare de lyon station and warned passengers to get to the back 
of the train 
the brake trouble on the eightcar train began five miles 
outside the station after a passenger pulled the emergency stop at 
vert de maisons an unscheduled station at about 630 pm monday 
the company said it wasnt known why the passenger pulled the cord 
after a 26minute delay there the train continued on toward 
paris but the brake problems continued and a mile from the 
station engineer daniel saulin appeared unable to stop the train 
saulin 42 alerted the station controller and then his 
passengers as the train rushed at 4050 mph through a stop signal 
600 yards from impact 
rail officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
station controller did not have time to reroute the train and it 
slammed into the stationary fourcar train at 710 pm 
normal procedure would have been for the arriving train to stop 
at the 600 yard signal and get directions to the appropriate track 
through the night and into tuesday morning 250 rescue workers 
struggled to free the injured the number of bodies grew steadily 
and the crash became paris worst train disaster 
sncf reported 59 dead paris emergency services said 38 were 
injured 
sncf the transport ministry and judicial authorities are each 
conducting their own investigation into the crash said philippe 
rouvillois director general of the rail company 
there is a tie the nature of which we do not yet know 
between the use of the alarm signal emergency stop which had 
immobilized the train a short time before and the 
catastrophe sncf official roger gerin told a news conference 
the origin of the accident was difficulties with the braking 
system but we do not know the exact cause 
sncf officials said saulin realizing about a mile from the gare 
de lyon that he could not stop was able to slow down slightly by 
using an emergency brake 
gerin said saulins train had made 15 stops along its route and 
that the brakes worked normally at each 
after the passenger pulled the emergency stop the engineer 
experienced difficulty in trying to rearm the brake system but he 
resumed his trip gerin said he gave no details about the brake 
problem 
a passenger on the train laure cocu told the french daily 
liberation that while the train was stopped at the unscheduled 
station she heard a noise like the release of air from the trains 
pneumatic brakes 
we heard a rush of air a little like the noise in a 
factory she told the newspaper some passengers in my car got 
off my colleague saw the conductor and the engineeer by the side 
of the train looking under the car 
my colleague heard the engineer say the brakes are blocked 
at the back 
the engineer on the train in the station andre tanguy was 
killed in the crash francis boulanger sncf spokesman said 
earlier reports that he escaped might have resulted from confusion 
with other railroad employees who jumped from the train boulanger 
said tanguy was one of seven employees who died 
asked whether the age of the train might have been a factor 
gerin said trains undergo maintenance four times a year in addition 
to routine checks and this particular train had been checked just 
days before the crash

nativeborn americans spend more time in 
hospitals or sick in bed at home and visit doctors more 
frequently a federal study says 
the national center for health statistics compared the health of 
nativeand foreignborn residents of the united states aged 18 and 
over and found that the newcomers appear to be the healthier group 
dr gerry e hendershot author of the report health of the 
foreignborn population united states 198586 said a number of 
possible reasons could account for this difference 
one factor that certainly is involved is the selectivity of 
immigration to this country he said in a telephone interview 
this week 
people with higher educations and professional skills have a 
better opportunity to migrate to this country so people coming 
here tend to be from groups that have good health he said 
in addition the immigration and naturalization service does 
some health screening hendershot said plus immigrants tend to 
be younger on average than the general population and younger 
people in general tend to be healther than older people 
finally he noted that the study was based on interviews with 
58682 households by looking at household groups the analysis 
would not include transients such as migrant workers who may tend 
to be in poorer health hendershot commented 
he added that he hoped to undertake another study in the future 
aimed at detailing the reasons for health differences 
according to the survey

some 108 percent of native americans had been hospitalized in 
the previous year compared to 95 percent of the foreignborn 
reporting six or more contacts with a doctor or other health 
professional in the year were 185 percent of natives and 162 
percent of the foreignborn 
when it came to spending four or more days in the year staying 
home sick in bed nativeborn people led 228 percent to 188 
percent 
the difference between nativeborn and foreignborn people in 
being sick in bed for four days or more covered all age groups up 
to 65 over age 65 however the groups were similar to one another 
263 percent for natives and 276 percent of foreign borns 
by sex 185 percent of nativeborn males were sick in bed four 
days compared to 153 percent of foreignborn men for women the 
figures were 268 percent for natives and 220 percent for those 
from overseas 
turning to hospital stays the 108 percent of natives 
hospitalized in the prior year included 86 percent of men and 128 
percent of women foreignborn people were hospitalized at a 95 
percent rate 70 percent for men and 118 percent for women 
six or more physician contacts during the year were reported by 
133 percent of native men and 231 percent of women the figures 
for those born elsewhere were 106 percent for men and 225 percent 
for women 
the survey also asked if people were limited in any of their 
activities by chronic physical problems 
some 176 percent of nativeborn americans aged 18 and over 
reported some such limitation this included 169 percent of men 
and 182 percent of women 
among the foreign born 132 percent reported chronic health 
problems limiting their activities this included 119 percent of 
men and 145 percent of women 
finally people were asked to generally rate their own health 
in this category the share who said they considered themselves 
in only fair or poor health was identical in both groups at 129 
percent 
however the fair and poor category included 119 percent of 
native men compared to 110 percent of foreignborn men for native 
born women 138 percent said they were in fair or poor health 
compared to 146 percent of the foreign born 
of the approximately 1566 million americans aged 18 and over at 
the time of the survey about 149 million were listed as foreign 
born

president reagan finds himself inadvertently 
in the middle of a republican primary fight in florida as he 
launches what aides say will be an active campaign season on behalf 
of gop candidates 
reagan was flying to miami today for a fundraising spech on 
behalf of thirdterm rep connie mack iii grandson of the 
legendary baseball manager who is seeking the seat of retiring 
democratic sen lawton chiles 
the president who follows a policy of not interfering in 
primary contests accepted the speaking date weeks ago on the 
assumption that mack would be unopposed in the sept 6 florida 
primary 
on monday however us attorney robert merkle the prosecutor 
who obtained a drug indictment against panamanian gen manuel 
antonio noriega resigned his federal post and jumped into the race 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked whether this made 
the miami speech inconsistent with reagans handsoff policy in 
primaries said well circumstances have made it a little 
inconsistent 
the president has campaigned for connie mack in the past and 
stated his support for him fitzwater said and so 
circumstances simply created this situation 
mark mills communications director for the mack campaign said 
the president gave his word and his commitment to support connie 
mack and i just think the president is following through on that 
mills said the presidents visit is expected to garner about 
600000 he said reagan would pose for photographs with people who 
have raised at least 10000 for the campaign or the state 
republican party and then speak at a luncheon luncheon tickets 
were 500 or 1000 depending on where the seats were 
the spokesman said the money raised will be split evenly between 
the mack campaign and the state gop merkle who said he would not 
come to the luncheon because he was not invited and didnt want to 
be rude said monday the money should be put in escrow and held for 
the winner of the primary 
reagan also planned to meet privately with leaders of miamis 
large cubanamerican community cubanamericans have generally 
supported reagan although some have argued that he is softening on 
fidel castro by negotiating on immigration human rights and angola 
it is the presidents fourth visit to miami and his 10th to 
florida during his second term 
republicans would need a net gain of five seats to regain 
control of the senate although the president has appeared at 
fundraising events in washington for gop senate candidates this 
is his first political foray out of the capital in the 1988 
campaign 
fitzwater said there will be more 
the political activities havent been fleshed out yet but as 
a general matter you will have fundraisers attended by the 
president some for the party some for specific candidates he 
said 
the white house spokesman said the extent of reagans 
campaigning for vice president george bush the apparent gop 
nominee for president will all be firmed up in the next few 
weeks 
most florida republicans predicted that merkle starting late 
with little financing would have trouble catching up with the 
wellfinanced mack democrats have four candidates slugging it out 
for their nomination us reps dan mica and kenneth buddy 
mackay insurance commissioner bill gunter and state sen pat frank 
of tampa

us officials today said israeli police hurled 
tear gas at a group of arab teenagers staging a peaceful sitin 
outside the us consulate to protest the closing of their school 
the officials said that they had asked that tear gas not be used 
in the occupied west bank soldiers shot and wounded two 
palestinian youths including one who was in serious condition 
hospital officials said the army said it was checking the reports 
american officials said the tear gas was thrown after the 
schoolgirls left the consulate parking lot and as the halfhour 
demonstration appeared to be breaking up 
a consulate spokesman said the girls mostly 13 and 
14yearolds didnt throw stones and only held up handwritten 
signs saying please open our schools about 30 police and riot 
police were at the scene said the official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity he said there were about 75 protesters 
police spokesman rafi levy put the number of demonstrating 
schoolgirls at 200 and said tear gas was used only after the 
students were warned to disperse 
the use of tear gas is based on operational considerations of 
the moment levy said if there are official complaints about 
police behavior i would be glad to check them and respond 
several arab schoolgirls were arrested outside a school in east 
jerusalem after they tried to incite fellow students to protest 
levy said 
israeli officials have closed 34 schools in arab east jerusalem 
and the occupied west bank contending schools are a central spot 
for antiisraeli demonstrations since the arab uprising began 
nearly seven months ago 
since dec 8 211 palestinians and four israelis have been 
killed 
israeli troops shot and wounded two palestinians one 17 and the 
other 22 in clashes near the casbah or arab marketplace in the

prime minister yitzhak shamir said today that 
israel will bolster its military might to counter the buildup of 
sophisticated missiles among arab nations 
shamirs comments carried on israel radio came a day after the 
united states promised to help israel develop an antiballistic 
missile in response to ominous new military developments in the 
region 
the new technology designed to shoot down ballistic missiles 
will cost 120 million to 130 million dollars the daily jerusalem 
post said the white house said the united states will pay about 80 
percent of the costs 
recent reports have said that china is preparing to sell syria 
its most advanced surfacetosurface missile the m9 the m9 has 
a range of 375 miles 
speaking in the coastal city of caesaria shamir said the 
planned sale meant israel would step up efforts to find a response 
it obliges us to increase our eforts in preparing answers 
to this threat we are working in this field there are answers and 
we have to improve them shamir said 
in jerusalem foreign minister shimon peres expressed concern 
about the production of groundtoground missiles with chemical 
warheads in the hands of governments that occasionally have lost 
their balanced judgment and want to attack israel just because they 
have a weapon 
im sure and i know what im speaking about that wewill 
find a reply to it peres said

the nuclear regulatory commission is ordering 
operators of 37 nuclear reactors to review safety procedures after 
power levels fluctuated erratically at an illinois plant 
the alert for operators of boilingwater reactors was prompted 
by a march 9 incident in which two pumps used to circulate water 
through a commonwealth edison co reactor were shut off triggering 
an uncontrolled fluctuation of power the nrc said tuesday 
the incident at edisons lasalle unit 2 near ottawa ill 
ended without harm after the reactor exceeded its rated capacity 
and shut down automatically the commission said 
although commonwealth edison handled the situation properly the 
problem could have been serious nrc spokesman frank ingram said 
the power was oscillating like mad from 25 percent one minute 
to something else the next added michael mariotte director of 
the nuclear information and resource service a private 
clearinghouse for information about nuclear energy and radiation 
effects 
then it suddenly burst up to 118 percent of power before an 
automatic setpoint finally shut the plant down he said were 
real concerned about what would have happened had that one 
automatic setpoint failed 
however an nrc official said there was no threat of a meltdown 
we didnt know how much worse the situation could get said 
ashok thadani its assistant director of engineering and systems 
technology there was the potential not likely but the 
potential of fuel damage but a whole lot of other things have to 
go wrong before you worry about a radiation release 
the incident was the first of its kind in the united states 
although engineers had calculated that such an event could occur 
without warning at any of 37 us plants using boilingwater 
reactors the nrc said most of the nations 110 licensed plants 
use pressurized water rather than boiling water to turn their 
turbines 
edison spokeswoman deborah vestal said both pumps inadvertently 
were shut off at the same time during routine calibration of 
instruments and the mixture of cold and hot water in the reactor 
system when the pumps started again caused the power fluctuation 
it was a oneinamillion thing ms vestal said at the 
instant we knew what was occurring and we knew what to do to cease 
it thats what was done there was no damage to the fuel there 
was no release of radiation there was no suffering at the plant 
ingram called the incident a fluke but said the nrc is advising 
utilities using similar reactors about what happened at lasalle 
he said the commission would make sure plant operators are 
briefed so they can recognize the conditions leading up to 
uncontrolled power changes and know what to do about them 
the nrc is admitting it does not yet know of a hardware way to 
fix the problem mariotte said we would like to see them come 
up with some sort of solution rather than telling the operators 
simply to watch out for it 
these are the 37 reactors affected listed first by the name of 
the operating utility followed by the name of the plant and then 
its location 
in some cases the location name may vary from the name in 
common use in the area the pilgrim peach bottom and browns ferry

discarded plastic already blamed for the deaths 
of hundreds of thousands of birds and fish in the oceans and along 
seashores is spreading to the great lakes 
the virtually indestructible material is becoming not just an 
eyesore but a potential threat to wildlife in the worlds largest 
freshwater system according to researchers and lay observers 
jim mattis of benzonia mich has operated fishing charter 
boats for 15 years in lake michigan he said hes found plastic 
debris floating up to 10 miles offshore some of it in scum 
lines of garbage a mile long 
theres more plastic bags and pieces of visquine a trade name 
for plastic sheeting in the lake than ive ever seen mattis 
said its gotten worse in the last three or four years 
ive heard a lot of people say its just a plastic bag 
they dont realize the damage it can do 
most legislation research and enforcement has focused on a 
different kind of great lakes pollution toxic chemicals that 
threaten widespread areas and can be traced to specific sources 
therere about 1000 different types of hazardous substances 
that are known to exist in the great lakes said cameron davis a 
research analyst with the chicagobased lake michigan federation 
right now toxics and contaminated sediments are the no 1 
thing 
plastic pollution is less fully understood although its 
potential for harm is clear a single shard of plastic sheeting 
sixpack beverage carrier or strand of fishing line can float 
undetected until it strangles fish or birds binds a boat propeller 
or jams an engine intake 
we see the pictures every year we know it happens said 
glen dudderar a michigan state university biologist but we 
dont have any research on to what extent 
the michigan department of natural resources estimated that one 
bird in 100 observed by biologists was entangled in plastic fishing 
line according to a 1987 report by the washingtonbased center for 
environmental education entanglement can also mean ingestion of 
the plastic 
little is known too about another synthetic material 
intentionally put into the lakes fishing nets that are loosed 
accidentally but continue trapping their prey 
ghost fishing has been documented mainly along the atlantic 
and pacific coasts but it also occurs in great lakes waters where 
gillnet fishing is done either by stateregulated commercial 
interests or by indians working under terms of federal treaties 
officials said 
from the fisheries standpoint the worst thing weve got is 
gill nets that break away said asa wright manager of the great 
lakes program of the state dnrs fisheries division 
just last month authorities retrieved a gill net containing 
more than 600 pounds of rotting lake trout the 1000footlong 
44inchwide net probably had been adrift several months in 
southern lake superior investigators said 
bill eger a biologist who works with michigans indian 
fishermen said gill nets occasionally are abandoned or torn from 
buoys in storms or by passing freighters 
but the approximately 350 indians who fish in the 
treatyprotected waters of northwestern lake huron northern lake 
michigan and south central lake superior usually set and retrieve 
their gill nets daily eger said 
since gill nets cost about 1 a yard theyre seldom abandoned 
he said those that arent retrieved tend to ball up and sink 
bearing only the fish trapped on the first day or two after being 
set he said 
it does not continue to catch fish at an exponential rate as 
asa wright would like to have you believe eger said 
charter skipper mattis said plastic refuse poses a threat to 
navigation 
my son last year blew out an engine when a plastic bag got 
sucked up in the intake he said i had a piece two years ago 
an 8foot piece of visquine that got around my prop it 
wouldnt come off it knotted up so bad luckily a shaft didnt 
break 
the governor has signed legislation that will make michigan the 
13th state and the second in the great lakes region after 
wisconsin to require that sixpack beverage carriers be made of 
plastic material that degrades within 360 days of exposure to 
sunlight 
enforcement of antidumping laws is isolated conceded capt 
larry murdock chief of th marine safety division of the us coast 
guards district office in cleveland 
disposal of solid waste anywhere in the great lakes has been 
illegal for years murdock said freighters and other large 
commercial vessels are required to store or incinerate their trash 
rather than dump it overboard a practice common among oceangoing 
ships and blamed for at least part of the plastic pollution at sea 
for the pleasure boaters i dont think youre going to find 
any enforcement murdock said we havent apprehended anyone 
youre talking about an individualtype problem 
department of natural resources biologists have estimated that 
michigans recreational boaters produce up to 26000 tons of 
garbage a year an unknown percentage of that total finds its way 
into the lakes 
the plastics industry has joined government and environmental 
groups in conducting public education campaigns about plastic 
pollution in the great lakes and oceans alike 
brochures describing the harm done to marine life by discarded 
plastic have been jointly distributed by the center for 
environmental education the marine entanglement research program 
of the national marine fisheries service and the society of the 
plastics industry inc an industry group 
the fisheries service and defenders of wildlife another 
washingtonbased environmental group have distributed similar 
brochures encouraging boaters and beach visitors to dispose of 
trash properly 
individuals can do the most to turn back the invasion of plastic 
flotsam said tom martin director of michigans office of the 
great lakes the absolute key thing is peoples individual 
responsibility that it has consequences for the environment

secretary of state george shultz may visit the 
middle east in july to try to push his regional peace initiative a 
senior american official said today 
undersecretary of state michael armacost said he discussed the 
possibility of a shultz visit during two days of talks with israeli 
leaders armacost spoke to reporters at ben gurion international 
airport before leaving israel 
shultz has made three unsuccessful tours of the middle east 
since october in an effort to try to persuade israel and arabs 
states to adopt his peace plan before american and israeli 
elections in november 
the plan calls for convening an international conference under 
the auspices of the united nations to serve as a launching pad for 
direct bilateral talks between israel and its arab neighbors 
the conference would be attended by the five permanent members 
of the un security council the united states the soviet union 
britain france and china 
the idea is favored by foreign minister shimon peres but opposed 
by prime minister yitzhak shamir who fears the international body 
would be hostile toward israel 
the israeli daily maariv reported that a decision on the shultz 
visit would be made after a meeting between assistant secretary of 
state richard murphy and vladimir p polyakov head of the middle 
east desk in the soviet foreign ministry the two are to meet in 
europe next month 
israeli foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said the twoday 
meeting would be devoted to ironing out ussoviet differences 
over the role of superpowers in the proposed international forum 
while the united states favors a largely ceremonial role the 
soviet union has insisted on more active involvement 
the kremlin also supports the participation of the palestine 
liberation organization israel views the plo as a terrorist group 
and refuses to negotiate with it and the united states backs 
israels position

are nothing to crow about either 
for one thing the smiths are waking up earlier now 4 am to 
be exact because of the dozen roosters that mysteriously appeared 
on their lawn and havent left yet 
the fowl visitors arrived in the dead of night and announced 
their presence in the customary way with loud crowing to greet the 
dawn 
dawn comes earlier for roosters than it does for humans 
mrs smith noted 
after their first rude awakening the couple called the police 
but the only advice they could offer was make soup 
for the past 12 days the chickens who appear to be all 
roosters have resisted all efforts to get them to fly their 
newfound coop they roost among trees along the road at night and 
wander over the smiths threeacre spread during the day 
they even no jokes please cross the road to explore the 
woods and fields on the other side 
the smiths have taken the invasion goodnaturedly although to 
smith it is becoming about as humorous as the old joke 
its funny but when youre awakened at 430 every morning it 
loses its charm fast he said 
the smiths have enlisted the aid of the connecticut humane 
society and a local 4h club but the chickens have managed to 
elude any attempts at capture now the couple is offering free 
chickens for the taking 
if no one takes them up on the offer nature will probably solve 
the problem in its own manner 
whats going to happen eventually is that theyll be picked 
off by predators foxes raccoons mrs smith said and that 
will be it 
already she said tuesday there appear to be only about seven 
chickens left from the original dozen 
but all things considered she said its not a bad way to go 
theyre probably having the time of their life eating bugs 
roaming free and then they come back and find bread under the 
tree 
the smiths have been feeding the birds i dont know whether 
we should be doing that smith said but we felt sorry for 
them 
where the chickens came from in the first place remains a 
mystery 
if it was a prank the chickens arrived on the weekend that 
many high schools staged graduation ceremonies the smiths have no 
clue as to who is responsible or why 
wherever they came from the chickens appear to like their new 
home and the smiths are adjusting 
if you dont like it you shouldnt live in the country 
mrs smith said philosophically im sure a lot of city people 
wouldnt like it at all

archbishop marcel lefebvre today 
ordained 16 new traditionalist priests and urged them to join the 
fight against the cancer of liberalism in the roman catholic 
church 
the ordinations came on the eve of the consecration of four 
bishops by lefebvre a move that will cause the first schism or 
split in the church in more than a century and lead to lefebvres 
excommunication 
at least 5000 sympathizers watched the fourhour ceremony 
several traveled up to 16 hours to reach this swiss hamlet the 
birthplace of lefebvres st pius x fraternity 
in his homily the frenchborn prelate did not make any 
reference to his threatened excommunication the vatican said it 
will take effect as soon as he goes ahead with the consecrations 
without papal approval 
lefebvre whose movement is fighting reforms of the second 
vatican council said it was since the council in 196265 that 
the cancer of liberalism is spreading in the church 
join the fight against liberalism that false notion of 
freedom he said and be prepared to suffer persecution 
whatever you may be told you will remain catholic 
the vatican announced it was canceling a symphony concert to 
express its deep pain over the impending schism 
the concert of ludwig van beethovens missa solemnis was 
scheduled for thursday evening in the vaticans paul vi auditorium 
as part of a series of cultural events marking the current marian 
year 
in anticipation of the grave act that will take place tomorrow 
to the damage of the unity of the church the president of the 
committee for the marian year announces that the concert is 
canceled a vatican statement said 
todays ceremony brought to 220 the number of priests ordained 
by lefebvre in defiance of an earlier vatican sanction imposed in 
1976 that bars him from celebrating mass or giving the sacraments 
many knelt during the ordination mass celebrated in latin 
according to the 16th century tridentine rite the vatican council 
replaced it with the mass in vernacular 
many in the crowd were seen buying a dossier on thursdays 
consecration that contained the text of a letter lefebvre had 
addressed to the four future bishops in it he charged that the 
chair of peter and the posts of authority in rome are occupied by 
antichrists 
that was why he said he felt obliged to proceed with the 
consecrations so that the catholic church and priesthood will 
continue to exist for the glory of god 
history will prove that he is right said mark simmons a 
29yearold accounting clerk who flew over from london for the 
occasion the threat of excommuncation does not impress me at 
all it cannot be valid it would mean condemnation of 2000 years 
of church history 
pierre papay a 43yearold french businessman from angers said 
he had come to demonstrate his total support for lefebvre 
im not worried at all by these threats 
dominique bochatay a 30yearold swiss teacher said there 
will be no schism certainly not by us schismatic are those who 
break with the tradition who break with jesus christ

prosecutors are keeping sealed a longanticipated 
federal indictment for illegally shipping arms to the nicaraguan 
contras but defense attorneys already are criticizing it for 
penalizing soldiers instead of the generals 
the indictment was returned tuesday by a fort lauderdale grand 
jury that had called witnesses to testify about illegal arms 
flights to el salvador and private training for nicaraguan rebels 
a source close to the investigation who spoke under condition 
of anonymity said the charges may not be made public for a week or 
more 
among those expected to be charged are tom posey and some who 
worked for him at the private civilian material assistance group 
which claims to have collected 3 million for the contras said 
poseys attorney doug jones 
he said the charges will be based on the neutrality act which 
bans private citizens from interfering in foreign affairs 
i have a real hard time understanding why this will be a 
violation of the neutrality act now when it wasnt three years 
ago jones said 
posey and the organization were absolutely totally 
encouraged by the reagan administration to help the contras and did 
so openly jones said 
posey who testified before the grand jury said everything 
we have done is legal 
we have never provided lethal weapons to the contras he 
added 
critics of the investigation say it charges those who carried 
out plans to aid the contras but not those who designed the plans 
john mattes a federal public defender in miami says the us 
attorneys office dragged its feet in the investigation for 
political reasons and tried to keep him from investigating the case 
of his client jesus garcia 
garcia now out on parole from a minor weapons conviction tried 
to get a reduced sentence by saying he had participated in a 
governmentbacked armssmuggling operation out of fort lauderdale 
mattes claimed prosecutors and fbi agents tried to convince him to 
drop the defense investigation 
thenus attorney leon kellner along with prosecutors later 
called before a congressional committee strongly denied the charge 
mattes said there is little likelihood the indictments will 
include higherups who ordered the illegal arms shipments 
it was coordinated by robert owen on behalf of oliver north 
mattes said tuesday owen the state department liaison to the 
contras worked closely with north 
the foot soldiers are never charged in wars it is the people 
that ordered them that directed them 
the arms shipment that sparked the investigation was flown out 
of fort lauderdale in march 1985 after supporters of the rebels 
gathered 20mm cannons m60 machine guns mortar shells automatic 
rifles and ammunition at various points around miami 
steven carr a civilian material assistance member who later 
died of an apparent drug overdose in california told the 
associated press that the plane landed at ilopango air force base 
in el salvador the arms were stored there for several weeks he 
said and then sent on to contra troops in northern costa rica

a group of prominent intellectuals 
has issued the strongest statement yet calling for a reappraisal of 
josip broz titos role in leading the country into its worst social 
and economic crisis 
the 19member committee in defense of intellectual freedoms in 
a statement to the yugoslav leadership also called for an end to 
official veneration of the late president the founder of communist 
yugoslavia who died in may 1980 
a copy of the statement received by the associated press on 
wednesday said tito is responsible for creating an undemocratic 
repressive political system which has thwarted progressive 
development of the society 
titos role in making crucial political decisions and his 
absolute power in shaping yugoslav policies were so great that the 
presentday position of the country and particularly its current 
deep social crisis cannot be understood or explained without a 
comprehensive and objective scientific and critical reappraisal of 
his historical responsibility the statement said 
tito was the undisputed leader of yugoslavia for 35 years until 
his death in spite of growing public disapprobation criticism of 
his policies is still considered a criminal offense 
in addition to rising ethnic tensions yugoslavia is faced with 
a 21 billion foreign debt 170 percent inflation 15 percent 
unemployment dropping living standards and growing labor unrest 
the influential unofficial group consisting of a number of 
prominent university professors authors artists and scientists 
issues regular statements on political issues but observers said 
they could not recall previous instances where titos policies were 
questioned in such a way 
there can be no way out of the present economic political and 
moral crisis affecting yugoslav society without a thorough critical 
evaluation of past yugoslav policies the statement said 
the constitution adopted in 1974 under tito is generally blamed 
for the countrys woes it granted wide autonomy to the six often 
factious republics and two provinces 
the statement called for a dispassionate assessment of 
titos role in the governments repressive measures against 
dissidents particularly against those incarcerated on one of 
modern europes most sinister prison camps goli otok 
goli otok an island off the central adriatic coast was used as 
an internment camp for alleged opponents of the government after 
yugoslavias break with the soviet bloc in the late 1940s 
several thousand are said to have died in detention from ill 
treatment by prison authorities 
the statement criticized titos nonaligned foreign policy for 
having isolated our country from its natural cultural 
historical economic and political surrounding in europe 
tito was one of the founders of the nonaligned movement in the 
late 1950s and early 1960s 
instead of paving the way for yugoslavias political and 
economic integration in western europe the focus of titos foreign 
policies remained exclusively on africa and asia the statement 
said 
the forum also criticized titos lavish lifestyle demanding to 
know the real costs of his rule

hungarys parliament expected to make 
significant changes in the government and discuss economic reforms 
began meeting for the first time today under new premier karoly 
grosz 
grosz led a new generation of communist leaders into power 
during a national party conference last month 
during the opening day of its spring session members of 
parliament elected bruno f straub as president a largely 
ceremonial post straub had been virtually assured parliamentary 
approval after he was nominated last week by the communist partys 
central committee 
the conference marks the end of janos kadars 32year leadership 
of hungary and paves the way for sweeping economic reforms grosz 
and other officials say are necessary to overcome economic 
stagnation and cope with the highest per capita foreign debt in 
eastern europe 
grosz replaced kadar as party chief last month 
the central committee of the hungarian socialist workers 
party and the national council of the patriotic peoples front 
forwarded joint personnel proposals on filling leading posts of the 
presidential council the news agency mti said in a terse report 
in announcing the session opening 
grosz became premier in june 1987 and won international 
recognition for his determination to push through a program of 
unpopular austerity measures including the introduction of 
personal income and valueadded taxes 
however grosz has said in recent interviews that his government 
has failed so far to revitalize the stagnant economy 
proposed government changes at the current session include the 
creation of a new cabinet position minister of state for imre 
pozsgay a key advocate of political change to accompany economic 
reforms 
he is to be entrusted with as yet unspecified tasks that are 
likely to include overseeing reforms 
soviet bloc parliaments traditionally rubberstamp party 
decisions but hungarian parliament sessions have increasingly been 
marked by intensive debate since some nonparty candidates were 
allowed to run for the assembly in 1985 
straub 74 replaced karoly nemeth 67 who has been officially 
on sick leave since june 1 nemeth was dropped from the politburo 
in may

the supreme court refusing to give new 
protection to crime victims today severely limited state efforts 
to shield young sex abuse victims when they testify at criminal 
trials 
the justices voting 62 overturned the conviction of an iowa 
man sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually molesting two 
13yearold girls 
the court said the defendants rights to a fair trial and to 
confront his accusers appear to have been violated by the use of a 
oneway screen that was placed in front of him at trial to prevent 
the children from seeing him 
the decision could jeopardize other efforts to protect 
witnesses such as videotaped testimony 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said such oneway 
screens violate a defendants right to confront his accusers 
it is difficult to imagine a more obvious or damaging 
violation of the defendants right to a facetoface encounter he 
said 
scalia said the defendants rights were not outweighed by the 
necessity of protecting victims of sexual abuse 
most states have approved the use of some form of protective 
device in child abuse cases when young witnesses testify 
todays case stems from the conviction of john avery coy on sex 
molesting charges 
a screen was placed in front of coy in court to shield the girls 
from seeing him when they testified prosecutors said the device 
which allowed coy to see the girls was intended to safeguard the 
children from possible emotional trauma 
a state law presumed children under 14 would be traumatized in 
such situations 
but coys lawyers said the screen made a guilty verdict 
practically inevitable by creating a presumption he was guilty 
they also said the screen deprived coy of confronting the girls 
face to face violating a constitutional right intended to yield 
honest testimony 
the lawyers said the screen was particularly prejudicial because 
in order for it to function properly the courtroom was darkened and 
a panel of bright lights was directed at the device 
coys lawyers said there was no evidence the girls were in 
danger of being traumatized 
they also argued that the judge in the case mistakenly may have 
believed the state law compelled him either to order the oneway 
screen or to have the girls testify outside the courtroom on 
closedcircuit television 
prosecutors initially asked the judge to permit the girls to 
testify via closed circuit tv coys lawyers objected to the 
request the judge overruled the objection but then ordered the 
screen used 
the screen resembled an oversize school blackboard 
the iowa supreme court in upholding coys conviction said the 
judge was not obligated to determine that the screen was necessary 
or that it served a compelling state interest 
the children were attacked while they were in a makeshift tent 
in their backyard adjacent to coys home they were unable to 
identify their assailant who was masked and shined a flashlight at 
them 
there was circumstantial evidence that led police to charge coy 
with the attack including testimony by the girls that their 
attacker wore his watch midway up his arm with the face turned 
inward coy was under arrest on an unrelated charge when police 
came to suspect him of the attack on the girls 
the supreme court has ruled previously that stigmatizing 
defendants in certain ways may violate their rights for example 
the court has struck down such practices as requiring defendants to 
wear shackles leg irons or prison uniforms while appearing in 
court 
but the justices have held even inherently prejudicial courtroom 
procedures may be allowed when they promote an essential state 
policy 
the court sent todays case back to the iowa courts for further 
hearings 
the justices said the conviction against coy could be reinstated 
only if the lower courts determine that the use of the oneway 
screen was a harmless error and there is proof beyond a 
reasonable doubt coy would have been convicted even if the screen 
had not been used 
dissentimg were chief justice william h rehnquist and harry a 
blackmun justice anthony m kennedy did not take part in the case 
the case is coy vs iowa 866757

israel and the united states today are signing 
an agreement to develop and produce jointly a new surfacetoair 
missile to counter a growing arab missile and chemical weapons 
arsenal 
the agreement is being signed at the pentagon by gen david 
ivry director general of the israeli defense ministry and lt 
gen james abrahamson director of the us strategic defense 
initiative organization 
the signing follows a statement of concern issued tuesday by 
president reagan after a meeting at the white house with israeli 
defense minister yitzhak rabin the president said he was troubled 
by ominous new military developments in the area 
rabin during two days of talks here has stressed soviet 
deliveries of new missiles to syria and libya and chinese 
shipments to saudi arabia 
the israeli official flew up to boston late monday for a 
45minute meeting with michael dukakis who is expected to win the 
democratic presidential nomination the substance of their 
conversation was not divulged 
after a speech today at the national press club and the signing 
ceremony at the pentagon rabin was to fly to huntsville ala to 
inspect us space and other military facilities there 
the reagan administration reassured rabin on tuesday of the us 
commitment to israels security but scolded him for the use of 
violence to quell palestinian disturbances in the occupied 
territories 
summarizing rabins talks here with reagan vice president 
george bush and top administration officials the white house said 
tuesday that the us government reaffirmed americas commitment 
to israels security 
but in a detailed account of the private talks between staunch 
allies the white house said rabin had been told israel should show 
more flexibility in the push for a middle east peace settlement and 
less inclination toward violence in the west bank and gaza strip 
the stern words were accompanied by a us promise to sign a 
memorandum of understanding for joint americanisraeli development 
of an antiballistic missile in response to ominous new military 
developments in the region 
rabin following his talks with reagan bush secretary of state 
george shultz defense secretary frank carlucci and national 
security adviser colin d powell pronounced himself satisfied 
in perhaps its harshest condemnation yet of violence in the 
territories the white house said in a statement neither should 
violence nor controls on violence become ends in themselves making 
a political solution more difficult 
realism and a willingness to nurture rather than reject 
possible opportunities for peace are essential as is a climate 
that makes negotiations possible it said 
although rabin and foreign minister shimon peres of the labor 
party have expressed general support for the us peace initiative 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has shown little enthusiasm for it 
the administration has been reluctant to criticize israels use 
of force against palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip where 210 palestinians and four israeli settlers have been 
killed since arab unrest began in december 
in its statement the white house said while israel should 
not be expected to make concessions under the threat of violence 
the preservation of order in the territories must neither provide a 
justification for civilian lawlessness nor act as an excuse for 
avoiding political discourse with the palestinians of the west bank 
and gaza 
rabin told reporters he was going back home quite satisfied 
with his expectations of continued us aid 
the framework of the support will be basically the same he 
said we also are aware of other problems that the united states 
faces we know of the problems about foreign aid bills and about 
the defense bills 
as long as we will be able to keep in reality the same level 
of support we are satisfied 
israel the largest single recipient of us aid is receiving 
about 3 billion in total military and economic assistance this 
fiscal year legislation before congress calls for an identical 
appropriation in fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 
rabin said the two sides discussed ways of reducing 
proliferation of groundtoground missiles in the middle east and 
of neutralizing damage from the weapons 
the new antiballistic missile is intended to counter this 
threat the white house said the american contribution will be 
about 80 percent and the israeli contribution 20 percent

delegates to a nationwide communist party 
conference today clashed over the pace of economic reforms in the 
soviet union with local managers saying the reforms had not gone 
far enough to help the stagnant economy 
the conference the partys first in 47 years also ordered an 
investigation into a soviet magazines charge that some delegates 
from the central asian republic of uzbekistan were involved in 
corruption 
reports in the official media on the second day of the 
conference indicated debate was shifting from political questions 
to the economy with the opening days presentation by economist 
leonid abalkin at the center of the debate 
abalkin head of the soviet academy of sciences economics 
institute and a top adviser to mikhail s gorbachev told the 5000 
delegates that the soviet economy is not improving because it still 
measures its progress by quantity rather than quality of products 
but georgy arbatov head of the institute of the usa and 
canada and a member of the policymaking central committee said he 
totally disagreed with abalkin tass reported 
the conference the 19th in party history was convened by 
gorbachev to review changes he has made since rising to power in 
march 1985 and to consider further steps he said are needed to 
modernize the country the delegates are meeting behind closed 
doors in the kremlin and only official soviet media are permitted 
to cover the proceedings 
the official tass news agency said arbatov told delegates the 
soviet union had made great progress in creating the political 
spiritual and moral preconditions for the economic reform 
but ya smirnov manager of a chemical factory in the ural 
mountain city of nizhnitagilsk complained that he had heard 
nothing that would help him improve the work of his factory 
i generally expected to hear much more how to transform it 
what kinds of tactics to use what stages what frontiers he 
said in an interview with soviet television 
addressing abalkin in his television interview smirnov said 
you are the economic institute you should map this strategy 
abalkin said its necessary but did not say how to do it the fate 
of perestroika depends on it 
va yarin a senior machine operator at a metallurgy factory in 
nizhnitagilsk said government ministers should get out of the 
fashionable halls of the kremlin to make their reports in 
workingclass districts 
abalkin said rigid central planning of production quotas made it 
impossible to solve the problems of a radical improvement in the 
quality of output technical reequipment of the national economy 
enhancing its efficiency making the economy face the consumer 
f v popov party leader in the siberian altai region drew his 
fellow delegates attention to the latest issue of the weekly 
ogonyok magazine which accused some uzbek delegates of involvement 
in corruption 
ogonyok said several bribetakers had been elected to the 
conference from the republic 
the delegates asked the credentials commission which previously 
had certified all delegates to investigate the charge 
tass said that georgy razumovsky chairman of the conferences 
credentials commission opened todays session with a report that 
some delegates were elected by their party organizations without 
popular support 
but he said established procedures were followed and the 
commission had certified the election of all delegates tass 
reported 
during the election campaign to select the delegates prominent 
advocates of gorbachevs reforms charged that middlelevel party 
bureaucrats were naming conservative allies as delegates at the 
expense of the reformers 
on tuesday delegates moved to restrict their debate after one 
speaker was hounded for straying from the subject at hand the 
official media reported 
the conference is considering the broad blueprint for political 
reform that gorbachev presented to its opening session on tuesday 
in a 3hour televised speech gorbachev proposed creating a 
powerful fulltime legislature and a presidency with powers akin to 
many western heads of state 
but the proposals left many questions unanswered about the 
future role of the party and its general secretary the post 
gorbachev holds 
pravda the communist party daily said delegates began clapping 
in protest on tuesday when a moscow party official v 
belyaninov strayed from the agenda during his speech 
tass said the conference then adopted a rule limiting speeches 
so delegates would not waste time it did not mention what 
belyaninov said but the rule prohibits delegates from reporting on 
their own activities or congratulating the chamber on its conduct 
of the discussion

president reagan today branded likely democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis a true liberal who would 
raise taxes and restore the heavy hand of government in 
american lives 
in his most direct attack yet on the massachusetts governor who 
is virtually assured of opposing vice president george bush in the 
fall election reagan told a republican party fundraising event 
the sad truth is that whenever liberals talk about reducing the 
deficit its just a code word for boosting taxes 
the 64 billion question is this should we expect that if the 
democrats allbutcertain presidential candidate is elected that 
he would raise taxes the president asked in fact he just 
did 
reagan making an appearance on behalf of rep connie mack iii 
who is seeking the republican nomination for the senate seat being 
vacated by sen lawton chiles dfla said that in the last five 
years dukakis has increased massachusetts state spending at 
double the rate of federal spending 
although the growth in federal spending has been slowed during 
the reagan years and the deficit has been cut largely through the 
grammrudman budgetbalancing act and a deal reagan struck with 
congressional leaders last fall the president has presided over 
the largest federal budget deficits in history reagan has blamed 
congress for that even though he has never submitted a balanced 
budget to capitol hill 
in making the trip to miami today reagan inadvertently put 
himself in the middle of a republican primary fight in florida 
the president who follows a policy of not interfering in 
primary contests accepted the speaking date weeks ago on the 
assumption that mack grandson of the legendary baseball manager 
would be unopposed in the sept 6 florida primary 
on monday however us attorney robert merkle the prosecutor 
who obtained a drug indictment against panamanian gen manuel 
antonio noriega resigned his federal post and jumped into the race 
in his speech to the fundraising luncheon reagan noted macks 
connection to baseball and said that next year thanks to you 
washington will have a new winning team and i mean real major 
leaguers sen connie mack and president george bush 
what the 1988 elections are all about is whether we continue 
to build on that progress and move ahead to an even brighter 
future or whether he hesitate and return to those wornout 
policies that bring high taxes low growth and a loss of direction 
and purpose he said 
and each time the people have made the same decision to 
continue in the direction of economic freedom entrepreneurship and 
individual opportunity he said and to move away from the 
heavy hand of government which seeks to control the people and the 
economy

that connie faces is a true liberal who instead of controlling 
government spending raises taxes reagan said

concessions with cubas fidel castro to warm relations between the 
united states and the island nation 
there is an unbridgeable gulf between the governments of the

storms cheered by thousands at a majorleague baseball game in 
kansas city brought desperately needed rain to the droughtbattered 
midwest today but forecasters said much more was needed 
you talk about a 1 million rain this is a 100 million 
rain extension agent vance haugen in northeast wisconsins 
shawano county said as the storms began tuesday were very 
happy were out dancing in it 
meanwhile the president of the american farm bureau charged 
that the droughts severity is being exaggerated by the media and 
politicians 
the national media never met a disaster they didnt like 
dean kleckner said during a news conference at colorado state 
university as part of a tour of four western states 
the nightly network news media have made up their minds the 
story is no crops in the country a complete disaster higher food 
prices he said 
politicians are hoping to take advantage of the drought crisis 
in an election year he claimed the farm bureau is a private 
nonprofit federation with 35 million members 
tuesdays rainfall was the first significant precipitation for 
the chicago area since may 23 the national weather service said 
the worst drought to hit americas midsection since the dust 
bowl has withered crops dried up water supplies halted barge 
traffic on shrunken rivers and sparked forest fires 
a record 167 inches of rain fell tuesday in madison wis 
where the old mark of 162 inches was set in 1928 in six hours 
overnight more than 3 inches fell in oklahoma city where streets 
were up to 3 feet deep in water omaha neb got 26 inches 
overnight and lacrosse wis got 2 inches 
in michigan however traverse city farm bureau agent john 
amrhein said the rain we got was almost nothing wasnt even 
enough really to settle the dust 
it definitely helps but probably a lot more will be needed to 
really change the situation the weather services hugh crowther 
said from kansas city mo 
scattered showers and thunderstorms extended today from the high 
plains to the midmississippi valley 
when light rain began falling tuesday in the bottom of the ninth 
of the white soxroyals game in kansas city the 27000 spectators 
broke into sustained applause but the rain lasted only a few 
minutes and the royals lost 43 
despite the rain temperatures in the 100s seared sections of 
the midwest it was 101 degrees in kansas city where the old 
record of 94 was set in 1978 temperatures hit 105 in sioux falls 
sd 1 degree higher than the 1931 record 
tripledigit temperatures caused part of interstate 20 in 
central mississippi to buckle more than 4 feet triggering a 
collision between two cars and a tractortrailer rig officials 
said no serious injuries were reported 
last weeks heat severely stressed crops and blotted up soil 
moisture in most of the nations eastern half the governments 
joint agricultural weather facility reported tuesday 
corn cotton soybeans sorghum and spring wheat conditions 
continued declining the week of june 2026 the unit said the 
lack of moisture may prevent some recently planted soybeans and 
sorghum from emerging 
pastures were rated poor to very poor and farmers culled herds 
as pasture and hay supplies dropped the report said 
vice president george bush the republican partys apparent 
presidential nominee was to attend a livestock auction in marion 
wis today to call attention to the farmers plight 
in washington agriculture secretary richard lyng meeting with 
ohios congressional delegation resisted a request from democratic 
sen howard metzenbaum the department expedite disaster 
assessments such assessments would be a step toward making farmers 
eligible for lowinterest loans 
most farmers you would ask say they dont know what kind of 
crop theyre going to have on the 28th of june lyng said and 
i think it would be very dangerous for us to start making these 
loans for just political reasons he said 
in other developments 
the coast guard tightened restrictions on barge traffic on the 
lower mississippi northbound towboats will be limited to 20 
barges only 12 of which can be loaded said cmdr michael donohoe

the defense departments chief purchasing 
official today defended his attempt last month to give top pentagon 
political appointees the power to veto searches of the private 
contractors who supply military equipment 
robert costello undersecretary of defense for acquisition told 
the house armed services committee he wrote the memo after a 
contractors office in st louis had been searched costello said 
he didnt object to the search but said it should not have been 
conducted without a prior review at the upper levels of the 
pentagon 
the system at that point had been shortcircuited costello 
said the people at the local level had taken perhaps overly 
aggressive actions if the system had been allowed to function as 
it was constructed to function the access to the information 
could have been achieved without resort to the use of force 
the may 5 memo was written before the public ever learned of a 
twoyear nationwide investigation into allegedly corrupt pentagon 
contracting the associated press obtained the memo tuesday 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the committee told costello 
that the memo itself sends the wrong signal to defense 
contractors the whole tenor of that the memo is awfully 
sympathetic to defense contractors 
defense secretary frank carlucci rejected the proposal 
perceiving it as interference in the conduct of criminal 
investigations air force col david j shea a pentagon 
spokesman said tuesday 
the plan could have curtailed a crucial tool for investigators 
seeking evidence that topsecret pentagon information was sold to 
private consultants who then sold it to contractors about three 
dozen searches have been conducted so far 
the costellotocarlucci memo complained that defense department 
investigators had executed a search last february in a 
sensational manner by using some two dozen law enforcement 
officers and failing to give the company prior notice that 
particular search was part of a fraud investigation but was 
apparently unrelated to the nationwide probe 
initially carlucci sent costello a note saying this is a 
good idea shea said 
but shea insisted tuesday the note referred only to costellos 
suggestion that pentagon investigators be trained to obtain 
evidence in the least forceful and sensational manner 
shea said carlucci doesnt want to be associated with 
costellos proposal that a review and approval system be 
established for search warrants 
the appropriate level of review andor approval should at 
least be deputy secretary of defense will taft or myself and 
quite possibly yourself costello wrote 
on tuesday a justice department official confirmed that 
attorney general edwin meese iii has removed himself from the 
investigation because his own lawyers represent figures in the 
pentagon case 
earlier in the day meese had spoken about the case at length 
during a news conference but never mentioned that he had withdrawn 
from it 
meese spokesman patrick korten later confirmed that the attorney 
general had recused himself korten said meese didnt mention it 
because there wasnt any particular reason to mention it 
at the news conference meese said he thinks congress is to 
blame for creating an atmosphere conducive to scandal at the 
pentagon he said congress puts layers of requirements on 
pentagon officials and ignores budget planning cycles leading 
contractors to say weve got to get ours now 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said he agrees there are too many regulations but many came from 
within the pentagon rather than from congress in any event he 
said that is no excuse for pure old fraud waste and greed 
in other developments 
former navy secretary james h webb said investigators told him 
last fall that navy officialturnedconsultant melvyn paisley and 
an unidentified member of webbs headquarters staff were under 
investigation 
the washington post reported today that the defense department 
is reviewing six previously closed fraud investigations to see if 
they should be reopened in light of the new allegations pentagon 
inspector general june gibbs brown said her office is reviewing any 
past cases involving individuals or companies whose names have come 
up in the current investigation 
the fbi said it searched the home of richard seelmeyer who was 
an aide to the late rep joseph p addabbo dny seelmeyer is now 
publisher of capitol hill defense digest a newsletter about 
military matters addabbo who died in april 1986 was chairman of 
the house subcommittee on defense department appropriations 
costellos suggestion for the search warrant review was rejected 
not only by carlucci but by brown the pentagon inspector general 
according to a pentagon source speaking only on condition he not 
be named 
the source said ms brown indicated to mr carlucci the 
department of justice will not accept a procedure whereby use of 
search warrants by defense criminal investigative organizations 
would require concurrence of any official outside the office of 
inspector general 
costellos anger was triggered by a feb 25 search at the 
electronic amp space division of emerson electric co near st louis 
the search was partly based on an affidavit by john e lake an 
agent of the defense criminal investigation service the company 
responded with a lawsuit asking that the search be declared 
unconstitutional 
in court papers filed by emerson the company said government 
agents lied or left out important information when they asked for a 
search warrant 
lakes affidavit said that in october he began investigating 
fraudulent billings for contracts performed for the department of 
defense 
authorities alleged that emerson violated federal law by billing 
the government for parts that were installed on vehicles the 
company was making for egypt under a separate contract 
costello complained in his memo that only minimal 
consideration was given to executing the search warrant in a less 
sensational manner 
to send 19 dcis agents one customs agent and several 
missouri state troopers directly to the plant appears to me to be 
an unwarranted show of force that invites sensational treatment in 
the press he wrote

foreign minister pik botha 
said today a cuban and angolan raid on south african forces in 
southern angola could threaten peace talks to end the 13yearold 
angolan civil war 
south african soldiers protecting a dam killed more than 300 
angolan and cuban troops who launched a land and air attack monday 
south african military headquarters said it said 12 south africans 
were killed 
the 12 deaths were the countrys highest fatality count in a 
single battle in angola during the past year col john rolt of the 
south african defense force described the battle as one of the 
biggest south africancuban clashes since cuban troops arrived in 
1975 to support angolas marxist government 
the battle occurred at a dam outside calueque about 30 miles 
north of the border with southwest africa the territory 
administered by south africa 
the south african military said 11 of its soldiers were killed 
by a bomb dropped from a sovietmade mig fighter plane the 12th 
soldier was killed in the ground skirmish that left 300 cubans and 
angolans dead the military said 
south africa has long protected the dam which supplies water to 
southwest africa also known as namibia the dam wall was damaged 
electricity to the wall was cut off and a water pipeline was 
destroyed the military said 
botha said the attack confirms cubas aggressive intentions 
adding that additional raids could undermine ongoing peace talks 
south africa angola cuba and the united states have held three 
rounds of peace talks since may including discussions that 
concluded last weekend in cairo egypt a fourth round is scheduled 
next month in the united states 
the talks have focused on withdrawing all foreign troops from 
angola and bringing independence to namibia the talks have not 
produced any concrete results but all sides have described the 
meetings as productive 
i cannot at this stage predict how the events at calueque will 
affect the further course of the discussions botha said in a 
statement released early today however should this trend 
continue it will serve no purpose to hold further discussions 
botha said south african protection of the calueque dam was 
discussed in may at peace talks in brazzaville congo 
the impression was left that angola understood the position 
and would ensure that calueque would not become the scene of 
military intervention by the cubans botha said 
the clash at calueque confirms the south african governments 
suspicion that the cuban command in angola ignores the angolan 
government and possibly also the cuban political 
representatives who participated in the discussions botha added 
south africa has said that during the past year it has had up to 
3000 troops in angola supporting the national union for the total 
independence of angola unita a prowestern rebel movement 
unita which also receives military aid from the united states has 
been fighting since 1975 for a powersharing agreement 
angola claims there are 9000 south african troops inside its 
borders the angolan government meanwhile is backed by more than 
40000 cuban troops and an estimated 1000 soviet advisers 
in recent weeks south africa and unita said the cubans and 
angolans had moved at least 15000 fresh troops to southern angola 
along the border with namibia the angolans said the troop 
movements were to match south african activity in the area 
south africa traditionally has crossed into angola from 
southwest africa in pursuit of guerrillas of the southwest 
african peoples organization 
the guerrilla group has been fighting for 21 years to end south 
african control of the territory the rebels often launch their 
periodic raids from bases in southern angola

democrat michael dukakis got down to serious talk about a 
running mate today beginning private meetings at the capitol with 
senators including some mentioned as possible candidates while 
president reagan joined the campaign fray by blasting dukakis as a 
liberal sure to raise taxes 
vice president george bush the likely republican presidential 
nominee said today in a foreign policy speech in san francisco 
that sweeping changes being proposed by soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev should be viewed with optimism but he added the cold 
war is not over 
in a speech to the world affairs council the vice president 
credited americas military buildup for a change in soviet 
thinking my point is that it was eight years of american 
strength that confronted the soviet union with the true costs of 
aggression and the necessity of reform bush said 
reagan in remarks prepared for delivery at a gop fundraising 
event in miami referred to dukakis though never mentioning him by 
name as a true liberal and he said the sad truth is that 
whenever liberals talk about reducing the deficit its just a 
code word for boosting taxes 
the 64 billion question is this should we expect that if the 
democrats allbutcertain presidential candidate is elected that 
he would raise taxes the president asked in fact he just 
did 
dukakis recently signed a cigarette tax designed to head off a 
deficit in the massachusetts state budget 
reagan taking credit for the 1980s economic revival in 
massachusetts said dukakis has spent every dime and more of the 
revenue generated in his state by the eaganbush recovery and 
since 1986 while the federal budget deficit has been cut sharply 
his deficit in massachusetts has ballooned 
the dukakis administration says the state budget will in fact be 
in balance as mandated by law at the end of the fiscal year on 
thursday 
the massachusetts governor and certain democratic presidential 
nominee also planned to travel to the midwest late today and like 
bush highlight the hardships caused by the long dry spell 
dukakis who earlier said he was enjoying the process of 
selecting a running mate said nothing to reporters as he arrived 
at the capitol today 
bush previewing the foreign policy speech he was to give to the 
world affairs council in san francisco today said tuesday that 
americans should be very very wary about whether gorbachevs 
call for sweeping changes in the soviet union actually will lead to 
a fundamental departure from their marxist system 
on the other hand bush said gorbachev should be encouraged to 
move ahead with his twin programs of glasnost or opennesss and 
perestroika or restructuring 
in interviews tuesday bush said he was not worried about a 
gallup poll for the times mirror corp released this week which 
showed him running 13 points behind dukakis 
i like to come back he said i think im going to win 
bush was heading back to washington after a brief stopover in 
appleton wis 
dukakis meanwhile was spending today on capitol hill in 
meetings with as many as 30 democratic senators among them 
perhaps will be his eventual choice for a vice presidential 
nominee 
sources say the dukakis campaign is seeking exhaustive 
background information even driving records from potential 
candidates to avoid any embarrassing surprises after the ticket 
has been set 
the most recent among the possible candidates reportedly 
declining to be considered is rep thomas foley of washington the 
house majority leader 
at a joint appearance tuesday in boston with dukakis sen alan 
cranston dcalif said the betting on capitol hill seems to be 
john glenn and lloyd bentsen as the frontrunners for the no 2 
spot 
dukakis laughed when told that the ohio or texas senator was the 
sure winner im not a betting man he said 
republican party sources meanwhile said tuesday that new 
jersey gov thomas kean has been chosen to deliver the keynote 
speech at the republican national convention in august in new 
orleans the selection could be announced as early as today the 
sources said 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said bush was 
attracted to the governors views outlined in his book the 
politics of inclusion on ways to reach beyond the gops 
traditional wealthy whitecollar base 
although kean has also been mentioned as a potential running 
mate for bush kean said tuesday im doing everything i can to 
make sure he doesnt come to me 
former un ambassador jeane j kirkpatrick will be a featured 
speaker at the gop convention it was announced tuesday 
kirkpatrick had endorsed senate republican leader bob dole for 
president during the primaries 
republican party chief frank j fahrenkopf jr said there was no 
link between the announcement and the democrats choice on monday 
of texas treasurer ann richards as their convention keynote speaker 
while in california bush endorsed the recommendation of 
president reagans aids commission that victims of the deadly 
disease should have federal protection from discrimination on the 
job in schools and elsewhere 
reagan has yet to take a position on the recommendation and 
bush supported the president adding ive got a different role 
here i want to say what i think 
jesse jackson in a speech tueday at the 17th annual convention 
of his operation push said the federal government should be 
required to set aside 10 percent of all contracts to businesses 
owned by minorities he also said a cabinetlevel administrator 
should be put in charge of making sure affirmative action programs 
are enforced

the official saudi press agency reported today 
the saudi government said it will punish anyone involved in a 
violation of security including possession of weapons or 
explosives and any act of disturbance terrorism or sabotage 
such as demonstrations sloganshouting and carrying of posters and 
banners use of loudspeakers and blocking of roads and delaying of 
pilgrims from performing the rites the news agency said 
the statement issued tuesday was clearly aimed at the shiite 
moslem followers of irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who are 
among the millions of pilgrims to visit mecca 
the annual hajj or pilgrimage to mecca begins in late july 
during last years pilgrimage more than 400 people mostly 
iranian shiites were killed in riots iran accused saudi security 
forces of opening fire on its people 
the saudis accused the iranians of holding demonstrations 
including antius protests in defiance of a ban on political 
activity in april saudi arabia broke off diplomatic relations 
with tehran citing terrorism and subversion 
the law in the kingdom of saudi arabia is based on the koran and 
its islamic code which allows beheading and crucifixion 
crucifixion has not been used in years in saudi arabia other 
punishments include the cutting off of hands or feet 
the saudis said their warning of koranic punishment was 
triggered by reports from tehran of threats from khomeini and his 
aides to plant some hired agents of different nationalities to 
conduct acts of sabotage including holiganism and atheistic 
chantings and other foolish practices carried out by the 
revolutionary guards last year 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus said today that the saudi regime fears a truly islamic 
hajj and holding of demonstrations it has created obstacles for 
moslems

this year to 45000 instead of the previous 150000 
iranian leaders have said they will boycott this years hajj 
but have called on shiite moslems from other countries to stage 
protests

most of saudi arabias 11 million people belong to the predominant 
sunni sect of islam saudi arabia said that iranian revolutionary 
guards posing as pilgrims tried in 1986 to smuggle explosives 
hidden in suitcases into saudi arabia to carry out sabotage

the supreme court in an 113 million victory 
for the state of massachusetts ruled today that federal judges 
have the power to settle disputes between states and the federal 
government involving medicaid funds 
the 63 ruling reinstated a federal judges decision that 
massachusetts may recover 113 million in medicaid money to care 
for the mentally retarded that the federal government had withheld 
medicaid is a joint federalstate program to provide medical 
care to the financially needy states administer the daytoday 
operations and the federal government pays part of the costs 
reimbursing the states in advance 
from 1978 through 1982 massachusetts received several hundred 
million dollars in federal money as partial reimbursement for 
providing medical assistance to the mentally retarded 
under regulations adopted by the secretary of health and human 
services medicaid reimbursements are not available for 
vocational training and educational activities 
in two separate audits federal officials determined that 
massachusetts had obtained medicaid reimbursements for various 
special education services provided to mentally retarded people 
living in intermediate care facilities 
the federal officials disallowed 113 million in reimbursements 
paid for the fiveyear period in question and recovered the money 
by withholding some advance medicaid reimbursements in subsequent 
years 
massachusetts officials sued hhs secretary otis bowen in a 
federal trial court seeking to recover the 113 million and to 
bar his agency from failing to reimburse such services in the 
future 
us district judge w arthur garrity jr of boston ruled in 
1985 that the government must make up the 113 milion withheld 
from massachusetts 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals last march 31 overruled 
part of garritys decision 
the appeals court said that under a federal law called the 
tucker act any claim against the federal government for more than 
10000 in monetary damages must be settled by the us claims 
court based in the nations capital 
but the appeals court upheld garritys decision regarding future 
reimbursement 
the reagan administration asked the supreme court to step in to 
decide which court has jurisdiction in such disputes 
the justices today ruled that garrity rather than the claims 
court had authority to decide the case 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said federal 
judges rather than the claims court are empowered to review final 
orders by the secretary of health and human services refusing to 
reimburse states for medicaid expenditures 
dissenting were chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
the case is bowen vs massachusetts 87712

michael dukakis enjoying the process 
took his search for a running mate to the capitol today while aides 
ran extensive background checks on even the driving records of 
potential candidates 
the massachusetts governor and certain democratic presidential 
nominee entered the capitol without saying a word today and headed 
to a room to conduct meetings all day with as many as 30 or more 
democratic senators among them perhaps his eventual choice for 
a vice presidential nominee 
dukakis met first with most of the 16 senators up for 
reelection this fall including lloyd bentsen of texas and daniel 
patrick moynihan of new york 
two other senators who met with dukakis george mitchell of 
maine and john kerry of massachusetts said the subject of the vice 
presidency came up but that the likely nominee did not discuss the 
names of potential candidates 
he said the process is still open and hes enjoying the 
process of getting to know people kerry said no names were 
mentioned 
paul brountas dukakis senior adviser who is leading the search 
for a vice presidential candidate sat in on the meetings kerry 
said 
press secretary dayton duncan said dukakis might also meet with 
some house members before the day was out but planned a return 
visit on july 13 to meet with house democrats 
he said dukakis felt no pressure to make or announce a decision 
on a running mate soon despite suggestions the campaign would like 
to make the choice before the democratic national convention opens 
july 18 
he doesnt feel like hes under any timetable or deadline 
duncan said 
dukakis planned a lateafternoon departure on a campaign swing 
through the midwest starting in des moines iowa where he 
scheduled an event to highlight the hardship farmers face on the 
droughtstricken plains 
dukakis dismissed speculation about his search for a running 
mate saying at an appearance tuesday in boston theres only one 
guy who knows whats going on and thats the guy youre looking at 
im enjoying the process and i hope you are too he added 
dukakis refused to rule out sen sam nunn of georgia for the no 
2 spot on the ticket despite nunns insistence that he is not 
interested the georgia senator said he had no plans to provide the 
background information being requested of prospective running mates 
dukakis also said sen bob graham of florida remained in 
contention 
campaign spokesmen were providing few details of his washington 
meetings 
all that does is lead to tealeaf reading said duncan 
duncan said only that the campaign would release a list of 
senators he had met with by the end of the day dukakis was to use 
an office in the capitol where senators would drop by to see him 
duncan said 
dukakis campaign according to sources has asked for an 
exhaustive amount of information from several potential democratic 
vice presidential contenders 
officials said dukakis campaign has requested detailed 
background information including income tax returns academic 
records driving records military records and health records among 
other material 
brountas is even delving into details of sen john glenns 1984 
presidential campaign sources said they sought information about 
the ohio senators lingering 24 million campaign debt and a staff 
upheavalat a critical time in that illfated campaign 
the campaign wants to avoid any embarrassing surprises once the 
choice has been made past campaigns have been damaged by 
controversy over the running mate such as in 1984 when financial 
questions were raised about the husband of nominee geraldine 
ferraro and in 1972 when revelations about sen thomas eagletons 
psychiatric treatment led to his withdrawal from the ticket 
dukakis aides have solicited information from several 
prospective candidates including jesse jackson and glenn as well 
as sens graham nunn and bentsen and reps thomas foley of 
washington former rival richard gephardt of missouri and lee 
hamilton of indiana the names of sen dale bumpers of arkansas and 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee also have cropped up 
foley has reportedly declined to provide the requested 
information sen bill bradley of new jersey also has taken himself 
out of the running and dukakis said friday i respect that 
dukakis appeared in boston with sen alan cranston dcalif at 
an event where he promised to spend 3 billion on subsidized 
housing 
cranston said the betting on capitol hill seems to be john 
glenn and lloyd bentsen as the frontrunners for the no 2 spot 
dukakis laughed when told of cranstons assessment im not a 
betting man he said

the supreme court today barred states from 
placing sweeping strict regulations on professional forprofit 
organizations that solicit contributions for charities 
the justices by a 72 vote ruled that a north carolina law 
that imposed such regulations violated freespeech rights 
numerous charitable groups such as the national federation of 
the blind the american red cross and the easter seal society had 
urged the court to disallow north carolinas regulations for 
fundraising they said the restrictions severely threatened 
charities ability to raise money 
the north carolina regulations would have forced fundraising 
organizations solicitors to tell prospective contributors what 
percentage of the money they raised over the past 12 months had 
been used for expenses and fundraising fees 
the forprofit solicitors also would have been required to 
disclose before requesting a contribution the approximate 
percentage of money that would go for charity 
the 1985 north carolina law also required forprofit fundraising 
organizations to be licensed and generally regarded fundraising 
costs greater than 35 percent of contributions to be unreasonable 
and illegal 
the law was aimed at preventing fraud and applied to telephone 
and doortodoor solicitations 
north carolina officials had discovered that some forprofit 
fundraisers kept between 75 percent and 85 percent of the money 
raised for various charities in no case did the officials find a 
professional fundraising organization pay more than half of its 
revenues to the charities in whose names the money was raised 
justice william j brennan writing for the court today said 
each of north carolinas requirements violates freespeech rights 
the interest in protecting charities and the public from fraud 
is of course a sufficiently substantial interest to justify a 
narrowly tailored regulation brennan said 
the question then is whether the north carolina law is 
sufficiently tailored to this remaining interest we conclude that 
it is not he said 
the decision likely will carry an immediate impact for dozens of 
local and state regulations seeking to ensure that the bulk of 
charitable contributions actually go to charities 
only a few other states maine tennessee and indiana among 
them have enacted laws requiring financial disclosures during 
solicitation and the laws in those states ran into adverse court 
rulings too 
todays decision calls those laws into question 
brennan was joined today by justices byron r white thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and anthony m kennedy justices 
antonin scalia and john paul stevens joined most of brennans 
opinion 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice sandra day 
oconnor dissented 
the court in 1980 and again in 1984 barred states from limiting 
the amount of money charities that do their own fundraising spend 
on such campaigns 
in 1980 the justices struck down a schamburg ill ordinance 
that prohibited doortodoor solicitation of contributions by 
charitable organizations that could not prove they used at least 75 
percent of their revenues for charitable purposes 
in 1984 the justices voted 54 to overturn a maryland law that 
barred charities and charitable fundraisers from soliciting 
contributions if more than 25 percent of the revenue was consumed 
by fundraising costs 
the maryland law allowed charities to spend more than 25 percent 
of revenues on fundraising costs if they could show they were 
unable to raise money under the legal limitation 
the justices said in the maryland case that high solicitation 
costs were not an accurate measure of fraud 
today the court said north carolinas law does not differ 
significantly from the maryland law with which it found fault 
the case is riley vs national federation of the blind of north 
carolina 87328

the white house issued the following statement 
wednesday after the supreme court upheld the independent counsel 
act the statement was issued by presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater as president reagan flew to miami for a republican 
fundraising event 
the united states supreme court today upheld the 
constitutionality of the independent counsel act in so doing the 
court reversed a decision by the united states court of appeals for 
the dc circuit justice kennedy did not participate in the 
decision of the case 
the president signed an extension of the independent counsel act 
in december 1987 at that time he expected full support for the 
goal of ensuring public confidence in the impartiality and 
integrity of criminal law investigation of highlevel executive 
branch officials at the same time the president expressed concern 
that the acts procedures were inconsistent with the text of the 
constitution and the principle of separation of powers 
despite these doubts about the constitutionality of the 
independent counsel act the administration has faithfully and 
consistently complied with all of the acts requirements even 
offering the ongoing independent counsels parallel appointments 
within the department of justice to protect them against 
constitutional challenge thus todays decision by the court will 
have no practical effect on the administrations implementation of 
the independent counsel act or on the ongoing investigation 
we cannot comment on the consequences of this decision for any 
existing cases

a jury today convicted a 20yearold 
schizophrenic of the murders of his parents rejecting a defense 
claim that he believed he was under the spell of a character in the 
fantasy game dungeons and dragons at the time 
the jury found daniel kasten guilty of shooting his parents as 
they lay sleeping in their lake ronkonkoma home in may 1987 
in closing arguments yesterday kastens lawyer william nash 
said that the case was not about dungeons and dragons 
this case is about psychoses delusions and schizophrenia 
nash said dungeons and dragons is the game mr kasten decided to 
make his own reality 
the lawyer said kasten believed he was under the control of the 
mind flyer character when he shot his parents edith and joseph 
kasten 
but assistant district attorney randall hinrichs said no one 
is saying that kasten is a normal welladjusted individual a 
normal welladjusted individual wouldnt kill his parents 
but he added at the time that he killed both his parents he 
was aware that he had a gun in his hand and it could cause harm 
hinrichs also played part of kastens videotaped confession in 
which he said that he had thought about murdering his parents for 
years but had hesitated because he knew it was wrong

worried americans tell pollsters that drugs are the nations no 
1 problem congress is about to boost spending in the war on 
drugs to 91 billion a year george bush michael dukakis and 
jesse jackson battle over drug issues politicians point fingers at 
each other for not voting to impose the death penalty on drug 
dealers who commit murder 
at the risk of being branded soft on drugs and ridden out of 
town on a rail may we suggest that the drug crisis is being 
blown out of proportion and that while it is serious the country 
has more important concerns 
rep fortney stark dcalif deserves credit for trying to put 
the drug threat in perspective by circulating three revealing 
numbers among his colleagues last year illegal narcotics use 
killed fewer than 6000 americans while cigarettes caused more 
than 300000 deaths and alcohol 60000 
of course the damage done by drugs greatly exceeds 6000 
deaths illicit narcotics are a cause of crime grief wasted lives 
and aids transmission the problem is grave but not overwhelming 
drugs should be addressed with more balance less political

subsequent benefit at the ballot box 
thus it was cheering to see the senate appropriations defense 
subcommittee vote 800 million last week toward the planned us 
space station even if nasa says that is 100 million less than 
necessary to make it operational by a 1996 target the figure is 
far better than the 200 million approved by another subcommittee 
last week an amount space officials said was so insufficient it 
would derail the project

the honolulu starbulletin on the possible marcos return to the 
philippines 
philippine president aquino would be risking a lot by letting 
ferdinand marcos return home even to stand trial as a defendant in 
the theft of national wealth 
marcos who has been living in honolulu since february 1986 has 
previously asked for permission to go home he wanted to be with 
his dying mother and also to attend her funeral these requests 
were wisely rejected by the aquino government which has enough 
troubles without letting the deposed president back into the 
country 
aquinos fragile government is asking for trouble by letting the 
mischievous marcos back in the country even if he is under lock 
and key opportunities are still ripe for marcos and his old 
backers to exploit his presence in manila to stir up insurrection 
as badly as the philippines wants marcos millions the price of 
having marcos back home again may be too costly a tradeoff

look closely at the news photos coming out of droughtstricken 
farm regions at images of sunbaked land and withered crops if a 
group of scientists who testified before a congressional hearing 
last week are right pictures like that could be common in years to 
come and we have only ourselves to blame 
the cars that clog our freeways the factories and power plants 
that spew pollutants into the air the massive deforestation taking 
place in poor countries they all contribute to the greenhouse 
effect a warming trend expected to profoundly impact our planet 
the four warmest years of the last 100 have been in the 1980s and 
1988 is shaping up to be the hottest on record 
what could be the longrange consequences as with just about 
anything there will be winners and losers americas rich farm 
belt could dry up but canadian and soviet agriculture would 
benefit 
because some countries stand to benefit from a global warming 
trend it could be difficult to enlist their support for measures 
to fight it 
so what can be done a start would be to clean house in our 
country by phasing out polluting plants improving 
masstransportation systems and developing pollutionfree 
alternative energy sources 
america after all is one of the major contributors to the 
problem if this country doesnt show leadership who will

the knoxville tenn newssentinel on lineitem vetoes 
if the president had a lineitem veto would it be easier for 
him to fight spending excesses on capitol hill though common sense 
says yes opponents of the idea cite discouraging evidence from 
states that already have this budget device they say that on the 
average these states have no more success in restraining outlays 
than other states 
but george mason university economist mark crain currently on 
leave to the white house budget office has conducted a more 
detailed analysis he reports that not all lineitem vetoes are 
created equal the most effective type seems to be the 
itemreduction veto which allows a governor to substitute a 
lower dollar figure than the one sought by the legislature for a 
particular item only 10 states have this budget device 
crain finds that when all other variables are held constant the 
itemreduction veto slashes average annual spending increases by 
more than half from 4 percent to 13 percent 
over the years that adds up to enormous savings crains 
findings make the case for a strong lineitem veto more convincing 
than ever

the orange county calif register on tougher drug laws 
the law authorizing the seizure of vehicles involved in drug 
transactions was intended to punish smugglers and bigtime dealers 
by taking trucks or dopeladen tugboats at the same time the drugs 
themselves were confiscated now the authorities claim the 
right to confiscate a vehicle with a few marijuana seeds on or in 
it and sell it at auction unless the owner takes the initiative of 
contesting the seizure the owner doesnt need to be convicted of 
selling buying or possessing an illicit drug to lose the vehicle 
such a penalty for a minor crime for which punishment is already 
prescribed by law is intended to frighten smalltimers not bother 
big dealers 
the drug law catch22 is on display here the more drug laws 
drive up the price of illicit drugs the more tempting the trade 
will be and the more violent and utterly unscrupulous people will 
dominate it 
drug laws do not keep drugs away from those who want them and 
they have unfortunate sideeffects like massive increases in real 
crimes such as mugging and robbery the latest escalation simply 
illustrates the point it should be abandoned and we should move 
to something constructive like a spirited debate about drug 
legalization

professional baseball team since charlie finley that probably 
explains why martin is the exmanager of the new york yankees for 
the fifth time 
what remains inexplicable is why steinbrenner keeps hiring 
martin back only to fire him again and again or why martin who 
knows hes going to be sacked the next time steinbrenner gets up on 
the wrong side of the bed keeps taking the job 
not that anyone in these parts really cares actually from the 
standpoint of red sox fans steinbrenners ability to keep the 
muchloathed yankees in turmoil and thus from winning pennants 
can be classified as a good thing if boston doesnt win a pennant 
there is at least some small solace in the knowledge that the

the veterans peace convoy is heading back to 
the usmexico border where it will try again to leave the 
country with 30 tons of humanitarian aid for nicaragua packed into 
17 aging trucks and buses 
the convoy plans to cross into mexico in the rickety vehicles 
loaded down with food clothing and medical supplies at laredo on 
july 9 spokesman joseph franklin said wednesday 
the us customs service barred the convoy from crossing the 
border at laredo earlier this month and seized four vehicles after 
the group refused to post bond and sign a series of papers 
promising the trucks would be returned to the united states 
about 100 participatns in the convoy and 30 of their vehicles 
arrived in washington last week to rally against customs decision 
circling around the white house and in front of the state 
department in three days of protests 
the convoy made up largely of vietnam and other veterans was 
unsuccessful in convincing the reagan administration to reverse its 
decision the group was also unable to meet with elliot abrams 
assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs or anyone 
else in the administration franklin said 
its been a complete stonewall said franklin 
officials contend that letting the vehicles remain in nicaragua 
would violate a trade embargo they have said they cannot meet with 
the group because the matter is in litigation the convoy has filed 
a federal lawsuit challenging the customs decision 
were not going to sign any papers or post any bond when the 
convoy gets back to laredo franklin said 
franklin said about 35 to 40 people began the trip back to texas 
on tuesday with other members of the convoy returning home and a 
few staying in washington where were going to keep the pressure 
on 
he said the reagan administration has been despicable in their 
deceit in their contempt for the people of nicaragua especially 
elliot abrams but hes just following the party line 
the convoy began in four cities seattle missoula mont 
minneapolis and caribou maine and the four groups traveled 
through 100 cities in 42 states collecting aid before joining up in 
austin and arriving in laredo june 7 
in addition to the 30 tons on the trucks another 140 tons of 
aid has been shipped to nicaragua convoy members say the trucks 
are needed by the people of nicaragua to deliver humanitarian aid 
around the country by nongovernmental groups one of the buses was 
designated for transportation of hospital patients

vice president george bush said today that 
sweeping changes being proposed by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev should be viewed with optimism but cautioned the cold 
war is not over 
in a speech to the world affairs council the allbutcertain 
republican nominee credited americas military buildup with being 
responsible for the change in soviet thinking my point is that 
it was eight years of american strength that confronted the soviet 
union with the true costs of aggression and the necessity of 
reform bush said 
he said that president reagans summit in moscow with gorbachev 
late last month was the result of eight years of moral 
determination and hard work rebuilding american might but this 
said we must remember the cold war is not over 
we must be bold enough to seize the opportunity of change but 
at the same time prepared for as one pundit titled his column 
the protracted conflict 
bush spoke in san francisco at the wrapup of a 24hour visit to 
northern california chiefly intended to raise money for gop coffers 
at two private fundraisers on his return to washington today 
bush planned to stop in appleton wis to highlight the plight of 
farmers hurt by the drought 
in discussing americas military buildup bush took note of the 
investigation of alleged bribery fraud and corruption at the 
pentagon 
if the news stories are true he said the accused have 
done more than steal from the public treasury they have undermined 
americas security and broken faith with the american people 
in the prepared text of his speech released earlier bush 
promised we will throw the book at guilty parties however in 
delivering the address he omitted that phrase 
the vice president cautioned however about overreacting to 
the alleged corruption 
the first reaction in congress to the scandals to increase 
the regulatory bureaucracy at defense though understandable will 
only add to the complexity and worsen the problem bush said 
the answer is to reduce cut and simplify including staff and 
executive overhead 
the vice president said that congress and the executive branch 
should make a compact to take the patronage and pork out of 
defense 
in a series of interviews tuesday bush said he was not worried 
about a gallup poll for the times mirror corp that showed him 
running 13 points behind democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis the survey was released monday 
i dont make too much of it bush said adding that polls 
had shown him trailing thenrival bob dole before the new hampshire 
primary which he won handily i look at it as something that can 
be taken care of 
i like to come back i think im going to win he said 
bush offered a preview of his foreign policy address in 
responding to reports about gorbachevs opening remarks tuesday to 
a communist party conference that is expected to produce a showdown 
this week between reform and conservative forces in the soviet 
union 
the soviet leader urged a redistribution of power in the soviet 
union to give new authority to the president and legislature he 
said his country must break with the ossified system of the 
past 
asked his view of gorbachevs speech bush said he had not been 
briefed on the soviet leaders remarks but that it seems to me 
that the address is quite encouraging 
i am one who views perestroika as manifestation of change 
some of that change is real im also one that feels that as they 
go about reforming their country we should look for opportunities 
to do more with the soviet union in terms of investment or 
exchanges of people or whatever it is 
however bush said we ought to be very very wary and not 
jump to the conclusion that a call of that nature be confused with 
fundamental permanent change in the soviet unions approach to 
other countries and indeed whether its a fundamental departure 
from their marxist system 
as to whether the soviets are moving toward democracy he said 
i dont see the evidence of it yet 
he urged the soviets to strive for fuller compliance with the 
helsinki accords which prescribe how nations should respect human 
rights 
specifically bush called for more jews and divided families to 
be allowed to leave the soviet unioni think that would be the 
most visible manifestation of real glasnost openness and real 
reform perestroika and thats what we ought to be looking for and 
encouraging in every way possible the vice president said 
on another subject bush said carriers of the deadly aids virus 
should be protected by the federal government from discrimination 
on the job in schools and elsewhere 
i think it is needed bush said embracing the key and 
most controversial recommendation of president reagans aids 
commission 
i think it is important to do a lot to lay to rest some of the 
fears there is a lot of misunderstanding bush said 
reagan has not taken a position on the recommendation

daily journal fergus falls minn on the department of defense 
scandal 
is there nothing thats not for sale in washington dc 
americans have every reason to be disillusioned with the government 
in general and the military in particular when those entrusted with 
the nations defense are more concerned about profit than their 
country 
the pentagon was shaken to its foundation recently by the news 
of a twoyear investigation into alleged insider trading within 
the department of defense the news broke when the fbi and the 
naval investigative service conducted raids on 38 locations in 
search for evidence of theft of classified information from the 
pentagon 
the stories of waste and mismanagement within the defense 
department are old hat nobody is surprised any longer by tales of 
7000 coffee pots but even the most hardened cynics have to be 
shocked at the allegations of the blatant selfserving activities 
of current and former defense department employees sen strom 
thurmond rsc a strong supporter of the pentagon has predicted 
that the nation will be shocked by the depth of the wrongdoing 
shocked indeed the american people are told that the country 
cannot afford programs to aid the young the old and the poor 
because the nation must maintain a strong defense while many 
americans are prepared to sacrifice to ensure a strong defense it 
appears the defenders are robbing them blind

the westerly ri sun on fishing vessel safety standards 
congress appears to be on the verge of at last enacting law to 
require basic survival gear on commercial fishing vessels both 
houses should be strongly urged to push ahead and rectify one of 
the nations worst safety shortcomings 
there are some 33000 commercial fishing boats in the united 
states but for about 90 percent of them vessels under 200 tons 
the government requires only that there be a life jacket for each 
person aboard nothing in the rules about thermal body suits 
nothing about life rafts or even a radio beacon to call for 
emergency aid 
though industry leaders and even many of the fishermen oppose 
federal regulation as being too costly and probably ineffectual 
there is need for establishment of minimum standards that would 
save lives

the evening journal martinsburg wva on federal antidrug 
legislation 
republicans in congress have introduced extremely tough 
antidrug legislation vice president george bush enthusiastically 
has endorsed the measure which among other provisions calls for 
the death penalty to be meted out to drug kingpins 
the likely democratic presidential nominee gov michael dukakis 
of massachusetts has piously proclaimed that one of the reasons he 
is seeking to take up residence in the white house is because of 
the republican shortcomings in the war against drugs however 
dukakis thus far has refused to back the death penalty for drug 
dealers 
bush cites the brutal slaying of drug enforcement administration 
agent enrique camarena salazar in his argument for establishing the 
death penalty the vice president makes a good point 
the legislation introduced by congressional republicans in 
addition to establishing the death penalty for drug dealers calls 
for increased funding for the coast guard to patrol for drug 
traffickers it also would impose stiff sanctions against convicted 
drug users including heavy fines and making them ineligible for 
student loans and federally backed mortgages 
if dukakis and co actually are serious about waging a real war 
on drugs their support for establishing the death penalty for 
dealers immediately would be forthcoming

the commercial appeal memphis tenn on sex bias bans 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in supporting a new york city ordinance banning sex bias by 
large clubs the us supreme court has made clearer the right of 
women to an equal chance to get ahead in the maledominated 
business and professional world 
previous decisions in this area won women admission to such 
businessoriented organizations as the jaycee and rotary 
organizations the latest extended that right to large socalled 
private clubs where business contacts and deals are often made 
at issue was a city law that barred discrimination against women 
in clubs that have more than 400 members regularly provide meal 
service allow dues to be paid by members employers or get some of 
their income by providing services such as conference rooms to 
nonmembers in effect the city says that such clubs are not 
really private 
the court pointed out that its ruling did not apply to all 
private clubs it said it is conceivable that an association 
might be able to show that it is organized for specific expressive 
purposes and that it will not be able to advocate its desired 
viewpoints nearly as effectively if it cannot confine its 
membership to those who share the same sex for example or the 
same religion 
in other words an organization would have to prove it is truly 
private if it wants first amendment protection to keep out certain 
classes of people

the supreme court in a setback to the reagan 
administration and some of its key former officials today upheld a 
law that allows independent prosecutors to investigate alleged 
crimes by highranking government officials 
the 71 decision dispels crucial doubts about the convictions of 
former reagan aides michael k deaver and lyn c nofziger and 
clears away a possible stumbling block in the prosecution of 
exwhite house aides oliver north john m poindexter and two 
others indicted in the irancontra affair 
the decision also allows an investigation to continue into the 
activities of attorney general edwin meese iii accused of 
financial improprieties and conflicts of interest 
the court in a momentous constitutional decision said the 
special prosecutor law does not violate the separation of powers 
between the executive legislative and judicial branches of 
government guaranteed by the constitution 
chief justice william h rehnquist in his opinion for the 
court said we observe first that this case does not involve an 
attempt by congress to increase its own powers at the expense of 
the executive branch 
similarly we do not think that the act works any judicial 
usurpation of properly executive functions 
rehnquist continued finally we do not think that the act 
impermissibly undermines the powers of the executive branch or 
disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate branches 
lawrence e walsh the independent counsel investigating the 
irancontra affair said in a statement moments after the decision 
was announced 
the independent counsel statute provides a workable solution 
to a difficult problem we are gratified that the supreme court has 
upheld the constitutionality of that statute 
president reagan queried about the courts decision as he 
arrived in miami for a speech said nothings changed i cant 
comment 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the decision will 
have no practical effect on the administrations implementation of 
the independent counsel act or on the ongoing investigations 
a white house statement said that despite doubts about the 
constitutionality of the independent counsel act the 
administration has faithfully and consistently complied with all of 
the acts requirements 
the chief justice acknowledged that the law limits presidential 
power to investigate and prosecute some alleged crimes 
but he said there are adequate safeguards to protect against 
abuses 
for example rehnquist said the law permits the attorney 
general to decide when a special prosecutor is warranted and allows 
the attorney general to fire a special prosecutor for good 
cause 
notwithstanding the fact that the counsel is to some degree 
independent and free from executive supervision to a greater 
extent than other federal prosecutors in our view the act 
gives the executive branch sufficient control over the independent 
counsel to ensure that the president is able to perform his 
constitutionally assigned duties rehnquist said 
the chief justice read parts of his 38page opinion from the 
bench speaking for five minutes 
underscoring the importance of the case justice antonin scalia 
read a portion of his lone dissent for nine minutes 
scalia said the balance of powers and the separation of powers 
are what make the us constitution a unique and enduring document 
in dictatorships of the modern world bills of rights are a 
dime a dozen he said 
the decision was the last to be handed down by the high court on 
its last day of the 198788 term 
in other action the court 
made it easier for workers to prove their bosses are guilty of 
illegal discrimination 
in their most important civil rights decision of the year the 
justices by an 80 vote expanded the way employees can use 
statistical evidence to prove bias 
made it easier for millions of nonunion workers to withhold 
financial support from the unions that represent them in collective 
bargaining 
the court by a 53 vote ruled that nonunion employees of 
private employers may not be forced to pay the equivalent of union 
dues if some of that money is used for activities not directly 
related to collective bargaining 
severely limited state efforts to shield young sex abuse 
victims when they testify at criminal trials 
the justices voting 62 overturned the conviction of an iowa 
man sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually molesting two 
13yearold girls 
struck down an oklahoma mans death sentence but stopped short 
of ruling whether capital punishment may be used for convicted 
killers who committed their crimes before reaching age 16 
in what had been expected to be its most important capital 
punishment decision of the year the justices could not muster a 
majority of votes to resolve a key question does execution of 
teenage killers violate the constitutions ban on cruel and 
unusual punishment 
ruled the federal government may give money to religious 
groups to promote chastity among americas teenagers 
the 54 ruling said a 1981 federal law that funnels taxpayer 
money to private groups to counsel adolescents against premarital 
sex is not unconstitutional on its face 
barred states from placing sweeping strict regulations on 
professional forprofit organizations that solicit contributions 
for charities 
the justices by a 72 vote ruled that a north carolina law 
that imposed such regulations violated freespeech rights 
justice anthony m kennedy the newest member of the court and 
one of three justices appointed by reagan did not take part in the 
independent prosecutor decision kennedy disqualified himself 
without giving an explanation 
the court overturned a 21 federal appeals court ruling last 
jan 22 that declared the watergateera special prosecutor law 
unconstitutional 
congress passed the law after the scandal that led to president 
nixons resignation to provide an independent mechanism for 
investigating alleged highlevel government wrongdoing 
opponents and supporters of the law a key portion of the ethics 
in government act cited the watergate case to buttress their 
position 
the laws advocates said it was essential to assure the nation 
that crimes in high places would not be covered up 
but opponents pointed out that nixon was forced out of office 
because of public opinion and the threat of impeachment without 
any need for an independent investigation 
the law empowers a special federal court to appoint independent 
counsels or special prosecutors at the request of the attorney 
general the attorney general first conducts a preliminary probe 
generally lasting up to 90 days to determine whether charges 
against a government official warrant appointment of the outside 
counsel 
the law was challenged by theodore b olson a former assistant 
attorney general accused of lying to congress in 1983 during a 
dispute over the environmental protection agencys cleanup program 
for toxic waste sites 
alexia morrison a washington lawyer is the special prosecutor 
investigating the case 
the reagan administration supported olsons challenge arguing 
that the independent counsels violate constitutionally mandated 
separation of powers between the three branches of government 
among the defenders of the law are the senate and the democratic 
leadership in the house 
the immediate stakes in the case involved some of the most 
prominent figures of the reagan presidency 
deaver convicted of lying to a grand jury and a house 
subcommittee that investigated his lobbying activities is awaiting 
sentencing whitney north seymour was the independent counsel who 
prosecuted him 
nofziger prosecuted by independent counsel james c mckay was 
sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined 30000 for illegal 
lobbying mckay also is conducting the investigation into the 
charges involving meese 
north a former aide to the national security council was 
expected to go on trial in the fall in the irancontra case on 
charges he conspired to divert profits from the sale of arms to 
iran to the contra rebels fighting the government in nicaragua 
his codefendants poindexter businessman albert a hakim and 
retired air force maj gen richard v secord are to be tried 
separately 
some said the irancontra prosecution the nofziger conviction 
and the meese probe would survive any adverse supreme court ruling 
on the independent counsel law because walsh and mckay received 
backup authority from meese to conduct their investigations 
but there had been uncertainty in those cases as well because 
the investigations began before the backup authority was conferred 
ms morrison and seymour did not receive such backup authority 
to conduct their respective investigations of olson and deaver 
the case is morrison vs olson 871279

the fbi is investigating the abduction of a 
novice nun wearing traditional habit who was forcibly put into a 
car by members of her family opposed to her remaining in the 
convent authorities said 
the nuns brother who participated in the abduction said his 
sister is free to return to the convent after she listens to her 
familys arguments against it 
it was the second time in four months in which a family member 
of mary sue greve known as sister mary cecilia 22 attempted to 
keep her from returning to the convent state police said 
police said ms greve was walking with two other nuns on a 
street near st joseph novitiate convent in roundtop ny where 
she has lived for the past two years when she was pushed into a 
waiting car sunday 
john greve of cincinnati said he and two brothers and their 
father took his sister 
the reason we did this was to give her the facts he said 
if she wants to return to the convent after she hears her family 
out she is free to do so but we know that will be the last time 
we will probably ever see her again 
greve said the family opposed his sisters joining st joseph 
after the family broke with a traditionalist catholic church in a 
cincinnati suburb 
st josephs with about 40 nuns and novices is not recognized 
by the roman catholic church 
special agent michael obrien said tuesday the fbi was 
investigating her disappearance but declined to elaborate 
we are all in a state of shock said the rev clarence 
kelly a spiritual adviser at the convent the last i ever heard 
of something like this was the case of st thomas aquinas in the 
13th century his family kidnapped him because they did not want 
him to become a dominican priest 
new york state police said ms greve went to cincinnati where 
her parents live following sundays incident her brother refused 
to say where ms greve and the rest of the family were 
state police said they would not press charges unless the woman 
wants to file them 
its a familytype matter trooper ron rieseberg said 
monday i think theyre authorities mostly interested in the 
wellbeing of the girl 
about four months ago ms greves mother abducted her after 
persuading her to get into a car to listen to a tape of her 
nephews police said once inside the car the mother drove off 
refusing to return her daughter to the convent

the senate labor committee voted 115 today to 
approve legislation that would increase the current 335 an hour 
federal minimum wage by 120 over the next three years 
the legislation sponsored by committee chairman sen edward m 
kennedy dmass would raise the wage rate to 455 per hour over 
three years identical to a proposal being considered by house 
leaders 
although several republican senators earlier had said they would 
offer amendments to the bill none was introduced at the meeting 
there was no reason to take on those issues in committee 
said sen orrin g hatch rutah there will be amendments when 
the bill gets to the floor 
an earlier proposal introduced in both the house and senate 
would have increased the wage to 465 per hour over three years 
and indexed it to 50 percent of the average national wage 
thereafter 
the house during subcommittee and full committee action 
dropped the indexing provision and boosted the rate to 505 per 
hour over four years 
when the legislation goes to the house floor there is expected 
to a bipartisan substitute proposal to bring the minimum wage to 
455 per hour over three years

estonian delegates to the communist party 
conference said wednesday they expect the kremlin to back their 
baltic republics demand for autonomy from moscow as the only 
chance to keep the soviet union strong 
in interviews with the associated press three estonian 
delegates described what they said were efforts dating back to last 
fall to work out a political and economic program giving the 
republic independence over its economy ecology education and 
culture 
the program has been summarized in the platform of estonias 32 
delegates to the party conference who said it has been well 
received by influential reformers in moscow 
the soviet leadership supports it i know said johan aare 
one of estonias most popular television journalists and leader of 
a greens ecology movement born in the small republic last month 
mikhail bronstein an economics professor at estonias historic 
tartu university said the ideas in the republics platform were 
worked out unofficially by intellectuals in discussions that 
started months ago 
estonia was the first of the three baltic republics to form a 
national front in support of mikhail s gorbachevs 
perestroika or restructuring lithuania has followed suit 
while hundreds of latvian intellectuals have formulated demands for 
sovereignty extending to independent membership for their republic 
in the united nations and their own team at the olympics 
the intellectuals also worked out a more detailed program for 
economic independence known by the acronym of ime which means 
miracle in estonian bronstein said 
at first he said conservatives attacked the program and 
accused estonian nationals of seeking secession from the soviet 
union 
on the contrary we see this as the only chance of 
strengthening the soviet union along leninist principles of equal 
rights sovereignty and a federation bronstein said 
both he and aare said they see a federation as the only path to 
develop their republic and to help keep the soviet union 
competitive 
the tempo of growth is what is important aare said if 
there was just one state in the world it wouldnt matter but if 
there are other states moving faster right by your side you cannot 
lag behind 
estonians often compare their standard of living with that of 
neighboring finland which has a prosperous westernstyle economy 
both men conceded it might be difficult to create a federation 
in the soviet union when the 15 republics that make up the country 
have such diverse histories and levels of development 
central asian republics moved from nearfeudal circumstances to 
socialism after the 1917 bolshevik revolution bronstein said by 
contrast estonia and the baltic republics of lithuania and latvia 
developed under centuries of domination by the prosperous hanseatic 
league he said 
but they appeared convinced their ideas will win kremlin 
approval 
it is necessary to work carefully thoroughly 
diplomatically said aare but we have a program thats the 
important thing 
the two men gave the impression that estonian intellectuals have 
made a careful wellplanned effort to use gorbachevs reforms to 
bring about change in their republic 
they also stressed that demands to make estonian the official 
language and to improve education in estonian culture are not 
directed against the tens of thousands of ethnic russians brought 
into the republic since world war ii to man industry 
just over half of estonias 156 million citizens are estonians 
compared with 90 percent in 1940 when soviet troops seized the 
three baltic republics under a secret protocol to moscows 1939 
pact with nazi germany 
russian immigration maintenance of indigenous culture and the 
spoiling of the environment by postworld war ii industry are of 
growing concern to citizens of the baltic republics 
aare said estonian intellectuals criticized the thenleader of 
estonias communists karl g vaino and decided to unite in a 
national front which he said has since gained the support of tens 
of thousands of the republics 15 million people 
bronstein said the estonians want the right to open their own 
offices in scandinavian countries and the united states to further 
trade and maintain contacts with emigres 
emigres from the baltic republics have been reviled in official 
media as enemies of socialism who want to restore the bourgeois 
democracy that ruled before soviet troops seized the three 
territories in 1940 
indrek toome the communist party secretary in charge of 
ideology in estonia said it would be important to give the 
national front the greens and any other mass social movements 
which emerge a constitutional right to exist

the supreme court ruling for a michigan farm 
family accused of enslaving two retarded men for more than 10 
years said today that illegal involuntary servitude cannot be 
imposed through psychological coercion alone 
by a 90 vote the justices rejected reagan administration 
arguments that the legal definition of involuntary servitude should 
be broad enough to include psychological coercion 
if the court had agreed with federal prosecutors the broader 
definition of involuntary servitude outlawed by the 
constitutions 13th amendment which abolished slavery and by 
federal law could have jeopardized certain cult groups or 
religious orders that use psychological persuasion to enlist and 
retain members 
absent change by congress the term involuntary servitude 
necessarily means a condition of servitude in which the victim is 
forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical 
restraint or physical injury or by the use of threat or coercion 
through law or the legal process justice sandra day oconnor 
wrote for the court 
ike and margarethe kozminski who own a dairy farm in chelsea 
mich were convicted of keeping robert fulmer and louis molitoris 
in involuntary servitude 
both men are mentally retarded fulmer has an iq of 67 and spent 
most of his life in foster homes in training school or working on 
farms molitoris who has an iq of 60 was unemployed and living on 
the streets of ann arbor when he met the kozminskis 
at trial federal prosecutors introduced evidence that the two 
men received no pay for their work were physically abused were 
given woefully inadequate housing and were told they could not 
leave the farm 
the kozminskis introduced evidence tending to controvert some of 
that evidence 
after a federal jury convicted them the kozminskis received 
suspended prison sentences and were placed on probation for two 
years ike kozminski also was fined 20000 and ordered to pay 
fulmer and molitoris over 6000 each in restitution 
the couples son john was convicted of a conspiracy charge he 
was given a suspended prison sentence placed on two years 
probation and fined 10000 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals threw out the convictions 
last year ruling that the presiding trial judge erred in telling 
jurors about involuntary servitude 
the judge said it may include situations in which coercive 
acts or words cause persons in employment to believe they cannot 
freely leave employment if the acts are done or the words are 
spoken with the intent to cause this result 
the 6th circuit court said the judges instructions could be 
interpreted to mean that purely psychological coercion could 
amount to involuntary servitude too broad a legal definition 
the appeals court said involuntary servitude must feature 
physical or legal coercion or fraud and deceit used against a 
victim who is a minor an immigrant or a mental incompetent 
the appeals court sent the kozminskis case back for a new trial 
so a jury could decide whether the retarded men were victimized by 
fraud and deceit in an effort to retain their services 
reagan administration lawyers while not challenging the need 
for a new trial argued that the 6th circuit courts ruling defined 
involuntary servitude too narrowly 
today the supreme court sent the kozminskis case back for a 
new trial stating the judges instructions may have caused the 
kozminskis to be convicted for conduct that does not violate 
federal law 
but oconnors opinion said the record in the farm familys case 
contains sufficient evidence of physical or legal coercion to 
enable a jury to convict the kozminskis even under the stricter 
standard of involuntary servitude that we announce today 
the case is us vs kozminski 862000

with 12 days remaining of the first new york 
international festival of the arts the festivals chairman gave it 
a glowing interim review on wednesday 
i would say it attendance is in excess of 75 percent of the 
total number of seats martin e segal the festival chairman 
told a news conference 
however segal said he disliked speaking in terms of attendance 
percentages since the sizes of halls vary 
the judgment of the success of the festival we believe should 
be around its artistic merit he said 
to a question whether too much is going on one night lists 68 
events segal said we dont know the answer we wound up with 
140 composers of over 1000 composers that are known in this 
century we wanted to be sure we were representing the scope of the

patrick sherrill who shot and killed 14 
fellow postal workers two years ago slipped through a lax 
screening system for new employees congressional investigators 
said wednesday 
and although the postal officials rushed help to the families of 
victims immediately after the aug 20 1986 edmond okla 
tragedy the agency then dropped the ball the general accounting 
office reported 
a study of 15 post offices released by rep glenn english 
dokla indicated that out of 1289 newly hired employees 816 
were hired without checking their job histories with former 
employers and police checks were not done for 748 gao reported 
assistant postmaster general john s trosch responded that 10 
states have established policies of not providing criminal history 
information for employment purposes and many employers are 
reluctant to release details about former workers out of fear they 
will be sued as the source of prejudicial information or for 
invasion of privacy but the agency is working to tighten its 
hiring and screening practices he said 
a separate gao report on the edmond slayings said that while 
the postal service provided noteworthy immediate assistance to the 
families of victims it then turned the matter over to the oklahoma 
city division which offered further help only in response to 
direct appeals from the survivors 
the families were not contacted to see if they needed help 
because it was believed that such contacts would infringe on the 
families privacy during a time of grief subsequent criticism of 
the handling of the tragedy can be traced to this decision the 
gao said 
the study recommended that the postal service initiate 
contingency planning including crisis management in order to be 
prepared to deal with the traumatic effects of any future disasters 
in a response attached to the study postmaster general anthony 
frank said he accepts the findings and recommendations and will 
include the principles of crisis management in contingency plans 
sherrill a letter carrier killed 14 workers and wounded six 
others before killing himself

the american medical association today approved a 
report calling for expanded treatment of drug abusers and other 
major changes in the nations war against drugs 
also today the nations largest organization of doctors called 
for reform of the nations medicaid health insurance system for the 
poor to establish uniform nationwide eligibility standards and 
uniform payments for medical care 
the amas house of delegates its policymaking body voted to 
lobby the government to expand medicaid to cover an additional 27 
million poor people at an estimated cost of 24 billion at 1988 
spending levels 
on the drug issue delegates called for shifting the main point 
of attack from trying to catch drug traffickers to working to 
reduce demand for their illegal products by expanding treatment of 
abusers 
we are saying this nation does have the will to overcome the 
drug problem but it simply has the wrong game plan said dr 
lonnie bristow an ama trustee from berkeley calif 
the delegates today also approved a recommendation intended to 
encourage biomedical companies that may be hesitant about 
developing new products for fear of lawsuits 
it urged that state and federal governments reform the nations 
court system to limit the amount of money awarded in product 
liability lawsuits 
worry about being sued by patients and having to pay 
multimilliondollar awards is leading the companies to hold off on 
developing new vaccines drugs and other potentially lifesaving 
technologies according to a report presented to the group 
on tuesday the house of delegates rejected a ban on publishing 
articles about euthanasia but held firm against mercy killing 
it also called for bans on toy guns that can be mistaken for the 
real thing and on real nonmetallic firearms that can slip through 
metal detectors and other screening devices 
the policymaking arm of the 295000member group voted to urge 
the federal government to end price supports for tobacco and help 
tobacco farmers begin growing other crops but postponed action on 
a proposal for doubling the federal tobacco tax 
the 420 delegates were to vote later today on a proposal calling 
for creation of a new class of hospital worker 
the drug policy approved today recommends that the federal 
government expand drug abuse treatment programs ease regulations 
to permit private doctors to treat opiate addicts with methadone 
and strengthen drug education programs aimed at adolescents 
the policy also calls on the president to appoint a 
highranking official of the executive branch to coordinate federal 
drug policy to reduce rivalry among different agencies and keep 
them from working at cross purposes 
the policy stresses the amas opposition to widespread random 
drug testing and to the legalization of outlawed drugs 
the delegates reiterated their opposition to mercy killing in 
the wake of an uproar over the journal of the american medical 
associations publication earlier this year of an article by a 
doctor describing how he ended a cancer patients life at her 
request 
the article its over debbie touched off widespread 
criticism of the journal for not publishing the authors name and 
for not including a clear statement of the amas opposition to 
mercy killing 
however the delegates rejected a proposal from the nebraska 
delegation to require the ama to refrain from publishing articles 
which involve the taking of human life without also printing the 
associations stand against mercy killing 
the debate over euthanasia will be with society for the 
foreseeable future said dr alan nelson chairman of the ama 
board of trustees the position of the ama has been consistent 
and it was restated today so there wont be any confusion 
euthanasia is wrong and the medical profession will continue to 
deplore it 
the delegates also are considering a proposal to organize a new 
class of hospital bedside worker called a registered care 
technologist in an effort to offset the nursing shortage 
as envisioned in the doctors proposal these workers would 
receive from two months to 18 months of training and would handle 
such chores as bathing patients taking vital signs and changing 
bandages 
the plan is opposed by the american nurses association which 
says the answer to the shortage is increased salaries and better 
working conditions

firefighters today battled a blaze in wyomings shosone national 
forest while a 60000acre timber and grass fire was brought under 
control along the montanasouth dakota border and an indiana peat 
fire smoldered for a fifth day 
a stubborn fire that destroyed four homes and more than a dozen 
farmbuildings kept firefighters busy today in rural sonoma county 
north of san francisco where a windwhipped blaze nearby destroyed 
most of the historic community of preston on tuesday 
a 200acre wildfire in southern californias san luis obispo 
county that forced the evacuation of a campground and closed a 
highway was contained today while brush fires in riverside county 
east of los angeles were nearly contained 
the montanasouth dakota and wyoming fires were contained 
tuesday and the border fire was delared under control early today 
in montana information officer sandi sacher said some of the 
1034 firefighters were preparing to return home the fire burned 
over about 58300 acres in southeastern montana and northwestern 
south dakota including parts of the custer national forest 
they have delayed demobilization from what they normally do 
because of the severe weather conditions and severe dryness just to 
make sure sparks of the fire are well out and if the winds pick 
up none of them will flare up sacher said 
the fire which began june 20 during a lightning storm was 
fought in temperatures sometimes exceeding 100 degrees the fire 
cost upwards of 2 million to battle and caused an estimated 4 
million damage officials said 
about 22 ranchers had permits to graze cattle in the custer 
national forest and the fire forced them to seek other grazing 
land for their herds 
benny and dorothy padden who ranch about 7000 acres in the 
long pines area had about 550 head of cattle on forest land so 
far nine head have been found dead and nearly half of those who 
survived were burned 
the drought was bad enough without the fire said padden 
theres too many adversities at one time were infested with 
grasshoppers also they didnt leave any out this year 
in wyoming the 390 firefighters battling the 1150acre fire in 
the shoshone national forest completed a fire line around the blaze 
tuesday

timber sale and had threatened critical grizzly bear and bald eagle 
habitats 
forest spokesman tom portice said firefighters were able to 
protect bald eagle nesting sites the fire should not severely 
affect the grizzly bear habitat he said 
in northern californias sonoma county dry hilly terrain and 
gusty winds hampered firefighters who battled a stubborn fire that 
burned four houses and a dozen outbuildings tuesday the fire raged 
for hours several miles south of sebastopol and scorched between 
200 and 300 acres before firefighters contained it said bob 
gloeckner a director of the hessel fire protection district 
the wind kept picking up hot embers and spotting them ahead of 
the fire itself a quarter mile half a mile ahead and starting 
additional fires gloeckner said 
earlier in the day gusts fanned a fire from a downed power line 
into an inferno that destroyed a 17room mansion built 112 years 
and an art colony in preston a hamlet two miles north of 
cloverdale on the border between sonoma and mendocino counties 
after the flames were quenched only chimneys and bathtubs 
remained of the mansion the fire also destroyed the textile 
artworks of christina buffalo larkin and the paintings of artist 
robert thomas album designer for the grateful dead 
also lost in the fire was thomas 30year collection of antique 
and unusual folk music instruments 
this has been a double tragedy said lisa ellis wife of a 
ranch manager not only have we lost the historic buildings but 
the artists colony has been wiped out an incalculable loss 
in southern california three brush fires broke out in the 
afternoon as arid regions sweltered under temperatures that topped 
the 100degree mark all burned in steep brushy terrain and were 
fanned by winds 
in san luis obispo county 175 miles northwest of downtown los 
angeles a 200acre brush fire forced the evacuation of cerro alto 
campground and closed highway 41 between atascadero and morro bay

the supreme court today ruled the federal 
government may give money to religious groups to promote chastity 
among americas teenagers 
the 54 ruling said a 1981 federal law that funnels taxpayer 
money to private groups to counsel adolescents against premarital 
sex is not unconstitutional on its face 
but the justices ordered further lower court hearings to 
determine whether the statute as it is being applied ever may 
violate the constitutionally required separation of church and 
state 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
if there is evidence that some recipients of federal funds are 
violating the constitution by teaching religious doctrine the 
remedy is to ban them from getting further money the solution is 
not to kill the law rehnquist said 
rehnquist said the socalled teen chastity law has a valid 
secular purpose in seeking to eliminate or reduce economic problems 
caused by premarital sex among young people 
he said the statute also does not have the primary purpose of 
advancing religion and does not create an excessive entanglement 
between church and state 
we note as is proper given the traditional presumption in 
favor of the constitutionality of statutes enacted by congress 
that our conclusion that the statute does not violate the 
establishment clause requiring separation of church and state is 
consistent with the conclusion congress reached in the course of 
its deliberations rehnquist said 
in a dissenting opinion justice harry a blackmun said as 
the record developed thus far in this litigation makes all too 
clear federal tax dollars appropriated under the law have been 
used with government approval to support religious teaching 
he was joined by justices william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and john paul stevens 
the law officially the adolescent family life act was passed 
by congress soon after president reagan took office 
former sen jeremiah denton rala sponsored the law it was 
ushered through congress by fellow conservatives the act provided 
millions of dollars for care prevention and research 
care services include pregnancy testing maternity counseling 
and adoption and referral help 
prevention services are those aimed at discouraging adolescent 
sexual relations and include programs offering counseling and 
family planning 
opponents of the law said religious groups were using the money 
to promote christianity for example they said some groups advised 
young girls to practice sexual abstinence by pretending that 
jesus is their date 
supporters of the law said it is in line with federal aid to 
religious organizations that sponsor other worthy social services 
such as hospital care drug abuse programs orphanages and 
emergency shelters 
in seeking funds applicants are required to describe how they 
will involve religious and charitable organizations voluntary 
associations and other groups in the private sector 
us district judge charles richey in washington struck down key 
provisions of the law in april 1987 richey said the law had a 
primary effect of advancing religion and fostered an excessive 
entanglement between government and religion 
the judge left intact provisions of the law that did not involve 
giving money to religious groups 
the administration said the law is needed to combat teen 
pregancy more than one million teenage girls become pregnant each 
year and about 500000 have abortions 
the law was challenged by a group of taxpayers clery members 
and the american jewish congress they were represented by the 
american civil liberties union 
planned parenthood the american psychological association the 
national organization for women and the national abortion rights 
action league were among the groups that attacked the law 
supporters of the statute include the us catholic conference 
the catholic league for religious and civil rights and united 
families of america 
the case is bowen vs kendrick 87253

the securities and exchange commission has 
subpoenaed records from at least six brokerages and is seeking 
swiss cooperation in a probe of alleged insider trading by a rookie 
securities analyst and a wealthy hong kong businessman the sec 
said today 
weve sent subpoenas to a number of firms thomas newkirk 
the commissions chief litigation counsel said from washington 
the reason wee doing this is to check the defendants trading 
records were not investigating the firms themselves 
newkirk said he did not know the number of firm records 
subpoenaed but sec officials familiar with the investigation who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said that besides morgan stanley amp 
co subpoenas were sent to goldman sachs amp co first boston co 
merrill lynch amp co shearson lehman hutton inc and charles schwab 
amp co 
the sec has accused morgan stanley securities analyst stephen 
wang jr 24 of leaking inside information about at least 25 
corporate takeovers in which morgan stanley played a role to fred 
c lee lee 38 a wealthy hong kongbased investor who had 
numerous trading accounts on wall street also has a home in the 
washington suburb of mclean va 
sec chairman david s ruder told a senate subcommittee today 
that his agency has asked swiss authorities to provide information 
on trades emanating from that country that the sec believes 
involved lee 
ruder testifying before the senate banking committees 
securities subcommittee said the sec also is involved in active 
negotiations to possibly freeze assets in switzerland controlled 
by lee 
ruder would not discuss how much money the trades involved or 
the value of the assets 
at the same hearing sec enforcement chief gary lynch said the 
agency has 40 to 50 investigations under way involving foreign 
trading including one that involves very large dollar amounts 
the commission claims lee made at least 19 million by trading 
on that information and shared 200000 with wang it has demanded 
the two repay the money plus triple damages for a total of 76 
million the secondbiggest insider tradin case after the 100 
million ivan f boesky scandal 
in a complaint filed monday in manhattan federal court the sec 
also obtained an order freezing the assets of both men 
wangs attorney ira l sorkin has declined to comment on the 
accusations other than to say hes studying them lees attorney 
michael perlis was quoted in todays new york times as saying his 
client intends to resist the accusations 
they want to make him out to be another ivan boesky but hes 
far from that perlis told the newspaper 
perlis also said we told the sec that we would be willing to 
sign a consent decree on reasonable terms under a consent 
decree a defendant generally may settle charges sometimes paying 
a penalty without admitting or denying guilt 
the wanglee case has raised major questions about wall streets 
selfpolicing efforts in the aftermath of the insidertrading 
uproar created by boesky formerly one of the securities industrys 
bestknown speculators 
boesky settled insider trading charges in november 1986 by 
returning 50 million in illicit profits and paying 50 million in 
penalties in addition he was banished from securities trading for 
life and was sentenced to a threeyear prison term for conspiring 
to lie to the sec

each morning israel zamora reports to 
the job exchange hoping a farmer needs him and his family to hoe 
weeds competing with the lucrative sugar beet crop 
migrant laborers are in demand in the red river valley between 
minnesota and north dakota even more so this year as farmers try 
to salvage a cash crop that could determine if they survive or fail 
its too hot theres not enough rain a lot of the fields are 
too dry so its dirty said zamora 40 of weslaco texas 
showing his calloused nickedup hands 
but were poor this is how we make our living we never know 
whats going to happen the next day 
zamora was given the name of a farmer and directions to his 
place then he headed off with his family in a tattered white ford 
van that survived the threeday journey from texas for the next 12 
hours they hoed weeds for 30 an acre 
hundreds more migrants than usual almost all of them from the 
parched lands of texas made the 1500mile trip in pickups and 
vans to find seasonal work in minnesota thanks to unusual weather 
they found more work than normal 
everybodys working and i have 50 farmers waiting for more 
laborers weeds dont know theres a drought said armando 
cuellar counselor for the states job service division in 
crookston 
ive never had this much labor available but this is the year 
im shortest on labor im hearing from growers who never used 
migrant laborers cuellar said 
the worst drought in 50 years is only one problem facing the 
beets which ripen into tannishwhite bulbs that produce sugar a 
may 13 frost killed much of the first planting so farmers had to 
try again high winds hampered the second seeding and survivors 
are enduring the drought and an onslaught of weeds 
farmers spray chemicals to control weeds which suck up moisture 
from the ground and keep it from the beets but the herbicides 
dont work unless it rains if it rains now the weeds grow twice 
as fast as the beets 
if the chemicals dont kill the weeds the laborers will 
theyre like insurance to an automobile owner said pablo 
guajardo of the job service division in moorhead 
the red river flows north into canada through a lush 
200milelong valley that was once the bed of a glacial lake the 
heavy rich soil is among the most fertile in the world 
sugar beets are a 1 billion industry in the valley which 
produces about 20 percent of the sugar made in the united states 
about 12 percent of the us total comes from an 1800member 
cooperative called the american sugar crystal co which expects 
the yield to be down substantially this year because of the drought 
crop projections are 16 tons per acre on 366000 acres down 
from last years yield of 19 tons per acre according to ron hayes 
president of american crystal 
but the beets have fared better than wheat barley and other 
light grains on the parched prairie so growers are concentrating 
on them 
you cant dare abandon the sugar beets at this point said 
evert schumacher polk county executive of the states agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service thats all the hope these 
farmers got 
about 4400 migrants are in moorhead including 1400 who are 
laborers they arrived in april and may but had no work early 
because of the weather 
however with the late start and and the drought theyll 
probably have work into august 
the migrants normally get paid 22 an acre or a minimum of 5 
an hour because of the increased demand some are getting 30 to 
35 an acre and a good hoer can work two acres per day seven days 
a week 
at the job exchange men with folded arms sat in chairs against 
a wall at a former high school looking like anxious students 
waiting to see the principal they waited for word on work and 
talked about the weather barefoot children scurried about or drew 
pictures on papers 
its a pretty bad year too many weeds said rodolfo 
gonzalez 46 wearing a los angeles dodgers baseball cap one 
good thing about the drought though no mosquitoes 
bennie hernandez had just driven 14 hours from wyoming because 
he heard there were jobs here after this job hell go to iowa to 
hack weeds with a machete in the soybean fields 
you dont know from one day to the next we just move and hope 
to find work hernandez said 
the work is exhausting workers chop at kneehigh weeds along 
straight rows of beets stopping occasionally for water the lunch 
break lasts 30 minutes 
the migrants took a chance on the droughtstricken north because 
job opportunities are scarcer in texas 
at least up here they have hope the economy in texas is not 
the best theres nothing down there to begin with said guajardo 
the migrants dont harvest the beets thats done by machine in 
october when the crop is cut into slices like french fries and 
mixed with water to remove the sugar 
farmers who have given up on their grain crops are keeping their 
fingers crossed on sugar beets 
gerald olsonawski of kittson county who plowed under 1400 
acres of failed wheat he has 321 acres of beets thats my last

politics of inclusion in the book kean talks about ways to 
reach beyond the gops traditional wealthy whitecollar base 
kean one of new jerseys most popular governors was 
resoundingly reelected in 1985 with an unprecedented 60 percent of 
the black vote four years earlier he had squeaked into the 
governors job by the slimmest margin ever

a series of moraleboosting victories has 
given iraq the edge in its war with iran and convinced iraqis the 
8yearold conflict has entered its final phase 
the situation has improved a lot from an iraqi standpoint 
said deputy foreign minister nizar hamdoun time is not on irans 
side which was the perception before 
we think we are in the last phase of the war a phase where 
the iranians have begun a significant deterioration in their 
internal affairs caused by their military defeats 
the string of successful iraqi military operations began in 
april when iraq recaptured the important southern oil terminal at 
faw in a 36hour battle 
that was followed by victories in the southern shalamcheh area 
in may which took only nine hours and another ninehour battle 
saturday that recovered the oilrich majnoon islands near the 
southern city of basra 
also in june iraq announced it had driven iranian forces from 
several strategic mountaintops in its northern kurdistan province 
that left only a handful of iranian positions in iraqi territory 
military experts in baghdad who visited some of the recaptured 
areas were astonished at the speed of the iraqi offensives and what 
appeared to be the lack of stiff iranian resistance 
shalamcheh should have taken days if not weeks to retake 
said one western military man in the iraqi capital 
the bubble has burst for the iranians said a diplomat 
for five or six years they have been on the verge of winning now 
every iranian knows there have been major battlefield reverses it 
has had a great impact on iranian morale 
the victories have sparked new optimism here 
president saddam hussein told his troops after the victory at 
majnoon that they had won the most difficult of battles needed to 
end the war 
official slogans suggest the iraqis feel the end of the fight 
against ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis forces is near 
the official announcement of victory will be soon god 
willing said one sign near the front at majnoon 
we are convinced that the outcome of the war will be decided 
in the coming days weeks or months deputy premier taha yassin 
ramadhan was quoted as saying last week 
khomeini and khomeinism cannot survive for long said 
hamdoun its defeats at the front are a key to its overall 
defeat without iraq as an enemy khomeini cannot survive 
it was not clear if baghdads battlefield successes resulted 
from a newfound military prowess or a crumbling iranian will to 
fight there have been growing signs of disarray in iran 
western military analysts have noted increasing desertions in 
the military and tehrans difficulty recruiting soldiers the issue 
of new identity cards in iran is seen largely as an effort to crack 
down on draft dodgers 
the conduct of the war also has come under critical scrutiny in 
the press and political infighting continues 
on june 2 parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani was appointed 
commanderinchief of irans armed forces to end bickering and 
reorganize the military 
the national liberation army of iran an iraqibacked rebel 
force say many of the more than 2000 prisoners they hold 
surrendered easily after only brief resistance 
some observers speculate that once baghdad has recovered the few 
pockets of iraqi territory still in iranian hands mostly in the 
mountainous north the war will come to a de facto end the 
pre1980 borders having been reestablished 
the iraqis concede there is no movement at all on the diplomatic 
front but cling to un security council resolution 598 as the 
only solution to the conflict 
that resolution accepted by iraq after its passage in july has 
been neither accepted nor rejected by iran it calls for a 
ceasefire withdrawal to original borders exchange of prisoners 
and determination of who was responsible for starting the war 
had iran accepted the resolution and begun negotiations it may 
have been able to extract concessions from iraq in return for the 
captured territory now it has lost the territory and has nothing 
concrete to show for it 
iraq cannot accept just a ceasefire hamdoun said we 
think that after eight years of war you either continue or settle 
the war once and for all you cant have a nopeace situation and 
maintain the necessary manpower 
iraq has little faith in the united nations ability to mediate 
peace pointing to 20 years of failure in the arabisraeli 
conflict and has even less faith in outside mediators 
conventional wisdom has been that iran with its larger 
population and greater resources could outlast iraq in a war of 
attrition that has not been the case 
iraq has shown it has the staying power said a western 
diplomat its lived through the worst and shown it can tough it 
out

making a contribution to society is far 
more important than earning a hefty salary a poll of us high 
school student leaders has found 
delegates to the national association of student councils 
conference in albuquerque were asked tuesday what would be most 
important to them at age 40 
fiftytwo percent selected having made a contribution to 
society 20 percent chose a successful first marriage 18 
percent picked being a better parent than the generation that 
raised me and 10 percent reported making a lot of money 
the conferences sponsors say the findings show a definite shift 
in values among americas youth 
during the past three years students have been moving away 
from money as a measure of success and focusing upon societal 
contributions as their prime measure of achievement as an adult 
said dale hawley director of student activities for the national 
association of secondary school principals the conference sponsor 
when we asked this question at a similar conference four years 
ago students indicated making money was their primary measure of 
success hawley said 
the 1500 delegates from across the county also cited alcohol 
overwhelmingly as the most frequently used drug by their peers 
eightynine percent chose alcohol 9 percent chose cigarettes 2 
percent chose marijuana and less than 1 percent cited hard drugs 
like cocaine figures were rounded off so they totaled more than 
100 percent 
delegates reported they see considerable cheating in school 
sixtysix percent said they see cheating frequently 33 percent 
said infrequently and 1 percent said they never saw any cheating

the house on wednesday approved a measure 
prohibiting federal involvement in road projects for a disputed 
shopping center scheduled to be built next to a civil war 
battlefield in northern virginia 
the provision included in a 108 billion transportation bill 
approved by the house prevents federal money from being used for 
the planning design or construction of bypasses or access roads 
associated with the william center development just west of 
washington in prince william county va 
the development is being opposed by local groups who say it 
would be detrimental to the adjacent manassas national battlefield 
park 
this is designed to indicate congress interest in this piece 
of land said tad boggs an aide to rep robert mrazek dny 
who sponsored the provision this is a shot across the 
developers bow and is intended to buy us time until we come up 
with a plan to purchase the land 
the bill is the first piece of legislation passed by the house 
that attempts to stop the 542acre development which historians 
claim would violate the sanctity of the 4600acre park where two 
major civil war battles were fought 
the projects developers have offered to help pay for road 
construction but federal funds usually are needed for a project of 
this size to be completed mrazeks provision prohibits federal 
involvement in road bypasses or alterations associated with 
interstate 66 which runs adjacent to the park and us 29 and 
state route 234 which run through the battle site 
the project proposed by the hazelpeterson cos would feature 
a 12 millionsquarefoot shopping center 17 millionsquarefeet 
of office space and 560 homes john t hazel president of the 
development group first proposed a much smaller office park for 
the space but upgraded his plans once county officials relaxed 
zoning requirements for the tract 
mrazek is a cosponsor of another house bill that would take 
control of the development tract and add it to the boundaries of 
the park that measure is scheduled to be voted on by a house 
interior and insular affairs panel thursday

the largest display ever of the 
magical creations of filmmaker george lucas opens thursday just a 
few miles from the movie studio where his fantasies come alive 
visitors can see han solo frozen into a block of carbon like a 
coffin figure from the empire strikes back luke skywalkers 
landspeeder from star wars the ark of the covenant from 
raiders of the lost ark and a halfsize jabba the hutt from 
return of the jedi 
the fiveday show at marin countys annual fair is free except 
for fair admission 
it has the look of an exhibit of pop culture as much as a 
showing of lucas galaxy of special effects 
explanations are written on cards at each display but most are 
surely recognizable to even the least avid moviegoer there is 
wicket on his ewok hang glider darth vader and his imperial 
shuttle craft a stooped yoda and the star wars storm troopers 
were putting out for the first time on this kind of scale the 
very things which dreams and wishes are made of said judy niles 
spokeswoman for lucas industrial light and magic the 
specialeffects division of his moviemaking empire 
there also are mockups of solos clunker spaceship and vaders 
superstar destroyer the imperial atat or all terrain attack 
transport the tauntaun snow lizard and the imperial scout 
antigrav speeder bike 
in one corner of the 15000squarefoot round auditorium vader 
stands next to the deathstar battle station 
nearby where they will pose for pictures with guests stand 
c3po and r2d2 skywalkers mechanical sidekicks 
this is a collection of giant flashes of imagination all 
inspired by lucas said steve gawley model shop project 
supervisor at industrial light and magic in san rafael 15 miles 
north of san francisco 
i think people will come here to try and see how their heroes 
were created said gawley who has worked for lucas 13 years 
besides lucas creations industrial light and magic also has 
created special effects for scores of other hit movies the klingon 
bird of prey from star trek iii is displayed along with a 
model of the delorean time machine from back to the future 
all the movie props were taken from a giant warehouse employees 
call the archive 
many were falling apart and had to be repaired 
these models die a little bit every time you move them said 
niles i doubt that well ever again be able to put on a show 
this large certainly not one thats more than just a few miles 
from our studio 
the same crew that handles lighting makeup and costuming for 
ilm arranged the display which includes a star backdrop and videos 
showing how the various items appeared on the big screen 
models of the spacecraft are startling in detail not all of it 
done in the utmost seriousness 
look in the cockpit of one for example and youll see a 
miniature playboy poster in another a nasa emblem one has a sea 
anchor on the outside of a space destroyer

mothers have the greatest influence in getting 
children to wear auto safety belts while fathers often set a bad 
example according to a survey of the nations school children 
the survey released wednesday showed 79 percent of those 
interviewed believe seat belts save lives and more children wear 
seat belts than the parents who accompany them 
of the 1118 children interviewed by louis harris and associates 
for the american coalition of traffic safety 58 percent said they 
wear seat belts all or most of the time while 57 percent said 
their mothers regularly wear seat belts and only 38 percent said 
their fathers buckle up 
acts which has a 15 million annual budget was set up by the 
us auto industry in 1986 to support safety belt use 
among the youngsters surveyed 30 percent said they use seat 
belts all of the time 28 percent most of the time and 33 
percent sometimes with 9 percent saying they never wear them 
pollsters interviewed children in grades 57 across the country 
in late april and may pollsters who talked to children in their 
schools claimed a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent 
i cant believe i got out of that car alive said 9yearold 
nicole rabello of whiting nj an accident victim who was one of 
37 children presented at a news conference announcing the survey 
results all the children were saved because of seat belts 
according to acts officials 
blownup photographs of smashed cars including the 
mercedesbenz in which nicole was riding provided a backdrop 
elevenyearold frederick d thompson of washington dc said 
that he has only forgotten to put on his seat belt once since his 
crash and his father quickly reminded him 
if i was not wearing my safety belt my head would have gone 
through the window of the car frederick said 
susan akin miss america for 1986 accompanied the children and 
recounted that a seat belt saved her life in a 1987 mississippi 
crash involving her car and an 18wheel truck 
one rainy day i was in a hospital with blood running down my 
face said miss akin she said family cried when they saw her 
covered with blood but thank goodness they were not tears 
looking down on me dead 
miss akin said since the crash which left only a small scar on 
her nose she has volunteered her time to promote the use of seat 
belts 
phil haseltine acts executive director said the survey showed 
that parents are a greater influence on safety belt use than 
entertainers sports figures or police officers involved in safety 
campaigns 
but fathers dont look too good here said haseltine 
the survey said 48 percent of those surveyed wished their 
parents would use seat belts more often while 68 percent worry 
about their parents being killed in an auto accident only 38 
percent said they worry about dying in a car crash themselves

identified whether their states are among the 32 with mandatory 
seat belt laws the district of columbia also has such a law

a medicine widely used for gout appears to 
dramatically slow the lethal destruction of cirrhosis but doctors 
disagree over whether it should become routine treatment for this 
major killer 
in a report published thursday a team of mexican researchers 
said they found a striking consistent statistically significant 
benefit of the drug colchicine after 10 years more than half of 
those who got the medicine were alive compared with less than a 
quarter of the people in an untreated comparison group 
earlier versions of the 14year study have been published and 
presented at medical meetings over the years and many us experts 
are familiar with the work despite the impressive results 
however opinion is divided 
some believe colchicine should be used for cirrhosis despite 
flaws in the mexican research because the drug is clearly safe and 
inexpensive others contend that more research is necessary to 
prove that it works 
cirrhosis is scarring of the liver that usually results from 
alcohol abuse or chronic viral infections it is the ninth leading 
cause of death among us adults killing about 20000 people 
annually 
according to the world health organization it accounts for 13 
deaths for each 100000 people annually in the united states and 
as high as 32 in italy and 42 in hungary 
until now doctors treating cirrhosis have been able to do 
little except encourage patients to stop drinking 
we are the first ones to show that you can really do something 
for the cirrhosis patient said dr marcos rojkind who directed 
the latest study at the salvador zubiran national institute for 
nutrition in mexico city 
he concluded that colchicine stops the progression of cirrhosis 
and in some cases even seems to reverse the disease colchicine is 
widely used to treat gout a hereditary form of arthritis caused by 
excess uric acid in the blood and it attacks joints in the hands 
and feet 
rojkind who is now at albert einstein college of medicine in 
new york said he believes colchicine works by reducing 
inflammation in the liver and preventing the release of a growth 
factor that promotes the formation of connective tissue 
in an editorial published with the study in the new england 
journal of medicine drs james l boyer and david f ransohoff of 
yale medical school pointed out shortcomings in the study among 
other things they noted that those who received the drug were not 
as sick as those in the comparison group 
these questions about chance bias and biologic factors tend 
to weaken an endorsement of what is otherwise the most impressive 
outcome yet described for any treatment of patients with 
cirrhosis they wrote 
they said more research is needed dr jay hoffnagle of the 
national institute of diabetes digestive and kidney diseases 
agreed 
its the type of work that needs to be repeated to show that 
its a reproducible finding he said 
hoffnagle said the drug should not be routinely used for 
cirrhosis and he said he believes that many us experts are 
skeptical of the findings 
however dr thomas lamont of boston university medical center 
said he thinks colchicine should be offered now to victims of the 
disease 
while its a flawed study he said we have no other 
simple medical therapy for this disease coupled with abstinence 
from alcohol which we firmly believe in this therapy is certainly 
worth further consideration 
dr marhsall kaplan of new england medical center has 
successfully used the drug to treat a rare form of the disease 
called primary biliary cirrhosis and he agreed that colchicine 
should be used for cirrhosis resulting from alcoholism and other 
causes 
if a drug seems to have a benefit and doesnt have any risk 
and is inexpensive and with colchicine all of these things are 
true its probably reasonable to try it he said 
in the study 54 patients were randomly assigned to take 
colchicine while 46 got placebo pills after five years 75 
percent of the colchicine patients were alive compared with 34 
percent of the placebo group after 10 years the survival rate in 
the two groups was 56 percent and 20 percent 
biopsies seemed to show improvement in nine of those who got 
colchicine in two of them their livers had returned to normal 
while in seven others there was minimal scarring 
the two major side effects of the treatment were diarrhea and 
gastritis or inflammation of the stomach

a panel of health and employment experts concluded 
wednesday that most workers do not risk getting aids at work and 
it advised companies against screening current or prospective 
employees for aids or the hiv virus 
the 36member panel meeting under the auspices of the world 
health organization and the international labor organization also 
recommended that workers suffering from aids or those infected with 
the aids virus be given the same access to health benefits as other 
workers 
it said employees should feel no obligation to inform their 
employers whether they have acquired immune deficiency syndrome or 
are infected with hiv which causes the deadly disease 
the panel representing 18 countries also said hiv infection 
was not a reason to fire an employee it recommended that 
reasonable alternative working arrangements should be made if a 
workers ability to do his job is impaired by aids 
the panel approved the guidelines for governments employers and 
employees during a threeday meeting it recommended that companies 
and national governments should develop consistent policies and 
procedures as soon as possible 
the document says that in the vast majority of occupations and 
occupational settings work does not involve a risk of acquiring or 
transmitting hiv between workers from worker to client or from 
client to worker 
it reiterated that the three known ways the hiv virus can be 
transmitted are through sexual intercourse through blood and from 
infected mothers to their infants 
jonathan mann head of the whos aids program told a press 
conference that the guidelines did not apply to workers where aids 
transmission might be a risk such as in health care among 
emergency medical personnel and in some cases police and 
firefighters he said a meeting on such occupations would be held 
later this year 
mann said about 90 percent of the estimated 5 million to 10 
million hivinfected people worldwide are of working age it is 
in everybodys interest that hivinfected people work he said 
the panel also concluded 
screening prospective employees for hiv or aids to determine 
whether they are fit to work is unnecessary and should not be 
required preemployment screening for insurance or other purposes 
raises serious concerns about discrimination and merits close and 
further scrutiny 
screening employees or asking questions about tests already 
taken should not be required 
workers who are infected or perceived to be must be 
protected from stigmatization and discrimination by coworkers 
unions employers or clients this is best done through education 
programs it said

after captivating audiences in the soviet union 
with its magical retelling of the firebird and other ballets 
the dance theater of harlem has returned home as part of the first 
new york international festival of the arts 
the 20yearold company opened tuesday night at city center 
theater with the world premiere of arthur mitchells john 
henry using various versions of the american folk tune by the 
same name and traditional gospel hymns and spirituals the dance 
retells the legend of the steeldrivin man and the times in 
which he lived 
as artistic director and cofounder of the youthful dance 
company mitchell has staged an energetic dance that utilizes 
modern ballet moves and steps with a folk flavor theres even a 
texas twostep thrown in 
eddie j shellman whose barrel turns and leaps have made him a 
standout in the company portrays john henry he is a strong 
dancer whose forcefulness does not obliterate his grace he is 
partnered well with yvonne hall who dances the part of john 
henrys perky girlfriend 
theara ward a young dancer who has a wonderful technical 
astuteness in neoclassical ballets stretches her style as john 
henrys mother her moves though sustained are nevertheless in 
the folk tradition lowell smith is the father 
mitchell has placed his musicians singer and conductor on 
stage which is just fine and supports the folkiness of the piece 
however when he adds youngsters who gather around to hear leon 
bibbs sing the legend of john henry the stage becomes somewhat 
cluttered and some of the dancers and moves are hidden 
the dance theater of harlem prides itself on preserving american 
dance repertory and does an excellent job of presenting works that 
otherwise would disappear because they are not performed the 
company also is good at demonstrating a variety of styles and moods 
from the classical swan lake to the neoclassical serenade 
to the contemporary and ethnic dougla 
john henry is a good addition to the companys repertory 
but it is not necessarily one of its strongest works 
john henry was commissioned by the arts festival and 
mitchell said it was a tribute to actorsingerwriter paul robeson 
who was a kind of american folk hero and to john henry who is an

terrorists who claimed responsibility for 
a the carbomb assassination of a us military attache said 
wednesday they will continue killing americans until the pentagon 
abandons its bases in greece 
police said they had no leads in the death of navy capt william 
e nordeen 51 he was killed tuesday when a vehicle laden with 
explosives exploded as his armorplated car passed it 100 yards 
from his home in the kifissia suburb north of athens 
deputy premier agamemnon koutsogiorgas said greek police need 
better equipment and antiterrorism training to combat the leftist 
group november 17 which has taken responsibility for 11 unsolved 
political killings in greece over 13 years 
the explosion tore the top off nordeens car and hurled his 
decapitated body into the front yard of an unoccupied home on 
deliyanni street where several western embassy personnel live he 
and his wife patricia had been scheduled to leave greece next 
month after a threeyear tour 
we are at a standstill in the investigation we have no leads 
at this time said a senior police officer in athens speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
november 17 claimed responsibility in a statement published 
wednesday in the leftwing daily ethnos which did not say how it 
obtained the document a red star was stenciled on each of the five 
typewritten pages 
we decided to execute one of the higher officers of the 
military forces of american imperialism in our country and will 
continue making targets of americans until the last turkish 
soldier leaves cyprus and the last american soldier leaves our 
country the statement said 
many greeks feel the united states could have stopped turkey 
from invading cyprus in july 1974 after a shortlived coup led by 
greek officers turkey has about 30000 soldiers in the northern 
third of the eastern mediterranean island where ethnic turkish 
cypriots have declared a separate state 
in its statement november 17 described us military forces in 
greece as an occupation force and demanded the immediate 
closure of the american bases and removal of our country from 
nato both greece and turkey are members of the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
about 3500 american military personnel are stationed at four 
us bases in greece two near athens and two on the island of 
crete and a new bases agreement is being negotiated 
the group calling itself november 17 became known with the 
assassination in 1975 of richard welch the cia station chief in 
athens and also claimed responsibility for the killing of george 
tsantes a us navy captain in 1983 police have never arrested 
any of its members 
it name comes from nov 17 1973 when troops and tanks crushed 
a student rebellion against the military dictatorship that 
controlled greece from 1967 to 1974 
koutsogiorgas the deputy premier told reporters greece plans 
tough measures against terrorism but we are behind in matters of 
technology the criminals follow new methods and are ahead of 
our police in technological knowhow 
a few greek policemen have attended antiterrorism courses run 
by british and american experts but newspapers frequently 
criticize the force for inefficiency and oldfashioned methods 
nordeen a native of minnesota and former navy pilot was 
assistant naval inspector in washington before his posting to 
athens he previously served in the pacific and at the jacksonville 
naval air base in florida

the house on wednesday approved a 108 
billion transportation appropriations bill for fiscal 1989 that 
boosts spending for the coast guard and aviation and seeks to 
shield a civil war battlefield from development 
the measure sent to the senate on a 37140 vote has been 
threatened with a veto by administration officials who say it is 
too expensive the bill would pour 2 billion more into 
transportation programs for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 than 
president reagan has proposed 
besides 108 billion in new spending the legislation would 
allow the government to spend up to another 154 billion next year 
from special funds set aside for aviation highway and mass transit 
projects 
overall the measure would give the coast guard a budget of 31 
billion of which 492 million would have to be spent on antidrug 
programs the federal aviation administration would receive 66 
billion both agencies coffers would be boosted by about 16 
percent over 1988 levels 
the legislation also would make it harder for a developer to 
build a proposed shopping mall on a manassas va site where the 
second battle of bull run was fought in 1862 the provision would 
forbid the federal government from allowing highway interchanges to 
be built to serve the area 
the measure also provides 33 billion for mass transit 
programs 138 billion for highway projects and 590 million for 
amtrak the passenger railroad reagan has repeatedly proposed 
ending federal subsidies for amtrak and slashing mass transit 
assistance virtually in half 
the legislation as always also contains some money for road 
construction and other projects that benefit the districts of 
particular lawmakers 
the senate appropriations committee approved a 106 billion 
version of the bill last friday the two chambers will have to work 
out their differences before the legislation is sent to the white 
house

no one in this smokestack suburb of 
chicago ever clamored for a poet laureate so when a rhymster whos 
never worked or lived here assumed the title it ticked off a few 
locals 
they dont want james underdown and theyre not too fond of his 
poetry either 
its kind of cruddy if you ask me says mayor robert 
stefaniak 
for someone to be a poet laureate of a community he should at 
least be a resident of the community city librarian vickie novak 
said wednesday ive been a lifelong calumet city resident and i 
dont think he knows the city very well 
but underdown who recites what he calls calumet cityinspired 
poetry at an offbeat chicago nightclub disagreed with ms novaks 
assessment 
ive just introduced a new perspective to it calumet city 
and she may be blind to what shes been living in her whole life 
said underdown who wears a tuxedo and a black andy capp hat 
and smokes a fat black jack cigar while he performs 
underdown who grew up in the affluent suburb of wheaton said 
only one of his poems is written about calumet city itself but 
hes written 30 from a calumet city perspective 
he said his favorite line is 
theyve said in the past we aint got no class and we watch tv

the canadian embassy doesnt have to look far for 
advice on how to cope with the loss of most of its soviet employees 
in a titfortat spy war they can ask the americans across town 
on wednesday kremlin officials handed the canadians a list of 
25 soviet employees no longer be allowed to work at the embassy 
said the missions spokesman paul drager the soviets had actually 
stopped working monday 
american diplomats stationed a few blocks away in downtown 
moscow know the feeling they lost all 260 of their soviet support 
staff in october 1986 
the latest pullout comes at a particularly hard time for the 
canadians while they are trying to follow developments in the 
first soviet communist party conference in 47 years and just 
before fridays celebration of the canada day holiday 
by tradition canadas ambassador is given time on soviet 
television to address the soviet people on the holiday it is not 
clear whether the spy dispute will affect this tradition 
the problems began june 22 when canada announced it was 
expelling eight soviet diplomats and officials for alleged 
espionage nine other soviets previously assigned to canada were 
barred from returning the soviets retaliated the next day 
expelling two canadian diplomats and saying three others cannot 
come back 
canada shot back by kicking out the senior military attache at 
the soviet embassy in ottawa and barring a former second secretary 
from returning on saturday the soviets ordered canadas military 
attache to leave moscow told seven former diplomats they cannot 
return and pulled out the 25 soviet workers 
the withdrawal leaves the canadian embassy with just 14 soviet 
employees the hardesthit section is the one that issues visas for 
soviets traveling to canada drager said two of the three soviets 
who worked in the visa section have left meaning soviets citizens 
will have to wait longer to get permission to visit canada drager 
said the blow comes at a time when soviets travel to canada is 
soaring because of new more liberal soviet regulations he said 
the withdrawn employees include carpenters painters drivers 
mechanics translators and maintenance workers the canadian 
embassy is trying to replace those workers with spouses and 
children of diplomats and of other canadians living in moscow such 
as businessmen and journalists 
the problem is a familiar one for the us embassy after the 
soviet union withdrew its employees us diplomats had to take 
over much of the cooking cleaning driving and telephone 
answering they also lost valuable soviet translators eventually 
an american company was hired to send in support staff 
like the americans the canadians who number 42 are adopting a 
positive attitude 
we can function and we will function drager quoted canadian 
ambassador vernon turner as saying 
drager however said a longterm solution to the staff shortage 
has yet to be found its much too early to say he said 
the canadians are hoping the kremlin will allow some of the 
withdrawn soviets to return or be replaced on monday canadian 
foreign minister joe clark told reporters in ottawa after meeting 
with soviet ambassador alexei rodionov that soviet workers coming 
to montreal to rebuild the firedamaged soviet consulate may not 
get visas unless the kremlin reverses its withdrawal of the 25 
soviets 
managers of canadian embassy programs have given turner lists of 
jobs to be done according to priority drager said asked if job 
assignments of diplomats had been changed because of the staff 
shortage he responded were doing a lot of different things 
were certainly coping 
drager refused to say if the diplomats were working longer hours 
and declined to say whether the canadian embassy had asked the 
americans for advice on how to cope us embassy marguerite squire 
also declined comment

dissident intellectuals blame the 
late president tito for most of yugoslavias current troubles and 
are demanding an end to official veneration of the man who 
personified the nation for 35 years 
the 19member committee in defense of intellectual freedoms said 
in a statement dated monday and addressed to the yugoslav 
leadership that tito built an undemocratic repressive political 
system that has thwarted the progressive development of society 
a copy was received wednesday by the associated press it is 
believed to be the strongest statement to date for what is called a 
critical reappraisal of tito the undisputed leader of this 
communist nation from the partisan days of world war ii until his 
death in 1980 at age 87 
tito is still revered by yugoslav authorities and criticizing 
his policies is a criminal offense the intellectuals described 
many instances of public veneration as primitive rituals 
the group making the statement is led by dobrica cosic 
yugoslavias most popular author who was dismissed from the 
communist party central committee in the late 1960s for criticizing 
titos policies its members include university professors 
artists authors and scientists 
titos role in making crucial political decisions and his 
absolute power in shaping yugoslav policies were so great that the 
presentday position of the country and particularly its current 
deep social crisis cannot be understood or explained without a 
comprehensive and objective scientific and critical reappraisal of 
his historical responsibility the statement said 
there can be no way out of the present economic political and 
moral crisis affecting yugoslav society without a thorough critical 
evaluation of past yugoslav policies 
yugoslavia has a 21 billion foreign debt and an annual 
inflation rate of about 170 percent growing labor unrest is 
threatening the communist partys leadership 
in their statement the intellectuals traced the crisis to 
titos last decade in power when the foreign debt rose from 2 
billion to 20 billion 
they also said he intentionally invented political opponents 
in order to nurture the ghost of permanent civil war thus 
preventing the meaningful democratization of society 
although yugoslavia which left the soviet bloc in 1948 was 
considered the most liberal communist country tito was intolerant 
of opposition 
the statement was issued one day before the 40th anniversary of 
the day yugoslavia was formally kicked out of the soviet bloc after 
tito broke with josef stalin on june 28 1948 the informbureau a 
sovietdominated grouping of all communist nations and parties 
voted unanimously to expel yugoslavia for deserting the 
principles of marxismleninism 
moscow and its allies which accounted for more than 80 percent 
of yugoslavias foreign trade immediately imposed a trade boycott 
and tito turned to the west 
according to the intellectuals a dispassionate assessment 
is needed of titos role in measures against dissidents 
particularly those sent to one of modern europes most sinister 
prison camps goli otok 
goli otok or bare island is a rocky island off the central 
adriatic coast that was an internment camp for 13000 alleged 
opponents of the regime after titos break with stalin 
several thousand are said to have died because of maltreatment 
by prison authorities 
the intellectuals said titos foreign policy isolated our 
country from its natural cultural historical economic and 
political surroundings in europe he was a founder three decades 
ago of the organization of nations professing nonalignment 
that focused his foreign policy on africa and asia the 
statement said instead of on political and economic integration 
into western europe 
it also criticized titos lavish lifestyle demanding to know 
the real costs of his rule 
titos salary was never disclosed but the statement said the 
lengthy court battle over his estate indicated his personal wealth 
was substantial 
his widow jovanka sued the state for title to several 
mansions vineyards limousines and boats she claimed were his 
personal property

patrick graham wanted to break down the 
traditional british reserve and get to know his neighbors a bit 
better so he hung up a sign outside his door 
unofficial community cafe it said open and free to all 
local residents as long as the sign is up 
he got more than visitors he won an award for helping make the 
world a better place 
i think you have to be slightly brave to put up a sign saying 
knock on my door but it could catch on said nicholas albery 
founder of an organization called the institute for social 
inventions 
graham was among 12 people singled out this year by the 
institute a londonbased group that annually awards cash prizes to 
creative people who think of new ways to improve the quality of 
life 
graham a television soundman hung up his sign when he moved 
into his new row house in cardiff wales last winter the first 
day alone 13 people dropped by for coffee or tea 
i have a humanist bent and i say all people are worth 
something even the most boring of them but you have to be ready 
to do a lot of listening he said in a telephone interview 
wednesday 
a young mother up the road even borrowed the sign to host the 
homespun cafe for awhile 
the institute divides its 1700 cash prize among the winners 
who will be feted at a ceremony on july 12 
launched in 1985 the institute publishes a social inventions 
quarterly for about 400 subscribers said albery 39 a 
psychotherapist 
i think there are plenty of ideas that are worthy but dull 
and should be worthy but imaginative he said 
similar institutes have formed in sweden denmark and the soviet 
union and one is planned for the united states among interested 
parties in philadelphia san francisco and oregon albery said 
he said the soviet foundation for social inventions has been 
swamped with 15000 ideas from the public since it was set up last 
fall by geophysicist gennady alferenko 
other award winners this year include 65yearold ilya 
nikolayevich savin of the soviet union who proposed a network of 
regional and school botanical gardens grown from her own 30year 
stock of fruit and berry plant seeds 
also among this years winners is margie mcgregor whose 
friendship trust in oxfordshire encourages adults to help problem 
teenagers take up hobbies 
british biochemist john hart is cited for a proposal to deal 
with juvenile delinquents by postponing their age of majority to 
21 thus denying them driving licenses or credit cards 
the best third world social invention award went to dr thomas 
lovejoy of the smithsonian institution in washington 
in 1984 he suggested that western conservation groups could 
offer to redeem part of a third world countrys debt in return for 
that country providing funds to protect a conservation area such 
as a tropical forest 
debtfornature swaps have already been arranged in bolivia 
ecuador and costa rica

a bill that would provide grants to states 
which enact tough drunkendriving laws won the backing wednesday of 
state highway officials but was criticized by the reagan 
administration as too inflexible 
the measure introduced by sen frank lautenberg dnj would 
provide grants to states that adopt laws allowing a police officer 
to take away a drunken drivers license on the spot and issue a 
notice of license suspension or revocation a judge would make the 
final determination 
if we can save 2000 lives by spending 10 million or 20 
million in seed money is it too much lautenberg asked what 
were really asking is are we willing to invest federal dollars 
to help save lives 
his bill would tap highway trust fund money for grants to states 
to set up alcohol abuse programs it was endorsed by several state 
highway officials during a hearing by the senate committee on 
environment and public works 
the panel also is considering a second drunkendriving bill 
introduced by sen harry reid dnev that authorizes the 
transportation secretary to actually withhold routine federal 
highway funds from states that do not enact the license suspension 
and revocation procedures 
lautenberg is a cosponsor of the reid bill but said at 
wednesdays hearing that he would prefer using the carrot first 
then the stick 
if the incentives arent enough lets impose sanctions he 
said one way or the other we want to get to the same goal and 
that is to save lives by getting the drunken driver off the road 
but nearly all the witnesses argued that sanctions do not always 
work and that they preferred the grant program 
sanctions very frankly are counterproductive said ronald 
fiedler of the american association of state highway and 
transportation officials they decrease funds for other highway 
safety programs we support the incentive approach 
george reagle associate administrator for traffic safety 
programs for the national highway traffic safety administration 
spoke out against both drunkendriving bills contending that many 
of the provisions in the lautenberg bill duplicate existing law and 
are less flexible 
specifically reagle complained that the lautenberg measure 
gives states too little time to get the accused drunken drivers to 
court he said that the reagan administration believes 45 days is a 
reasonable requirement while the lautenberg bill requires the case 
go to a judge within 15 days 
we strongly encourage the states to adopt administrative 
systems for license suspensions reagle told the committee it 
is our view however that the bill may accomplish little that has 
not already been accomplished 
by contrast norma phillips president of mothers against drunk 
driving said her group supports both pieces of legislation 
administrative revocation of drivers licenses she said is 
madds number one legislative priority

canadas tough new disclosure law on the toxic 
contents and health hazards of smoking could set a precedent for a 
crackdown on tobacco products in the united states the nations 
leading antismoking campaigner said wednesday 
what was unthinkable five years ago is now going to be the 
subject of serious public debate in the united states said 
garfield mahood director of the torontobased nonsmokers rights 
association 
mahood was jubilant after parliament gave final approval tuesday 
night to two rigorous antismoking bills despite a major lobbying 
effort from the 54 billion canadian tobacco industry 
david has slain goliath said federal health minister jake 
epp praising citizens groups like mahoods that took on and 
defeated the tobacco lobby they were outgunned they were 
outmuscled and quite frankly they were outfinessed epp said 
one bill introduced by opposition new democratic party member 
lynn mcdonald requires the government to provide a smokefree 
environment in all buildings under federal jurisdiction including 
banks it also must guarantee smokefree travel on planes ships 
trains and buses 
mindful that 7 million canadians are smokers one adult in 
three the bill also says employers may set up separately 
ventilated smoking areas at their discretion 
the other bill came from the government and was described by 
mahood as the toughest in the world it bans tobacco 
advertising in print as of jan 1 phases out billboard ads by 1991 
and promotion signs by 1993 restricts sponsorship of sports and 
cultural events and prohibits free samples 
the bill further requires manufacturers to publicly identify all 
additives in their products mahood claims these include 
turpentine propane ammonia and volcanic ash and to disclose the 
toxic contents of cigarette smoke 
a leaflet detailing all known health risks from smoking with 
replace the general warning now required on cigarette packets 
you might reasonably expect a document the size of the new 
york telephone directory mahood said he said cigarette smoking 
has been linked to 17 terminal diseases causing 35000 deaths a 
year in canada and 300000 in the united states 
americans have always had a strong appreciation for the value 
of informed consent said mahood it will be difficult for the 
tobacco industry to argue that americans arent also entitled to 
this information 
from the tobacco farms of ontario to the boardrooms of imperial 
tobacco rjrmacdonald and rothmans in toronto and montreal 
industry leaders huddled in meetings wednesday to discuss how to 
protect their livelihood the volume of cigarette sales in canada 
has slumped 22 percent in the past five years 
spokesmen said the legislation may be challenged in court on the 
grounds that the advertising ban violates a constitutional 
guarantee of free speech they complained that while tobacco 
remains a legal product it will soon be illegal to talk about it 
commercially 
whether the challenge comes from a magazine editor an outdoor 
advertising firm a retail chain a manufacturer or all the above 
is hard to say right now said jacques lariviere spokesman for 
the canadian tobacco manufacturers council the industry employs 
60000 canadians 
lariviere said the disclosure of cigarette additives involves 
proprietary rights like the recipe for cocacola and he 
worried that the new laws could provide impetus to those south of 
the border who wish to remove the tobacco industry from the face of 
the earth 
michel bedard president of the industrysupported smokers 
freedom society guessed that smokers will ignore the new 
healthhazard warnings 
you get the list of contents on a box of corn flakes but 
nobody really pays attention to it said bedard 
as for the ad ban he noted that 140 million times a day someone 
in canada lights a cigarette and thats an advertisement in 
itself 
the ban could actually hurt the public if a safer filter is 
developed but manufacturers are unable to tell anyone about it he 
said

the partially deaf boy whose 
identity puzzled authorities for months until his mother arrived to 
claim him was just one of hundreds of waifs who fill the streets of 
this border city 
and more and more of these young beggars are finding their way 
across the rio grande into el paso texas where law enforcement 
officials discussed the issue at tuesdays city council meeting 
sometimes authorities in juarez take the street urchins to the 
integrated family development center the federal childwelfare 
agency for medical care and education 
thats what happened to jose de jesus garcia aguilera who was 
known as sabath before he was reunited tuesday with his mother 
after eight months apart 
but hundreds of other mexican children remain abused or 
abandoned and little can be done because there is not enough money 
in the financially strapped country said olivia espinosa bermudez 
director of the integrated family development office in juarez 
the agency known by its spanish acronym as dif can take care 
of about 80 children at its shelter in central juarez mrs 
bermudez said wednesday its filled nearly to capacity 
i know there are more but we cannot afford to pay the 
necessary attention to them she said we just cannot handle 
more than that 
dif tries to find childrens parents and in cases where they 
are unfit it tries to find foster parents it also runs a school 
provides medical care and encourages the older children to enroll 
in technical school 
downtown juarez and the international bridges are full of young 
panhandlers some barely old enough to walk older children 
sometimes play in pathetic makeshift brass bands to attract donors 
attention teenagers with squeegees wash windshields for pocket 
change 
some adult beggars rent children for 1 a day to elicit more 
sympathy from passersby deputy border patrol chief gus de la vina 
told the el paso council meeting 
el paso police chief john scagno told the council that his 
officers rounded up 27 beggars on saturday he said all of them 
were from mexico and all were back on el pasos streets the next 
day 
mrs bermudez said some of the youngsters picked up are runaways 
who dont want to go home 
thats apparently not the case with 9yarold jesus whose 
mother micaela aguilera de garcia of the gulf coast port of 
tampico arrived tuesday in juarez to claim her boy jesus 
nicknamed chuy seemed eager to go home 
chuy ran away last october and was picked up nov 7 near 
downtown juarez for months authorities on both sides of the 
border tried to find out the boys identity and origins the task 
was frustrating because chuy can speak only a few words and 
communicates mostly through gestures and pictures 
no one knows why chuy chose to run away to juarez but many 
people emigrate to the city of 11 million because of the relative 
wealth of northern mexico and the lure of jobs in the united 
states mrs bermudez said 
she said dif and the texas department of human services signed a 
pact last february in which each side pledged to help the other in 
cases where parents and children become separated across the border 
dif officials plan to visit the home of ms aguilera where she 
lives in a oneroom house with her mother and four other children 
mrs bermudez said then they will report about the conditions to 
their superiors in ciudad victoria capital of tamaulipas state 
chuy might attend a difrun school in victoria where he could 
learn to speak and use sign language she said

the transportation department broadened its 
proposed drug testing requirements wednesday to include more than 
350000 workers in the mass transit merchant marine and pipeline 
industries 
the action follows earlier announcements of proposed regulations 
that would require a variety of drug tests for workers in 
safetyrelated jobs in aviation interstate bus and trucking and 
the railroads 
none of the regulations has been put into effect and some 
already are under court challenge 
transportation secretary jim burnley said the testing 
requirements for mass transit workers merchant seamen and 
employees of companies that transport natural gas or hazardous 
liquids through pipelines comports with his goal of discouraging 
drug abuse in all sectors 
it is crucial that we send a zero tolerance message to all 
segments of our population regarding drug abuse the 
transportation industry included burnley said in a statement 
the new proposed regulation as the previous ones involving 
aviation trucking and the railroads calls for a variety of drug 
tests including random tests for employees involved in 
safetyrelated jobs 
the transportation department estimates about 108000 workers 
including vehicle operators and maintenance workers would be 
subject to the requirements covering mass transit systems such as 
city bus and subway lines 
another 132000 seamen on commercial vessels and an estimated 
116500 employees of companies that operate pipeline facilities for 
natural gas and hazardous liquids would be covered by the 
regulation the department said 
under the proposed rule the us coast guard would require the 
owners of commercial ships to conduct the testing program if the 
tests are not required the coast guard could lift the marine 
operators license the department said 
pipeline operators who also could lose their license also 
would be responsible for testing their employees under the 
regulation 
local transit officials could lose federal transit subsidies 
under the regulation unless they conduct the required testing 
programs

democractic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis got his first formal union endorsement on wednesday from a 
group that represents mostly federal internal revenue service and 
customs service workers 
the 59000member national treasury employees union said its 
endorsement of the certain democratic nominee was based on his 
commitment to beef up support for the customs services drug 
interdiction programs and revenue agencies such as the irs as a way 
to reduce the federal deficit 
the reagan administration has been long on empty words and 
false perceptions but very very short on good deeds said the 
unions president robert tobias 
it proposed reductions of funds to support customs service 
drug interdiction by 23 percent and whacked drug education 
expenditures by 36 percent tobia said 
the reaganbush romance with noriega was the capper he 
said referring to panamanian strongman manuel noriega who was 
indicted by a federal grand jury in florida on drug smuggling 
charges 
tobias also praised what he called dukakis commitment to 
collective bargaining as evidenced by his relations with 
massachusetts state employees over the past decade 
the only other union to formally endorse a presidential 
candidate so far is the 23000member blackdominated national 
union of hospital and health care employees it endorsed civil 
rights leader jesse jackson early in the primary campaign 
the treasury employees and hospital employees unions are not 
affiliated with the 14million member aflcio which has put off a 
formal endorsement until after the republican national convention 
in august

a sixblock area in a middleclass 
neighborhood is off limits after 10 pm to children under 16 as 
the city tries to keep young people away from drug dealers and 
other criminals 
police chief tommy moffett said the area is a no 1 hangout 
for drug users and peddlers of stolen property we have seen some 
gang activity and juveniles are being recruited by drug pushers 
we need to separate the youths from that element he said 
officials said the emergency 10 pm curfew approved 
unanimously by city council on tuesday will continue until sept 
30 for the rest of biloxi a southern missippi city of 49000 
people on the gulf of mexico the curfew for those under 16 is 1 
am to 5 am 
the curfew area is a wellkept neighborhood of modest homes with 
several nightclubs and a park officials said street corners open 
lots and parking lots have become gathering places for criminals 
who hide in the crowds of young people at night 
the police chief said young people idolize the criminals and 
drug pushers in the area and they have helped criminals escape 
from police officers are less aggressive because of the presence 
of young people he said 
officials said it will be easier for police to fight the citys 
drug and crime problems with the youths off the street 
city councilman william stallworth said he proposed the curfew 
after pleas from residents without juvenile shields criminals 
will be forced out of the neighborhood he said 
if you can break up the hub then everything disperses he

the supreme court decision upholding the 
validity of independent counsels clears the way for the sentencing 
of former white house aide michael k deaver for lying under oath 
about his lobbying business 
the trial judge in deavers case had stayed further proceedings 
in the case after a federal appellate court in washington struck 
down the constitutionality of the independent counsel law last 
january 
but the supreme courts decision wednesday removes an important 
element of deavers challenge to his prosecution though his 
lawyers say they have other issues to raise when they appeal the 
conviction 
the decision also means that former white house political 
director lyn nofziger will have to rely on other issues to appeal 
his conviction and 90day sentence for illegally lobbying former 
reagan administration colleagues 
and the decision dispels any doubt about the legal authority of 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh to prosecute former white 
house aide oliver l north and other defendants on charges stemming 
from the irancontra arms and money affair 
the independent counsel statute provides a workable solution 
to a difficult problem walsh who had accepted a backup 
appointment said in a statement we are gratified that the 
supreme court has upheld the constitutionality of that statute 
the prosecutor in deavers case independent counsel whitney 
north seymour said in a brief statement wednesday that he would 
ask us district judge thomas penfield jackson to reschedule the 
sentencing at an early date so the deaver case can then move on 
through the appeal to its final conclusion 
seymour who declined to accept a parallel appointment from the 
justice department to blunt the effect of contitutional challenges 
to the statute called the high courts decision a major victory 
for the public interest 
deaver could receive a fiveyear sentence for each of three 
felony convictions of lying to a grand jury and the house energy 
and commerce investigations subcommittee about the lobbying 
business he formed after leaving president reagans staff in 1985 
deaver was found guilty of lying when he denied or said he 
couldnt recall lobbying former administration colleagues on behalf 
of private clients 
when questions about the propriety of his lobbying business were 
raised in 1986 deaver requested the appointment of an independent 
counsel to investigate the allegations in the hopes of clearing his 
name 
his lawyers later tried to stop his indictment on the perjury 
charges by challenging seymours constitutional and legal authority 
to prosecute the case 
randall j turk one of deavers lawyers said the conviction 
could have been overturned had the law been struck down but he 
said the defense still had other avenues to pursue 
we have a number of issues still pending before the trial 
court and if we dont prevail there we plan to pursue an appeal 
turk said 
deavers lawyers have asked jackson to set aside the verdict on 
the ground that the judge made improper rulings and gave erroneous 
jury instructions 
e lawrence barcella who defended nofziger also contended that 
the independent counsel decision is not a big setback for his 
client 
while we dont agree with the opinion it doesnt 
significantly affect our challenge to the charges that were lodged 
against mr nofziger barcella said 
our challenge has always been focused on the postemployement 
sections of the ethics in government act the vagueness of that 
statute and the application of the facts to that statute 
barcella said 
nofziger was convicted earlier this year of three counts of 
violating the law by lobbying former reagan administration 
colleagues including thenwhite house counselor edwin meese iii 
within a year of leaving the presidents staff 
he has been allowed to remain free pending appeal to the us 
circuit court of appeals in washington which is scheduled to hear 
arguments in november 
had the high court struck down the statute however nofzigers 
conviction might have been put in jeopardy some of the evidence 
independent counsel james c mckay used to convict nofziger was 
obtained before mckay accepted a dual appointment from the justice 
department last year 
mckay meanwhile is investigating meese to determine whether he 
used his government office for financial gain 
the high courts ruling also revives the long dormant 
investigation of independent counsel alexia morrison to investigate 
allegations that former assistant attorney general theodore b 
olson obstructed a congressional investigation of the superfund 
scandal at the environmental protection agency 
olson and two other former highranking justice department 
officials had challenged morrisons power to subpoena them their 
efforts to resist the subpoenas led to the supreme court ruling 
wednesday 
obviously we are very pleased with the opinion and 
particularly at the fact that it was reached nearly unanimously by 
the court morrison said

delegates to a national communist party conference 
split openly wednesday over the pace of economic change and the 
medias new independence under mikhail s gorbachev 
they also ordered an investigation into a report that some of 
the delegates in attendance have taken bribes 
gorbachev broke in at one point to denounce attempts by any 
one group of people to monopolize the nations press as other 
delegates lashed out at publications including ogonyok magazine 
which has been one of the most daring advocates of the kremlins 
campaign for glasnost or openness 
the 5000 delegates to the partys first national conference in 
47 years watched a rare spectacle in this longclosed society 
speakers at an official gathering daring to disagree 
although closed to all but the official media soviet television 
viewers and newspaper readers got a taste of the proceedings from 
various published and broadcast reports on the second day of the 
openended forum 
gorbachev opened the conference in the kremlin on tuesday 
proposing to revamp the soviet political system by indirect 
election of a more powerful president convening of a fulltime 
legislature and shifting authority from local communist party 
bureaucracies to local government councils he also pressed for a 
quick return to family farming to spur food production and end 
chronic shortages 
delegates themselves and published or broadcast reports 
wednesday indicated the conferences second day was marked by 
contradictory assessments of the fruits of gorbachevs drive for 
perestroika or social and economic restructuring 
i cant really make a resume yet about whats for real and 
whats not said daniel granin a soviet author and conference 
delegate from leningrad so far its a real muddle its a 
complete mess 
the press became a target with critics suggesting there has 
been too much openness 
gorbachev who was sitting on the dais in the kremlin hall 
interrupted mikhail ulyanov to add his thoughts to those of the 
head of the russian federations theater workers union who 
observed the soviet media are no longer servile but a force to be 
reckoned with 
in the past gorbachev said there was a monopoly on the mass 
media by one group of people and we know what this has brought 
about now we see another group acting very gradually wants to 
use the press as a national rostrum we want the pluralism of views 
therefore it is necessary to create conditions for the 
expression of various viewpoints 
his comments drew stormy applause in the giant hall and yuri a 
sklyarov of the partys central committee propaganda department 
said other delegates had criticized ogonyok and its editor 
conference delegate vitaly korotich as well as other contemorary 
soviet journals exploring the frontiers of glasnost 
fv popov party chief in the siberian altai region called his 
fellow delegates attention to the latest issue of ogonyok which 
accused some uzbek delegates of involvement in corruption 
in an article detailing an investigation of widespread 
corruption in the asian republic ogonyok said several 
bribetakers had been elected to represent uzbekhistan at the 
conference 
theres nothing about it in the report of the credentials 
committee but its in korotichs ogonyok popov said of the 
corruption reports the credentials committee certified all the 
delegates elected to the conference 
popovs remarks were televised during the evening news program 
vremya 
popov demanded an investigation into the accusation and 
korotich said gorbachev directed that a inquiry begin thursday 
uzbek party boss rafik n nishanov who spoke at a news conference 
said a decision from the credentials commission was expected by 
thursday 
vladimir karpov head of the writers union complained that some 
writers are depicting soviet history totally in black an 
apparent reference to recent publication of a barrage of exposes 
criticizing the late dictator josef stalin and other former soviet 
leaders 
karpovs deputy yuri bondarev charged that nihilistic 
criticism was becoming a commanding force in the press 
the immorality of the press cannot teach morality he said 
delegate grigory baklanov chief editor of the literary magazine 
znamya told a late evening news conference he regarded the 
comments by the two writers union leaders a disgrace 
i felt shame for them as a writer baklanov said i dont 
think their speeches were proper it was a disgrace and if im 
given the floor ill certainly say what i think 
on tuesday leonid abalkin head of the soviet academy of 
sciences economics institute and a top adviser to gorbachev told 
the conference the soviet economy is not making headway because it 
still measures its progress by the number of items it produces 
rather than their quality 
but georgy arbatov head of the institute of the usa and 
canada and a member of the policymaking central committee said he 
totally disagreed with abalkin and that the soviet union had 
made great progress in creating the political spiritual and 
moral preconditions for the economic reform 
ya smirnov the manager of a chemical factory in the ural 
mountain city of nizhnitagilsk complained that he so far had heard 
nothing that would help him improve the work of his factory 
addressing abalkin in an interview on soviet tv smirnov said 
you are the economic institute you should map this strategy 
abalkin said its necessary but did say how to do it 
on tuesday delegates adopted a rule making speakers hew to the 
conferences agenda after an official from the moscow party v 
belyaninov was hounded from the stage by delegates derisive 
clapping the news agency tass said the rule prevents delegates 
from wasting time by reporting on their own activities or 
congratulating the chamber for its conduct of the debate

prime minister noboru takeshita has decided to push 
for tax reform putting his 8monthold job on the line on an issue 
that his two predecessors were unable to tackle 
the plan already has drawn substantial opposition in an unusual 
display of protest some japanese motorists have pasted bumper 
stickers on their cars that say we oppose the valueadded tax 
an editorial in the nationwide newspaper asahi shimbun urged 
takeshita to submit the plan to a national referendum and should 
such efforts fail then the obvious step would be to dissolve the 
lower house and call a general election 
previous attempts at tax reform have met with little success 
the late prime minister masayoshi ohira unsuccessfully tried to 
introduce a general excise tax in 1979 and failed 
takeshitas predecessor yasuhiro nakasone tried to push a 5 
percent sales tax through the legislature last year and suffered an 
embarrassing setback when he had to withdraw it 
later in local elections nakasones governing liberal 
democratic party suffered severe losses over the sales tax issue 
the general feeling is that takeshitas political career is 
riding on the outcome of his tax plan 
prime minister takeshita said that he will put his 
political life on this said a foreign ministry spokesman who 
demanded anonymity this could be rather dangerous 
the diet or japanese parliament has agreed to return from its 
summer recess to take up the issue in an extraordinary 120day 
session beginning july 11 
in a statement to the nation takeshita said tuesday that the 
current tax system relies too heavily on direct taxes especially 
taxes derived from salary increases as a result as you already 
know there has been a growing sentiment among salaried workers 
that the tax system is too heavy and unfair 
some japanese oppose the current system because it relies almost 
entirely on direct taxes and provides substantial tax breaks for 
certain groups such as politicians and doctors 
as japanese incomes have risen so has their tax burden to the 
point where many japanese have resorted to tax evasion 
the national tax agency reported on june 23 that tax evasion had 
reached a record high the agency said it uncovered unreported 
revenues totaling 518 million in fiscal 1987 up 29 million over 
the previous record set in 1985 
however critics say takeshitas plan is flawed and leaves too 
many loopholes without providing enough relief to middleincome 
families 
according to a study by the shimouma consumers cooperative 
association a tokyo consumers group the new tax plan means that a 
typical fourmember household with an annual income of 50750 
would save less than 775 a year under the liberal democratic 
partys tax reform 
the association said the typical family would pay 1250 less in 
income and property taxes but a new 3 percent sales tax would cost 
an additional 475 
small businesses oppose the plan saying there is no guarantee 
they can pass on increased costs to consumers consumers have 
objected saying there is no guarantee prices wont rise 
substantially 
takeshitas plan calls for reducing the current 12 tax brackets 
with tax rates ranging from 105 percent to 60 percent to five 
brackets with rates ranging from 10 to 50 percent property taxes 
also would be reduced 
although tax revenues would drop at first they are expected to 
rise as the economy continues to expand boosted in part by 
takeshitas pledge to turn japan away from its exportdriven 
economy and increase domestic demand

activists on the left and the right vied for 
the preconvention spotlight wednesday warning the democrats and 
likely republican presidential nominee george bush not to take them 
for granted 
the rev jerry falwell contended bushs advisers are pressing 
him to refrain from mentioning controversial issues such as 
reproductive rights and homosexuality 
at the other end of the political spectrum representatives from 
the national organization for women and the fund for a feminist 
majority said the democrats should not assume the gender gap 
frees them of responsibility in promoting womens causes and female 
candidates 
falwell called homosexuality a perverted lifestyle and when 
asked if he would urge bush to make the same statement he said 
i would recommend that everyone tell the truth and thats what 
it is its a perverted lifestyle 
the tv evangelist joined other conservatives in announcing 
family forum 88 to be held before both the democratic and 
republican national conventions this summer 
meanwhile feminists and people for the american way announced 
opposing convention plans to highlight liberal views 
falwell himself a strong bush supporter said it is 
important for george bush to pick up the mantle of support for 
conservative social issues that endeared president reagan to the 
right but he said a vanguard of experts and advisers is trying 
to keep george bush from doing what he needs to do 
he said the bush campaign cannot rest assured that the religious 
right will have nowhere else to go other than the republican 
ticket 
we can go fishing he told a news conference if theyre 
not enthusiastic they dont vote he said of religious 
conservatives 
falwell said he is confident bush is committed to the agenda of 
conservative family issues that helped elect reagan but addedhe 
needs to be saying that openly and often 
falwell said that in talking to evangelical leaders he has 
sensed a deep and unanimous concern that the republican party 
this time is offering little more than the democratic party 
eleanor smeal of the fund for a feminist majority and now 
president molly yard saved most of their fire for the republicans 
whose platform hearings smeal will address this week 
smeal said the gender gap in which polls show women voting more 
democratic in the reagan years and providing the margin of victory 
in some congressional races is becoming a gender gulf 
still despite the gops comparative backwardness in issues 
such as comparable worth equal rights amendment reproductive 
choice employment equity and party decisionmaking said yard 
its perfectly possible for the democrats to throw away their 
advantage we will do our bst to make both parties realize that the 
gender gap is there to be used 
meanwhile people for the american way a liberal lobby group 
founded by tv producer norman lear plans to be on hand at both the 
republican and democratic conventions this summer to counter the 
efforts of the right to influence the parties said the groups 
president arthur kropp

the house passed the last of its 13 annual 
appropriations bills on wednesday the earliest that feat has been 
accomplished in 28 years 
hell has indeed frozen over quipped rep silvio conte of 
massachusetts senior republican on the house appropriations 
committee 
after the house overwhelmingly approved its last two money bills 
covering transportation and interior programs house speaker jim 
wright halted deliberations to hail a historically significant 
occasion 
the last time the house approved all of its spending bills 
before june 30 was in 1960 when the new fiscal year began july 1 
this years bills are for fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 
this years process has been immensely easier than in recent 
years because of last falls deficitreduction agreement between 
president reagan and congressional leaders that pact decided in 
advance next years overall spending levels for military foreign 
aid and domestic agency programs 
we have kept the total of appropriations bills below the 
presidents requests although we made rearrangements of priorities 
of the various bills to continue essential domestic programs 
said rep jamie l whitten dmiss the chairman of the 
appropriations committee who received a round of applause 
because of the houses changes in spending plans some of which 
the white house contends are too costly there are veto threats 
hanging over several of the bills 
but even if just one of the regular spending bills is eventually 
signed by the president the record will be better than in the last 
two years 
for last year and the current fiscal year all of the 
governments spending authority has been wrapped into huge 
catchall money bills the president has promised never again to 
sign one of those omnibus measures and many in congress vowed 
never to vote for one again 
the senate has approved its version of four spending bills the 
house and senate have reached agreement on one of those and it 
could be sent to the white house in the next few days

election in the heavily democratic district 
i think i offer new ideas and especially important the energy 
to put those ideas to work kennedy said appearing slightly 
nervous before the television cameras as he filed his candidacy 
papers 
skeffington said he was surprised that a kennedy would decide to 
begin his political career by challenging a member of his own party 
i did not think they would come in running against an 
incumbent democrat holding office skeffington said i dont 
think theyve ever done that before with the exception of patrick 
kennedys father running for president 
skeffington in an interview stressed his familys ties to the 
working to middleclass mount pleasant neighborhood where his 
grandfather established the family funeral home 75 years ago 
im 50 years old my roots are here im not going anywhere

before in the march presidential primary he spent 12000 and won 
more votes than any other delegate for massachusetts gov michael

the government announced proposals wednesday to 
liberalize britains sweeping secrecy laws by decriminalizing 
trivial leaks and giving journalists more legal protection 
another key clause would confine secrecy mainly to defense 
intelligence and foreign affairs 
the opposition labor party denounced the proposals as 
draconian and unacceptable they also were criticized by 
proponents of freedom of information and by at least one tory 
legislator 
home secretary douglas hurd said the conservative government 
long accused of being obsessed with secrecy aimed to clip the 
wings of any possible abuse of the criminal law by the executive 
this should dispel any notion that the criminal law is being 
used to protect information simply because its disclosure would 
embarrass the government hurd told the house of commons 
however the reforms would reinforce the lifetime gag on 
intelligence agents and make them automatically liable for criminal 
prosecution for any disclosure 
hurd said the move was the most radical plan yet to reform the 
official secrets act which makes it a criminal offense to reveal 
any official information however trivial without formal 
authorization 
the act passed hastily during a 1911 german spy scare has 
helped give britain a reputation as the most secretive of the 
western democracies 
the new proposals restricted secrecy to six categories defense 
security and intelligence international relations information 
obtained in confidence from other governments information useful 
to criminals and information about bugging telephone surveilance 
and the reading of mail 
however officials would face internal disciplinary measures for 
disclosing confidential material such as cabinet documents 
from a freedom of information point of view this is dismal 
said des wilson chairman of the campaign for freedom of 
information pressure group 
this gives no greater access to information it simply narrows 
the number of categories in which disclosure is a criminal 
offense 
prime minister margaret thatcher has ruled out a usstyle 
freedom of information act 
the proposals outlined in a policy document presented to 
parliament followed a series of secrecyrelated controversies 
these included a 1986 police raid on british broadcasting corp 
studios to seize tapes of a documentary about a spy satellite and 
the governments losing twoyear court battle to ban publication of 
spycatcher the memoirs of retired intelligence officer peter 
wright 
under the new proposals wright who lives in australia could 
be pursued with the same vigor and be charged if he returned to 
britain 
the proposals also stipulated that people charged under the 
official secrets act cannot plead in their defense that the leak 
was in the public interest commonly known as whistleblowing or 
that the material had been already published elsewhere 
in 1985 a jury acquitted clive ponting a former senior civil 
servant on grounds that his exposure of a goverment coverup of 
facts surrounding the sinking of an argentine cruiser in the 1982 
falkland islands war was in the public interest 
i would probably have been found guilty under these new 
proposals ponting commented wednesday 
however the proposals offer journalists a new protection by 
shifting to the prosecution the onus of proving that a disclosure 
gravely harmed national interests 
courts alone and not government ministers would be able to 
rule on what is secret 
richard shepherd a tory legislator whose more liberal reform 
bill was defeated last january on mrs thatchers instructions 
called the government proposals repressive 
but analysts said a parliamentary revolt by tory dissidents who 
backed the shepherd bill appeared to have helped liberalize the 
government proposals 
two major previous attempts at reform in 1971 and 1979 
foundered largely on criticisms they did not go far enough 
newspaper editors said the new proposals were less restrictive 
than anticipated but complained that publication of secret 
material in the public interest or because it had already been 
published elsewhere should be legitimate defenses 
we believe they the defenses would have helped avert 
nonsenses such as we have recently had to endure in the guise of 
protecting official secrets said james bishop chairman of the 
association of british editors 
several prestigious national newspapers are fighting 
prosecutions for publishing material from or about spycatcher 
wrights book banned from sale in britain has been a bestseller 
worldwide

good samaritan hospital in los angeles anderson spokesman david 
smallen said the congressman was expected to return home to san

heart attack 
smallen said the surgery on anderson who had no history of 
heart problems was elective and routine he said the 
lawmaker had planned to have the procedure performed during the 
congressional recess in august but moved up the date after 
learning that his surgeon would be taking a long vacation beginning 
later this week 
anderson probably will miss the democratic national convention 
in atlanta next month smallen said which he was scheduled to 
attend as a delegate for the likely candidate massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis he is expected to return to washington after the 
convention 
anderson has been in congress for 20 years known as a quiet

governor of california from 1959 to 1967 and a member of the state 
assembly from 1943 to 1951 he began his political career when he 
became mayor of hawthorne calif in 1941

authorities used phony lab reports to 
help get a confession from a man in the rape and murder of his 
5yearold niece and the mans lawyer is seeking a special 
investigation 
the prosecutor defended the action 
i would not encourage these unusual investigative tactics 
except in very rare circumstances lee county state attorney 
joseph dallesando said tuesday we believe it was better to use 
whatever tactic was legal than to see this atrocious crime go 
unavenged 
here theyre manufacturing evidence that isnt true were 
talking about fundamental fairness said the mans attorney 
deputy public defender robert jacobs 
jacobs has asked gov bob martinez to appoint a special 
prosecutor to find out if the prosecutors used the fake memos or 
paul david caywards alleged confession when arguing their case 
before the grand jury if so jacobs said he will ask that the 
charges be dismissed a hearing on the request is set for friday 
paris massey was found dead in her bed on dec 19 1987 her 
uncle of fort myers allegedly confessed in april after he was 
shown fake lab reports linking him to the crime 
on may 3 a grand jury indicted cayward on charges of 
firstdegree murder and sexual battery of a child both capital 
crimes he has pleaded innocent and is being held in the lee county 
jail awaiting trial sept 12 
dalessandro said at a news conference that his investigators 
drafted one fake lab report while cape coral police drafted 
another 
the state attorneys fake report used the letterhead and logo of 
lifecodes corp a new york lab hired to analyze dna evidence in 
the case 
the april 7 report said a dna print taken from blood and 
semen found in the childs underwear matched a genetic print found 
in a hair sample taken from cayward it said the probability that 
the genetic match was incorrect was one in 12 million 
the actual lifecodes report dated april 12 concluded that 
investigators didnt send them enough physical evidence to make a 
dna print ronald dorazio a lifecodes vice president said the 
company did not authorize the fake letter 
if the idea of using a bogus report is acceptable they ought 
to make up a fictitious company he said they shouldnt use 
our logo 
cape coral police drafted their fake report under the letterhead 
of the florida department of law enforcement without authorization 
it said said a hair sample taken from cayward matched one found in 
the girls underwear 
fdles actual reports did not find any hair samples that matched

a federal judge ruled wednesday that the us 
government does not have legal authority to close the palestine 
liberation organizations observer mission to the united nations 
the justice department maintained that last years 
antiterrorism act which branded the plo a terrorist group 
empowered the government to close the plos un mission 
but us district judge edmund palmieri found that the act does 
not supersede us obligations to the 1947 agreement that brought 
un headquarters to new york 
in a 37page opinion palmieri wrote that the language of the 
usun headquarters agreement as well as longstanding practice 
leave no doubt that it places an obligation upon the united 
states to refrain from impairing the function of the plo observer 
mission 
palmieri dismissed the governments lawsuit with prejudice 
meaning it cannot be brought again although his ruling could be 
appealed to a higher court 
us attorney rudolph giuliani who argued the governments case 
before palmieri earlier this month said he and the justice 
department were studying the ruling and we will make a decision 
as to further proceedings as soon as possible 
the head of the plo mission in new york hailed the decision as a 
victory for international law 
the united nations now has no fear that the host country or 
any host country can violate its legal obligations and get out 
scotfree zehdi labib terzi permanent observer of the plo told 
the associated press 
lawyers for the plo including former us attorney general 
ramsey clark had argued that closing the mission would violate 
international law because the headquarters agreement called for 
arbitration of disputes between the united states and the united 
nations 
they maintained that palmieri lacked jurisdiction and should 
defer to an advisory opinion from the international court of 
justice which said the united states was bound to submit to 
arbitration 
but palmieri rejected those arguments for two reasons first he 
said us courts are not empowered to order the executive branch 
of government to submit to international arbitration on a question 
of foreign policy and secondly only us courts are empowered to 
interpret us laws 
however the judge noted that the language and legislative 
history of the antiterrorism act which branded the plo a 
terrorist group do not indicate congress meant to abandon the 
countrys obligations under the headquarters agreement 
we are therefore constrained to interpret the ata as failing 
to supersede the headquarters agreement and inapplicable to the 
mission wrote palmieri 
the justice department had filed suit in march seeking to close 
the plo mission citing the antiterrorism act passed by congress 
and reluctantly signed by president reagan last year 
the law which took effect march 21 labeled the plo and its 
affiliates a terrorist organization and a threat to interests of 
the united states 
the law barred the plo from operating its un mission or any 
other office in the united states and also barred the plo from 
funding any activities in this country to further its aims

the womans national democratic club born in 
1922 of the suffrage movement voted wednesday to grant its male 
members the right to vote 
outgoing club president jean r jensen said it was ironic that 
men now seek full membership in clubs founded to give women a say 
in what once was the male world of politics 
perhaps it is a measure of our success that womens clubs are 
being asked to include men she said 
club members agreed by voice vote and without dissent to give 
men full membership status the organization has nearly 2000 
members of whom 85 are men who as associate members could 
participate in all ways except that they could not head committees 
become officers or vote 
ms jensen said that while the men have enjoyed the business 
and networking opportunities that come with socializing and 
participating in activities at the clubs stately mansion they 
have been slow to volunteer to work on projects and committees 
well have to work on the men to get them more involved she 
said 
the clubs decision to grant men full membership status comes on 
the heels of votes by washingtons exclusive metropolitan and 
cosmos clubs to end their menonly policies 
in addition the supreme court this month upheld a new york city 
law that bars discimination against women and minorities by large 
private clubs where business deals often are arranged 
ms jensen said the decision of the womans club to admit men 
was unrelated and had been approved by the organizations 
governing board in april as part of a yearlong project to revise 
the clubs bylaws 
john f banzhaf iii a law professor at george washington 
university who had filed discrimination complaints against the 
cosmos metropolitan and democratic womans clubs welcomed the 
latest vote saying theyre falling like 10pins 
he said that while he was less concerned about the potential 
discriminatory impact of womenonly clubs than about menonly 
organizations youve got to have sauce for the goose and sauce 
for the gander 
the womans clubs activities include sponsoring trips 
seminars conferences speaker luncheons and dinners providing 
volunteers for various democratic campaigns and developing position 
papers on issues

government weather forecasters offered scant 
cheer to droughtplagued areas wednesday issuing a series of 
forecasts that call for more of the same at least for the next 
month 
its likely to get worse before it gets better said dr 
michael hudlow director of hydrology for the national weather 
service 
the overall outlook calls for little change in the weather for 
the next week or two hot dry weather will continue but shift its 
emphasis eastward and southward over the next one to three months 
said dr donald l gilman head of the agencys long range 
predictions group 
the lone bit of good news if it comes in time was a chance of 
abovenormal moisture in some western sections of the great plains 
sometime in the next 90 days 
unfortunately reliable predictions of the droughts end its 
geographic spread or changes in severity cannot be made today 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration cautioned in a 
statement issued at a news briefing 
highaltitude jet stream winds that normally sweep across the 
northern tier of states have split to the north and south gilman 
said holding the drought conditions in place between them 
the 6to10day outlook is very close to holding stationary 
the pattern of the last few weeks gilman said 
in that short time span the outlook calls for muchabovenormal 
temperatures in montana wyoming the dakotas nebraska wisconsin 
and iowa 
in addition abovenormal readings are expected in much of the 
rest of the nation except the columbia river valley west texas and 
along the atlantic coast from north carolina through georgia and 
northern florida 
in the short range the rain forecast is patchy said 
gilman he said no precipitation is likely in oregon california 
nevada southern idaho western utah western arizona and texas 
there is a chance of some scattered moisture from the gulf of 
mexico causing rain here and there in the midwest but only kansas 
south carolina and georgia seem likely to have more rain than 
normal for the period 
turning to the 30day forecast for july abovenormal heat is 
expected throughout most of the northern plains and upper midwest 
gilman said while the outlook for rain is very uncertain 
the greatest chance of hot weather is in illinois indiana 
ohio kentucky and tennessee gilman said he gave that region a 65 
percent chance of being hotter than normal for july an unusually 
high ranking for a summer forecast outlooks for 30 days normally 
carry only a 55 percent probability 
in addition july has a chance of warmerthannormal weather 
from pennsylvania west through the great lakes states to montana 
south to oklahoma and arkansas and east to the appalachian 
mountains 
the rest of the country should expect nearnormal readings in 
july except the puget sound region where is it expected to be 
cooler than normal 
the outlook for rain in july shows belownormal readings 
expected for california michigan illinois indiana ohio and 
kentucky abovenormal precipitation is expected only in puget 
sound and along the arizonanew mexico border 
other regions are likely to be close to normal gilman said but 
the belownormal region could expand back into the plains 
gilman said that if it were earlier in the year he would have 
predicted a larger dry area but there may be breaks in the jet 
stream which could allow some rain to move north from the gulf of 
mexico 
the weather service also issued a 90day forecast for july 
august and september 
that outlook anticipates abovenormal temperatures along the 
pacific coast in southern arizona and in iowa missouri arkansas 
louisiana illinois indiana ohio pennsylvania west virginia 
kentucky tennessee virginia maryland delaware the carolinas 
mississippi alabama georgia and florida 
belownormal temperatures are expected in idaho montana 
wyoming colorado utah and new mexico with nearnormal readings 
elsewhere 
the threemonth rain outlook is for belownormal amounts in 
california maryland virginia the carolinas georgia and parts of 
west virginia tennessee and kentucky 
the lone bit of good news may be the chance of abovenormal 
precipitation for montana wyoming southern south dakota 
nebraska kansas colorado new mexico west texas and western 
oklahoma over the 90 days 
for the rest of the nation the chances are too close to call 
over such a long period gilman said

mary susan greve known as sister mary cecelia was walking with 
two nuns on a street in a catskill mountains town sunday when her 
father and her three brothers pushed her into a car and took her 
away

a cincinnati suburb 
the rev michael a farano chancellor of the roman catholic 
archdiocese of albany ny said the st joseph novitiate convent

return to the convent 
a sisterinlaw gina greve said the convents spiritual 
adviser the rev clarence kelly has forbidden mary susan greve 
from seeing or talking to family members 
he said they cannot let her go back to her family because we 
would be an evil influence and jeopardize her vocation she said

hope the parents come to their senses leave her be and let her 
live her own life 
john greve said he and two brothers dave and mark and his 
parents james and susan greve participated in the most recent

prices farmers got for raw products in june 
rose 37 percent from may a droughtspurred jump that carried the 
overall index up 69 percent from a year ago the agriculture 
department said wednesday 
the departments agricultural statistics board said in its 
preliminary report that higher prices for soybeans corn and wheat 
contributed most to the june increase lower prices for cattle and 
peaches partly offset the rise in other commodities 
most grain prices moved up sharply in june reflecting the 
widespread drought the report said the average soybean price 
was at the highest level since may of 1977 and the fifth highest on 
record corn and wheat also moved up sharply to the highest levels 
since august of 1985 and may of 1984 respectively 
according to the preliminary june figures based mostly on 
midmonth averages the index for crop prices was up 10 percent 
from may and averaged 18 percent more than a year ago 
the livestock price index dropped 26 percent from may and 
averaged 13 percent below the yearago level 
as a commodity group prices of feed grains and hay in great 
demand for livestock in the stricken drought areas rose 20 
percent from may to june averaging 40 percent above a year ago 
prices of food grains mostly wheat but also including rice 
rose 14 percent during the month and averaged 14 percent higher 
than in may the june index was up 49 percent from june 1987 all 
of the mayjune rise was due to higher wheat prices while rice 
prices declined during the month 
the index of prices for oilbearing crops which mostly involves 
soybeans jumped 19 percent from its may average and was 48 percent 
more than in june 1987 preliminary figures showed soybean prices 
averaged 856 per bushel up 157 from may 
lower prices for cattle and calves were mostly responsible for 
the june decline in the livestock price index prices of beef 
cattle generally fell to an average of 6520 per hundredweight 
in june from 6930 in may calf prices dropped 670 to 8670 in 
june 
many farmers and ranchers have been forced by drought to send 
cattle to slaughter or to feedlots as pastures and and ranges 
continue to burn up that has put extra animals on the market and 
depressed prices 
the price index for poultry and eggs collectively rose 75 
percent from may to june and averaged 11 percent more than a year 
ago 
besides the decline in livestock prices the fruit index dropped 
67 percent from may and averaged 71 percent lower than in june 
1987 prices for peaches grapefruit oranges and strawberries 
were lower than the previous month the report said 
although the projections are subject to review as more is known 
about 1988 crop and livestock production usda economists say now 
that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 53 billion 
to 59 billion this year down from the record level of 56 billion 
in 1987 that is the difference between cash receipts and cash 
expenses during the calendar year 
consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent 
this year compared with a 42 percent average increase in 1987 
before the drought took hold usda was predicting a 1988 food price 
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent no forecast has been made by the 
department for 1989 
no new figures for farm production costs were included in the 
report those have been confined to quarterly averages because of 
budget cutbacks 
in april however farm expenses were up 18 percent from 
january and averaged 37 percent above a year earlier the april 
figures were carried forward into june with the next revision 
scheduled in july 
the report said

the supreme court in a decision that may 
signal an end to capital punishment for young killers overturned 
an oklahoma mans death sentence wednesday 
four of the eight justices who voted in the case said the death 
penalty for convicted murderers who committed their crimes before 
reaching age 16 always amounts to unlawfully cruel and unusual 
punishment 
three justices said the constitution imposes no such age 
limitation on imposing capital punishment 
in her controlling vote justice sandra day oconnor voiced 
serious doubts whether states may execute people for crimes 
committed when only 15 
although i believe that a national consensus forbidding the 
execution of any person for a crime committed before the age of 16 
very likely does exist i am reluctant to adopt this conclusion as 
a matter of constitutional law without better evidence than we now 
possess oconnor said 
but she supplied a fifth vote to overturn oklahoma death row 
inmates william wayne thompsons death sentence ruling that the 
states death penalty law could not be applied to him because the 
law has no minimum age 
there is a considerable risk that the oklahoma legislature 
either did not realize that its actions would have the effect of 
rendering 15yearold defendants deatheligible or did not give the 
question serious consideration oconnor said 
she added that thompson and others who committed their crimes 
before age 16 may not be executed under the authority of a 
capital punishment statute that specifies no minimum age at which 
the commission of a capital crime can lead to the offenders 
execution 
but wednesdays ruling left unclear whether oconnor would vote 
to strike down a death penalty law that explicitly made 15yearold 
murderers eligible for execution 
the decision also left unclear whether the court would find 
fault with death penalty laws in which convicted killers who were 
16 or 17 when they committed their crimes are eligible for 
execution 
as a practical matter 15 year olds wil not be executed in 
this country predicted paul l hoffman a los angeles lawyer who 
represented amnesty international in urging the justices to abolish 
capital punishment for juveniles 
justice oconnor walked right up to the edge of saying that 
hoffman said 
in oklahoma assistant attorney general david lee said the 
line has been drawn in my opinion our reading of the opinion is 
that the court used 16 as the line 
if hoffman and lee are correct the decision will affect only 
about 30 of the some 2100 death row inmates nationwide 
of the 100 men and women executed in us prisons since the 
supreme court in 1976 allowed states to resume capital punishment 
three died for murders committed when they were 17 
charles rumbaugh was executed in texas in 1985 james terry 
roach in south carolina in 1986 and jay pinkerton in texas in 1986 
since 1948 no one has been executed in this country for a crime 
committed when he or she was younger than 17 
of the 37 states with death penalty laws 19 of them do not 
specify a minimum age of the 18 state laws that do impose a 
minimum age none of them allows execution of killers younger than 
16 when they committed their crimes 
thirteen states and the district of columbia do not allow 
capital punishment 
justices john paul stevens william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and harry a blackmun voted to ban the death penalty for 
any crime committed by someone not yet 16 
writing for the four stevens said imposing death to such 
criminals is nothing more than the purposeless and needless 
imposition of pain and suffering and thus an unconstitutional 
punishment 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
and byron r white voted to let thompson die writing for the 
three scalia said he found thompsons age inadequate grounds for 
reversal of his sentence 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court after 
thompsons case was argued did not participate in the case 
thompson now 20 was one of four people convicted in the jan 
29 1983 death in grady county okla of charles keene his 
former brotherinlaw 
all four including thompsons older brother were sentenced to 
death thompson was the only juvenile 
police said keene was beaten stabbed shot and thrown into a 
river

archbishop marcel lefebvre ordained 16 
priests wednesday the day before a consecration of four bishops 
that will automatically expel the rebel traditionalist from the 
roman catholic church 
he urged the new priests to fight the cancer of liberalism 
in the church which the 82yearold archbishop says has been 
infiltrated by wolves and thieves 
organizers estimated the ceremony attracted at least 7000 
people to a rolling meadow in front of lefebvres seminary in this 
swiss hamlet 
sympathizers came from all over western europe many in buses 
more than 1000 cars were parked around the huge tent which also 
will be the scene of thursdays consecration 
lefebvre says bishops must be consecrated so his traditionalist 
movement will continue after he dies church law provides automatic 
excommunication of those involved if bishops are consecrated 
without papal approval 
pope john paul ii said tuesday he was very saddened by 
lefebvres breaking the unity of the church and taking with him 
a large number of followers into schism 
vatican officials said a performance of beethovens missa 
solemnis scheduled for thursday evening in the paul vi auditorium 
was canceled because of the deep pain felt by the church over 
the lefebvre affair 
the last major schism or split in the church occurred when the 
socalled old catholics broke with rome in 1870 after the first 
vatican council proclaimed the doctrine of papal infallibility 
repeated pleas by the pontiff have failed to impress the french 
archbishop who has said excommunication is without value and 
ignored previous vatican sanctions 
before wednesdays ceremony he had ordained more than 220 
traditionalist priests since pope paul vi suspended him from 
priestly functions in 1976 the vatican considers all the 
ordinations illegal 
most of the 16 new priests are french graduates of the seminary 
of lefebvres st pius x fraternity which he founded 18 years ago 
in econe and named for the pope who condemned modernism in a 1907 
encyclical 
also among the new priests were west german italian spanish 
australian and british nationals and an american james h doran 
25 son of an automotive designer in detroit 
lefebvres rebellion began with the second vatican council of 
196265 whose liberal reforms included modernizing the liturgy he 
continued celebrating mass in latin using the 16th century 
tridentine rite and dismissed the bastard rites in the 
vernacular that took its place 
he speaks of the satanic influence of liberalism in the 
church preaches against neomodernist and neoprotestant 
tendencies and proclaims our future is the past 
in his homily wednesday lefebvre did not refer directly to the 
impending excommunication but repeated his argument that he is not 
the one causing schism 
he who breaks with tradition breaks with the church 
lefebvre told the new priests and urged them to fight the cancer 
of liberalism he says has been spreading since the second vatican 
council 
they will suffer persecution he added but whatever you 
may be told you will remain catholic 
antonio de castro mayer of campos brazil who is 84 and the 
only bishop to support lefebvre publicly assisted him at the 
ceremony 
among the spectators were nuns in white dominican monks in 
yellow robes and 50 supporters of lefebvre from gabon dressed in 
african garb and mingling with the crowd lefebvre was a missionary 
in gabon for 13 years and later was named archbishop of dakar 
senegal 
about a dozen people questioned at random said the vatican 
warnings left them unshaken in their loyalty to lefebvre view 
history will prove that he is right said mark simmons a 
29yearold london accountiong clerk who was among about 200 
british sympathizers 
some supporters said they expect an eventual settlement with the 
vatican 
sooner or later rome will recognize the fruits of monsignor 
lefebvres work said doran the american ordained 
speculation about a new lastminute appeal from the pope stirred 
when a priest arrived in the official car of the vatican ambassador 
to switzerland but would not say why he had come 
edoardo rovida the ambassador was reached by telephone at his 
office in bern and asked whether his aide brought a letter from the 
pope there are always letters to be brought he replied and 
refused to elaborate

the united states and israel agreed wednesday 
to work together on the development of a new tactical missile 
designed to shoot down arab ballistic rockets which could be fired 
at israeli population centers 
israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin called the arrow project 
a response to pushbutton warfare in which arab foes were 
relying on soviet and chinese rockets to try pierce israeli 
defenses 
he said the missile should be ready for testing in two to three 
years with a decision on production depending on the results 
the agreement was signed at a pentagon ceremony by maj gen 
david ivry director general of the israeli defense ministry and 
lt gen james abrahamson who is in charge of the us strategic 
defense initiative 
israel is collaborating with the united states in the search for 
a spacebased defense against soviet ballistic missiles the 
program known popularly as star wars anticipates using kinetic 
energy lasers and other sophisticated technology to destroy the 
rockets before they could reach their us targets 
rabin stressed in a speech at the national press club that 
israels objectives were much more limited he said if the arrow 
proved effective in the tests the missile might be used as a 
defensive weapon at shortrange 
the israeli official said israel had to find a way to cope with 
the new missiles the soviets had supplied to syria and the chinese 
to saudi arabia he said the syrian missiles could reach almost 
every target in israel 
for the arabs who have fought six major wars with israel since 
1948 the rockets offer a chance to accomplish what arab armies and 
air forces could not achieve rabin said 
defense secretary frank c carlucci at a separate news 
conference said the arrow would make a contribution to our sdi 
program and have application as well in other areas 
he said the joint project fits in very well with our concept 
of deterrence based on defense 
secretary of state george p shultz who appeared with carlucci 
at the windup of separate talks with australian officials said 
if you happen to be sitting in israel with shorterrange 
ballistic missiles around you that are very hard to defend against 
you feel very strongly the importance of learning how to defend 
yoursevles against them 
a pentagon statement said 80 percent of the cost would be borne 
by the united states and 20 percent by israel 
the signing followed a statement of concern tuesday by president 
reagan after a meeting at the white house with rabin the president 
said he was troubled by ominous new military developments in 
the area 
rabin during two days of talks here has stressed soviet 
deliveries of new missiles to syria and libya and chinese 
shipments to saudi arabia 
if the united states could not persuade china and saudi 
arabia i doubt israel would be able to persuade the soviet 
union to refrain from the deliveries rabin said 
israel has had a series of diplomatic meetings recently with 
soviet officials that indicate a warming by moscow to the jewish 
state with which it broke relations in 1967 
on another subject rabin criticized american television 
networks and other media for giving much less coverage to missile 
attacks by iran and iraq on each others cities and other war 
atrocitiies than to the beatings of palestinian arabs on the west 
bank 
rabin said he was used to having a doublestandard applied 
to israel but he believed the networks should have devoted more 
than a few minutes to what he said was the slaying of 5000 kurds 
by iraq with chemical weapons 
state department spokesman charles e redman said shultz had no 
plans to visit the middle east in july the possibility of such a 
trip was raised when michael h armacost undersecretary of state 
for political affairs told reporters in israel he discussed the 
issue with israeli leaders

a test case has shown that a government 
takeover can restore some democracy to a corrupt teamsters local 
but the battle is far from over the locals courtappointed 
trustee said wednesday 
and labor observers stressed that the experience of teamsters 
local 560 in union city does not mean the justice department will 
be able to meet the far more ambitious goal it announced tuesday 
wresting control from the unions international leaders 
the success of a government takeover could depend on how much 
power a judge grants to a trustee said herman benson director of 
the brooklyn nybased association for union democracy a 
nonpartisan union rights group 
to eliminate union corruption you have to have massive 
government interaction said benson 
us attorney rudolph giuliani in new york filed suit tuesday 
describing the teamsters as dominated by the mafia seeking to have 
a federal judge remove from office any union officials who violated 
racketeering laws and appoint a trustee to supervise free elections 
in 1984 us district judge harold a ackerman ruled that a 
takeover of local 560 was necessary because of a quartercentury of 
brutal organized crime domination at the hands of the provenzano 
family ackerman appointed a trustee to clean up the local and 
bring on free elections 
it was the first time a union had been placed under government 
control 
benson points to recent improvements in allowing the 8500 
members of local 560 a voice in their union he said the changes 
have come under stewardship of edwin steir a former federal 
prosecutor on the job about a year 
i see enormous change since ive gotten here said steir 
citing discussion of past corruption among the rank and file 
people say things theyve never said before he said 
however theres still fear here and theres a lot of 
uncertainty about how to assert dissenting views he said 
attorney harvey weissbard who represents local 560s last 
president michael sciarra said giulianis office is going to face 
some highpowered legal talent and the prospect of lengthy 
appeals which could also bog down the process 
sciarra dismissed tuesdays lawsuit as a politically motivated 
unionbusting move that signaled a dark day for labor sciarra 
has the support of a large and vocal group of local 560 members 
about 2000 people appeared at a recent rally for him 
two candidates have emerged to oppose sciarra who rose to power 
under the deposed leadership 
weissbard said he plans to file a motion later this week to 
overturn ackermans 1984 decision based on a recent supreme court 
ruling a group of 260 truckers who joined the union after 1984 
have also sued to end the trusteeship 
the trustee took over local 560 in 1986 after an appeals courts 
upheld ackerman but only in recent months have forces organized to 
oppose the former allies of jailed expresident anthony tony 
pro provenzano who authorities say is a captain in the genovese 
crime family 
he has been linked to the unsolved disappearance of national 
teamsters leader jimmy hoffa in 1975 
steir says he has had trouble building democracy because of a 
tradition of suppression of dissent that made fear and cynicism his 
main enemies 
benson said the very size of the international union could be an 
asset in allowing more open discussion among the rank and file 
the international at least is not one monolithic block of 
crooks he said 
on the other hand said labor law expert michael goldberg a 
university of pittsburgh law school associate professor a trustee 
of the international will have to contend with thousands of local 
leaders who may not cooperate 
new york university law professor james jacobs pointed out that 
the function of a local and the international are different and it 
is difficult to draw conclusions from local 560s experience 
there youre really running a union at the grass roots he 
said in the internationals case youre talking about an 
overarching management of the whole administration 
whether local 560 has been freed from the taint of organized 
crime is still an open question 
federal prosecutors earlier this year questioned sciarra and 
former vice president joseph sheridan at a deposition where they 
sought to find out whether reputed genovese crime family captain 
matthew matty the horse ianniello influenced union decisions 
on a tape of a secretly recorded conversation in 1984 ianniello 
is heard saying to a local 560 official i think mike sciarra 
should take over there

a shock said tom walsh 33 a neighbor of wangs father stephen 
sr a taiwanborn engineer and stepmother pat who still live in 
the house where wang his brother and two sisters grew up 
wangs parents have an unlisted telephone number and could not 
be reached wednesday but an account in the wall street journal on 
wednesday quoted his father as saying his son remains hopeful hell 
be cleared of wrongdoing

the us government seems content with the 
dollars sharp rise which could have the paradoxical effect of 
shrinking the trade deficit in the months leading up to the 
november elections 
even though the dollars strength of a few years ago helped gut 
american manufacturing the reagan administration seems to believe 
that the recent rise in the dollar is no cause for alarm and could 
even be helpful 
in spite of its recent rise the dollar remains far below its 
peak of early 1985 
for now treasury secretary james a baker iii may have 
concluded that although there are dangers from a stronger dollar 
they are less fearsome than the dangers of a weaker dollar 
if the dollar weakened the united states would have to raise 
interest rates sharply to keep foreigners interested in owning 
dollar securities and a big rise in interest rates could squelch 
the 6yearold economic expansion 
with the dollar strengthening the united states has more 
latitude to set policy economists said 
it gives them a bit more room of maneuvering said shafiqul 
islam senior fellow for finance at the council on foreign 
relations in new york 
as a side benefit a currency rise might make the trade deficit 
smaller over the next several months because it takes fewer dollars 
to buy a given volume of imports and a given volume of exports 
brings in more dollars 
eventually a stronger dollar would worsen the deficit because 
the lower dollar price of imports would cause americans to buy more 
of them while foreigners would decide american products had become 
too expensive and switch away from them 
a strong dollar gives a new perspective to americas trading 
partners which have gotten used to thinking of the us currency 
as an invalid in recent years 
the world economy is unusually healthy in spite of forecasts of 
doom after last octobers worldwide stock market crash it is so 
healthy that central bankers are concerned their economies may 
overheat and they have been slowly nudging interest rates higher 
the strength of the dollar has made it easier for central banks 
in europe and japan to raise their rates which is a politically 
difficult decision because it tends to suppress economic growth 
in turn the increase of interest rates overseas gives the us 
federal reserve some room to raise interest rates here modestly as 
antiinflation medicine 
the united states cannot raise rates too much for fear of 
causing the dollar to shoot too high but it does not want to 
increase rates much anyway because toohigh rates could choke off 
the economys growth 
the dollars strength is coming at an opportune time said 
lawrence leuzzi an economist for sg warburg amp co in new york 
at the treasury department baker is a close ally of vice 
president george bush the allbutcertain republican nominee for 
president baker may believe a modest rise in the dollar could 
dampen inflation without causing the monthly trade deficits to 
balloon 
if you can go into the election with a strong economy a 
falling deficit and a strong dollar thats a good combination 
islam said 
the federal reserve is politically independent of the reagan 
administration but fed chairman alan greenspan also seems to have 
concluded the dollars rise is at least tolerable 
the fed and the treasury have taken only small steps to control 
the rise of the dollar which has shot up since june 14 the day 
the commerce department announced a big improvement in the trade 
deficit 
eventually the federal reserve and other central banks will 
decide the dollars rise has gone far enough and take steps to 
knock it back down 
the us of course doesnt want to see the benefits of the 
decline of the dollar against the major currencies given up so i 
would imagine there would come a point where you would see more 
forceful intervention said irwin kellner chief economist of 
manufacturers hanover trust co

leading defense contractors contributed more 
than twothirds of the honoraria received by members of the house 
and senate committees responsible for defenserelated legislation 
a liberal lobby organization said wednesday 
common cause said its review of public finance statements showed 
northrop corp paid the most in honoraria for speeches by members 
of congress seventyeight percent of the 64902 paid by northrop 
went to members of the defense committees it said 
the top 50 defense contracters as determined by 1986 pentagon 
contracts gave a total of 521310 to members of the house and 
senate armed services committees and appropriations subcommittees 
on defense common cause said 
in all members of congress got 737744 from the top defense 
contractors in 1987 the group reported 
common cause president fred wertheimer said the contractors 
have been paying substantial fees to key members of congress who 
control defense decisions to buy their influence not their 
oratory 
common cause has long been active in fighting special interest 
money in politics contending that honoraria and campaign 
contributions allow for too much influence by such interests 
an associated press review found that last year 37 of the 101 
members who serve on the four military committees received 137100 
from defense contractors that have been publicly linked to the 
current investigation in the pentagon procurement case 
that was part of the millions of dollars that those defense 
contractors poured into the pockets and campaign accounts of the 
committee members over the past several years the ap review found 
lawmakers are permitted to take honoraria for speaking 
engagements but senators are limited to a total of 35800 a year 
and house members to 26850 a year 
the defenserelated committees do not award contracts that is 
the pentagons purview but they are responsible for appropriating 
money to build weapons systems

all employers would be required to offer 
medical insurance to their workers under a bill introduced 
wednesday by rep fortney h stark who said the measure would 
move us a long way toward universal health insurance 
the employee health benefit act is similar to a minimum health 
bill awaiting senate floor action 
there are about 37 million americans without health care 
coverage and twothirds of them have jobs or are dependents of 
people with jobs in 1985 hospitals provided 74 billion in 
charity care 
the bill from stark chairman of the house ways and means health 
subcommittee would require employers to offer coverage of the same 
services as medicare plus maternal and child health benefits it 
would set up state risk pools to keep costs reasonable and put a 
cap on the cost of group insurance purchased by small employers 
its enactment would move us a long way towards the target of 
assuring every americans basic right to highquality health 
services stark dcalif said in a floor statement submitted 
for the record 
the senate labor and human resources committee in february 
approved a similar bill sponsored by its chairman sen edward 
kennedy dmass but it is unclear when or if the full senate will 
consider it during this congress the same bill is pending in the 
house energy and commerce committee 
expanded health care coverage is expected to be a priority in 
the next congress starting in january

the government remained silent about 
washingtons anger over the release of a puerto rican separatist 
but local editorials wednesday praised the decision as an example 
of national sovereignty 
the mexican government denied the extradition of william 
morales and that is a decision that merits all the support of the 
citizenry because it strengthens national sovereignty against 
external pressures the leftist newspaper uno mas uno or one 
plus one wrote 
morales 37 is wanted in the united states for terrorist 
activities 
the daily la jornada a competing leftist paper wrote that the 
united states tried to magnify a diplomaticpolitical matter 
whose limits are clearly defined and has taken the case of the 
patriot william morales as a new pretext for confrontation with 
mexico 
the editorial said that course can be risky for both 
countries especially because of the time and space in which the 
conflict is introduced 
both newspapers have followed the morales case closely la 
jornada broke the story earlier in june that the foreign ministry 
decided to grant political asylum to morales who was in a mexican 
prison at the time 
last friday morales was released after serving five years of an 
eightyear sentence for murder and allowed to fly to cuba the 
cuban government has not made any statement about his presence on 
that caribbean island 
as a sign of its displeasure washington recalled ambassador 
charles j pilliod jr from mexico city for consultations 
this decision is an inexplicable affront to otherwise 
excellent usmexican relations and a great blow to us and 
mexican efforts to combat the scourge of international terrorism 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday 
pilliod last week wrote to la jornada objecting to its editorial 
praise for the foreign ministrys decision and its description of 
us policy on puerto rico as colonialism 
mr william morales was tried found guilty and sentenced by 
state and federal courts in new york on the charges of possession 
of explosives homemade bombs and dynamite pilliod wrote 
it concerns us very much that an individual with his criminal 
record and who is a convicted criminal in both countries might be 
considered worthy of the status of a political refugee he added 
a us embassy spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
said tuesday that mexico waited five days before informing the 
united states of morales release 
the newspaper excelsior which generally reflects government 
positions said washingtons announcement that it was recalling 
pilliod was accompanied by the reagan administrations typical 
language which doesnt bode well 
in a frontpage column excelsior said the news produced a 
silence in all the countrys political circles and now the 
inevitable response that this announcement provoked must be 
awaited above all in these times on the eve of presidential 
elections 
general elections are scheduled for july 6 with unusually 
strong competition facing the institutional revolutionary party 
that has governed mexico since 1929 
morales was sentenced to more than 100 years in prison in new 
york but escaped from us custody in 1979 he fled to mexico 
where in 1983 he was convicted in the killing of a police officer 
and for entering the country illegally 
tensions about the morales case come at a time when both 
governments have been emphasizing cooperation the most recent 
meeting between presidents reagan and miguel de la madrid in 
february in the pacific coastal resort of mazatlan even minimized 
the longstanding disputes over drug trafficking 
us officials at the state department are making no secret of 
their dislike for foreign minister bernardo sepulveda whose 
department issued the decision on morales political asylum 
the resolution signed by sepulveda granting asylum said morales 
who was badly disfigured in an explosion at a clandestine bomb 
factory in new york did not arrive at producing harm to society 
or any individuals in particular escept those he inflicted upon 
himself 
in one of morales last interviews before leaving mexico he 
told the associated press by telephone from the northern 
penitentiary in mexico city that the governments decision was a 
political recognition of our fight for independence 
he said he would not return to puerto rico because political 
persecution continues over there but i can say that the mexican 
governments decision reflects a very latin american position 
puerto rico is a commonwealth of the united states whose 
residents have american citizenship but cannot vote in us 
presidential elections some puerto rican nationalist groups 
advocate independence for the island but are split over whether to 
use violence to attain their goal

a concern about spreading aids through donated 
blood along with an improvement in surgical techniques has led a 
national institutes of health panel to recommend to doctors that 
blood transfusions be kept to a minimum and that traditional 
uses of blood be reevaluated 
the chances of contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
from donated blood is still considered miniscule said tibor 
greenwalt a university of cincinnati researcher and chairman of 
the nih committee but he warned wednesday that blood transfusions 
do carry documented risks of infection and immune changes 
he and other committee members issued a report that recommended 
doctors reevaluate their use of blood transfusions during surgery 
and use their clinical judgment instead of a traditional 
formula to decide when transfusions are needed 
blood transfusions were once believed to be relatively safe 
but more recently many physicians and patients have come to regard 
them as potentially dangerous the report said 
the fear of aids has already caused a decreased usage of 
blood greenwalt told reporters in my community it is down by 
7 percent 
but he said the transfusion of donated blood the socalled 
homologous transfusion remains a therapeutic mainstay that 
continues to save thousands of lives particularly during the 
emergency treatment of wounds and other injuries 
despite a call for caution the committee report said that the 
chances contracting aids is only a remote hazard because of donor 
selection and laboratory screening procedures it is variously 
estimated that the risk of aids transmission by transfusion 
is 1 to 40000 to 1 to 1 million 
but the report warned that level of risk is unlikely to be 
appreciably decreased in the foreseeable future even if additional 
screening tests are added 
patients receiving blood transfusions are more likely to 
contract hepatitis with the risks rated as low as 1 in 100 for 
some types of this viral disease the committee report said 
greenwalt said the risks of disease increase with each 
additional unit of donated blood used by a patient and as a 
result the use of such blood should be kept to a minimum 
the committee said doctors should reexamine a basic surgical 
tenent called the 1030 rule that has been in use for decades 
the rule applies to the findings of blood tests given routinely 
to patients before surgery the first number refers to the numbers 
of hemoglobin or red oxygencarrying cells in the blood the 
second number is the hematocrit a measure of the percentage of 
cells in the blood low counts such as 1030 indicate anemia and 
lead surgeons to give transfusions routinely before surgery 
but the committee said the available evidence does not support 
the necessity for the 1030 rule it recommended that doctors 
instead make specific clinical evaluations of each patient and to 
use as little transfusion blood as is appropriate 
improved surgical procedures along with a better understanding 
of anemia the report said shows that patients with lower 
readings if otherwise healthy can do well in surgery without 
transfusions 
greenwalt said the committee also recommended that where 
possible patients should be given their own blood during surgery 
this can be done in two ways prior to surgery patients can 
give blood that is stored and then reinfused when needed or blood 
from a sterile surgical wound can be collected processed and 
returned to the patient using equipment now on the market 
your own blood is always the safest to get greenwalt

the pilot of an airbus a320 jetliner 
that crashed during an air show told investigators wednesday the 
jets instrumentation indicated he was flying at a safe altitude 
despite claims he flew too low 
three people were killed and 50 people were injured in the crash 
of the new model jet sunday 
state prosecutor jean volff said michel hasseline and his 
copilot pierre mazieres told police investigators the 
instruments on board the plane indicated an altitude of 100 feet 
above the ground at the time of passing over the aerodrome 
volff told reporters preliminary investigations indicated the 
jet passed at 30 feet altitude which is completely outside the 
technical norms when it is carrying passengers 
according to volff hasseline told investigators he realized his 
altitude when his attention was captured by a hightension power 
line over the forest 
the pilot also repeated wednesday that the engines responded 
late to emergency efforts to gain altitude volff said 
at the time of the accident bernard labalette an amateur pilot 
who was among the 1000 spectators at the air show told reporters 
the a320 was about 65 feet above the ground just before it 
clipped some trees and crashed in a forest at the end of the runway 
transport ministry officials said the flight recorder on the jet 
indicated that hasseline a veteran pilot was flying at only 30 
feet at the time of the crash they said that was too low to be 
safe 
hasseline was quoted in the french press monday as telling a 
rescuer he wanted to increase the power but the aircraft did not 
respond 
volff said no criminal charges will be brought against the pilot 
and copilot pending outcome of the investigation 
transport ministry officials in paris defended the reliability 
of the new sophisticated jet 
ministry officials told reporters monday no evidence emerged 
from the preliminary accident investigation to justify removing the 
plane from service 
british airways and air france each of which has two of the 
completely computerized new jets suspended flying the a320s for 
one day after the accident but resumed service following the 
ministry statement 
the aircraft leasing company gatxcl air of the united states 
announced wednesday it had ordered 10 of the a320s from the 
european consortium airbus industrie which makes the plane 
airbus spent nearly 2 billion over four years developing its 
new competitor in the lucrative international commercial air market 
the order was the first to be announced since the crash

the palestine liberation organizations 
ambassador to the un hailed as a victory for international law a 
federal court ruling issued wednesday that permits the plo to keep 
its mission in new york 
the united nations now has no fear that the host country or 
any host country can violate its legal obligations and get out 
scotfree zehdi labib terzi told the associated press 
us district judge edmund palmieri ruled that the 
antiterrorism act passed by congress does not supersede us 
obligations under its 1947 headquarters agreement with the united 
nations 
palmieri also said the language and legislative history of the 
antiterrorism act which branded the plo a terrorist group do not 
indicate congress meant to abandon americas obligations under the 
headquarters agreement with the united nations 
the us mission to the united nations said it would have no 
comment on the ruling 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he was 
gratified by this judgment which demonstrates the respect of the 
us courts for the international obligations of the country 
terzi said the ruling is a great relief because to add insult 
to injury by the united states and have those injuries coming from 
the judiciary would be very damaging 
but now that the judiciary has come out with an opinion 
which is supportive of international legal minds including the 
international court of justice we are satisfied 
in april the international court of justice at the hague 
commonly known as the world court decreed that the united states 
is obligated under the 1947 headquarters agreement to submit the 
dispute to arbitration 
the court has no enforcement power over its rulings 
dr clovis maksoud the arab leagues permanent observer to the 
united nations said we welcome the decision of the judge we 
consider it to show the integrity of the judicial system 
the judgment goes to show respect for the headquarters 
agreement and we consider this to be a victory for the united 
states judicial system over the recklessness of the israeli lobby 
and their unquestioning supporters said maksoud in a telephone 
interview from washington 
we welcome this decision and believe that this will facilitate 
the work of the un general assembly he said it shows 
judicial respect for united states treaty obligations and the 
healthy independence of the judiciary

president reagan plunged into the 1988 white house 
campaign on wednesday attacking michael dukakis as a liberal bent 
on wornout policies of tax raises and runaway government 
spending 
should we expect that if the democrats allbutcertain 
presidential candidate is elected that he would raise taxes in 
fact he just did reagan said mocking the recent cigarette tax 
dukakis signed in an effort to head off a state budget deficit 
dukakis told of reagans remarks told reporters with all 
due respect i think the presidents confused 
he defended his own economic record contrasting it with that of 
the administration 
the next president will inherit a fiscal mess i think we all 
know thatand one of my jobs as president of the united states 
will be to straighten out this mess said dukakis 
reagan in an address prepared for a florida gop fundraising 
event in support of rep connie mack iiis senate bid fired his 
harshest barrage yet at vice president george bushs likely 
opponent the speech marked his first political foray outside the 
capital this campaign season 
the president said of dukakis not only has he hiked taxes as 
governor of massachusetts but in the last five years he has 
increased massachusetts state spending at double the rate of 
federal spending 
dukakis has spent every dime and more of the revenue generated 
in his state by the reaganbush recovery reagan said so yes 
the man expected to head up the democratic ticket is a true 
liberal who instead of controlling government spending raises 
taxes 
the dukakis campaign was quick to fire back 
there he goes again said campaign spokesman mark gearan 
the fact of the matter is that the massachusetts budget will be 
balanced and that tough choices on spending have been made 
something that we have seen nothing of during the past eight 
years 
this administration has piled up more red ink than the 
presidencies of george washington to jimmy carter combined 
gearan said michael dukakis has balanced nine and soon to be 10 
budgets a track record that should be the envy of this 
administration 
reagan appeared to relish his role as a surrogate for bush in 
addition to his clear effort to debunk the massachussets 
miracle of economic recovery dukakis has touted the president 
also seemed intent on raising the taxhike issue which helped foil 
walter mondales bid for the white house in 1984 
hitting at critics who have attacked his own record on federal 
deficits which reached record levels during his administration 
reagan asserted that when liberals talk about reducing the deficit 
its just a code word for boosting taxes and once they raise 
taxes they raise spending even more 
the president boasted about the nations robust economy and 
said what the 1988 elections are all about is whether we 
continue to build on that progress and move ahead to an even 
brighter future or whether we hesitate and return to those wornout 
policies that bring high taxes lowgrowth and a loss of direction 
and purpose 
reagan also lashed out at another prominent democrat and 
favorite target massachusetts sen edward kennedy charging that 
the senators health care proposals amount to disguised taxes on 
corporations 
sen kennedy has tried for years to pass an exorbitantly 
expensive program of socialized medicine reagan charged adding 
it hasnt happened so he is proposing and the expected 
democratic nominee has endorsed this plan that the government 
pass a law requiring private companies to directly pay for a 
federally mandated health insurance program 
what is euphemistically called governmentcorporate 
partnership is just government coercion political favoritism 
collectivist industrial policy and oldfashioned federal 
boondoggles nicely wrapped up in a bright colored ribbon and it 
doesnt work reagan said 
yes soaring prices and a sinking economy thats what the 
other fellows with all their lip service about compassion have 
inflicted and have in store for the american people reagan 
asserted 
reagan who met privately with a group of some 30 
cubanamericans before his address also tried to reassure them 
that his administration was not warming up to fidel castro terming 
cuba an inhuman communist dungeon 
although reagans support has been strong in the cubanamerican 
community here some leaders have argued that he is softening his 
anticastro stand by negotiating with cuba on immigration human 
rights and the issue of cuban troops in angola 
there is an unbridgeable gulf between the governments of the 
united states and cuba it is the gulf between freedom and 
tyranny reagan said 
in his address reagan also offered a renewed plea for aid to 
the contra rebels in nicaragua 
connie mack and i stand with the nicaraguan resistance we 
will not rest until we have won for them the full support they need 
and until they have won for themselves the genuine democracy and 
freedom for which they have so bravely struggled 
en route to miami aboard air force one reagan spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said the white house has no package prepared for 
congressional consideration on renewing aid to the rebels 
were waiting for secretary of state george shultz to 
return fitzwater said shultz left wednesday on a threeday 
swing through costa rica el salvador guatemala and honduras on a 
trip billed by the administration as an attempt to reinforce us 
support for the central american democracies 
reagans appearance in florida put him in the middle of a 
republican primary fight mack the conservative thirdterm 
congressman is seeking the seat of retiring democratic sen lawton

liberal members questioned the practice 
of automatically approving communist party choices for the 
parliament leadership prompting unusually spirited debate in 
wednesdays session 
a scheduled report by the head of the foreign relations 
committee was postponed at a time of conflict between the two 
soviet bloc allies over romanias treatment of its ethnic hungarian 
minority 
on tuesday romania closed the hungarian consulate in the 
transylvanian city of clujnapoca and ordered its staff out of the 
country 
foreign minister peter varkonyi said he would have no comment 
until later in the week 
the parliament expected to discuss economic reform and make 
significant changes in the government began meeting for the first 
time wednesday under new premier karoly grosz he led a new 
generation of communist leaders into power during a national party 
conference last month 
parliament members elected bruno f straub 74 as the nations 
president a largely ceremonial post straub the first president 
who is not a party member was nominated the partys central 
committee last week 
istvan stadinger party candidate for speaker was voted in 
after zoltan kiraly one of the most liberal legislators started a 
debate by saying there should be more than one candidate 
kiraly was expelled from the party in april apparently for his 
associations with independent reformers he proposed that a 
parliamentary group of party and nonparty members discuss the 
quesion multiple nominations 
another deputy csaba csangradi said votes by secret ballot 
were not enough and the practice of democracy requires 
alternatives 
he proposed the mayor of budapest pal ivanyi as an alternate 
candidate for speaker but other deputies objected because ivanyi is 
not a parliament member 
two legislators who were proposed as alternative candidates 
declined peter horn and istvan gajdos apparently feared they would 
be disciplined by the party 
kiraly suggested the fall session discuss the issue the debate 
ended when with only 17 negative votes and 16 abstentions the 
members decided to vote on standiger and the deputy speaker as 
planned with a secret ballot 
standiger was elected by a vote of 222 in favor and an unusually 
high 129 against with three abstentions 
the membership also approved the appointment of leading reformer 
imre pozsgay to the newly created office of minister of state 
pozsgay said one of his main goals would be to build cooperation 
and confidence between the government and legislature

the carbomb killing of a us defense 
attache here has again focused attention on greeces elusive 
terrorist group november 17 
the leftwing group has claimed responsibility for 12 political 
assassinations in 13 years including those of three american 
diplomats not one of its members has ever been arrested 
in a country where there is little violent crime november 17 
has gained notoriety for its bold attacks some in daylight in the 
center of athens 
besides us diplomats and servicemen its targets have included 
four greek police officers a conservative newspaper publisher and 
two prominent industrialists 
the conservative opposition has claimed that premier andreas 
papandreous panhellenic socialist movement pasok has link with 
terrorists making the government reluctant to crack down on local 
extremists 
the suspicion that pasok members relations with terrorists of 
every kind prevent the state from taking action is constantly being 
reinforced said the conservative new democracy party after 
november 17 claimed responsibility for killing greek industrialist 
alexandros athanassides in march 
us navy capt william e nordeen 51 died tuesday when a 
parked car containing more than 88 pounds of high explosives blew 
up next to his armorplated vehicle near his home in athens 
kifissia suburb 
police said the bomb was set off by a remotecontrol device and 
called it the most sophisticated attack yet staged by november 17 
as is its custom the group took responsibility in a lengthy 
statement sent to a leftwing athens daily a senior police 
officer speaking on condition of anonymity said the statement was 
hammered out on the same typewriter used for previous proclamations 
by the group 
the statement called for greece to pull out of the north 
atlantic treaty organization and shut down four us military bases 
here it said it would keep targeting americans until the last 
american soldier leaves greece 
november 17 is named for the date in 1973 that the rightwing 
military dictatorship then in power crushed a student rebellion at 
athens polytechnic university 
the organizations antiamerican profile reflects a belief still 
held by many greeks that us tolerance of the military regime 
enabled it to stay in power from 196774 
greeks also blame the united states for failing to prevent the 
1974 turkish invasion of cyprus after a coup there inspired by the 
athens junta 
speculation has been widespread among conservative politicans 
and newspapers that november 17 may have links with socialists who 
belonged to the panhellenic liberation movement 
papandreou founded panhellenic liberation a resistance 
organization when he was living in exile in sweden during military 
rule in greece he returned to greece in 1974 several of the 
resistance groups members including high ranking officials in the 
present government reportedly trained in palestinian camps in the 
early 1970s 
in the past the papandreou government has been sharply 
criticized by the united states for being lax in fighting 
terrorism but greece is now anxious to shake that image and 
deputy premier agamemnon koutsogiorgas on tuesday pledged tough 
and unrelenting measures against terrorist activity 
it is not known whether november 17 has any links with foreign 
terror groups but in the past police have speculated the group 
might have had contacts with italys red brigade and the frances 
direct action 
tuesdays carbomb attack triggered speculation among western 
diplomats that the group had been in touch with international 
terror groups skilled in such techniques november 17 used to 
specialize in attacks by gunmen on motorbikes using a 45 caliber 
pistol in their attacks 
athens cia station chief richard welch in 1975 and us navy 
capt george tsantes in 1983 were killed with the same 45 weapon 
according to police ballistics experts 
in the past senior greek police officers said they had a 
fingerhold on members of november 17 
but the closest they seem to have come was the october 1986 
discovery of a cache of weapons in the home of leftwinger michael 
prekas prekas was killed in a shootout with police and the 
investigation apparently reached another dead end

a judge fined the citadel 1000 
wednesday for violating a gag order during the trial of an injured 
football players 165 million suit against the military college 
circuit judge john hamilton smith ruled the college had 
willfully disobeyed the gag order he issued in march requiring that 
parties to the suit make no purposeful dissemination of 
information about the case 
meanwhile bill holthouser the former linebacker coach at the 
military school denied in testimony wednesday he pressured the 
injured student marc buoniconti to play against east tennessee 
state during the 1985 season 
buoniconti the son of former miami dolphins star nick 
buoniconti was the starting middle linebacker for the citadel when 
he suffered a broken neck while making a tackle in that game he 
was left a quadriplegic 
citadel public relations director ben legare admitted he was 
aware of the gag order when he approached the news and courier and 
suggested the charleston newspaper run a previously published 
column about the case 
the column by a miami sportswriter was syndicated by the knight 
ridder newspaper chain and appeared in the june 19 edition of the 
columbia state 
i had no input into the creation of that story legare said 
adding in my opinion it was a public domain story 
he said the column brought out points that had not been 
brought out before the trial opened june 13 the defense began 
its case monday 
citadel attorney dawes cooke said legare did not view his 
actions as dissemination of information by the citadel itself and 
said the intent was not to influence the jury 
but smith noted that it was the citadel that initially requested 
the gag order he fined the school 5000 but when he returned to 
court in the afternoon he said that upon reflection he decided to 
reduce the fine 
the column quotes a university of miami official as saying 
buoniconti speared an opposing player in the tackle that left him 
paralyzed spearing is hitting head first rather than with the 
shoulder it is illegal under football rules 
that has been the defenses contention in the suit against the 
citadel the teams trainer and doctor 
buoniconti alleges the defendants were negligent in treating a 
neck sprain he suffered several weeks earlier the suit also 
charges they failed to warn him a congenital neck condition made it 
dangerous for him to continue playing football 
holthouser now defensive coordinator at virginia military 
institute testified wednesday that he put no pressure on 
buoniconti to play i did not have a conversation in which i said 
we need you to play to win he said 
he added buoniconti seemed normal in warmups before the game 
did not complain about pain or say special equipment to protect his 
neck didnt feel right

vice president george bush declared 
wednesday the cold war is not over between washington and 
moscow but said sweeping changes proposed in the soviet union by 
mikhail s gorbachev sound revolutionary 
bush certain to be the republican presidential nominee 
credited the reagan administrations 1 trillion military buildup 
with helping push the soviets toward democracy and openness 
and in a speech he said he hoped the investigation of fraud 
bribery and corruption in the pentagon procurement process would 
not undermine the consensus for military strength or provoke an 
overreaction 
the first reaction in congress to the scandals to increase 
the regulatory bureaucracy at defense though understandable 
thats only going to add to the complexity and worsen the problem 
the answer is to reduce cut and simplify including staff and 
executive overhead bush said adding that congress and the white 
house should agree to take the patronage and pork out of 
defense 
bush spoke before the world affairs council a foreign policy 
group at the conclusion of a 24hour visit to northern california 
where he spent most of his time at private fundraisers for 
republicans 
on his return to washington on air force two bush attacked 
dukakis policy on strategic nuclear weapons 
dukakis has voiced opposition to the mx missile and midgetman 
missiles and also has said he would replace the administrations 
strategic defense initiative with a buildup in conventional forces 
he wants to do away with a lot of these systems and i think to 
negotiate an arms control agreement with the soviet union it would 
be ridiculous to do that bush said 
the vice president said it was the united states refusal to 
make unilateral concessions on arms that persuaded the soviets to 
sign an agreement to abolish us and soviet intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles 
en route home the vice president stopped in appleton wis and 
then drove nearly 50 minutes to the farming community of marion to 
watch a cattle auction and talk about the drought 
standing at the auctioneers podium amid the mooing of cows 
bush said i want to say that leave aside the politics of the 
moment and my ambitions for the fall what we want to do as a part 
of the administration is do as much as possible under the 
circumstances 
upward of threequarters of an inch of rain fell on the parched 
area tuesday and bush said i just hope we get more rain i hope 
that will save some of the corn crop we passed by and may take a 
little of the pressure off the families 
bushs speech earlier followed by one day an address in moscow 
by gorbachev to an extraordinary party council in which the soviet 
leader proposed creation of a powerful new post of president and a 
partial transfer of power away from the communist party 
some of the dramatic reforms that general secretary gorbachev 
proposed just yesterday would truly if implemented be revolutionary 
and should the reforms be put into practice it would represent 
historic change he said the vice president said that such moves 
should be watched with guarded optimism 
however bush said weve got to remember the cold war is not 
over we must be bold enough to seize the opportunity of change 
but at the same time as one pundit titled his column be prepared 
for the protracted conflict 
he said the changes of glasnost or openness and perestroika 
or restructuring of the soviet economic system didnt take place 
in a vacuum but in the context of reinvigorated american strength 
bush added my point is this it was eight years of american 
strength that confronted the soviet union with the true costs of 
aggression and necessity of reform 
he called reagans recent summit in moscow with gorbachev the 
result of eight years of moral determination and hard work 
rebuilding americas strength its might 
highlighting his concern about the alleged corruption in the 
pentagon purchasing system bush said the greatest tragedy out 
of all of this would be if the conduct of a few individuals were to 
be used to undermine the consensus on rebuilding americas 
strength 
he spoke warmly of reforms proposed several years ago by a 
presidential commission headed by david packard for changes in the 
procurement process he said the panel concluded that far more 
defense money is lost because of the bureaucracy than because of 
fraud and corruption 
even if every one of dave packards recommendations were 
implemented tomorrow it would not eliminate human greed bush 
said that is why we must be constantly vigilant bring in the 
best people and hold them to the highest standards 
in raising the subject bush said the alleged scandal involved 
congress the pentagon and the defense industry if the news 
stories are true the accused have done more than steal from the 
public treasury they have undermined americas security and broken 
faith with the honest american people the vice president said

a federal judge wednesday ruled that dramatic 
increases in landing fees for small aircraft at logan international 
airport are not discriminatory and can be implemented as planned on 
friday 
the massachusetts port authority the independent agency that 
runs the airport had announced the new fees in march to reduce 
airport congestion by encouraging small planes to use suburban 
airfields 
the objectives of the airport to reduce delays are rationally 
related to government interests us district judge a david 
mazzone said i cannot say that the assignment of the fees was 
an arbitrary irrational nonuniform assignment 
lawyers representing owners of small aircraft and commuter 
airlines said they had not decided whether to appeal 
the new england legal foundation a nonprofit organization 
specializing in government regulation of business had argued that 
the fee increase violates laws requiring equal access to federally 
supported airports they also alleged the fees violate 
constitutional guarantees against discrimination 
wayne henderson a lawyer for the foundation said he was 
obviously disappointed but its a close call as the judge 
said 
the fees are based on a combination of airplanes weight and 
other operating costs while fees for large jets actually would go 
down fliers of smaller aircraft would pay as much as 250 percent 
more 
under the new fees all planes at logan will be assessed an 88 
flat fee and 47 cents per 1000 pounds currently planes are 
assessed 131 per 1000 pounds or 25 whichever is greater most 
small planes pay 25 
the fee for a boeing 747 would drop to 408 from 680 while a 
cessna 402 seating 10 passengers will pay 96 compared to the 
current 25 
the legal foundation represented commuter airlines in the new 
england area also appearing in court were lawyers for the national 
business aircraft association and the aircraft owners and pilots 
association 
the landing fees were approved after a crowded highly charged 
hearing among those applauding the increase were residents living 
next to the airport who see it as a way to reduce noise and the 
potential for accidents 
logan averages 90 takeoffs and landings an hour according to 
massport the federal aviation administration ranks logan among the 
nations 10 most congested airports 
massport executive director david davis called the decision a 
ruling of national importance its a larger victory because the 
judge supported the position of the authoritys right to set 
fees he said 
in a related development the us house on tuesday removed 
provisions in a 108 billion spending package for federal 
transportation that might have blocked federal aid to logan because 
of the new fees 
opponents of the fee hike had inserted a provision to withhold 
money from logan until the us transportation department finishes 
investigating massports plan and the court ruled the dot review 
is not due until november 
the provision was deleted after rep joseph p kennedy ii 
dmass complained it had no place in a spending bill the bill 
passed the house and went to the senate similar provisions 
blocking aid to logan remain in the senate version

the supreme court on wednesday upheld the 
power of independent counsels to prosecute illegal acts by 
highranking government officials a momentous constitutional 
decision and a defeat for a handful of former white house aides 
such as oliver l north and michael k deaver 
by a 71 vote the justices said a 1978 law inspired by the 
watergate scandal does not violate the constitutions command that 
the powers of the executive legislative and judicial branches be 
separate and balanced 
the ruling clears away a potential stumbling block in the 
prosecution of north the former national security council aide 
john m poindexter president reagans former national security 
adviser and two arms dealers indicted in the irancontra arms and 
money affair 
it also dispels important doubts about the convictions of 
deaver who formerly was reagans deputy chief of staff and 
another onetime reagan aide lyn c nofziger 
it also permits a special prosecutor to wrap up a lengthy 
inquiry into the financial activities of attorney general edwin 
meese iii no criminal charges are expected in that case 
the court announced the ruling moments before ending its 198788 
term in an extraordinarily busy day the justices issued nine 
decisions totaling 433 pages 
in the other rulings the court 
made it easier by an 80 vote in a case from texas for 
workers to prove their bosses are guilty of illegal discrimination 
by expanding the way employees can use statistics to prove bias 
severely limited state efforts to shield young sex abuse 
victims from trauma when they tesitfy at criminal trials the 62 
ruling in a case from iowa jeopardizes the use of such protective 
devices for witnesses as oneway screens and videotaped testimony 
struck down 43 an oklahoma mans death sentence but stopped 
short of deciding whether capital punishment may be used for 
convicted killers who committed their crimes before reaching age 16 
ruled 54 that the federal government may give money to 
religious begroups to promote chastity among americas teenagers 
as long as the groups do not teach religion while using the federal 
aid 
in a highstakes defeat for organized labor voted 53 to make 
it easier for millions of nonunion workers to withhold financial 
support from the unions that represent them in collective 
bargaining 
barred states from placing strict regulations on professional 
forprofit organizations that solicit contributions for charities 
the 72 ruling struck down a north carolina law as a violation of 
freespeech rights 
in the special prosecutor case the court overturned a 21 
federal appeals court ruling last jan 22 that declared the law 
unconstitutional 
but chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court 
wednesday said the law does not transfer presidential powers 
improperly to congress and the courts 
this case does not involve an attempt by congress to increase 
its own powers at the expense of the executive branch he said 
similarly we do not think that the act works any judicial 
usurpation of properly executive functions finally we do not 
think that the act impermissibly undermines the powers of the 
executive branch or disrupts the proper balance between the 
coordinate branches 
rehnquist said the special prosecutor law is distinct from the 
socalled grammrudman budgetbalancing law the court struck down 
in 1986 as a violation of separation of powers that law was 
invalidated for empowering a quasilegislative officer the 
comptroller general to establish budget cuts 
the chief justice in a 38page opinion said since special 
prosecutors may be removed by the attorney general for good 
cause the executive branch maintains important control over the 
independent counsels 
justice antonin scalia the lone dissenter in his own 38page 
opinion said the checks and balances of the constitution are what 
make it a unique and enduring document and guarantee the freedom of 
the american people in dictatorships of the modern world bills 
of rights are a dime a dozen he said 
the law opens the way to prosecutorial abuses by those unlike 
the president who are not accountable to the voters scalia said 
i fear the court has permanently encumbered the republic with 
an institution that will do it great harm scalia said 
but james c mckay who prosecuted nofziger and who is 
conducting the meese inquiry hailed the ruling saying in a 
statement this office has believed that there is an appropriate 
place within the framework of the constitution for the 
establishment of a process which eliminates the inherent conflict 
of interest which arises when a high official of the executive 
branch is investigated by the department of justice 
the independent counsel statute provides a workable solution 
to a difficult problem the irancontra prosecutor lawrence e 
walsh said in a statement 
the public can now be confident that criminal wrongdoing will 
get a full hearing and not be swept under the rug at the justice 
department said sen william cohen rmaine who was a member of 
the congressional panels that investigated the breakin at 
democratic national committee headquarters at the watergate in the 
early 1970s and the irancontra affair last summer 
the reagan administration which helped lead the challenge to 
the law sought to minimize the importance of the ruling 
in a statement the white house said the administration has 
faithfully and consistently complied with all of the acts 
requirements todays decision will have no practical effect on 
the administrations implementation of the law 
meese told reporters these are all tough constitutional 
issues and we put up on behalf of the administration the best 
legal arguments that we can 
justice anthony m kennedy the newest member of the court and 
one of three justices appointed by reagan did not take part in the 
independent prosecutor decision 
congress enacted the statute in the wake of the watergate 
scandal that led to president nixons resignation to provide an 
independent mechanism for investigating alleged highlevel 
government wrongdoing 
opponents and supporters of the law a key portion of the ethics 
in government act cited the watergate case to buttress their 
position 
the laws advocates said it was essential to assure the nation 
that crimes in high places would not be covered up 
but opponents pointed out that nixon was forced out of office 
because of public opinion and the threat of impeachment without 
any need for an independent investigation 
the law empowers a special federal court to appoint independent 
counsels at the request of the attorney general the attorney 
general first conducts a preliminary inquiry to determine whether 
charges against a government official warrant appointment of the 
outside counsel 
the law was challenged by theodore b olson a former assistant 
attorney general accused of lying to congress in 1983 during a 
dispute over the environmental protection agencys cleanup program 
for toxic waste sites 
alexia morrison a washington lawyer is the special prosecutor 
investigating that case 
the immediate stakes in the case involved some of the most 
prominent figures of the reagan presidency 
deaver convicted of lying to a grand jury and a house 
subcommittee that investigated his lobbying activities is awaiting 
sentencing whitney north seymour was the independent counsel who 
prosecuted him 
nofziger was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined 30000 
for illegal lobbying 
north was expected to go on trial in the fall in the irancontra 
case on charges he conspired to divert profits from the sale of 
arms to iran to the contra rebels fighting the government in 
nicaragua 
his codefendants poindexter businessman albert a hakim and 
retired air force maj gen richard v secord are to be tried

guerrilla leader jonas savimbi claiming 
control of more than onethird of angola appealed wednesday for 
continued us aid to force angolas communist government to deal 
with his movement 
support should not be cut before we have concluded with the 
mpla government a deal for negotiations formation of a 
government of national unity and elections savimbi told a forum 
on southern africa 
the bearded guerrilla fighter takes his message to the white 
house thursday where he has an appointment with president reagan 
he met secretary of state george shultz on tuesday and has been 
talking to members of congress and private groups during an 
extended visit to the united states 
savimbi has been lobbying against views of some democrats who 
favor restoring the ban lifted two years ago against aid to his 
national union for the total independence of angola or unita and 
of us civil rights advocates troubled by unitas acceptance of 
arms from whiteruled south africa 
savimbis proposals for national reconciliation were sharply 
opposed here this week by an angolan mpla government delegation 
that discussed with reagan administration officials the ongoing 
negotiations about the removal of cuban forces from angola 
the angolan officials rejected talks with unita or elections 
repeated demands for the guerrillas to lay down their arms and 
branded them ancillary forces of south africa 
declaring he is against apartheid the south african system of 
racial segregation savimbi said unita has always accepted 
support from wherever we get it earlier in the independence 
struggle against portugal and now against the marxist government 
and its supporting cuban soviet east german and north korean 
forces 
no one is saying that churchill or roosevelt by supporting 
stalin were communists he added referring to the allied 
british american and soviet leaders during world war ii 
jeane kirkpatrick former us ambassador at the united nations 
introduced savimbi to the forum sponsored by the american 
enterprise institute a private businesssponsored conservative 
policy group as one of the authentic heroes of our time a poet 
revolutionary theoretician and survivor 
savimbi said 12000 more cuban troops entered angola the past 
two months raising the total to 57000 which is about 25 percent 
over us estimates 
except for increased cuban strength the situation has turned 
very favorable for unita savimbi said with the cubans moving 
from northern to southern angola this has given us the intiative 
in the north we are closer to the capital and mpla is feeling much 
more pressure than ever before he said 
us support has made a tremendous difference we have 
neutralized cuban and mpla air power and we got a very powerful 
transmitter which is allowing us to pass our message to the whole 
nation 
us aid to unita since the ban was lifted is classified but has 
been unofficially estimated at about 16 million a year

intelligence maj gen amnon shahad as saying that although the 
arab uprising spawned a new local leadership in the west bank and 
gaza strip palestinians still accept the palestine liberation 
organization as their undisputed leader

influence in the occupied territories 
hospital officials said wednesdays clash in nablus began when 
youths threw bottles and rocks at troops accompanying israeli tax 
officials who were checking arab shops

investigators searched for clues wednesday to why a 
train lost its brakes and ended its journey in a disastrous 
collision at a paris station that killed nearly 60 people 
police said dismembered bodies had caused confusion in 
establishing a death toll in the accident which occurred monday 
and it probably was 56 rather than the 59 announced earlier of 38 
people injured 13 still were hospitalized 
all the 55 dead identified by wednesday were french 
the runaway commuter train careened into the busy gare de lyon 
station at 710 pm monday and hit a full train waiting to depart 
most of the victims apparently were in the stationary train 
witnesses said most passengers had left the incoming train at an 
unscheduled 26minute stop 
three separate investigations are being conducted by police 
the staterun railway company and the transport ministry 
officials of the rail company said tuesday the veteran engineer 
on the runaway train realized more than a mile from the gare de 
lyon that his brakes were gone and warned passengers to move to the 
back of the train 
they also said the engineer daniel saulin 42 first realized 
there was a brake problem after the eightcar train had been 
stopped five miles from the station by a passenger who pulled the 
emergency cord 
louis lecor a company spokesman said authorities had not yet 
identified the passenger who committed the act of malicious 
mischief 
saulin had problems resetting the brakes and the train did not 
move for 26 minutes the company said most passengers boarded 
another parisbound train that passed the french press quoted 
witnesses as saying 
about a mile from the paris station when saulin realized he had 
no brakes he alerted the station controller and then his 
passengers his train sped into the gare de lyon at 4050 mph 
through a stop signal 600 yards from impact 
the french news agency agence francepresse said investigators 
were questioning both saulin and the controller and listening to 
black boxes containing technical information on train movements 
quoting well informed sources it said there was a conflict 
in the accounts of the engineer and station controller according 
to the agency report saulin said the controller told him to 
proceed despite brake problems but company policy is that such a 
decision rests with the engineer

a military court sentenced nine 
army lieutenants wednesday to jail sentences ranging up to 90 days

a district judge blocked the union carbide 
corp on wednesday from settling directly with victims of the 
bhopal gas leak the worlds worst industrial disaster 
judge mw deo issued an interim injunction against direct 
settlement in response to a june 16 request by the indian 
government which has made itself sole legal representative of 
victims of the dec 3 1984 gas leak 
nearly 3000 people were killed and more than 20000 seriously 
injured in the leak at a bhopal pesticide plant owned by an indian 
subsidiary of union carbide which is based in danbury conn 
the company says the leak was caused by employee sabotage india 
says poor maintenance and low safety standards were to blame 
india filed a 3 billion suit against union carbide that is 
still being heard 
its disturbing that the indian government which claims to be 
the sole representative of bhopal victims continues to prevent 
those victims from resolving their own claims expeditiously and to 
their own satisfaction the company said wednesday in a statement 
released at its headquarters 
union carbide saying there was no political will in the new 
delhi government to settle began dealing directly with lawyers who 
filed suit in the united states on behalf of gas claimants 
nearly 150000 claimants are represented by lawyers seeking 
damages in courts in connecticut and texas the indian government 
has received claims from about 500000 people 
deo said his order was not to stop proceedings but only to block 
a settlement in the united states before he gives his final 
judgment on july 29 
union carbide argued that any injunction would be an affront to 
the connecticut court that is judging the case with private lawyers 
of gas victims 
indian government lawyers say any settlement reached in the 
connecticut court would be null and void 
they quoted a union carbide spokesman as saying the company was 
seeking to reach a settlement providing less than 350 million for 
the victims

an unidentified soviet government 
official was quoted as saying wednesday that soviet submarines may 
have regularly violated swedish waters until 1985 when mikhail s 
gorbachev took power but have not done so since 
the aftonbladet daily quoted the official as saying the soviets 
distrusted swedens ability to keep neutral in wartime and feared 
it would be forced to help the north atlantic alliance 
the soviet military wanted to chart swedish waters and convinced 
the kremlin to go along in what was one of a series of foreign 
policy errors during the regime of leonid brezhnev the newspaper 
quoted the official as saying 
i cannot exclude that soviet submarines operated in swedish 
waters on the contrary it is probable considering our previous 
foreign policy he was quoted as saying in an interview in moscow 
according to aftonbladet he said the military could easily 
convince the soviet party leadership that this or that was 
necessary the control over the army was not so strict since then 
it has been tightened 
aftonbladet called the man an expert on scandinavian affairs 
it said the official reported that the soviet violations 
continued until 1985 when gorbachev became general secretary of 
the soviet communist party 
it was the closest to an admission of territorial violations 
since a soviet submarine ran aground off karlskrona naval base in 
1981 last week soviet spokesman gennady gerassimov said reports 
of continued intrusions reminded him of the loch ness story 
swedish defense staff spokesman evert dahlen declined to comment 
on the aftonbladet story since we do not know who the source is 
but dahlen said incursions were continuing as they have every 
year this decade sweden has not identified the nationality of the 
intruders since making a diplomatic protest to moscow in 1983 the 
soviets rejected the accusations and swedishsoviet relations were 
virtually frozen until last year 
the soviet official was quoted as saying soviet foreign policy 
has changed fundamentally and that he without doubt can say 
there are no soviet submarines in swedish waters today 
we know that the slightest mistake or another grounding will 
cause a new conflict with sweden and not only sweden there will 
be an outcry all over the world he was quoted as saying adding 
that a new scandal could be fatal to gorbachevs new foreign 
policy which is based on showing we are not aggressive

the pentagon inspector generals office has 
reopened its investigation into a disputed contract in the wake of 
the separate criminal investigation of bribery and fraud in defense 
department weapons purchases according to rep john dingell 
dmich 
the ig probe was renewed june 16 two days after the 
twoyearold criminal investigation became public when search 
warrants were served on pentagon officials contractors and 
private consultants 
the investigation was reopened because of the possible 
involvement of melvyn r paisley a former top navy official who 
has emerged as a key figure in the bribery investigation 
the contract in question involves a navy radarwarning system 
said dingell chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
dingell in a letter tuesday to defense secretary frank c 
carlucci asked for all documents relating to the decision by june 
gibbs brown the pentagon inspector general to take another look 
at the case 
dingells letter said browns office received information from a 
telephone tip in which the tipster alleged that paisley conspired 
with officials of two companies to limit competition for the 
analr67 radar receiving sets the two companies were identified 
as littons applied technologies division and dalmo victor a 
subsidiary of the singer corp 
the navy reportedly planned to open competition for a 121 
million part of the contract to several companies but the 
unidentified tipster said paisley ordered that a lesscompetitive 
process known as leaderfollower be used 
that would permit litton to remain the lead contractor and allow 
it to train a second company to produce the system the second 
company would be dalmo victory the tipster said 
litton had been the solesource contractor for the system which 
includes a sophisticated display and warning system which tells a 
navy pilot that his plane is being tracked by enemy radars 
dingells letter said the contract may ultimately be worth 1 
billion to the recipients 
the tip was telephoned to the general accounting office the 
congressional watchdog agency which passed it along last aug 27 
to the pentagon inspector generals office the pentagon office 
investigated and told the gao on feb 18 that the charges were 
unsubstantiated dingell said 
dingell said he wants to know what facts led the dodig to 
label the charges as unsubstantiated

one of the first red wolves to produce 
offspring since the endangered species was reintroduced to the wild 
has died and her mate apparently has taken charge of the 
9weekold pup officials said wednesday 
the wolf thought to have succumbed to disease or infection was 
discovered saturday at alligator river national wildlife refuge 
near manteo said refuge manager john taylor 
the pup was nowhere to be found but two days later a wildlife 
team spotted it trotting alongside its father in the 140000acre 
refuge taylor said 
we are fortunate that the puppy had been weaned already he 
said adding that it was unusual for male wolves to take care of 
their offspring 
he said the male wolf apparently had been feeding the puppy the 
way the mother would by killing and eating raccoons rabbits and 
other small animals and regurgitating the soft gruel 
its cute it looks like a little dog puppy only its kind 
of mottlecolored mostly reddish with spots of gray taylor 
said we thought the prospects of our finding it alive were 
slim 
the female wolf was among four pairs of red wolves released into 
the wild in september as part of a federal effort to save the 
species the animals were declared extinct in the wild in 1980 
the newly orphaned pup was first spotted may 21 and another pup 
was sighted soon afterward with different parents marking the 
first time a species previously extinct in the wild has produced 
offspring after being returned to its natural environment 
although litters average five or six pups scientists believe no 
more than one survived from either of the two litters 
the red wolf once roamed the southeast in large numbers but in 
1978 with the species teetering near extinction the last pure red 
wolves were taken from the wild to a zoo in tacoma wash there 
breeding in captivity encouraged biologists to try reintroducing 
the animals into the wild 
at alligator river wildlife teams take trips into the wild 
every other day to track the adult wolves via radio collars worn by 
the animals taylor said

a watchdog panel of police and 
civilians said wednesday no disciplinary action will be taken 
against northern irelands police chief over allegations his force 
murdered unarmed guerrilla suspects 
sinn fein the legal political wing of the outlawed irish 
republican army called it a coverup the social democratic and 
labor party the provinces leading roman catholic party said the 
chief and his deputies should resign 
the 20member northern ireland police authority criticized 
certain police operational procedures but said no action was needed 
against sir john hermon chief constable of the royal ulster 
constabulary 
nor will his two top deputies deputy chief constable michael 
mcatamney and assistant chief constable trevor forbes face 
disciplinary action it said 
it was the latest chapter in a conflict that has bedeviled the 
british province since late 1982 when police killed six unarmed 
catholics five of them acknowledged guerrillas in three separate 
incidents 
the killings led to allegations of an illegal shoottokill 
policy against guerrillas fighting to rid protestantdominated 
northern ireland of british rule and unite it with the 
predominantly roman catholic irish republic 
the panel said it based its decision on findings of an inquiry 
which reported no evidence of illegalities it said its decision 
was by a majority of one but did not give the exact vote or say 
how many members voted 
hermon and his deputies said in a statement we always knew we 
had nothing to fear from any investigation nevertheless we are 
pleased the police authority has vindicated our position 
herman who turns 60 in november has said he will retire next 
year 
on monday the londonbased human rights group amnesty 
international demanded a judicial inquiry into the killings saying 
existing procedures were inadequate for preventing illegal police 
shootings 
john stalker a british detective assigned to investigate the 
shootings claims he was obstructed by hermon and eventually forced 
off the case because he was close to proving murder had been 
committed 
in january the british government announced that although there 
was a police conspiracy to obstruct justice no one would be 
prosecuted 
stalkers inquiry was completed by another british officer 
colin sampson whose report has not been published 
but the police authority quoted sampson as concluding i have 
found no evidence that there were instructions to any police 
officers in northern ireland to use other than legitimate methods 
to bring offenders to justice 
kevin mcnamara the opposition labor partys northern ireland 
spokesman said there have been two casualties the first is 
confidence in the administration of the rule of law in northern 
ireland the second is britains good name in the world

the lawyer for the teamsters union on wednesday 
said a us justice department plan to stop alleged mafia influence 
of the union through a courtappointed trustee is an idea that was 
tried in new jersey and failed 
teamsters chief counsel john climaco in a telephone interview 
from the ritz carlton hotel where the teamsters executive is 
holding its quarterly meeting told the associated press the 
trustee plan was a very real threat 
but he said union leaders were ready to fight anything 
on tuesday us attorney rudolph giuliani filed a racketeering 
lawsuit in manhattan federal court in what he said was an attempt 
to break mafia domination of the teamsters 
the government wants a federal judge to remove from office any 
teamsters officers found to have violated racketeering laws and to 
appoint a trustee who would ensure the fair election of new 
officers in the 16million member union 
a test case for the move occurred in teamsters local 560 in 
union city nj where courtappointed trustees have been in 
charge since 1986 
the second trustee appointed former federal prosecutor edwin 
steir has reported some progress but also says union members are 
reluctant to get involved because of past intimidation 
everyone who has been connected with 560 has said its a 
failure including the first trustee climaco said 
he said the union executive will conclude its meeting behind 
closed doors thursday but may not immediately reveal its plans 
against the federal lawsuit 
the lawsuit named all 18 members of the unions executive board 
including the canadian representative edward lawson 59 of 
vancouver a member of canadas appointed senate it also named 26 
alleged members or associates of the mafia 25 of whom already have 
been convicted of extortion embezzlement and other crimes 
lawson was angered by the sweeping nature of the suit noting 
the specific allegations involve only six us locals out of 620 
and no charges against the union in canada 
he claimed the suit was aimed at taking the heat off a 
scandalplagued reagan administration including allegations of 
wrongdoing against attorney general edwin meese and corruption at 
the pentagon 
this is the most corrupt administration in the history of the 
united states said lawson head of the teamsters in canada and a 
vicepresident of the international union 
theyve decided they have to get all of that scandal out of 
the news and do something like attack an easy target like the 
teamsters 
he said it was not clear if the suit was aimed at appointing a 
trustee for union elections in canada 
whether they have the right to extend their tentacles into 
canada is a very serious question lawson said were going to 
defend this vigorously theyre going to find that the teamsters 
are not so easy a mark

socialist premier michel rocard said wednesday his 
new governments proposal to reestablish a wealth tax was intended 
to knit society together not to soak the wealthy 
the wealth tax is a contribution to solidarity not a revenge 
against the rich rocard told the national assembly in a speech 
describing the outlines of his governments policies 
rocard appointed premier just after the may 8 reelection of 
socialist president francois mitterrand named an expanded 
49member cabinet on tuesday with socialists in all key positions 
but with several more centrist or nonpolitical figures in 
ministerial posts 
the socialists have just 277 seats in the 577member assembly 
and so will need support from communist or centerright deputies to 
pass legislation 
but rocards minority government should be in no immediate 
danger of falling he is under no obligation to call a vote of 
confidence either on his statement of general policy or on other 
issues 
in his speech the premier did not provide any specifics of the 
planned wealth tax which will replace a levy imposed by the 
socialists after their election in 1981 and repealed by the 
conservatives under premier jacques chirac in 1986 
rocard said too high a tax on accumulated wealth would risk 
accelerated capital flight at a time when france needs business 
investment 
on the other hand a symbolic tax which would be purely 
ideological would not produce the necessary amounts for the 
solidarity desired by all he said 
the wealth tax as mitterrand promised in his reelection 
campaign is to provide part of the funds for a mininum guaranteed 
income the amount of which has also not been set 
rocard said legislation on both proposals would be adopted by 
his cabinet on july 13 and sent immediately to the assembly for 
consideration 
the premier said his government hoped to provide a new hope 
for france by increasing spending on research restoring 
dilapidated public housing and making education and training 
priorities 
government agencies will be asked to improve and simplify their 
service to the public said rocard who promised to pay a visit 
exactly a year from now to those departments that make the greatest 
improvements 
he said france would remain committed to building a united 
europe and increase its development aid gradually until it amounts 
to 07 percent of the gross national product

a massive memorandum accompanying a government 
suit to seize control of the teamsters outlines hundreds of 
teamsterrelated prosecutions since 1970 to back up charges the 
union made a devils pact with the mob 
the government filed suit tuesday seeking to oust the top 
leadership of the nations largest union 
in support of its request the government claimed in a detailed 
105page document that a recent series of successful criminal and 
civil prosecutions demonstrates the mafia has gained control over 
the teamsters 
the court papers noted that four of the last five teamsters 
presidents have faced federal felony charges and three were 
convicted david beck for embezzlement jimmy hoffa for obstructing 
justice and mail fraud and roy williams for trying to bribe a us 
senator 
since approximately 1970 according to the memo the 
government has successfully prosecuted well over 300 persons 
associated with the teamsters for teamstersrelated crimes 
among 26 alleged mob figures named as defendants in the lawsuit 
25 have been convicted of teamstersrelated crimes such as 
extortion through threats of union problems embezzling union funds 
and taking labor payoffs 
from 1970 until now the government contended the teamsters 
executive board has rarely taken disciplinary action against or 
even investigated corrupt teamsters officials or subordinate 
entities 
the union leadership the government charged has made a 
devils pact with la cosa nostra or the mafia 
the teamsters executive board which is holding its quarterly 
meeting in montreal criticized the lawsuit as a vicious 
antilabor attack and said allegations of ties to organized crime 
were pure myth 
after the suit was filed us district judge david edelsten 
barred the board from making large expenditures of union funds or 
destroying records and banned the 25 convicted mob defendants from 
participating in union affairs 
in announcing the lawsuit us attorney rudolph giuliani quoted 
the presidents commission on organized crimes description of the 
teamsters as the union most controlled by organized crime

opposition parties argued in the legislature 
wednesday that the planned transfer of usmade f16 fighter jets 
to italy from spain would harm chances for peace 
the government responding to a request from the north atlantic 
treaty organization announced june 4 it would accept 72 f16s that 
will be expelled from the torrejon air base near madrid within 
three years 
nato asked italy to accept the warplanes which comprise the air 
forces 401st tactical fighter wing so they could remain part of 
nato strategy for the defense of southern europe 
the chamber of deputies the lower house opened debate on the 
transfer wednesday and is expected to vote thursday on a motion by 
four opposition parties to reject it 
premier ciriaco de mitas governing coalition holds a 
comfortable majority and is expected to win parliamentary approval 
for the transfer 
the government says italy must honor its commitments to nato and 
that italy and the allies cannot make what would amount to a 
unilateral act of disarmament 
the united states wanted spain to keep the planes but after 
lengthy negotiations spain declined to renew a base agreement 
italys opposition parties argued wednesday that accepting the 
planes would alter the strategic balance between east and west and 
hinder efforts to reduce tensions 
deputy maria teresa capecchi a communist said relocating the 
fighterbombers in italy shapes up as dangerous act that risks 
being misinterpreted by the east 
however christian democratic deputy bartolo ciccardini argued 
that failure to relocate the planes in southern europe would 
reduce natos military power in the area by 30 to 50 percent 
the government has decided to station the american planes at a 
military airport near crotone a city of 50000 about 400 miles 
south of rome

the house ways and means committee voted 
wednesday to limit the tax break for singlepremium life insurance 
policies but chairman dan rostenkowski said his panel did not go 
far enough because of industry pressure 
the committee meeting in closed session approved by voice vote 
an amendment offered by rep barbara kennelly dct whose 
hartford district is an insurance industry stronghold to raise 
about 300 million over the next three years by shrinking the 
loophole 
rostenkowski wanted to raise twice as much but shrinking the 
loophole still more 
under the 1986 tax law the growth in value in the policies is 
untaxed and the purchaser can borrow back the large single premium 
interestfree making what critics say is a tax dodge for the 
wealthy who are able to afford such policies 
under the kennelly version that prevailed people who take 
advantage of that mechanism would incur subsequent tax penalties if 
they borrowed against policies held less than seven years 
rostenkowski had wanted penalties to apply if interestfree 
loans were taken against a policy held less than 20 years his plan 
would have raised more than 600 million but over his objections 
the panel went with the industrysupported kennelly plan 
in a statement released when committee staff briefed reporters 
on the session rostenkowski told the committee it was getting 
rolled by the insurance industry and promised to fight the 
issue again on a future tax bill 
were only kidding ourselves and the industry is completely 
naive if they think this does the job he said 
mrs kennelly in a telephone interview said she was confident 
her plan would end abuses she said the current tax bill was not 
the place for a broad revamping of insurance taxes 
i think what we probably did was close down the single premium 
loophole she said brokers promising a quick buck will be out 
of business she said 
the provision was added to a grabbag tax package which started 
as a series of technical corrections to the 1986 bill but which 
also includes a wide range of other tax changes 
about 6 billion in new taxes mostly on corporations have been 
approved by the committee to offset tax breaks such as repeal of 
the requirement that farmers and other offroad users of diesel 
fuel pay the 151 centpergallon federal tax 
the committee was scheduled to continue work on the bill on 
thursday

secretary of state george p shultz appealed 
to new zealand on wednesday to reconsider its ban on visits by 
nuclear warships and rejoin the threenation alliance disbanded in 
1986 
it seems to us there must be a formula if only new zealand 
would look for it that would make it possible for them to come 
back into the fold shultz said 
we would hope that the new zealanders would change their 
attitude and reenter the alliance australian foreign minister 
bill hayden said 
they made the comments at a news conference following annual 
talks by the australian and us defense and foreign ministers 
the socalled anzus defense alliance between the united states 
australia and new zealand was dissolved in a dispute over new 
zealands ban on nuclear weapons and nuclear power and the 
longstanding us policy of neither confirmwith the city before the rally 
and 
said theres nothing to be optimistic about but he declined to 
explain why his perception differed from suttons viewpoint 
in terms of what i have seen at the bargaining table it looks 
like a problem said cronin who represents about 3000 workers 
maybe he has seen something else 
both sutton and cronin said they would favor of an extension of 
the talks into the weekend if the deadline passes without contracts 
goode has said he would prefer not to extend the negotiations 
deputy mayor marjorie adler said talks with the unions were 
making progress but moving along slowly 
workers and thd 
plans to eliminate about 1700 city jobs in an effort to balance 
the budget 
goode said the city councils approval of 101 million in new 
taxes about 40 million short of his request has forced him to 
make costcutting plans for every department 
hes putting the unions in the position where hes forcing a 
strike said ronald armour a sanitation worker 
armour said he was doubtful an agreement could be reached before 
the deadline he said goodes plans set a different tone for this 
years contract negotiations 
this here could be the demise of our departments its do or 
die for us armour said 
other municipal workers who have been through past strikes 
agreed 
i think the attitude is different because the city is asking 
for a lot of givebacks and the threat of layoffs is hanging over 
our heads said brenda goode a social worker 
dana bennett is another sanitation worker who remembers the last 
municipal workers strike when garbage went uncollected and 
gathered in rotting piles across the city two years ago 
in those 20 days i hated it bennett said i hate to 
strike i want to work but if worse comes to worst 
the arbitration hearing for the city and the union representing 
philadelphias more than 6000 police concluded wednesday 
bob hurst president of lodge 5 of the fraternal order of 
police said arbitrators would consider testimony and make a 
decision on an expected police pay increase next week 
hurst criticized the city for delays in the arbitration process 
which he said made it impossible for a ruling to come out in time 
for other city workers to use it as a benchmark in their own 
negotiations 
by law the police and the firefighters rpesented by local 22 
of the firefighters association in talks cannot strike

hudson said in arguing against disclosure of the sealed documents 
hudson chief prosecutor in the pentagon investigation provided 
no details on who destroyed documents how they were destroyed or 
how they might have been related to the probe 
in an affidavit attached to hudsons brief assistant us 
attorney joseph aronica said prosecutors had learned of two 
incidents of document destruction by persons who are implicated in 
the investigation which in two separate instants required the 
securing of premises to prevent further destruction and the 
emerging application for search warrants 
the application by newsday a long islandbased newspaper seeks 
to unseal search warrants and supporting affidavits executed by 
andrew maloney the us attorney for the eastern district of new 
york on june 14 as part of the larger investigation into defense 
contract procurement 
under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and 
consultants many of them former military men bribed pentagon 
officials for inside information useful in winning contracts worth 
billions of dollars 
among those targeted by maloneys office are the unisys corp 
plant in great neck charles gardner a consultant to unisys and 
former unisys employee dennis mitchell an employee at the plant 
and the hazeltine corp in greenlawn 
in april gardner met with rep roy dyson dmd and unisys 
engineers to discuss several defense programs in which unisys was 
involved including aegis a multibillion dollar shipboard combat 
system for the navy dyson reportedly is under scrutiny in the 
investigation 
newsdays lawyer robert raskopf has argued to us district 
judge edward korman that the seal should be lifted because the 
investigation has been extensively reported in the media 
in response hudson said disclosure would jeopardize the probe 
which is in many respects still in a formulative and most 
vulnerable stage 
revealing the precise contours of the governments intentions 
and current information may well encourage document destruction and 
other acts would have the practical effect of putting major felons 
beyond the reach of justice hudson said 
hudson disputed newsdays position that much of what is in the 
documents is public knowledge 
in fact previous news stories have not disclosed significant 
portions of the material recited in the affidavit particularly the 
wiretap information he said 
some of the affidavits detail targets of the investigation 
information suggesting the direction of the probe and the 
governments theory of the case he said 
hudson also said that the disclosure of hazeltines affidavit 
would reveal the identity of a confidential source cooperating in 
the investigation 
korman has yet to rule on the application for disclosure 
raskopf said he would ask the judge on thursday to give him until 
friday to respond to hudsons brief

federal agents posing as the captain and crew 
of a drug smuggling ship helped seize 36 million worth of cocaine 
and arrest three people in the biggest such bust in louisiana 
officials said wednesday 
j robert grimes regional customs commissioner said the case

the gulf coast area around new orleans as authorities turn up the 
heat in florida and texas

grimes said at a news conference 
about 990 pounds of cocaine in bricklike packages were stacked

secretary of state george p shultz said 
wednesday that nicaraguas government systematically has refused to 
engage in good faith negotiations compiling instead a record of 
evasions and noncompliance 
opening a fournation central american visit shultz hailed the 
democratic gains made in the region in recent years but singled 
out nicaraguas lefist sandinista government as an exception to the 
trend 
the tone of shultzs remarks as he arrived here wednesday night 
suggested he hopes that central american countries will bring 
pressure to bear on nicaragua to move toward a democratic system 
but he offered no specific proposals 
the sandinistas shultz said have not democratized they 
continue to suport subversion in neighboring countries theirs is 
not a record of honest negotiations 
it is a record of negotiations corrupted by the sandinistas 
efforts to destroy those who do not agree with them 
instead of negotiating fairly shultz said the sandinistas have 
engaged in evasions and noncompliance in talks dating back to 
the revolution in 1979 
shultzs trip is aimed at giving central american leaders 
forceful assurances of us support and at seeking common 
approaches for dealing with nicaragua 
a senior official who briefed reporters earlier said the 
administrations plan to seek renewed aid for the nicaraguan 
contras will not be a major focus of the trip but shultz is 
expected to hold a strategy session with rebel leaders in guatemala 
thursday night 
in addition to guatemala shultz will visit el salvador 
honduras and costa rica returning to washington friday night no 
stop in nicaragua is planned consistent with the reagan 
administrations policy of shunning contacts with sandinista 
government leaders until they show what washington regards as 
serious interest in moving toward a democratic system 
the official who insisted on anonymity said shultz hopes to 
encourage the leaders of the four countries to pressure nicaraguas 
government to show more flexibility in efforts to achieve a final 
settlement to its conflict with the prous guerrillas known as 
contras 
negotiations for a settlement broke down earlier this month and 
no new talks have been scheduled the sandinistas and the contras 
have blamed each other for the collapse of the negotiations 
meanwhile a fragile ceasefire remains in place but some 
insurgents impatient with the negotiating impasse are reported 
prepared to resume the fighting 
the contras have received no military aid since feb 29 and the 
consensus among both democrats and republicans in the house is that 
any administration request for additional military aid would have 
little chance for approval 
the administration has said no decision has been made as yet on 
an aid package but some contra supporters on capitol hill are 
weighing the possibility of seeking approval for additional 
military aid that would be released only if certain but still 
undefined conditions are met 
one senate source said the military aid package likely would be 
offered only if shultz signals congress upon his return that such a 
move would be welcomed 
but several congressional sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said they thought it more likely that costa rican 
president oscar arias would emphasize to shultz the prospect of 
increasing economic pressure on nicaragua as a substitute for 
contra military pressure 
arias has spoken to us officials about asking the handful of 
european countries now giving economic aid to the sandinista regime 
to cut off that aid and possibly about seeking a broadened trade 
embargo against the regime 
at the same time the sandinistas might be offered us economic 
aid if they meet certain targets for democratic reforms the 
sources said 
some hardline congressional backers of the contras said they 
feared shultz might go along with such suggestions i detect a 
diminution of zeal one house republican said 
but rep mickey edwards rokla a leader of house procontra 
forces said nothing short of a total economic boycott of nicaragua 
would have any effect i see no sign arias is willing to go that 
far 
the countries shultz will visit are among the largest recipients 
of us aid in the hemisphere shultz will tell leaders in each 
country that us support for them will continue regardless of the 
outcome of the november election the official said 
among the countries shultz will visit el salvador appears to be 
the one facing the the gravest difficulties a leadership vacuum 
has been created by the illness of president jose napoleon duarte 
who is believed to have only a few months to live 
the country also has become increasingly polarized between the 
left and right with the fmln guerrilla movement pledging to step 
up their campaign against government forces and the rightist arena 
party scoring impressive electoral gains at the expense of duartes

the tennessee valley authority the 
nations biggest supplier of electricity said wednesday it will 
lay off 7500 of its 34000 workers to keep the federal utility 
competitive and ensure its survival 
its very important for all of us to realize that were not 
just going through another reorganization or another reduction in 
force simply to achieve a onetime budget goal said general 
manager bill willis were fundamentally restructuring tva and 
getting it in shape for the future 
the 22 percent reduction to be completed by oct 1 is in line 
with tva chairman marvin runyons goal of converting tva from a 
bloated topheavy organization to a businesslike structure capable 
of competing with privately owned utilities 
runyon formerly chief executive officer of nissan motor 
manufacturing corp usa and a vice president of ford motor co 
became tva chairman in january in april he announced a program to 
restructure the agency 
he said at the time the restructuring would include substantial 
layoffs 
tvas goal is to keep its rates the same for the next three 
years the cuts and other changes announced wednesday are an effort 
to avoid an increase of about 300 million in the budget year that 
begins oct 1 
we fully believe these measures will allow us to go into 
next year with no rate increase willis said 
the governmentowned utility was founded during the depression 
in 1933 to help develop the tennessee river basin tva built dams 
and power plants and also undertook health education and 
conservation programs 
runyon said at a board meeting wednesdasy that the number of 
jobs created in the tennessee valley by the availability of 
reasonably priced electricity eventually will more than offset the 
loss of 7500 tva jobs 
those laid off will include about 4000 fulltime salaried 
employees 1800 contract employees and 1700 paid on an hourly 
basis 
runyon said 889 managers are among those let go reducing the 
ratio of supervisors to employees from 1to7 to about 1to13 
we know that these decisions will be painful for our employees 
who are being asked to leave through no fault of their own 
runyon said but we are convinced and we hope you understand 
that these actions are absolutely necessary for the survival of tva 
and for the longterm economic vitality of our region 
runyon repeatedly has said tva cannot survive unless it becomes 
more efficient and competitive with utility companies outside its 
sevenstate region he has said the agency can be of more help to 
the regions economy by luring industry with cheap electric power 
than by being an employer itself 
more than 1200 jobs will be lost in tvas headquarters city of 
knoxville 775 jobs in chattanooga and 329 in muscle shoals ala 
runyon said tva would inform every affected employee by late 
wednesday 
runyon said he does not believe the layoffs violate the agencys 
contracts with any of the five unions that represent some of its 
employees 
there was no immediate response from the unions to wednesdays 
announcement 
the board also approved a more moderate pace for tvas nuclear 
power program which began in the early 1970s with an ambitious 
plan to build 17 reactors tva has gotten as many as five reactors 
in operation but currently only one is running the agency is 
paying off 8 billion on eight plants that were canceled runyon 
said 
the board agreed to defer indefinitely construction at 
bellefonte nuclear plant near scottsboro ala until projections 
indicate a need for the power the board also agreed to reschedule 
operational dates for five other reactors

private sector 
courageous changes without sentimentality or illusions are 
imperative and any delay would be fatal krunic said in his 
speech

introduction of a marketoriented economy but he added the state 
would continue to exercise a measure of control 
if we allow the uncontrolled functioning of the market we 
would face even greater difficulties krunic said 
during a discussion that followed krunics speech central 
committee member radovan radonjic submitted his resignation 
claiming the body was largely responsible for the countrys 
problems 
the reforms cannot be implemented by those who created the 
present system radonjic was quoted as saying by the official 
tanjug news agency the reforms can only be carried out by new 
and able men 
ante markovic president of croatia yugoslavias second largest

a senator asked the fbi on wednesday to give 
congress its file on a former pentagon procurement official under 
investigation in connection with alleged fraud and bribery in 
defense purchasing 
the former official melvyn paisley was assistant secretary of 
the navy for research engineering and systems from 1981 through 
1987 
he had worked for boeing corp a major defense contractor for 
28 years before taking the defense department job and became a 
defense consultant after resigning in march 1987 
paisleys consulting office was bugged and his phone tapped 
during the twoyear investigation into allegations that defense 
contractors and consultants many of them former military men 
bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that could be 
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
paisley was approved for the navy job after a nineminute 
hearing nov 18 1981 attended by two members of the 17member 
senate armed services committee the full senate confirmed his 
nomination nov 23 1981 
sen carl levin dmich in a letter to the fbi said press 
accounts of paisleys activities indicated the fbi knew of 
allegations of improper conduct by him while the committee was 
considering the nomination 
as a member of that committee i believe it is important to 
determine just what the fbi knew about mr paisley at the time of 
his senate confirmation and the extent to which that information 
was made available to the senate armed services committee levin 
wrote 
there have been allegations the fbi was told during a background 
check for the appointment that paisley had been involved in making 
questionable payments or gifts while he was at boeing the 
allegations were made by a former associate of paisleys at boeing 
by one of his three exwives and by a former sisterinlaw 
the transcript of the confirmation hearing gives no hint of any 
controversy 
the fbi has refused to release results of the background check 
citing privacy restrictions 
levins staff asked the fbi by telephone last week for access to 
the paisley file the request was passed to the white house which 
denied the request tuesday levin said 
i am therefore now requesting the entire fbi file from you 
levin said in his letter to the bureau 
the current chairman and ranking republican on the armed 
services committee sens sam nunn dga and john warner rva 
said in a statement wednesday night that the committee has 
researched the records it currently holds on paisleys nomination 
those records contain a copy of mr paisleys biography his 
completed financial disclosure forms and associated memoranda and 
the standard letter from him required by the committee concerning 
his financial situation the statement said the committees 
records of the paisley nomination contain no other information 
levin was a member of the armed services committee in 1981 but 
did not attend the hearing 
although he was not there his staff was there because he had 
a conflict in schedule said willie blacklow a levin aide 
asked if the senator believed he had done his duty in 
scrutinizing the nomination blacklow said if youre assertion 
is this was not viewed as a major appointment youre absolutely 
right were finding out a bit differently now 
the only two senators present at the confirmation hearing were 
the late sen henry jackson dwash and roger w jepsen the iowa 
republican who was acting as chairman of the committee jepsen was 
defeated for reelection in 1984 by democrat tom harkin 
the statement by nunn and warner notes that they instituted new 
procedures for reviewing nominees when they took their present 
positions in january 1987 
the new procedures require all nominees to complete an 
extensive questionnaire that requests not only financial 
information but also personal background information according 
to the statement 
the staff director and general counsel are required to advise 
the chairman in writing as well as any other interested members 
as to whether the nominee has a conflict of interest or the 
appearance of a conflict of interest we also require a letter 
from both the office of government ethics and from the department 
of defense general counsel that any nominee does not have a 
conflict of interest the statement said 
we require the counsel to the president to submit a letter to 
the committee that describes the extent of the fbi background 
investigation the conflict of interest review and the tax record 
check the chairman and the ranking minority member review such 
information as the fbi elects to make available when any question 
has been raised and that information may shed light on the issue

torture is systematically used against hundreds of 
political prisoners in somalia amnesty international charged 
thursday in a report on the horn of africa country 
the londonbased human rights organization said somalia was 
subject to a persistent pattern of gross human rights 
violations including routine torture of suspected political 
foes of the government and their longterm and often arbitrary 
detention 
some torture victims were as young as 12 or 14 and were arrested 
for collecting money for the somali national movement which 
opposes the government of president mohamed siad barre the report 
said 
according to testimony of victims torture methods of the 
national security service included bending people double and 
severely beating them electric shock wounding with knives 
suspension upside down sexual assault death threats and tying 
people in sacks and submerging them in water until they nearly 
drowned either in the sea or a water tank 
numerous testimonies spoke of the security service headquarters 
at godka prison in the capital mogadishu as a place of torture 
it is known as the hole a place from which it was extremely 
difficult to escape the report said 
somalia a pastoral country with a population of 53 million 
has had to act as host for about 15 million refugees from drought 
and guerrilla war in neighboring ethiopia it became an independent 
republic in 1960 created from territories colonized by italy and 
britain 
siad barre an army major general seized power in a 1969 coup 
amnesty won the 1977 nobel peace prize it conducts worldwide 
campaigns for the release of nonviolent political prisoners and 
opposition to torture and the death penalty 
the report said although previous amnesty appeals to end torture 
and other grave violations of human rights in somalia received 
little response it was again appealing to siad barre to stop 
torture which it added probably went on during the whole of his 19 
years in power 
amnesty said it was also asking the president to investigate 
recent unlawful killings in hargeisa northern somalia where 
the government is fighting rebels 
the report torture in somalia was based on testimony by 
torture victims corroborated in some cases by medical examination 
ai said 
the report said that in most testimony of torture the victims 
asked their identities be kept secret however it printed the 
testimony of an architect seleiman nuh ali who was arrested in 
1982 tried last february and sentenced to 24 years imprisonment 
after a death sentence was commuted 
nuh ali described how he was driven from godka prison to a beach 
and subjected to four types of torture first being punched then 
framed into a small ball almost breaking my back and having 
his testicles squeezed having water poured into his mouth while 
his nose was clasped so he could not breathe and finally being 
kicked all over his body with heavy boots 
nuh ali said torture continued for two weeks until he agreed to 
confess to political opposition activities 
the report included testimony by an unidentified woman who said 
that after her husband fled to ethiopia and joined an opposition 
movement there she was arrested in 1978 and tortured for about a 
year by being raped repeatedly in godka prison beaten burned 
with cigarettes given electric shocks and submitted to the 
sackinwater torture 
i was later put in solitary confinement for four years the

lawmakers rewriting the constitution 
voted wednesday to exempt small business and farm loans from 
adjustments to inflation which ran nearly 550 percent since the 
loans were made 
legislators doubling as a constituent assembly voted 286163 for 
the exemption on debts incurred between feb 28 1986 and feb 28 
1987 
the article could still be defeated when the complete 
constitution is voted on later this year 
not more than 50000 owed by each business will be pardoned 
under the measure and debtors must pay the principal within three 
months after the constitution goes into effect 
the loans were made under a 1986 government program which was 
aimed at stimulating the economy 
during the program many brazilians believing in a sustained 
economic boom expanded their businesses to meet soaring demand but 
when the program ended as inflation soared brazilians once more 
found themselves mired in a government austerity program pushing 
many small businesses into bankruptcy 
finance minister mailson da nobrega has said if the exemption 
goes ahead the government will pay the costs partially by raising 
taxes the rest he has said will push up the public sector 
deficit now running at about 6 percent of the gross national 
product and fuel inflation which is 20 percent monthly 
the government will cover 80 percent of the cost and private 
banks will cover the balance 
lawmakers are writing the constitution that will replace the 
authoritarian document handed down by military generals in 1969 
brazil returned to civilian rule after 21 years of military 
government in march of 1985

a federal grand jury has subpoenaed northrop 
corp and three top executives for information on a 65 million 
payment the company made to south korean businesses the defense 
contractor said wednesday 
the subpoenas were served tuesday and wednesday said tony 
cantafio a northrop spokesman 
cantafio said the executives ordered to appear before the grand 
jury were thomas v jones northrop chairman and chief executive 
officer welko e gasich an executive vice president and william 
c mcgagh former chief financial officer 
although mcgaghs retirement was announced in april he has been 
working with the company during a transition period the company 
said 
the justice department and a congressional subcommittee is 
investigating northrops payment of more than 65 million to 
korean businesses in connection with attempts to sell its f20 
tigershark jet fighter to the korean military 
eventually northrops program to develop the f20 jet fighter 
failed with development costs estimated at 12 billion and 
without a single plane being sold 
the house energy and commerce subcomittee on investigations is 
investigating whether the payment was intended to buy influence 
rather than build a hotel and office project in seoul as northrop 
contended 
cantafio said in may that the 1984 payment was part of a 
socalled offset program in which northrop was to invest in koreas 
economy in return for receiving the fighter contract such 
arangements are common among aerospace companies dealing with 
developing companies and are allowed by us law he said 
northrop denying it violated the foreign corrupt practices act 
has portrayed itself as a victim of fraud by its korean partners in 
the hotel venture 
we made this investment in 1984 in good faith and to show our 
commitment to korea on the f20 project cantafio said wednesday 
we made several attempts to get the hotel built but our partners 
delayed the project when it became clear we werent going to get 
the hotel built we tried to get our money back by going to 
arbitration in korea 
a call to the us attorneys office went unanswered after

michael dukakis screened vice presidential running mates on 
wednesday telling reporters afterward were making progress 
president reagan meanwhile tore into the likely democratic 
presidential nominee as a true liberal bent on more taxing and 
spending 
vice president george bush certain to be the republican 
presidential nominee this fall said the next administration must 
be prepared to seize the opportunity of change in the soviet 
union he said the reagan administrations military buildup had 
helped nudge the soviet union toward openness but he added the 
cold war is not over 
bush made his way from california to wisconsin as a two new 
polls suggested he was closing in his democratic rival the surveys 
stood in contrast to several polls in recent weeks that put 
dukakis lead in double digits 
an abcmoney magazine survey of 1013 adults last week found 45 
percent support for dukakis and 42 percent for bush a tie given 
the margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points 
another poll this one taken over the weekend by the gallup 
organization indicated dukakis had 46 percent to bushs 41 
percent the poll of 1210 voters which had a margin of error of 3 
percentage points was published in wednesdays editions of the san 
francisco chronicle 
in another development new jersey gov thomas kean announced 
that he will deliver the keynote address at the gop national 
convention in new orleans in august kean who was overwhelmingly 
reelected governor in 1985 with support from blacks and union 
members said he would use his prime time speech to show there is 
a tremendous difference between the two parties 
but there was also some difference within the party sen gordon 
humphrey of new hampshire saying keans selection as keynote 
speaker was an affront to the righttolife movement 
threatened to stage a walkout at the gop convention if a 
righttolife partisan doesnt get equal time 
the republican developments came as dukakis was spending the 
better part of his day in the capitol in washington meeting some 
lawmakers in groups and others individually as the search for a 
running mate intensified 
i cant say at this point if im close or not so close things 
have a way of sorting themselves out dukakis said after his 
series of meetings were making progress ill be talking with 
other possible vice presidential candidates 
sen sam nunn favored by many in congress for his southern base 
and his conservative political beliefs said he was never offered 
the vice presidency during a hourlong private talk with dukakis 
but told the likely democratic presidential nominee he wasnt 
interested 
i cherish my independence and the nature of the vice 
presidency is a very different job nunn told reporters after 
spending an hour with dukakis i enjoy making my own decisions 
he said dukakis accepted nunns desires and did it very 
graciously 
nunn is the second prominent democrat to take himself out of the 
running for runnerup on the ticket following new jersey sen bill 
bradley 
dukakis aides went to unusual lengths to keep the governors 
agenda private reporters were not told in advance who the 
massachusetts governor was meeting and when a list was circulated 
at days end it did not say which lawmakers met privately and 
which in large groups nor were reporters permitted to wait outside 
the room just off the senate floor where dukakis set up his 
temporary office 
one man prominently mentioned in the vice presidential 
speculation sen john glenn of ohio met privately with dukakis 
the two were scheduled to campaign together in ohio on friday 
others mentioned as potential running mates include sens lloyd 
bentsen of texas bob graham of florida and dale bumpers of 
arkansas as well as reps richard gephardt of missouri lee 
hamilton of indiana and tom foley of washington although sources 
said foley had decided not to provide background information 
requested by dukakis aides 
jesse jackson also has been asked to provide information about 
himself but dukakis aides widely discount the possibility that he 
will be offered a spot on the ticket 
for his part jackson said he will spend much of the next week 
in private deliberating with his family about a possible vice 
presidential nomination and working to free us hostages in the 
middle east jackson had said previously that he already had made 
up his mind about the vice presidency 
dukakis worked on completing his ticket for the fall as an 
associated press survey of the delegates to the democratic 
convention showed no clear consensus on a vice presidential pick 
of 1200 delegates responding thus far to the survey 534 said 
they had no preference nunn had the support of 163 followed by 
jackson with 135 most of whom will go to the convention supporting 
him for president glenn was supported by 106 delegates 
in florda reagan entered the campaign with a partisan vigor 
unseen since his 1986 bid to reelect republican senators 
what the 1988 elections are all about is whether we continue 
to build on that progress of his administration and move ahead to 
an even brighter future or whether we hesitate and return to those 
wornout policies that bring high taxes low growth and a loss of 
direction and purpose he said as he campaigned for senate 
candidate connie mack 
he added that the man leading the democratic ticket is a true 
liberal who instead of controlling government spending raises 
taxes 
reagan said that dukakis has spent every dime and more of the 
revenue generated in his state by the reaganbush economic 
recovery and since 1986 while the federal budget deficit has been 
cut sharply his deficit in massachusetts has ballooned 
despite reagans allegation records show there hasnt been a 
deficit in massachusetts since 1982 when dukakis inherited one 
from outgoing gov edward king 
with all due respect i think the presidents confused 
dukakis said on learning of reagans remarks it is this 
administration that has given us more red ink than all the previous 
administrations from george washington to jimmy carter combined it 
is this administration that has raised taxes four times in the last 
six years 
bush concentrated on foreign policy in his speech in california 
saying that the sweeping changes proposed on tuesday by soviet 
general secretary mikhail gorbachev were revolutionary 
bush said the changes taking place in the soviet union didnt 
take place in a vacuum but in the context of reinvigorated american 
strength 
he added my point is this it was eight years of american 
strength that confronted the soviet union with the true costs of 
aggression and necessity of reform 
bush said the proposals forwarded by gorbachev on wednesday 
should be watched with guarded optimism 
but he said weve got to remember that the cold war is not 
over

the american medical association voted wednesday 
to test creation of a new type of hospital worker who would handle 
chores such as taking vital signs bathing patients and changing 
bandages 
the proposal for the new category of workers called registered 
care technologists comes in response to the nationwide shortage of 
nurses but the plan drew strong opposition from a major nursing 
group 
the amas 420member house of delegates also called for major 
changes in the nations war on drugs and approved a detailed plan 
for reforming the nations medicaid health insurance program for 
the poor 
the decisions by the policymaking arm of the nations largest 
doctors organization with 295000 members were made by voice vote 
the plan for the new type of worker was opposed by the american 
nurses association which maintains that the answer to the nursing 
shortage is higher salaries and better working conditions 
i really am appalled that in the face of opposition from all 
of organized nursing that medicine has gone ahead with this 
decision said judith ryan executive director of the american 
nurses association 
the house of delegates rejected an attempt to delay the pilot 
project to allow more time for study 
the new workers would receive from two months to 18 months of 
training 
nurses argued that isnt enough training and said the 
technologists would duplicate the role now played by nursing 
assistants licensed practical nurses and technical registered 
nurses 
in regard to drug trafficking the delegates rejected efforts to 
delay action on a report calling for major changes in the war on 
drugs the ama said the united states is losing the war to rich 
sophisticated drug traffickers 
the delegates said real progress will only be made by 
shifting the attack from catching smugglers to treating abusers 
several doctors complained they hadnt had enough time to study 
the proposal but many more delegates said the problem was too 
urgent to delay action 
it is a farsighted report and it would be a tragedy if it 
were not adopted said dr saul levin of sacramento calif 
this is a major issue before this country said dr lonnie 
bristow an ama trustee from berkeley calif we are saying this 
nation does have the will to overcome the drug problem but it 
simply has the wrong game plan 
we must approach the demand side of this problem by treating 
those who are sick and thereby reducing the demand for those 
who traffick in this filthy product bristow said 
with an estimated 30 billion to 100 billion in annual revenue 
drug traffickers can counteract federal crackdowns the ama report 
says 
they can acquire sophisticated technology bribe public 
officials and recruit new members it contends real progress 
is likely to come only from a major shift in primary emphasis away 
from supplyreduction and enforcement strategies and toward 
demandreduction strategies 
shifting their attention to another pressing social problem 
uneven medical care for the poor the ama policymakers proposed 
creating uniform nationwide eligibility standards for medicaid and 
uniform payments for medical care 
the delegates voted to lobby the federal government to create 
the standards and expand medicaid to cover an additional 27 million 
poor people at an increased annual cost of 24 billion at 1988 
spending levels the program administered by state governments 
covers an estimated 19 million poor people at a projected cost of 
52 billion in 1988 
an ama report on medicaid said the program is in desperate 
need of reform because the lack of national standards has bred 
severe inequities in the level of medical care benefits 
provided to poor people 
in other action wednesday the house of delegates 
continued the amas war on tobacco approving a proposal to 
lobby congress to double the federal tax on cigarettes from 16 
cents per pack to 32 cents 
called on state and federal governments to reform the court 
system to limit the amount of money awarded in product liability 
lawsuits a report approved by the delegates contends that 
biomedical companies are holding off on developing new vaccines 
drugs and other potentially lifesaving technologies because 
they are afraid of being sued 
the drug policy approved wednesday recommends that the federal 
government expand drug abuse treatment programs ease regulations 
to permit private doctors to treat opiate addicts with methadone 
and increase drug education programs aimed at adolescents 
the policy also calls on the president to appoint a 
highranking official of the executive branch to coordinate federal 
drug policy to keep rival agencies from working at crosspurposes

customs agents have arrested a british man who 
allegedly schemed with the iranian ambassador to spain to illegally 
ship 10 militarytype helicopters to iran authorities said 
wednesday 
the arrest of colin breeze has apparently ended attempts to lure 
other conspirators into the country said patrick obrien head of 
the us customs service here but he said agents suspect the 
operation was part of a larger network 
we are continuing the investigation to look for diversions of 
military equipment to iran obrien said but refused to give 
other details 
breeze a 33yearold british citizen was held without bond in 
the metropolitan correctional center south of here after the 
federal government declared him a risk of flight 
he is accused of trying to smuggle 10 sikorsky s36 helicopters 
to iran by arranging to have them sold to a european company 
secretly owned by the iranian government obrien said 
us law forbids exporting arms without a permit 
irans ambassador to spain was helping arrange the deal and 
intended to take a cut from the 30 million sale to his own 
government said obrien 
the 10 sikorsky helicopters were originally sold to the 
jordanian air force in 1979 and 1980 six were later traded back to 
sikorsky but remained in jordan and all 10 were for sale at 
675000 each 
sikorsky spokesman bob stangarone in stratford conn confirmed 
that the company owned the six helicopters but said it had never 
dealt with breeze 
the s36 is a militarytype helicopter said obrien they 
are basically a troop carrier a civilian version of the blackhawk 
these things are great over the desert 
in may the affidavit said breeze approached a confidential 
informant for the customs service about buying the helicopters for 
iran the informant advised customs and coversations between the 
two were taped by authorities 
in the conversations some of which took place in spain and some 
in the united kingdom breeze told the informant the ultimate 
purchaser was iran 
breeze further advised that negotiations for the purchase were 
being conducted through a spanish national middleman and the 
iranian embassy in madrid customs agent thomas bailey said in 
the affidavit 
last week breeze told the informant that the sales agreement 
was on its way by diplomatic pouch from madrid to iran for final 
approval but he later said it was held up because the ambassador 
was insisting on a larger share of the profits 
frankly its standard in these iranian cases said obrien 
they raise their price at the last minute 
breeze was arrested tuesday at the fort lauderdale airport 
because authorities were afraid he was about to leave the country 
he was taken before a us magistrate and was scheduled for a full 
hearing friday

police have stepped up patrols around 
arabowned businesses after the slaying of a black man by an arab 
grocery clerk sparked several firebombings police and community 
leaders said wednesday 
everybodys got bad feelings and these come from isolated 
incidents said patricia a blackmon the citys chief prosecutor 
ms blackmon who has met with community groups in recent days 
seeking to calm racial tensions said blacks are demanding higher 
quality food lower prices and more courtesy from arab shopkeepers 
arab shopkeepers representing egyptians lebanese iranians and 
palestinians have complained of repeated thefts and slow response 
time by police ms blackmon said 
tensions erupted june 18 when a black man james slaughter 31 
was shot and killed by an arab clerk eiab taher 33 who was 
charged with involuntary manslaughter the following night a crowd 
ransacked the store in apparent retaliation 
the tensions have resulted in a rash of firebombings of 
arabowned businesses including one store set afire three times in 
as many weeks authorities said 
in response police have increased patrols in black 
neighborhoods where arabs have businesses and police community 
relations specialists are working with community leaders on the 
problem said detective robert bolton a police spokesman 
we dont want it to escalate to anything if there are 
problems that have to be fixed thats fine bolton said 
city council member helen knipe smith whose district includes 
the neighborhood where an arab store was firebombed said most of 
the grocers and small delis in the area are operated by arabs 
she said the arabs follow the jews irish italians and blacks 
who in succession operated familyrun businesses in the citys 
ghettoes 
she blamed tensions on a need by ghetto businesses to charge 
higher prices than larger chain stores operating in the suburbs and 
a concern by arabs about crime 
mayor george v voinovich said the city has increased health 
inspections at groceries 
neither the proprietors of stores or any member of our 
community should take the law into their own hands he said 
in response to the tensions the cleveland community relations 
board has formed a joint arabblack committee to improve relations

somali rebels have appealed to the united 
nations to investigate purported government massacres in the 
wartorn north and organize massive relief aid for other victims a 
guerrilla spokesman said wednesday 
ahmed mohamed silanyo somali national movement chairman wrote 
to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on saturday 
urging him to seek an independent evaluation of drugs and food 
needed by civilians caught in the cross fire in the past month 
according to a copy of the fourpage letter 
the inhabitants of towns and settlements which have been and 
are still being indiscriminately shelled and bombed from the air 
are currently unable to defend themselves silanyo said they 
look to the united nations and world opinion to protect them 
silanyo sent the letter from his exile headquarters in london 
and a rebel official delivered a copy to the associated press in 
nairobi 
in it silanyo said water and power supplies were cut in many 
areas unburied decomposing corpses in streets threatened to 
trigger a cholera epidemic food was scarce and medical supplies 
virtually exhausted 
silanyo renewed rebel claims that they control key northern 
centers including hargeisa somalias second largest city and the 
regional capital of burao since mounting a major offensive against 
president siad barres army late may 
in retaliation he wrote warplanes bombed civilians in villages 
and troops massacred suspected rebel sympathizers many through 
summary executions in public 
barres government repeatedly has denied atrocity charges 
accusing the insurgents of killing civilians and looting the 
government insists that since last week its troops have been 
controlling all northern centers 
but foreign travelers who arrived this week in nairobi the 
kenyan capital from neighboring somalia said rebels were holding 
on to burao and other towns while fighting continued for hargeisa 
the westerners who spoke on condition of anonymity also said a 
dusk to dawn curfew was still in force in the capital mogadishu 
they said troops there were commandeering vehicles including those 
owned by foreign aid workers 
silanyo a former cabinet member in barres government helped 
form the somali national movement seven years ago 
barre seized power in a 1969 coup since 1977 he has been a 
staunch african ally of the united states

police knew 3 months ago that one of four people 
slain this week in a dispute among radical polygamists had been 
threatened with death an investigator says 
we were contacted march 10 and we conducted a preliminary 
investigation into the threat against mark chynoweth homicide 
lt richard holland said tuesday he declined to say who contacted 
the homicide division 
we didnt pick anyone up for questioning he said 
police on wednesday guarded frightened relatives of the four 
victims former followers of the late ervil lebaron a polygamous 
cult leader whose current followers operate from mexico 
no arrests have been made in the slayings which holland 
characterized as the work of religious extremists 
local authorities and the fbi searched for three brothers for 
questioning in the case one is heber lebaron who is wanted in a 
1986 bank robbery in richardson he fled after being released on 
bail officials said police also sought aaron lebaron 20 and 
andrew lebaron 28 
in addition to mark chynoweth 36 his brother duane chynoweth 
31 and duanes daughter jennifer 8 were slain monday in 
houston in the dallas suburb of irving eddie marston 32 another 
former cult member was gunned down at almost the same time 
investigators are trying to determine if mondays slayings were 
directly related to the chynoweths past involvement with ervil 
lebaron 
ervil lebaron founder of the church of the lamb of god a 
radical polygamist group believed responsible for more than 20 
killings died in prison in utah in 1981 
before his death lebaron targeted a number of people for death 
primarily for being unfaithful to his preaching his daughter 
lillian chynoweth told the salt lake city tribune in october 
the victims had been followers of lebaron but had broken from 
the religious zealot after his 1980 conviction on a charge of 
conspiracy to commit murder marston was a stepson and ervil had 
been married to the chynoweths sister rena 
holland said investigators believe others in the houston area

michael dukakis hoping to underscore the 
impact of this years dry weather got a firsthand look at a 
relatively healthy corn field wednesday but stressed the 
importance of pulling together to help farmers suffering from 
drought 
this is a problem that affects farmers and farm communities 
and farm states and consumers dukakis said we are very much a 
part of this were one nation and one community and one family 
his comments came as dukakis made a brief stop at the howard 
hughes farm just south of des moines 
hughes conceded he was a little embarrassed to have his farm 
be the staging ground for a visit aimed at pointing up drought 
problems because rain just fell on his 160acre farm and the corn 
is nearly seven feet high 
my corn does look pretty good hughes said 
though hughes farm isnt the most hardhit in the state it 
does have at least one major tactical advantage its located about 
four miles from the end of the runway at the des moines airport and 
quickly accessible for dukakis motorcade 
dukakis spoke to about 250 people under threatening skies and in 
chilly weather that caused many to don sweaters 
i dont know whether those storm clouds overhead mean dukakis 
brings good fortune he said i hope so 
dukakis was accompanied on the tour by illinois sen paul simon 
a former rival for the nomination who appealed for party unity 
there is a time to fight and a time to heal simon said 
after a brief round of speeches dukakis was led on a tour of 
the farm and told by hughes that the apparently healthy corn 
wouldnt last long without rain although he conceded it has a lush 
appearance 
just under an inch of rain fell on the hughes farm overnight 
and that comes on top of a 25 inch downpour earlier in the month 
what this does is its kind of a tantalizing rain hughes 
said it prolongs things and it makes my corn look better 
simon warned reporters not to jump to any quick conclusions 
about the status of the crop simply because it looked good 
dont get any false impressions even though that corn looks 
better simon said 
vice president george bush the certain republican nominee had 
a similar farm visit in wisconsin on wednesday 
hughes said his farm presents a fairly lush backdrop for a 
drought tour really im a little embarrassed by it he said 
but he said even crops which look good now will soon be 
threatened by dry weather 
this is a point that were going to have to drive home real 
hard with people who arent familiar with farming hughes said 
my corn is six or seven feet high and getting ready to tassel 
but if we have some more searing heat and no rain i dont have 
stalks with enough vigor to produce ears 
hughes said recent rainfalls are far too little and too 
scattered to do much about ending this years drought 
it gives me a few more days over the farmer who didnt get 
any he said 
to illustrate how fickle these rains are i have a dear friend 
just north of here who only got twohundredths while indianola just 
south of here got an inch its just in a little pocket hughes 
said

democrat michael dukakis met with senators 
wednesday in his search for a vice presidential candidate and was 
told by one sam nunn of georgia to count him out 
i cant say at this point if im close or not so close things 
have a way of sorting themselves out dukakis said after his 
series of meetings were making progress ill be talking with 
other possible vice presidential candidates 
the allbutcertain presidential nominee spent an hour in 
private with nunn a favorite of southern and conservative 
democrats during a day filled with private meetings on capitol 
hill including individual sessions with at least three other 
possible running mates 
i told governor dukakis that i was honored to be considered 
to be on the list nunn said i told him i was still not 
interested in the vice presidency 
dukakis also met privately with sens john glenn of ohio lloyd 
bentsen of texas and bob graham of florida he told reporters while 
leaving the capitol 
he said he would be back in a week or so to meet with other 
potential candidates 
nunn had previously indicated a lack of interest in the post 
but he had been pushed by conservative democrats who want a 
geographic and ideological balance on the ticket the meeting with 
the likely nominee enabled nunn to relay his decision in person 
he accepted the decision and he did it very graciously nunn 
said 
the two then discussed seven or eight other potential vice 
presidential candidates nunn said 
the georgia senator is the second major prospective candidate to 
take himself out of the running sen bill bradley dnj 
recently withdrew from consideration 
nunn said his move should not be taken as a reflection of 
dukakis my feeling on the subject had absolutely nothing to do 
with governor dukakis he said 
despite the rejection dukakis said he had a good day a very 
helpful day 
i cannot emphasize too much the kind of cooperation and 
response that ive gotten its been terrific he said 
the massachusetts governor met with 29 senators and nine house 
members including some of the lawmakers often mentioned as 
potential running mates bentsen glenn graham and rep tom 
foley dwash 
glenn who figures high in the vice presidential speculation 
declined to comment he was flying home to ohio to appear friday 
with dukakis who was stopping in dayton on a midwest campaign 
swing said a spokesman who declined to be identified 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee whose democratic presidential 
campaign failed to catch fire outside the south was not invited to 
meet with dukakis said gore press secretary mike kopp 
foley met with dukakis during the governors lunch with a group 
of agriculture committee members he said they did not discuss the 
vice presidency but added that he would meet again with dukakis in 
a week or so foley declined to comment when asked if he had turned 
over background information to the dukakis campaign 
dukakis shuttled from meeting to meeting through corridors 
cleared of bystanders by capitol police and he said nothing on the 
few occasions reporters caught glimpses of him 
dukakis later departed on a fivestate campaign swing through 
the midwest 
accompanying dukakis was his senior adviser paul brountas who 
is leading the campaigns search for a running mate and is heading 
a team of lawyers who are reviewing financial records and other 
information about prospective candidates brountas and other aides 
left the room during the nunn meeting 
nunn told reporters after his meeting with dukakis that he had 
taken himself out of the running because he prefers his senate job 
to the vice presidency 
i cherish my independence and the nature of the vice 
presidency is a very different job i enjoy making my own 
decisions nunn said 
nunn was among the democrats asked by the dukakis campaign to 
supply personal and financial disclosure information he declined 
i considered filling out forms to be essentially a job 
application and theres no reason to do that if youre not 
interested in the job nunn said 
he said that although dukakis urged me to keep my hat in the 
ring he did not engage in any form of pressure or armtwisting 
he made no move for my arm nunn said 
he said that at no point did dukakis ever directly ask him to be 
his running mate i would not have put him in that position 
nunn said 
dukakis press secretary dayton duncan said that dukakis did not 
have a deadline for selecting the running mate and planned to 
return july 13 for meetings with house members that would be five 
days before the democratic national convention opens in atlanta 
he doesnt feel like hes under any timetable or deadline 
duncan said 
dukakis met first with a group including most of the 16 senate 
democrats facing reelection races this year a group that included 
bentsen 
sen john kerry dmass said they discussed the vice 
presidency without mentioning names 
he said the process is still open and hes enjoying the 
process kerry said he said dukakis invited suggestions on a 
running mate 
dukakis also held a lunch with nine democratic members of the 
senate agriculture committee and 10 members of the house 
agriculture committee to discuss the drought in farm states 
later dukakis toured the farm of howard hughes near norwalk 
iowa the farm actually got some rain the night before but hughes 
said even if his corn crop looks healthy now it wont produce ears 
if it doesnt rain some more and soon 
hughes said some farms in the state were much harder hit by the 
drought than his but his farm is only about four miles from the 
des moines airport and lent itself to a quick campaignstyle stop 
this is a problem that affects farmers and farm communities 
and farm states and consumers dukakis said after a brief tour 
we are very much a part of this were one nation and one 
community and one family 
dukakis spoke in chilly weather under skies threatening rain 
i dont know whether those storm clouds overhead mean dukakis 
brings good fortune he said i hope so

with the economic scene calming down after a 
succession of crises trade imbalance falling dollar recession 
threat the current big concern of economic worry warts is a 
familiar one inflation 
from researchers at drexel burnham lambert inc comes an 
economic flash about early signs of wage acceleration 
service sector wages it states have accelerated significantly in 
the past three months 
the pervasive drought adds urgency to the inflation message 
since commodity prices could force increases in the consumer price 
index 
jack lavery of merrill lynch amp co comments that enough damage 
has already been done to corn wheat and soybean crops to 
accelerate foodprice increases this year although the full extent 
of the damage remains to be seen 
at donaldson lufkin amp jenrette it isnt only drought that 
produces worries our concerns about inflation have never been 
based on the weather say researchers there 
instead they observe that apparel prices are higher than they 
were a year ago gasoline and fueloil prices have risen for 
several months and medical care costs have continued to set 
records as they have for years 
the worriers fall into two distinct camps those who fear 
inflation via higher commodity prices or wages are citing a 
costpush scenario others fear the threat is from demandpull as 
from high levels of consumer demand 
while the worriers might not be growing in number they are 
shouting louder and in the otherwise quieter economic setting that 
has evolved in the past month their voices are carrying farther 
are they worth listening to 
other commentators observe that there is always an inflation 
threat it is ever present ready to end any economic expansion if 
allowed to gain headway you can always cite it as a threat they 
say it is always available for duty 
costpush inflation scenarios dont make economic sense 
according to a paper released a few days ago by the us chamber of 
commerce it explains 
sellers to the final consumer can only raise prices if 
competitors and consumers are willing to go along otherwise 
sellers must absorb cost increases by cutting other costs or 
accepting lower profits 
right now it states competition is intense among sellers the 
latter are more concerned about meeting competitor prices than they 
are about raising margins they are fighting for a limited number 
of consumer dollars 
it is true that wages show signs of rising but there are few 
indications that they are rising faster than productivity 
offsetting the wage pressure the antiinflationists contend is 
growth in the nations capacity to produce as well as an increase 
in productivity money is being spent on enlarging capacity and on 
making it more efficient 
the core rate of inflation has been remarkably stable says 
edward yardeni economist at prudentialbache securities inc since 
1985 he states it has hovered between 4 percent and 45 percent 
some things have risen others have fallen 
he attributes this partly to investment in new facilities and 
demographics as well he asserts that the nations problems with 
babyboomers have ended at least in the production of goods 
in retrospect those problems were enormous youngsters flooded 
the labor markets they were inexperienced they were inefficient 
producers and because there were so many available business 
didnt bother with efficiencies 
now its different says yardeni the shortage of young job 
seekers will force businesses to invest in laborsaving and 
productivityenhancing plants and equipment and efficient 
production is antiinflationary 
will that stop the inflation worries not likely at least until 
something bigger seizes the stage

the number of women in seminaries continues to 
increase while the number of men decreases with some predictions 
that by the year 2000 a fourth of mainline protestant pastors will 
be women 
women still encounter some resistance in roles as church 
leaders while male clergy are tending to be older nonetheless 
the ecclesiatical presence of women spreads as do the gray hairs 
among male ministers 
summing up statistics for the 198788 crop of seminarians the 
association of theological schools says women now constitute 27 
percent of total enrollment 
fifteen years ago when inclusive figures first were gathered 
women amounted to only 10 percent of enrollment 15 years ago 
compared to an enrollment then of 3358 the ranks of women have 
swelled fourfold to 15310 up 3 percent this year but the overall 
enrollment was down by 1 percent to 55766 
it was the third straight year of overall decline as men became 
a gradually shrinking majority in 20l protestant and roman catholic 
seminaries while the proportion and numbers of women rose in 
contrast 
despite the increase in their numbers women say they still face 
obstacles as clergy in the united church of christ which has the 
largest number of women totalling 1460 a survey found that 61 
percent say theyve been turned down for jobs because of their 
gender 
however the rev ann cordray a united church pastor in miami 
says theres a great deal more openness toward women leadership 
in the church than we had for a while 
most other major protestant bodies united methodist 
episcopal presbyterian and lutheran now admit women to 
ordination although theyre barred from it in roman catholicism 
and eastern orthodoxy 
roman catholic study of the issue is advocated in a new bishops 
draft paper on women 
the international bulletin of missionary research forecasts that 
by the end of the next decade one out of four pastors in mainline 
protestant congregations will be women 
an encouraging note among male catholic seminarians came in a 
nationwide survey that found them more satisfied with their 
training than their counterparts about 20 years ago 
for example 88 percent considered their training very 
relevant or fairly relevant while only 68 percent did so in 
1966 a majority of those studying for the priesthood 58 percent 
approved women being in seminaries 
the findings show much greater satisfaction and more 
confidence among catholic seminarians say the researchers the 
rev eugene hemrick and sociologist dean hoge of washington 
meanwhile the average age of male seminarians has increased 
from 22 to 32 with an increasing proportion of delayed 
vocations men who have worked in other careers and then switched 
to study for the ministry 
fourteen percent of seminarians are over 40 
the rev hugh thompson now minister of oakwood forest christian 
church in kingsport tenn had been an accountant before he gave 
up a lucrative job to pursue seminary training 
im sure my friends thought id gone off my rocker he says 
noting that the seminary years drained his familys finances but 
any financial loss has been more than compensated 
he says concentrating on making money can be a disillusioning 
addiction however he says ministers who previously have worked in 
the secular atmosphere arent shocked by what they find in the 
world because theyve been there 
the rev jack mcwhirter now pastor of concordia lutheran church 
in kingsport had been a teacher before entering the ministry 
i think it gave me a little more mature look at the 
congregations needs he says a better balanced way of 
ministering to people

proliferating holocaust memorials about the nazi

klein director of the international center for holocaust 
studies of the antidefamation league of bnai brith says any 
reconstruction of the past mediates if not erases history because 
memory is selective 
the holocaust particuarly lends itself to historical

mary ann pascal had never given acting a 
thought but because of her voluptuous beauty people kept assuming 
she was an actress 
i never trained as an actress i never thought about it until 
i was 26 said pascal who stars on the showtime comedy series 
brothers 
i was working in a boutique learning the business so i could 
open my own place but when you look like i do people always 
assume youre an actress anywhere else i suppose theyd think 
you were somebodys mistress a man who later became one of my 
managers said i really should try acting 
it quickly fell into place for her she got a job on her first 
interview which got her into the screen actors guild she was cast 
as a hammerettes one of the women executive producer jay 
bernstein hired to walk through mickey spillanes mike hammer 
obviously these women are not brain surgeons said pascal 
i went to fredericks of hollywood and bought a pushup bra i 
looked exactly like what i was supposed to look afterward i 
burned the bra and told my agent i didnt want any more parts like 
that 
she did guest shots on hotel knight rider and 
remington steele 
brothers was her first comedy and her first time before an 
audience 
when tuesday night came around i was trembling she said 
thered be 600 eyes on me they say that after a while it becomes 
like nothing and it does now it gives me adrenalin and energy 
but in the beginning it was terrifying 
now that ive done drama and comedy id pick comedy every 
time the hours are so much better you can lead a normal life 
around it 
since then shes also had roles on night court crime 
story and the tv movie blood vows a mafia wifes story 
pascal is married to michael pascal marketing executive of the 
golden nugget hotel and casino she lives in las vegas and is 
unofficial hostess of the casino she commutes to los angeles for 
filming 
because of some unsavory fan mail she is taking pistol lessons 
and practicing her marksmanship i play this very sexy person 
she said and people who dont have a good grip on reality 
confuse me with the character im a happily married woman and have 
been for almost 10 years 
pascal stars on brothers as sam the girlfriend of joe 
waters robert walden the show focuses on three brothers played 
by walden brandon maggart and paul regina reginas character is 
gay as is a family friend played by philip charles mackenzie 
hallie todd plays waldens collegeage daughter 
brothers opened its fifth season on showtime last friday 
with sam announcing she was pregnant 
my character is so full of herself said pascal she cant 
believe that no one would drop dead to marry her but she and joe 
decide to get married on the next show theyre already married 
the baby will be born on the 10th episode of the season which 
will be the 100th episode for the series 
the fly in the ointment however is that only three shows were 
taped for the new season before the writers strike if the show is 
forced to go into reruns after the third show the producers will 
select best shows from the past seasons 
brothers will go into syndication in the fall of 1989 
theyre getting into more boygirl relationships so it will have 
broader appeal for syndication said pascal theyre diluting 
the gay theme 
pascal who was born in new york and grew up there and in 
florida said acting is work but that being hostess at the golden 
nugget is play 
after she was persuaded to become an actress she said i had 
visions of what i would be i thought of dynasty i imagined id 
be alexis and i end up as lucy when i was a kid all i wanted to 
be was a nun

kevin anderson came to fame as the wild 
youthful kidnapper in the play and film orphans however his 
new movie miles from home shows the actors more taciturn 
side 
this guy is so quiet the 28yearold anderson said most 
of the time i just had to try to exist to be there and to listen 
anderson talked about the movie in an interview at the recent 
cannes film festival where the 6 million movie had its world 
premiere in may 
scheduled for an american release in october from cinecom the 
film costars anderson and richard gere as two brothers on a family 
farm in iowa who destroy their property rather than face 
foreclosure on it 
gere is the impulsive older brother frank roberts a man quick 
to take action regardless of the consequences anderson is the 
shyer more tentative terry who comes to respect his brother as 
they become joint outlaws on the run 
the film drew mixed reviews at cannes for its somewhat dogged 
earnestness but there was general acclaim for andersons ability 
to make passivity engaging in a film that puts two brothers 
centerscreen as orphans did 
maybe theres some brother hangup i need to work out 
joked the softspoken actor himself the youngest of three brothers 
from gurnee ill 
however there are differences between the parts it was 
difficult to find the arc of terry because he is largely silent 
he said of miles from home which marks the film directing 
debut of gary sinise a longtime colleague of anderson from their 
days at chicagos steppenwolf theater company 
in orphans i was so soundly rooted in the character i 
didnt have to worry about nerves he said of the earlier film 
which began life as a lyle kessler play for steppenwolf directed 
by sinise and acclaimed in chicago new york and london 
the film directed by alan pakula and costarring matthew modine 
and albert finney fared less well reviews were mixedtogood but 
the box office was low contrary to the hopes of its star whose 
prior movie credits were limited to one line in the popular comedy 
risky business 
i received a lot of attention for orphans onstage so i 
really wanted the movie to be special anderson said i was 
very disappointed the studio kind of gave up on it 
anderson will also be seen this year in ray silvers a walk on 
the moon playing a peace corps volunteer in ecuador in 1969 his 
costar terry kinney is a steppenwolf alumnus who has a 
supporting role in miles from home alongside other chicago 
talents such as moira harris francis guinan and in a vivid cameo 
john malkovich 
despite his increased screen exposure anderson remains attached 
to the stage last december he headed an exemplary company of 
young new york actors in an offbroadway revival of michael 
wellers moonchildren 
he is currently playing the celebrated gigolo of the title in a 
revival of the musical pal joey at chicagos goodman theater 
the richard rodgers and lorenz hart classic costarring carlin 
glynn runs through aug 7 with the chance of an extension 
anderson said he was enjoying reprising one of broadways most 
famous cads in a bitter and pungent show considered ahead of its 
time when it opened in 1940 what the stage cant offer in salary 
it makes up for in quality he said 
you have to work on something he said and for me there 
are so many lousy movie scripts that you might as soon do a decent 
play than some lousy movie

on the surface nelson peltz might seem like 
just another corporate raider 
he got where he is today heading the worlds largest consumer 
packaging concern triangle industries inc through a series of 
acquisitions financed largely through the personal services of 
drexel burnham lambert incs junkbond whiz michael milken 
milken also has provided muchneeded leverage for many other 
takeover strategists like carl c icahn who incidentally lives 
near peltz in the verdant westchester county suburbs of new york 
but peltz parts company from icahn and others who sell off parts 
of their newly acquired companies for quick profits and displace 
many of the target companys workers 
our goal is to buy companies and build it up the 
46yearold peltz said in a recent interview i invest in a 
business make it grow and make sure it competes 
we dont like to strip a company to tear it apart 
since peltz and longtime associate peter may gained control of 
triangle in 1983 after working for peltzs familyowned 
foodsupply business in new jersey the company has expanded from a 
copperwire and cable manufacturer with annual sales of 264 
million to a packaging giant with more than 4 billion in sales 
in fact most people can barely go a day without coming in 
contact with a trianglemade beer bottle soda can toothpaste tube 
or potato chip bag 
when peltz took the helm at triangle the company was low in 
money it didnt have too bright a future and needed direction 
the previous management had promised to liquidate the wire and 
cable division that would have meant 1000 people out of work we 
didnt liquidate the business we kept it going and rebuilt it 
peltz was determined to rebuild the entire company he amassed 
his packaging empire by gobbling up national can corp in 1985 and 
purchasing american can cos packaging business a year later 
peltz and may are now in the process of increasing to 80 percent 
their voting shares of triangle by having a smaller subsidiary cji 
industries inc buy the parent 
its like watching a baby grow he said with a touch of 
pride admitting that hed like another addition to his business 
family were always looking at all kinds of things 
it is with that same vision and gusto that peltz has approached 
his latest rebuilding project helping the nations homeless 
get back on their feet through transitional housing financed by big 
business 
peltz was recruited more than a year ago by tipper gore wife of 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee to help fund a nationwide tour 
for an exhibit of photographs aimed at raising the publics 
awareness of americas homeless 
his own interest piqued he decided to go a step further with 
the building proposal 
such a civicminded task might seem a bit out of character for a 
wealthy industrialist like peltz who is used to the good things in 
life posh new york offices decorated with expensive antiques and 
paintings a private corporate chef a large homestead outside of 
new york city and a second home in florida shared with his 
formermodel wife claudia and four children 
but the brooklynborn peltz said he is touched by the plight of 
the homeless and besides his keen business sense tells him that 
if something isnt done now to stem this growing social problem 
big businesses will undoubtedly have to pay somewhere down the line 
through higher taxes 
the government clearly is not going to spend the money i 
dont know if the government is capable of doing enough peltz 
said they big corporations have to take an active role because 
its a problem we face 
peltzs goal is to eventually build transitional multifamily 
homes for the homeless in major us cities with each facility 
housing between 30 to 40 families he estimates each building would 
cost half a million dollars 
although still in its factfinding stage peltz has been 
circulating a slick coffeetable book based on the homeless 
in america exhibit to big corporations to garner their support 
peltz has even tapped the same washingtonbased lobbying group 
involved in his efforts to promote highyield highrisk junk bonds 
to further his cause the group national strategies and marketing 
group is helping move peltzs housing dream off the drawing board 
by formulating specific plans for building and financing 
no one has taken an active role in this fight we would like 
to be a catalyst peltz said

like most fbi agents robert brannon spends his 
day doing legwork making contacts developing leads 
but brannon is on the tail of mortgage officers and real estate 
agents not mobsters or terrorists and his most wanted list 
consists of affordable suburban homes within two hours of manhattan 
his assignment find housing for fbi agents transferring to new 
york 
the fbi is one of many organizations finding it harder and 
harder to persuade employees to take assignments in a city with the 
highest cost of living on the us mainland and levels of dirt 
noise and congestion to match 
that big transfer to the new york office is being regarded more 
warily by the organization man and the organization woman 
homequity inc the nations largest corporate relocation firm 
says 50 percent of transfer offers to new york are rejected 
compared to 25 percent two years ago 
when 143 corporations were asked to list the three areas to 
which transferees expressed the most resistance new york was named 
by 73 percent the next highest los angeles was named by only 39 
percent followed by boston 38 percent and san francisco 31 
percent 
although the transfer was once an accepted part of the trip up 
the organizational ladder americans have become more resistant to 
such moves particularly if the destination is an expensive urban 
area 
this resistance is most apparent in new york with its peerless 
concentration of corporate headquarters government offices and 
nonprofit agencies 
about a fifth of the nations 1000 largest companies have 
headquarters in the new york region 121 of them in the city 
itself the city of chicago the second most popular corporate 
base has 37 
but last year 16 companies announced plans to leave new york 
including jc penney and mobil oil both of whom cited employee 
reluctance to transfer here as one reason for their move 
for government and nonprofit agencies new york is even tougher 
to sell 
even though new york offers what the fbis brannon calls some 
of the best work in the organization in areas such as organized 
crime and counterintelligence it is last choice among the 
nations fbi agents and the office is short about 100 agents 
when the coast guard reorganized its civilian work force last 
year and asked more than 100 employees to transfer to new york all 
but a few refused 
its easy to see why runzheimer international relocation 
consultants says the 50000 it takes to support an executive with 
a spouse and two children for a year in suburban tampa fla or 
columbus ohio would have to increase to 70000 to do the same in 
new york boston the next priciest region is far behind at 
62000 
new york has 7 movie tickets at most manhattan theaters 22 
parking tabs for 10 hours at a midtown garage and the most 
expensive regional housing market in the united states barring the 
costly outposts of alaska and hawaii 
in the first quarter of 1988 the average price of a twobedroom 
apartment south of 96th street a traditional real estate boundary 
line of personal and financial security was 468000 the median 
price of a single family home in the metropolitan region was 
186600 compared to a national figure of 88100 that gap 
relocation experts say reflects the growing disparity between 
living costs in larger and smaller cities 
the price swings are so huge now said michael schell 
president of moran stahl amp boyer relocation consultants the 
differences were always there but the magnitude has become so 
enormous it would seem to make relocation impossible in some 
cases 
one result is horrendous commutes as late entrants to new 
yorks overheated housing market are forced to seek less expensive 
shelter farther and farther from work 
the daily odyssey of frank carlin an executive at catholic 
relief services illustrates one reason for the agencys decision 
to move to baltimore next year 
when carlin was transferred to new york two years ago he settled 
in the central new jersey town of plainsboro because he couldnt 
afford housing closer to crss offices in manhattan 
he must leave home at 640 each morning drive to the train 
station ride to manhattan take the subway uptown and walk 15 
minutes to his office by the time he reverses the process it 
often is 930 or 10 pm 
if crs had not decided to move i couldnt continue it much 
longer he said it really has taken a toll on our family i 
barely see my kids 
beyond housing new york has image problems to be overcome 
admitted schell 
lance barclay a moran stahl vice president is often reminded 
of that as he flies into new york were all admiring this 
magnificent view of manhattan and somebody will say something 
like somebody down there is getting mugged you dont feel the 
same sort of resistance to la or san francisco 
many americans he said regard the city as a place where the 
pace is too fast and the people are too arrogant 
although many approaches to overcoming relocation resistance are 
tried it generally boils down to dollars said joseph sasanno 
of homequity the limo that meets you at the airport is window 
dressing 
federal workers however get neither the limo nor the dollars 
the government pays civil servants in new york no more than 
anywhere else although a trial cost of living raise for new york 
has been proposed in congress 
corporations increasingly offer assistance in selling the old 
house and buying a new one and in getting a mortgage for the 
latter many companies also offer bonuses loans salary 
adjustments housing allowances and miscellaneous moving budgets 
when he was recruiting for american express in manhattan 
barclay would try a simpler approach to get people to see the 
more positive side of things 
if it were a nice day he would take his visitor outside buy a 
couple of beers and franks and conduct the interview on the staten 
island ferry 
on that ferry on a good day with that view of manhattan

seventeenyearold yasemin lives 
in a modern west german city but has to wear skirts nearly down to 
her ankles plead to go to school and can leave her watchful father 
only in the escort of a male cousin 
yasemin is a critically acclaimed film about a young turkish 
woman born in west germany who struggles to fit into a society 
her immigrant parents and family perceive as alien and corrupting 
and although the story is fictional it accurately reflects 
conflicts faced by many of west germanys 15 million turkish 
workers and their families many of them were invited to work in 
west germany during the countrys postwar economic boom 
the movie along with a recent film called 40 square meters 
germany and new turkishlanguage cable tv stations in west 
berlin is part of an increasing awareness about the plight of 
turks reflected in the entertainment world 
its the realistic story of a cultural conflict director 
hark bohm said in an interview and it has of course social 
implications 
the combination turkishgerman language movie portrays the large 
turkish community in altona a workingclass neighborhood in 
hamburg hamburg residents call it little istanbul 
there turkish women who date german men are thought to have 
lost their virtue a brides family is disgraced if a bridegroom 
cannot display a sheet stained with virgin blood after the wedding 
night and the threat of deportation underscores relationships with 
teachers the police and even doctors for some of the workers are 
in west germany illegally 
bohm who lives in altona and speaks some turkish spent three 
years doing research talking with neighborhood families and young 
people one of them a turkish girl even showed him her diary 
that became the basis for my story bohm a wellknown actor 
and director said this girl eventually married her german 
boyfriend despite conflict with her family 
the lovers in yasemin do not marry but end up riding off 
together on a motorcycle 
the love story begins when yasemin and jan a west german meet 
in a judo class at first jans interest in yasemin is based on a 
crude adolescent bet 
theres no woman i cant get within three days jan boasts 
to friends and tries for yasemin who rejects his overtures 
but jan persists despite attempts by yasemins father to keep 
the two apart in one touching scene he spraypaints a request for 
a date on a wall outside her bedroom window in another he runs 
after a bus in which she is riding jubilantly holding his new 
turkish language lesson book up to the window 
indeed the two lovers spend most of their courtship gazing at 
each other across streets and through windows even when they 
finally kiss it is only with a window pane between them 
yasemins father catches them and threatens to send his daughter 
back home meaning turkey 
you mean your home yasemin cries i was born here 
yasemins youngest sister also born in west germany can hardly 
even speak turkish 
like many turks in west germany yasemins father owns a small 
produce store where all members of the extended family pitch in 
the story has a much more positive note than 40 square meters 
germany released two years ago the movie by turkishborn 
director tevfik baser concerned a turkish worker who literally 
locks up his wife in their tiny hamburg apartment in order to 
protect her virtue 
turks have told me they find yasemins father much more 
sympathetic than that husband bohm said he loves his daughter 
deeply and really just wants to protect her 
turks have a harder time fitting into west germany than workers 
from spain yugoslavia and italy bohm said 
the turks brought a whole different cultural tradition here 
with them bohm said adding that much of that tradition stems 
from their adherence to the moslem faith 
jan is played by bohms 26yearold son uwe yasemin is played 
by teen actress ayse romey who was born in the united states to a 
turkish woman and an american soldier she was raised in west 
germany where she now lives

patty casey literally used to count the days 
between visits from roving evangelist mario tony leyva 
tony was like a breath of fresh air she said he preached 
the word of god and always took such an interest in our children 
especially the boys 
casey and her sister barbara gish both bornagain christians 
now say they wish theyd never heard of leyva who stands accused 
of having oral sex with two roanoke county boys and of taking at 
least a dozen boys including two of their sons across state lines 
for prostitution as his traveling revival meeting crisscrossed the 
south and midwest 
the boys were like kept women in that they were hauled 
around with him from town to town for sexual purposes said us 
attorney jennie montgomery the prosecutor in the case 
and those are just the ones we know about the ones who have 
been willing to come forward she said leyva probably has 
molested young boys everywhere hes gone im talking about a 
multitude of children 
the alleged molestations which spanned two decades took so 
long to surface due to a mix of shame ignorance and stubborn faith 
in a man who claims jesus appeared to him at age 12 and anointed 
him to preach the gospel 
now the selfordained preacher faces two trials one begins july 
26 in roanoke county where he is charged with committing crimes 
against nature with two boys the second set for oct 3 
concerns federal charges of transporting minor males with intent 
to engage such minors in criminal sexual activity and 
prostitution 
charged with leyva in the federal indictment are two associates 
rias morris 47 his organist and business manager and the rev 
freddie herring 49 a fellow evangelist who sometimes filled in 
for leyva at revivals and who operates the lighthouse assembly in 
douglasville ga 
montgomery said the three men were charged with prostitution 
because they gave the boys money for sexual favors they have 
pleaded not guilty and are free on 20000 bond each 
the fbi which investigated the case said most of the victims 
were aged 13 to 16 and often were problem kids leyva had promised 
to help 
montgomery said leyva 42 is a smoothtalking charismatic 
performer who easily persuaded his audiences mostly 
unsophisticated workingclass people to give him money and lend 
him their sons for what he termed special religious instruction 
she said the boys were swept off their feet by the flamboyant 
preacher who sometimes dressed up in a superman costume and 
portrayed himself as super christian at a typical miracle 
restoration revival leyva prowls the stage jumps up and down 
shouts wails and speaks in tongues collection baskets are passed 
around several times at each of the performances which end with 
the crowd pressing forward for leyvas touch 
casey who offers child care in her roanoke home and whose 
husband is a factory worker said leyva had showered her four sons 
with gifts and money and taken them to revivals in such distant 
cities as west palm beach fla and atlanta in luxury automobiles 
she said her boys idolized leyva 
the case opened up last fall after casey and another mother 
contacted authorities casey came forward after a hearttoheart 
with her youngest boy then 16 who had just spent several weeks 
traveling with leyva and his associates 
i guess i was too trusting but i wanted my boys to be good 
christians i let him take them one by one to teach them in the 
lord she said in an interview 
gish said she regretted introducing her sisters family to leyva 
in 1976 
i was a widow at the time and was happy about the attention he 
paid to my boys because i felt they needed a good strong christian 
father figure she recalled i told my sister about this 
wonderful man of god 
but she said she started to wonder about leyva when her three 
sons returned home from trips depressed and angry and with their 
pockets full of cash 
they were different boys after spending time with tony 
leyva gish said and i would wonder why he would be buying 
them airplane tickets and giving them cash when hed always say at 
his meetings that he desperately needed money for a new tent or an 
orphanage in haiti or something

she said she tried to talk with her sister about her suspicions 
but she wouldnt listen 
i thought tony leyva was what he claimed to be a man who had 
been anointed by god to preach the gospel casey said i 
thought he was above suspicion but in prayers god finally spoke 
to me about tony levy and i made my youngest son admit what had 
happened between them 
when asked why her older boys hadnt warned their brothers 
casey said they told me they were too ashamed also they were 
afraid of these men 
her nephew gishs eldest son echoed casey whenasked why he 
hadnt spoken up earlier frankly i was ashamed by what had 
happened its embarrassing to talk about it 
gishs son now 21 asked not to be identified by name but said 
in an interview that leyva first seduced him when he was 11 
he got me the third time my parents took me to see him it was 
in a motel room in the roanoke area he cried and said he was 
lonely he said it oral sex would be all right as long as nobody 
found out 
gishs son said that over five or six years he made numerous 
trips with morris herring and leyva who gave him hundreds of 
dollars he recalled one specific gift of 400 and a lot of 
times when he was handed more than 100 
the federal indictment handed up in late april alleges leyva 
morris and herring used youngsters as prostitutes from 1983 through 
1987 in virginia north carolina georgia florida mississippi 
louisiana arkansas ohio and indiana leyva also is charged with 
having sex with boys as early as 1967 in hendersonville nc his 
mothers hometown 
leyvas exwife and mother of their two children mary still 
lives in hendersonville she appeared before the grand jury at 
roanoke and is scheduled to testify against leyva at the october 
trial according to montgomery 
leyva has been separately indicted in roanoke county on charges 
he orally sodomized two boys in roanoke motels 
all three men have refused to discuss the charges but leyva has 
told supporters satan is trying to wreck his ministry he has 
continued to conduct crusades saying he needs donations to fight 
the conspiracy against him 
herring told reporters after his indictment that he felt in 
the same position right now as jesus was when he was on the cross 
right now its open season on ministers 
leyvas followers maintain his innocence one of them 
18yearold richard greene of roanoke said hed traveled with the 
preacher and never saw anything out of line but in the same 
interview greene said herring had made homosexual advances toward 
him 
gishs son said levya used to photograph him nude and traveled 
with a footlocker full of pornographic photos of young boys 
montgomery said several of leyvas youthful accusers mentioned 
pornographic photos but no photos were found in searches of 
leyvas business headquarters or his international school of 
evangelism which he set up in columbus ga last fall 
montgomery also said leyva appeared to have no previous arrest 
record although police in salem west of roanoke received a 
report in 1983 that levya had molested a young boy 
the alleged incident did not take place in our juristiction so 
we passed our findings along to the fbi said salem detective 
jr bryant who added that he warned leyva that police would watch 
him whenever he came to town 
i guess he got the message because he never came back 
bryant said actually id never heard of the guy before we got 
the complaint were not talking about billy graham you know this 
was just another smalltime evangelist there were never more 
than 30 or 40 people at his meetings 
david henderson leyvas spokesman predicts the entire world 
will know about leyva before this case is finished 
its a tragedy whats happened to this fine man of god 
henderson said 
patty casey differs with henderson about who has been wronged 
i dont mind so much about all the money we gave tony leyva 
she said what hurts so much is what hes done to all these good 
christian children

ralph and mary jane crisman doing what 
theyd done together nearly every day of their 58 years on the 
ranch had just sat down to lunch when they smelled the smoke 
we saw it drifting through the yard said crisman 81 a 
farmer all his life we called our neighbors to try and find out 
where the fire was the store in town said it was under control 
then they called back and said it wasnt 
crisman got in his pickup and drove to the top of the south 
ridge 
visibility was about three miles and i still couldnt see it 
so i went back home 
he told mary jane shed better get the engagement ring hed 
given her 60 years ago just in case he grabbed a handful of tax 
records 
all at once i saw the flames a half mile away he said in 
five minutes it was in our yard traveling 40 miles an hour the 
bridge across the crick was on fire so we drove north across the 
pasture mary janes got a heart condition and she was getting 
pains i told her to take some more of those nitro pills but i was 
sure i was gonna lose her along with everything else 
i tried to take it easy but we had to get out when the car 
quit on me i was afraid we were done for but i got it started 
again when i looked back all i saw was flames the barn was gone 
and the house was next i took a last look at my tree 
crisman told his story in a quiet resigned voice as he stood 
amid the devastation of his entire lifes work rubble from the 
farmhouse had collapsed into the basement an enormous jigsaw 
puzzle of charred appliances twisted iron and steel melted glass 
the blackened bones of an ironing board leaned against the 
burnedout guts of the furnace 400 carefully preserved jars of 
homecanned food had exploded in a corner a big file cabinet its 
doors still closed futilely sheltered piles of heatpowdered paper 
all the outbuildings were gone so was the carefully tended 
garden down by the cottonwood trees whose bark was seared off and 
branches were dead sticks a ghost of a tractor baked under the sun 
the unrelenting wind lifted the charred topsoil and swirled it 
around the rancher as he hunched his back to it bending to pick up 
a handful of grit crisman already knew his land had turned to 
cinders that were blowing away to the dakotas 
the 30s was bad but this is just as bad maybe worse said 
crisman who was semiretired and wasnt raising cattle this year 
with the drought the prairie was so dry we were just waiting for 
disaster and it came 
its a shock to me when youve spent a lifetime building up a 
farm its just like losing a person that you love 
the crismans only child a daughter died of pneumonia when she 
was 6 months old they seldom heard from relatives in arizona and 
florida their ranch was their world 
of crismans 1200 acres 900 were burned the blaze which 
totaled about 17000 acres in eastern montana and western north 
dakota didnt injure anyone but destroyed part of another house 
and an empty homestead killed some cattle and left critical 
pasture land useless in a year in which grass is precious 
the burlington northern railroad said it will handle claims 
adjustments because the amtrak passenger train whose sparks ignited 
the fire june 10 was traveling on bn property a bn official held a 
meeting in bainville to pass out the railroads onepage claim 
forms chrisman has vowed to get a good lawyer but he wonders how 
long the settlement process will drag on because at my age time 
isnt on my side 
my wifes bitter about it said crisman his gaze always 
returning to the remains of his home when the fire started 
nobody came around to help us move out when you get old people 
forget about you 
mary jane wont ever come back and look at it she said to me 
ive made up my mind im not going to cry its done its over 
with and id like to forget the whole thing said crisman 
that first night in shock and with just the clothes on their 
backs the crismans stayed in a motel in williston nd 25 miles 
east of bainville then moved in with friends before deciding to 
get an apartment in williston 
it makes me feel like ive lost all my freedom said 
crisman its a nice enough place but im stuck in it i feel 
like somebodys said to me youre old now you just sit in that 
rocker and rock your life away 
it feels like were on vacation and its time to go home but 
theres no home to go to this is it for us i guess were gonna 
stay right here until we die we dont move around much just once 
in 58 years 
of everything they lost mrs crisman misses her prized cedar 
hope chest the most 
it was crammed full of handmade treasures from her mother 
crocheted things and lace tablecloths said her husband its 
enough to break her heart 
and what of his heartbreak what will he miss the most 
that he said simply pointing to the 5foottall skeleton 
of a fir tree that looked like it was welded out of iron 
i told the burlington northern man i wouldnt take 2500 for 
that tree said crisman i planted it next to the house so it 
could get runoff from the roof i put it next to the bathroom 
window so we could look at it a lot trees are so precious in this 
country i knew the birds would find it and they did weve had a 
nest in that straight little tree for the past three years there 
were baby birds in it when the fire came 
for the first time on that hot sad day crisman had to pause in 
his recollections to gather himself together 
everything was gone the birds the tree the fruit preserves 
and canned green beans the china plates lovingly accumulated over 
half a century the sweet corn patch the antique tractor the 
coffee grinder that came into the country in a covered wagon 
ralph and mary jane crisman escaped with their lives and one 
roll of film 
wed taken some photographs of the deer in march there was 
snow on the ground and it was cold it took me until a couple of 
weeks ago to use up the roll it was at the camera store when the 
fire came said crisman 
course it doesnt show the house well just have to try and 
remember it in our minds

pat wilson felt like he was riding a 
borrowed motorcycle into hell as he raced to save his cattle from a 
prairie wildfire sparked by a passing train 
wed had no moisture everything was bonedry the fire was 
moving incredibly fast ancient cedar trees were literally blowing 
up it got up into the missouri breaks and went wild totally out 
of control the flames were roaring 30 40 feet into the air a 
wall of fire was moving 40 miles an hour recalled wilson 
i arrived in time to see the fire break out of the badlands 
and just explode into country that was as dry as tissue paper all 
it needed was a spark what we got was a conflagration it was 
incredible awesome 
wilson is the 40yearold grandson of a widow who homesteaded a 
ranch in 1899 with five children under the age of 12 like his 
grandmother he is stubborn and determined 
hes got callouses on his hands a face stained walnut by the 
sun and the forehead creases of a man trying to support his family 
off the land in a time of drought 
but wilson is also a dreamer and a poet a scholar whos just 
half a dissertation away from a phd in american literature from 
syracuse university 
that dreadful day with smoke and fire blotting out his vision 
and the terrified bawling of cattle ringing in his ears wilson 
suddenly remembered lines from dream song 45 by john berryman 
the poet featured in his doctoral thesis 
funny things happen to you when you are part of a disaster 
thoughts drift by in your head you think of things youd never 
think of in a million years of normal living wilson said all 
i could think of was that i was staring at ruin and ruin was 
staring back at me and it was all over 
with his wife connie and two of his three children away from 
the ranch that friday june 10 wilson tried to save his cows first 
they were starting to come down from the breaks away from the 
fire he said i ran them into the creek and got them headed 
toward the house the smoke was so black and thick i couldnt see 
anything my lungs were full of it i got a terrible stomach ache 
and got sick 
wilson making splitsecond decisions to save his own life 
abandoned the motorcycle because he couldnt see the ground 
feeling his way on foot he found a road and hitched a ride home to 
grab some valuables he wanted to help fellow ranchers and 
volunteer firefighters from 100 miles around plow and bulldoze fire 
lines 
when i got to the house there was pandemonium said wilson 
neighbors were throwing everything they could grab into their 
pickups and moving us out 
connie got here in the middle of it and i turned her around 
and got her and the kids out again the fire was coming right down 
the creek 
wilson tried to reach his neighbors ralph and mary jane crisman 
a mile to the east but the bridge was burning and all we could 
do was sit there and watch the house go up so we turned around and 
left 
the real tragedy was ralph and mary jane who are surrogate 
grandparents to wilsons 6yearold twins he said the only time 
i wanted to cry was when i saw ralphs evergreen tree burn up it 
was an emblem of how precious life is out here how much 
perseverance it takes to grow a tree in eastern montana 
for three days wilson and fellow firefighters battled the 
blaze twice they thought they had it out twice it flared up 
finally it was over 
the wilson home was saved but blackened pastures and charred 
dead trees surrounded it on three sides 
nearly all of wilsons cattle survived but 5000 of his 6100 
acres needed to feed them had burned up and were blowing away 
id had just enough grass and water to get me to winter in a 
real dry year said wilson under normal weather conditions the 
fire wouldnt have burned as hot or as fast with the drought it 
went crazy 
burlington northern railroad acting as claims agent for amtrak 
whose train sparked the fire dispatched help to control the blaze 
the railroad also shipped in hay to feed stressed cattle while bn 
crews erected emergency fences 
averaging three hours of sleep a night wilson worked the phone 
trying to find pasture ten days after the fire he shipped all but 
three of his 300 cows to a north dakota ranch 
i think it will be ok the grass seems good and the rancher 
said hed take care of them until i can decide what to do this 
fall said wilson so far im about 7000 out of pocket for 
grazing land trucking brand inspection and the vet bill ive 
been encouraged by bns shortterm response but for the long haul 
well just have to wait and see 
john jacobsen an amtrak spokesman in washington said there was 
no deadline for settling claims it will depend on how 
complicated it is said jacobsen 
wilson now agonizes over how badly damaged his land is 
the soil conservation service is advising that these pastures 
shouldnt be grazed next year either said wilson i have no 
hay no fences and now no cattle for the first time since 1899 
there are no wilson cows on this land and it feels real funny like 
i dont know what to do with myself 
in his darkened living room the drapes pulled tight to keep out 
the glaring sun wilson paced back and forth and wondered aloud 
what he should do next 
im going to put this whole place back together corral work 
irrigation cleaning working in the shop thats the stuff you 
usually do during a rainy day but we havent had any of those 
lately 
i dont think my sense of loss has kicked in yet but it will 
i think i can hang on i hope i can but this drought has got to 
end or were all finished

contracts for unleaded gasoline spurred by the 
summer driving season posted the only gains in an otherwise dull 
oil market 
while contracts for other products fell on tuesday the july 
contract for unleaded gasoline rose 048 to 5153 cents a gallon 
most longer term contracts were lower however 
the august contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude fell 8 cents to 1578 per barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
among other refined products traded on the exchange the july 
contract for home heating oil slipped 028 cent to 4231 cents a 
gallon 
traders said activity was somewhat dull on tuesday theres 
not a whole lot going on said william byers of futures research 
at bear stearns amp co 
the gains posted in nearterm contracts for unleaded gasoline 
are typical of the summer driving season particularly ahead of the 
long independence day weekend traders said 
this is a gasoriented market said madison galbraith a 
trader with merrill lynch energy futures 
galbraith also said traders were awaiting the release of the 
latest statistics from the american petroleum institute issued 
after the market closed to see if supplies had declined enough to 
justify the rising price in the nearterm gasoline contract 
the api report showed a largerthanexpected drop in gasoline 
stocks and a decline in crude oil stocks 
among other contracts traders noted there was a late wave of 
profittaking that brought both crude and heating oil down shortly 
before the market closed 
people dont see what will happen to make the market go up 
but theyre not overwhelmingly negative either byers said

a tiny computer chip that can be glued to 
the bodies of killer bees to track their movements may help 
control migration of the pests into the united states according to 
the defense contractor designing the device 
engineers for martin marietta known for its production of mx 
missiles and laserguided artillery shells developed the 
sophisticated tracking chip at the oak ridge national laboratory in 
oak ridge tenn the company said tuesday 
the microchip about the size of a halfcarat diamond and 
weighing about as much as a grain of salt is part of an integrated 
circuit that would be attached to the midsections of captured bees 
the device is powered by nine solar cells and will transmit an 
infrared signal that can be picked up by a ground station up to a 
mile away 
a captured bee would have the device to be glued to its body and 
then be set free a spokesman said the transmitters may have to be 
attached to hundereds or thousands of bees 
what weve done so faris establish that the bee could 
indeed fly with the chip attached said ed aebischer a spokesman 
at the laboratory the entomologists have looked at it and 
theyre convinced that its workable 
a working killer bee transmitter is expected to be put in the 
field by next year 
martin marietta engineers plan to use the device to monitor the 
mating and foraging habits of the creatures known as killer bees 
because of their aggressiveness 
the bees are descendants of african queen bees hundreds of 
thousands of the bees have been heading north from brazil since 
they accidentally escaped from a laboratory in 1957 
they have killed 350 people since 1957 said ralph bram an 
official with the us agricultural research service the killer 
bees have migrated as far as southern mexico and bram estimates 
they could cross into texas as early as next year 
scientists hope that by being able to track the insects they can 
control the migration without using large quantities of pesticides 
the bees pose a threat to the 20 billion annual production of 
us agricultural crops requiring bee pollination said diedre 
falter one of the chips developers the microchip should be 
able to help combat this potentially very serious situation 
martin marietta operates the oak ridge laboratory under a 
government contract last year the company developed a handheld 
electronic detector that allowed scientists and beekeepers to 
distinguish between africanized bees and the domestic species by 
the different sounds they make

the nations biggest tobacco maker is touting 
the economic muscle of smokers in a multimilliondollar advertising 
campaign but a longtime smoking critic faults the ads for failing 
to mention smokings economic costs 
the ad campaign is being sponsored by philip morris magazine 
published by philip morris usa which makes marlboro virginia 
slims and merit cigarettes 
the first ad placed tuesday in 19 daily newspapers across the 
country carried the headline 1 trillion is too much financial 
power to ignore 
the figure is based on findings from the polling concern roper 
organization which said it reflects the combined household income 
of the 558 million american smokers 
roper interviewed a nationallyrepresentative sample of 2000 
people about a number of issues including smoking habits for 
philip morris 
but irving rimer of the american cancer society said the 
campaign left out the other half of the story and that is 
smokings costs to the economy 
rimer said smoking costs the economy an estimated 65 billion 
annually in terms of lost productivity and treatment of 
smokingrelated diseases 
the new campaign comes amid widening efforts to ban smoking in 
public places 
it also appears two weeks after a jury in newark nj held 
another cigarette maker liggett group inc partly responsible for 
a smokers lung cancer the first such finding in 30 years the 
same jury cleared liggett philip morris inc and another tobacco 
concern lorillard inc of conspiring to mislead the public about 
the risks of smoking 
guy l smith publisher of philip morris magazine said the 
timing of the ad campaign had nothing to do with publicity about 
the verdict against liggett 
he said subsequent ads will appear in about 30 trade magazines 
over the next six months and point out what roper found about the 
travel dining shopping and entertainment habits of americans who 
smoke 
more than 24 million of this countrys smokers will travel 
this summer make room america one ad says americas smokers 
attend enough sporting events each year to fill the astrodome 3200 
times another ad states 
smith said the ads are designed to reach leaders in a variety of 
industries to make them aware of how much money smokers spend 
the economic strength of this group has been overlooked or 
understated for far too long smith told a news conference 
he said one ad indicating us smokers own 35 million cars and 
bought more than 5 million new cars last year was designed to 
reach automobile industry leaders enough cars to stretch 
bumpertobumper around the world four times is too much horsepower 
to ignore the ad states 
smith said the auto industry was singled out because some 
opponents of smoking have reportedly suggested that automakers 
remove ash trays from cars 
we want automobile manufacturers for instance to at least 
think before taking action that will discriminate against a large 
segment of their employees their customers and their vendors 
smith said the time has come when smokers will not sit passively 
and have their rights trampled 
the cancer societys rimer the campaign demonstrates the tobacco 
industry is in trouble they are trying to create an army out of 
cigarette smokers who have no other connection i think they are 
desperate he said 
separately philip morris released results of a survey of the 
readers of its magazine and said they were generally above average 
in terms of income education and political activity 
nearly threefourths of the respondents said they smoked smith 
said 
philip morris put the fourpage survey in the winter issue of 
its magazine which was mailed for free to 82 million households 
more than 408000 completed replies came back smith said

the house is moving toward final passage of a 
bill providing 108 billion in new spending for the governments 
transportation programs for fiscal 1989 despite a reagan 
administration veto threat 
approval of the legislation was expected today even though 
administration officials say rejection of the measure by president 
reagan is possible because it is too expensive 
the legislation would provide 2 billion above the amount reagan 
requested for transportation programs for the fiscal year that 
begins oct 1 and 182 million over the amount provided for this 
year it contains large increases for the federal aviation 
administration and the coast guard 
the bill would also allow the government to spend up to an 
additional 154 billion out of revenues collected each year 
specifically for aviation highway and mass transit programs 
as usual the bill also contains a number of highway projects 
and other items aimed at particular districts 
altogether the measure would allow 31 billion in spending for 
the coast guard a 16 percent increase over 1988 levels at least 
492 million would have to be spent on drug interdiction efforts 
the federal aviation administration would be entitled to spend 
more than 66 billion 15 percent more than this year most of the 
money would be for the salaries of air traffic controllers and 
other workers new equipment such as radar and grants to airports 
for construction 
amtrak the federally subsidized passenger railroad would 
receive 590 million and mass transit programs would get 33 
billion 
it was for those programs that lawmakers differed most radically 
from reagans proposed budget the president wanted to terminate 
all federal aid to amtrak which expects to carry 34 million 
passengers next year and provide mass transit programs with barely 
half the amount the house approved 
the senate appropriations committee approved a 106 billion 
version of the bill last friday when the full senate passes that 
legislation the two chambers will have to agree to a compromise 
bill before it is sent to reagan for his signature 
when debate on the house bill began tuesday lawmakers removed 
provisions that might have blocked federal aid to bostons logan 
international airport 
officials at logan plan to increase landing fees july 1 for 
small aircraft which they say would reduce delays for airline 
passengers by encouraging private and commuter planes to use nearby 
airfields the program is supported by bostonarea legislators 
opponents inserted a provision that would have withheld federal 
assistance to logan until the department of transportation 
completes an investigation of logans plan and until the courts 
rule on challenges filed by small aircraft industry groups 
the provision was removed on procedural grounds however after 
rep joseph p kennedy ii dmass complained that by house rules 
it should not have been included in a spending bill rep leon 
panetta dcalif who was presiding over the house at the time 
upheld kennedys objection there was no vote 
similar provisions blocking aid to logan remain in the senate 
version of the transportation bill 
the house bill would also attempt to block a private developers 
plans to build a shopping mall in manassas va on part of what 
was the scene of the second battle of bull run a confederate 
victory during the civil war the provision introduced by civil 
war buff rep robert mrazek dny would forbid the government to 
approve the construction of exits from highways that serve the area

general motors corp chairman roger smith says a 
major reshuffling of toplevel management will help train and 
prepare a new generation to run the worlds largest automaker in 
the next century 
smith announced promotions tuesday of more than a dozen top 
executives including three new executive vice presidents in the 
wake of mondays resignation of elmer johnson a gm director and 
executive vice president in charge of gms operating legal and 
public affairs staffs 
johnson a rare highlevel outsider who joined gm just five 
years ago once was considered a contender to replace smith when 
the chairman retires in 1990 
smith said tuesday gm had been planning the moves for more than 
a year but accelerated the changes when johnson resigned smith 
disputed reports that johnson was frustrated in efforts to lighten 
gms ponderous bureaucracy and in his ambition to succeed smith 
the moves which widened the pool of smiths potential 
successors affected 14 gm executives 
we have elected three new executive vice presidents which we 
think will significantly strengthen our organization and prepare us 
better for the 21st century as we move forward smith said 
one of our corporations greatest strengths has been the depth 
of our people but people always need broader assignments 
different training he said 
smith also announced the formation of the new power products and 
defense operations group which will centralize direction of 
several nonautomotive divisions that build diesel and locomotive 
engines and defense vehicles 
johnsons executive assignments were divided among several top 
executives but he was not replaced on the board of directors 
the three new executive vice presidents are william e hoglund 
53 john f smith jr 50 and robert t oconnell 49 
hoglund who was vice president and group executive in charge of 
gms buickoldsmobilecadillac group is now in charge of gms 
automotive components groups and the new power products and defense 
operations group 
its just a typical round of management changes said chris 
cedergren analyst with jd power and associates in agoura hills 
calif 
hoglund did a really fine job in that particular area im 
kind of saddened because i like to see people who are real good in 
the car business stay in the business 
but cedergren said in order to move up hoglund and others 
have to go through the various ranks and various divisions 
its kind of interesting because it widens the field up a 
little bit and falls in line with a strategy gm used to have that 
they have three people to replace any key job said analyst 
thomas ogrady a former gm economist 
hoglund is succeeded in his old job by jt battenberg iii 45 
who was manager of the boc flint automotive division and is now a 
vice president 
john smith who was a gm vice president and president of general 
motors europe is now in charge of all gm overseas operations the 
first time gm has had an executive vice president whose sole 
responsibility is overseas business the primary source of gms 
1987 profits 
smith is succeeded as president of gm europe by robert j eaton 
48 a vice president and group executive of gms technical staffs 
group 
the responsibilities of oconnell who was vice president and 
group executive of gms finance group were expanded with his new 
title he now also is in charge of general motors acceptance corp 
gms lending arm 
two of johnsons executive assignments were given to f alan 
smith 57 who had been the executive vice president in charge of 
the finance group and gmac smith is now in charge of gms 
operating and public affairs staffs 
other executives were moved up to fill vacancies left by the 
promotions

singapores economy will probably maintain its 
8 percent annual growth rate this year despite problems posed by 
labor shortages according to a us embassy report released 
wednesday 
the nations economy is dependent on foreign trade and continues 
to recover due to strong export demand in the united states and 
other industrialized countries the report said 
the economy stumbled into recession in 1985 and partially 
recovered with a 18 percent growth rate in 1986 which surged to 
88 percent last year 
domestic demand an increase in tourism and the recovery of the 
neighboring indonesian and malaysian economies boosted the islands 
trade and economic growth last year according to the embassy 
report 
but despite a favorable demand outlook for singapores goods 
and services for the rest of 1988 persistent labor shortages are 
causing many manufacturers to consider delaying new investment 
projects the report said 
the outlook for the economy beyond 1988 depends heavily on the 
health of singapores trading partners it said global 
economic uncertainties the threat of protectionism and strained 
political relations could cloud singapors investment climate

the government reported today that its chief 
economic forecasting gauge edged down 01 percent in may but 
analysts said the slight dip did not signal economic troubles ahead 
the commerce department said the decline in its index of leading 
economic indicators was the first setback since a 02 percent drop 
in january 
while reporting the decline for may however the government 
revised its estimate of april economic activity upward to show an 
increase of 05 percent in the leading index instead of the 02 
percent gain originally reported 
analysts said even with the slight setback in may which had 
been expected the forecasting gauge is still flashing signals that 
the economy is on an upward trend 
the economists said there was ample widespread evidence that 
the economy is maintaining its forward momentum 
the reagan administration last week boosted its economic 
forecast to predict growth as measured by the gross national 
product of 3 percent this year a significant revision from a 
february forecast that put growth at a 24 percent rate 
in may the biggest single factor holding the leading index back 
was a decline in stock prices without a 25 percent decline in the 
value of the standard amp poor 500stock compilation the leading 
index would have registered a 01 percent increase for the month 
four other business barometers also showed weakness during the 
month following stock prices the biggest negative factors were a 
drop in plant and equipment orders a rise in weekly unemployment 
claims a drop in the length of the average workweek and a fall in 
building permits 
four of the available nine indicators made positive 
contributions to the index the biggest positive force was a 
slowdown in business deliveries from suppliers this is seen as a 
sign of rising demand and is thus viewed as a good sign for future 
economic activity 
other positive forces were a rise in manufacturers orders for 
consumer goods a rise in raw materials prices also viewed as a 
positive by the index and an increase in the money supply 
the various changes left the index at 1926 percent of its 1967 
base of 100 
michael evans head of a washington economic consulting firm 
said the economy is really doing better than the leading index 
would suggest because much of the growth this year has come from a 
surge in export sales which the index does not track very well 
exports are moving us along and will continue to move us along 
for the rest of the year he said 
some economists have begun to express concerns that the drought 
in the midwest will boost inflation this year because of higher 
food prices 
but beryl sprinkel the presidents chief economist said last 
week the administration was sticking by its forecast that consumer 
prices would rise only 45 percent this year little changed from 
last years inflation rate 
the increase in the administrations gnp forecast was in line 
with the expectations of many private economists who have been 
busy adjusting their forecasts to take into account surprisingly 
strong growth in the first three months of this year 
immediately following the october stock market collapse some 
analysts had predicted the united states would enter a recession in 
the early part of 1988 instead gnp growth raced ahead at a 36 
percent rate annual rate from january through march 
frank mccormick senior economist at the bank of america in san 
francisco said he was looking for gnp growth in the current 
quarter at essentially the same brisk pace as the first three 
months of the year with only a modest slowdown in the last half of 
the year 
the stock market took a huge dive in october but it didnt 
turn out to be a very good predictor of where the economy was 
headed he said

first republicbank corp has told shareholders it 
will suffer another substantial loss in the current quarter because 
the texas real estate market has not bottomed out 
meanwhile the bank holding company was waiting to see if it 
would receive a buyout bid from citicorp first republicbank 
chairman albert casey said citicorp might submit a restructuring 
plan for the company with the federal deposit insurance corp 
citicorp wont tell me if theyre going to submit a 
proposal first republicbank chairman albert casey said 
first republicbank submitted its own restructuring proposal june 
9 the deadline for submission of a proposal is thursday and casey 
said the fdic should select a plan shortly after july 8 
a first republicbank internal memo distributed monday indicated 
citicorp officials were examining first republicbanks books and 
financial condition citicorp officials declined to comment on 
whether they plan to purchase first republicbank the states 
largest bank holding company 
citicorp which held 203 billion of assets at march 31 earned 
358 million during the first quarter of 1988 citicorp lost 114 
billion in 1987 largely as the result of large provision for 
possible losses on its 129 billion portfolio of latin american 
loans 
first republicbank lost 15 billion in the first quarter 
prompting a 1 billion bailout earlier this year from the fdic the 
company has been hit by a string of real estate loans that turned 
sour 
the complete disappearance of the real estate market was 
unforeseen by anybody casey said in discussing the companys 
problems 
on the second quarter were going to continue to record 
further losses casey said those losses are primarily made up 
of additional loan loss provisions and reductions in the assets by 
reasons of continuing new appraisals of the collateral both of 
those items are still hitting us 
hundreds of loan reappraisals now under way made it impossible 
for him to estimate second quarter results in dollar figures 
although the loss would be less than the first quarter he said 
we have not bottomed out in the real estate market yet as far 
as i can tell casey said 
under first republicbanks reorganization proposal shareholders 
would be compensated with a modest but asyet undetermined amount 
of stock in the bank that emerged from the restructuring casey 
said 
casey said a first republicbank plan will seek to repay the 
fdics 1 billion loan 
if first republicbanks reorganization plan is accepted it 
would file registration papers for new securities offerings with 
the securities and exchange commission in august

federal prosecutors launched a surgical 
strike against the nations largest labor union announcing a 
racketeering lawsuit to break the mafias alleged domination of the 
teamsters 
spokesmen for the 16 millionmember union called the civil 
racketeering suit a vicious antilabor attack and said 
allegations of ties to organized crime were pure myth 
hours after the lawsuit was filed tuesday here teamsters 
president jackie presser was readmitted to a cleveland hospital 
where he was in serious condition today presser had brain tumor 
surgery last month 
us attorney rudolph giuliani stressed that this lawsuit is 
not in any sense an attack on trade unionism or on the many many 
teamsters who are honest hardworking people 
we are not seeking overall control of the teamsters union 
giuliani said this is a use of the racketeering statute in a 
surgical way to attempt to take back from the mafia the teamsters 
union 
giuliani and teamsters lawyer john climaco sparred over the suit 
on morning news shows today the two shouted at each other on 
nbctvs today show and on cbstvs this morning each 
accused the other side of unamerican activities 
thats the political demagoguery and posturing that goes on in 
a situation like this it is not unamerican to try to have a 
union operated democratically rather than tyranically it seems to 
me its unamerican to let that go on year after year decade after 
decade giuliani said 
climaco acknowledged that there are individual associations 
between teamsters and organized crime but he insisted that the 
teamsters union doesnt condone corruption or criminal 
activity 
the suit is unamerican its contrary to our philosophy of 
government and american labor policy climaco said 
the us district court lawsuit charged that teamsters leaders 
made a devils pact with the mafia insuring the elections of 
top officers including presser and his predecessor roy williams 
organized crime has deprived union members of their rights 
through a pattern of racketeering that includes 20 murders a 
number of shootings bombings beatings a campaign of fear 
extortion and theft and misuses of union funds giuliani said 
court papers noted that four of the last five teamsters 
presidents have faced federal felony charges and three were 
convicted david beck for embezzlement james jimmy hoffa for 
obstructing justice and mail fraud and williams for trying to 
bribe a us senator 
the government wants a federal judge to remove from office any 
teamsters officers found to have violated federal racketeering 
laws it also seeks appointment of a union trustee to ensure fair 
union elections 
named as defendants were the international brotherhood of 
teamsters its general executive board as a group the executive 
boards 18 members and one former member as individuals 26 alleged 
members or associates of the mafia and the mobs ruling 
commission as a group 
twentyfive of those 26 defendants have been convicted of 
teamstersrelated crimes such as labor peace extortion embezzling 
union funds or taking labor payoffs the board consists of presser 
weldon mathis the secretarytreasurer and acting president and 16 
vice presidents 
judge david n edelstein granted the government a temporary 
restraining order that bars the board from making large 
expenditures of union funds or destroying union records the order 
also banned the 25 previously convicted mob defendants from 
participating in union affairs 
a hearing is scheduled for tuesday 
prosecutors have used the federal racketeering laws to uproot 
corruption in union locals and businesses but it was the first 
time the racketeerinfluenced corrupt organizations act was used 
against an entire union 
mathis condemned the lawsuit as a vicious antilabor attack 
two us senators and the aflcio of which the teamsters is a 
member said the lawsuit overstepped government authority 
the aflcio which the teamsters rejoined in october after 30 
years issued a statement calling it a clear abuse of the 
governments prosecutorial power and if sustained would 
undermine a free trade union movement 
its pure myth that this organization is in any way influenced 
or controlled by organized crime climaco said at a news 
conference in montreal 
sen orrin hatch of utah the ranking republican on the senate 
labor and human resources committee said the suit sets a 
terrible precedent 
i dont think the government or any court in this nation is 
capable of being a trustee over a union he said 
sen paul simon dill also criticized the move 
at the justice department attorney general edwin meese iii 
called the lawsuit a very carefully developed you might call it 
almost legally surgical step to remove the corrupt influences from 
the teamsters 
meese said he had no apologies for president reagans acceptance 
of teamsters support in the 1980 presidential campaign saying 
there had been no evidence at the time of any links to organized 
crime 
among the 26 alleged mafia members or associates named in the 
civil action were the reputed heads of six mob families in new 
york chicago and milwaukee 
they included convicted crime family boss anthony fat tony 
salerno of the genovese group who was convicted in 1986 of sitting 
on the commission that ruled the us mafia since prohibition

federal marshals temporarily have moved ivan 
boesky from a california prison back to new york raising 
speculation that the disgraced wall street speculator will testify 
against others he has implicated in a massive insider trading 
scandal 
boesky was transferred from a minimumsecurity prison camp in 
lompoc calif to the metropolitan correctional facility in 
manhattan june 23 joseph fitzmaurice a lompoc correctional 
officer said tuesday in a telephone interview 
robert palmquist a paralegal specialist in the wardens office 
at lompoc said marshals accompanied boesky on a federal writ that 
means boesky was likely to testify in an unspecified proceeding 
the officials said they did not know the exact reason for the 
transfer although palmquist said it was temporary 
he will eventually come back to this facility palmquist 
said 
federal prosecutors in new york said they could not comment on 
the transfer asked if he could explain why boesky was moved 
assistant us attorney john carroll said no i cant 
boesky attorneys theodore levine and robert mccaw were out of 
their washington office tuesday and could not be reached for 
comment a secretary there said 
boesky stunned the financial world in november 1986 by paying 
the securities and exchange commission a record 100 million to 
settle charges of insider trading the misuse of confidential 
information to profit from securities transactions 
he agreed to cooperate in a major government probe into wall 
street corruption and has supplied extensive information that has 
implicated others in exchange he was allowed to plead guilty to a 
single criminal charge of conspiracy to lie to the sec and received 
a threeyear prison term in december he began serving the term in 
march at lompoc a former us army barracks about 140 miles 
westnorthwest of los angeles 
in april boeskys attorneys asked us district judge morris 
lasker who sentenced boesky to reduce the punishment on grounds 
that the speculators cooperation was much broader and deeper than 
originally foreseen 
in a lengthy written plea for leniency the attorneys said the 
value of the information provided by boesky will become een more 
evident than it was at sentencing or than it can be now 
boeskys cooperation has resulted in more than 19 criminal and 
civil cases including four convictions in the united states seven 
pending indictments in britain nine sec civil actions and more 
than 134 million in returned profits and penalties the lawyers 
argued 
they also asked lasker to withhold a decision on their plea 
until october which suggested that new indictments stemming from 
boeskys disclosures could result by then

for the past 25 years james gray has 
labored in one of this citys tanneries where workers sling 
rubbery white sheepskins over wooden stands and then treat cut and 
color the skins with the touch of master craftsmen 
he never worried that his job could one day make him sick 
now he does since a state study showed tannery workers have an 
increased risk of getting testicular cancer 
the study released by the new york state department of health 
has found that more than half of fulton countys testicular cancer 
victims between 1974 and 1986 had worked in tanneries 
its not a chance finding said dr james melius director 
of the division of occupational health and environmental 
epidemiology people in the leather industry have an increased 
risk of getting testicular cancer 
state officials suspect the chemical solvent dimethlyformamide 
or dmf is a possible cause of the cancer the connection has yet 
to be proven but while tests continue the tanning companies have 
stopped using dmf to help dyes seep into leather 
the health scare comes at a time when the tanning industry here 
has already fallen on hard times cheaper imports have shut down 
hundreds of operations forcing the layoffs of thousands of workers 
and cutting the wages of those who have managed to hang on to their 
jobs 
despite the downturn new york remains the nations leading 
tanning and glovemaking state ahead of wisconsin maine 
massachusetts and pennsylvania and more than twothirds of the 
industrys work force is in fulton county 
the leather industry in the united states traces its roots back 
to 1853 when members of the glovers guild of perth scotland 
founded the industry that gave gloversville its name 
by 1892 there were 140 glove manufacturers and 52 tanneries in 
fulton county during a boom period in the 1940s the cities 
produced an estimated 95 percent of all leather gloves worn in 
america more than 5000 workers 20 percent of the countys 
population had jobs in one of the cities 75 tanneries 
today approximately 13000 people are still employed in 
tanneries across the country according to the us department of 
labor in new york the industry has shrunk to under 500 workers 
and only 17 tanneries still operate in fulton county most firms 
have moved to the far east to take advantage of low wages for the 
highly laborintensive process 
fulton countys unemployment rate at 92 percent is more than 
double the state average making it one of the most economically 
depressed areas in new york the toll can be seen on gloversvilles 
main street where blocks of empty stores many with broken 
windows line the citys main thoroughfare 
the situation leaves area workers torn between the need for jobs 
and concern about their health people need a job even one that 
could give them cancer said william towne manager of the glove 
cities area joint board of the amalgamated clothing and textile 
workers union 
theres nowhere else for them to go he said for a long 
time fear of losing a job has been greater than fear of cancer 
richard handy who spent 13 years working at gloversvilles pan 
american tanning corp including shifts on a spray line where the 
suspected cancercausing dmf was used agreed 
theres high unemployment there and we dont have any place 
else to get a job he said during a recent legislative hearing in 
the state capital on hazardous working environments we have to 
have a job to provide for our families 
handy doesnt have testicular cancer but he has developed 
cancer of the larynx he blames chemicals used in the tanneries for 
his illness 
both handy and towne say workers do want safer working 
conditions but at the same time they believe workers feel that if 
they place too much pressure on their employers tannery owners 
will pack up and leave taking muchneeded jobs with them 
at this point state health officials emphasize that dmf is only 
a suspected cause of the cancer however they say theyre highly 
suspicious of the chemical because out of the seven tannery workers 
who have contracted the disease since 1974 five worked at the pan 
american spray line where dmf was used a total of 10 fulton county 
men have contracted testicular cancer since 1974 
were suspicious theres a link between testicular cancer and 
dmf but it hasnt been definitely proven yet melius said 
tannery workers are exposed to so many toxic chemicals 
an attorney for the local tanners association also notes the 
lack of conclusive evidence 
we understand that from all the data given to us that theres 
no conclusion attorney frederick r stortecky said 
but tannery owners say they no longer use the chemical 
i think the industry has been responsive to new environmental 
concerns said tom nickerson president of the wood and hyde 
leather corp they responded as new information became known 
melius said health officials have told workers that even though 
dmf might not be used in tanneries anymore men who had been 
exposed to the chemical may be at risk of contracting the disease 
for up to 40 years 
testicular cancer usually strikes men in their 20s and 30s but 
older men can also get the disease melius said if treated early 
the cancer is curable he said 
use of dmf is not limited to just the tanning industry the 
chemical which is manufactured by du pont co is used widely in 
the aircraft industry as well du pont officials say a recent study 
conducted by their company shows no evidence linking dmf with 
testicular cancer 
the study included 8700 employees who worked over a 30year 
period at one of the companys four plants that either manufactures 
or uses the chemical said kathy forte a company spokeswoman 
adding that du pont does require that all employees be vigorously 
protected against exposure to chemicals on the job 
the results of du ponts twoyear study were released in may and 
are now being reviewed by the national institute of occupational 
safety and hazard 
the institute is also conducting a study of its own 
specifically to find out if dmf actually causes testicular cancer 
the results of the study should be released by the end of the year 
meanwhile people like towne are trying to make the best of the 
industrys plight 
its depressing at times the union manager said as he gazed 
out onto main street from his office but for the leather 
industry weve seen our attrition whats here will be here for a 
while

in what could be an early case of insider 
trading bishop peter of vasteras in 1288 traded land and fishing 
rights for a oneeighth interest in the great copper mountain 
mining co 
the deed of purchase from that deal lays the basis for the 
firms claim to be worlds oldest continuously operating company 
today the 700yearold firm stora kopparberg ab in swedish 
is undergoing an expansion program that is typical of the 
aggressive style of swedish business facing increasing competition 
for access to european markets 
as it marks its birthday the company is celebrating its success 
at shedding less productive businesses and establishing itself as a 
world power in forest products 
some 9000 shareholders are noting the sevencentury mark this 
summer with parties sporting events and a shareholders meeting in 
the mines 300footdeep open pit 
stora reportedly is spending up to 16 million on the birthday 
including invitations this year to its 22000 employees to visit 
the companys headquarters in this town in central sweden 
the mine had already existed for some 200 years and had provided 
swords for viking raiders when bishop peter bought into the company 
back in the 13th century he apparently was acting on a tip from 
monks in europe of a technological advance in water wheels that 
could be used for power in the mine and greatly increase profits 
the mine was the source of wealth for the swedish empire during 
the 17th century now stora is devoted mostly to paper and pulp 
production and the mine in the mountains outside falun is kept 
open more for sentimental than for economic reasons 
after 700 years we dont want to be the ones to close the 
mine said tommy forss curator of a small company museum 
stora owns forests half the size of belgium produces enough 
liquid packaging board to make two milk cartons for every person in 
the world and makes newsprint for swedens newspapers and for some 
of europes largest dailies 
a restructuring plan begun 10 years ago disposed of the 
companys steel interests and diversified its forestproducts 
holdings since 1984 it has acquired leading manufacturers of 
board packaging and fine papers stora president bo berggren and 
board chairman peter wallenberg are credited with the success of 
the transformation 
in march the company made it boldest move yet acquiring 
swedish match ab a multinational consumer products group for 1 
billion in the largest cash and securities deal in swedish history 
both companies are dominated by investments companies controlled by 
the wealthy industrialist wallenberg family 
the latest move was one of a series of business consolidations 
by the nonaligned swedes who are bracing for the elimination of 
trade barriers within the european economic community in 1992 
sweden has remained outside the common market to safeguard its 
neutral foreign policy but it is bargaining for economic 
integration that will protect it from discrimination once the eec 
dismantles internal tariffs 
in the meantime companies have begun merging or increasing 
their holdings in eecbased industries to keep doors ajar which 
otherwise might be slammed shut in 1992 
for instance swedish match the worlds leading manufacturer of 
lighters and wooden matches recently bought wilkinson sword a 
major british producer of matches shaving products and other 
household goods and the west german flooring group pegulan both 
offer stora access to the common market 
we have to create the financial entities with strength enough 
to meet the competition that means consolidation said stora 
president berggren in an interview 
he said stora and swedish match sell half their production to 
the eec or about 20 billion kronor 33 billion making the 
combined company too big to be ignored 
in similar fashion asea ab merged with switzerlands brown 
boveri and co late last year to become the worlds largest heavy 
electrical engineering firm although both sweden and switzerland 
are outside the eec the newly merged company has enough holdings 
in eec countries to give it a pipeline into the market 
ultimately berggren said sweden will have to join the eec to 
avoid isolation as for now by establishing ourselves within the 
common market we at least limit the disadvantage

senate republicans today thwarted an initial 
attempt by supporters of mandatory advance notice of layoffs and 
plant closings to force a showdown with the reagan administration 
before the democratic national convention 
on a 5839 largely partyline vote the senate refused to bring 
to a halt six days of debate on the measure which president reagan 
cited last month as his primary reason for vetoing a massive 
overhaul of the nations trade laws sixty votes are necessary to 
cut off senate debate on a bill 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva acknowledged the 
setback even before falling two votes short of the number needed to 
end debate telling reporters that republicans intend to drag 
this thing on awhile 
however byrd said he would call lawmakers back into session on 
july 6 instead of giving them all next week off to campaign for 
reelection in their home states if democrats do not win final 
senate passage of the bill tonight 
gop opponents concede that congress will pass the legislation 
but they are trying to deny democrats possible victory on a 
congressional override of an expected veto from reagan before the 
democratic convention opens july 18 in atlanta 
the bill would require employers of 150 people or more to give 
60 days advance notice to both workers and local community 
officials before closing a plant or laying off 50 people or more 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said tuesday he could 
not explain all the myriad amendments republicans have offered to 
the bill in six days of debate on the senate floor 
i dont know precisely whats happening myself its not a 
requirement around here he said but i know what the game plan 
is on the other side and its to get a bill passed before the 
democratic national convention 
byrd had planned to adjourn the senate today giving the house 
an opportunity to act on it thursday before it recesses that would 
give reagan just 10 working days to veto the bill enabling an 
override attempt the week before the democratic convention 
its hardball politics said dole im not sure of its 
importance beyond that 
with recent polls showing that more than 80 percent of americans 
favor early notices democrats and union leaders are more confident 
of winning the three senate votes they lacked last month to 
override reagans veto then 
dole won an amendment tuesday exempting businesses affected by 
the drought that is parching most of the farm belt and other 
natural disasters from having to provide the early layoff notices 
i dont think we ought to get carried away by the demands from 
organized labor he said if were serious about alleviating 
the effects of the drought on the economy then we ought not to be 
hitting businesses with both barrels 
the senate unanimously approved doles amendment after farm 
state lawmakers said they have been told by bakeries flour mills 
and meatpacking poultry egg ethanol and farm equipment plants 
they anticipate future layoffs because of the drought 
also approved tuesday were four amendments offered by 
republicans including one to exempt employers from having to give 
60day layoff notices to strikers who have been replaced 
rejected was an amendment to extend that exemption to 
nonstrikers whose jobs might be lost from a plant closing or 
layoff resulting from a strike also rejected was an amendment 
limiting the layoff notices only to workers losing their jobs as a 
result of a hostile corporate takeover 
fulfilling a promise to the nations labor leaders top 
democracts have agreed to delay final congressional action on a 
revised trade bill until after first acting on the plant closing 
and layoff notices 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas a chief author of the trade 
measure said tuesday he doesnt anticipate that senate action on 
it until august after congress has had a chance to override 
reagans expected veto of the plantclosing bill but before the 
republican national convention 
without a separate plantclosing law aflcio officials have 
vowed to withdraw what backers of the trade bill agree is organized 
labors pivotal support for it

the pentagons top procurement official said 
today the criminal investigation into fraud and bribery in weapons 
buying arises from one word greed but he said the probe shows 
the strength not the weaknesses of reagan administration 
defense policies 
so if we have accomplished so much why have there been so 
many cases of procurement fraud robert b costello asked at a 
packed hearing of the house armed services committee is there 
more corruption now 
we dont think so due to our improvements we can conduct 
viable enforcement to apprehend prosecute and jail procurement 
fraud perpetrators he answered 
added the witness 
we are firmly committed to insuring the integrity of the 
acquisition process and are continually improving it our 
acquisition system works otherwise we wouldnt be able to 
identify persons who attempt to circumvent it they may elude us 
for a while but in the end we will prevail 
costell is the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and 
oversees the vast pentagon purchasing system 
when rep les aspin dwis chairman of the panel asked 
costello why were seeing this case now costello answered 
in one word greed 
the hearing was the first formal meeting of a congressional 
committee to review the pentagon acquisition since the ongoing 
investigation became public two weeks ago 
an hour before todays session started well over 100 people 
were lined up along the corridors in hopes of getting into the 
hearing room 
the senate armed services committee will also hold hearings into 
military purchasing starting next month sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the panel said tuesday 
neither committees hearings will delve into the current 
criminal investigation so as not to interfere with it prosecutor 
henry hudson says has said it may not be before the end of the year 
until indictments are returned 
the probe focuses on allegations that defense contractors and 
consultants many of them former military men bribed pentagon 
officials for contracting details 
costello declined to discuss specifics of the current case but 
said we cannot and will not tolerate illegal acts that undermine 
the departments acquisition process 
as the investigations results become available we will take 
all appropriate actions on a case by case basis costello said 
but lets not judge suspects in an ongoing investigation through 
innuendo lets await the facts and allow the investigators our 
administrative processes and the courts to do their jobs 
he said the pentagon has taken a number of steps to improve the 
way its billions of dollars are spent 
we have substantially improved the acquisition system he 
said outlining a series of steps including more reviews of 
contracts more use of commercial products rather than products 
designed specifically for the military and increased competition 
although not part of the acquisition system our enforcement 
agencies contribute as much to the acqusition system as the defense 
acqusition board or the defense logistics agency he said 
aspin noted that the investigation involves about 85 contractors 
worth tens of billions of dollars and warned that those contracts 
may be compromised 
this uncertainty raises a number of critical legal issues that 
until resolved will cloud the daytoday operations of the dod 
acquisition system said aspin 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass noted that congress has tried 
to reform the pentagon procurement system for years 
quite frankly he told costello many of us are 
disappointed to see defense procurement problems again in the 
headlines in fact many in congres and much of the public at large 
are more than disappointed they are tired of hearing about a 
defense acqusition systems that cannot seem to iron out its 
systemic problems 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee which will conduct its own hearings next month said 
tuesay that i think we need to look at the procurement process 
we have to reexamine it to find out where it can be improved 
but we dont want to interfere with the current 
investigation he said weve got to get to the systemic part 
of the procurement problem and correct that but we should not use 
those problems to excuse pure old fraud waste and greed 
former defense secretary caspar weinberger believes theres no 
way to insure against fraud and he said he doesnt feel bad about 
the current situation 
appearing sunday on abctv weinberger said even his working 
every day cannot guarantee that theres going to be a total 
complete 100 percent honesty in the chain of people i dont 
have any basis whatever for saying i didnt do enough and i 
certainly dont feel culpable 
no changes in pentagon policy have yet been proposed in 
congress but several plans are likely to be offered 
for example sen david pryor dark a frequent critic of 
current pentagon spending practices has said he may try again to 
win approval of a law which he says would restrict the socalled 
revolving door between government and private sector employment

ardshiel inc a new york investment firm 
said it withdrew its 695 million takeover offer for quaker state 
corp in part because the motor oil company ignored the proposal 
we had hoped to put leverage on them to talk to us but they 
maintained their policy of silence dennis mccormick an ardshiel 
senior managing partner said tuesday 
it may not be the end of the game he said we like the 
company and we believe we have some good ideas for it 
mccormick said ardshiel looked at all our options and for a 
lot of reasons we decided just to step back from the situation 
ardshiel said its april 8 offer of 2650 a share hinged on 
approval from the quaker state board without which a hostile 
suitor would need approval of 95 percent of the outstanding shares 
under quaker states bylaws 
mccormick declined to say whether ardshiel officials have 
considered a hostile takeover 
the investors said they had intended to maintain quaker states 
core businesses which are producing engine lubricants and changing 
motor oil at a chain of fastservice shops 
quaker state the nations secondlargest motor oil producer 
employs about 6500 workers including 450 people at its 
headquarters and research center in oil city 
ardshiel is a private firm specializing in leveraged buyouts 
most notably the 146 billion acquisition of national car rental 
system inc in 1986 from household international inc

organized labor was dealt a potentially severe 
financial blow wednesday from a supreme court ruling that nonunion 
workers may sometimes withhold financial support from unions 
representing them in collective bargaining 
meanwhile the justices made it easier for workers to prove 
their bosses were guilty of illegal discrimination and barred 
states from placing sweeping regulations on professional groups 
that solicit contributions for charities 
by a 53 vote the supreme court ruled that nonunion employees 
of private employers may not be forced to pay the equivalent of 
union dues if some of that money is used for activities not 
directly related to collective bargaining 
the high court said that using compulsory fees paid by nonunion 
employees under socalled agency shop contracts to pursue a 
unions political goals violates federal labor law 
thousands of labor contracts require workers who choose not to 
join the unions representing them to pay the same amount in fees as 
members pay in dues 
although federal labor law allows states to pass 
righttowork laws barring such agencyfee requirements 29 
states representing twothirds of the nations population have 
chosen not to pass such laws 
in those states over 90 percent of the collective bargaining 
agreements to which a key federal labor law applies carry 
agencyfee requirements 
the justices were told that 6 million workers are covered by 
such contracts 
the high court in 1977 had ruled that public employees those 
who work for some governmental entity have the right to withhold 
that portion of their nonmember union fees used by the union for 
activities not directly related to collective bargaining 
on wednesday the court ruled that employees of private 
employers have the same right 
the ruling could deprive many unions of significant portions of 
their revenue and it likely will require many unions to establish 
costly bookkeeping procedures to assure that agency fees paid by 
nonmembers are not used for anything but collective bargaining 
wednesdays ruling involved 20 employees of american telephone amp 
telegraph co in maryland who sued the communications workers of 
america union in 1976 the employees contended that they should 
have the right to withhold a portion of their nonmember fees to 
avoid the involuntary subsidizing of political positions with which 
they did not agree 
they said the unions use of their money for such purposes 
violated their constitutional rights and the national labor 
relations act of 1935 
unions spend millions of dollars each year in lobbying for 
legislation and engaging in other political activities unions most 
often support democratic candidates 
a federal judge had ruled that the communications workers union 
must refund that portion of the agency fees spent for purposes 
other than collective bargaining and the ruling was upheld by the 
4th us circuit court of appeals 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals had ruled against 
nonunion employees in a similar dispute involvig the united auto 
workers 
the reagan administration splitting with some of its 
conservative supporters urged the justices to rule against the 
nonunion employees 
in other businessrelated decisions wednesday the supreme court 
expanded the way employees can use statistical evidence to 
prove bias voting 80 the justices said that clara watson a 
former bank employee in fort worth texas improperly was barred 
from using statistics in trying to prove she was discriminated 
against because she is black 
the lawsuit against fort worth bank amp trust now known as mbank 
east was ordered returned to a federal trial court 
ruled states should not be allowed to place sweeping strict 
regulations on professional forprofit organizations that solicit 
contributions for charities the justices by a 72 vote said that 
a north carolina law that imposed such regulations violated 
freespeech rights 
numerous charitable groups such as the national federation of 
the blind the american red cross and the easter seal society had 
urged the court to disallow north carolinas regulations for 
fundraising they said the restrictions severely threatened 
charities ability to raise money

consumer prices will rise at a faster pace in 
the second half of 1988 than they have during the past five years 
according to a forecast by standard amp poors corp 
overall consumer prices should increase by 45 percent to 5 
percent for the entire year compared with a 1987 increase of below 
4 percent the forecast said 
the labor department has reported that inflation ran at an 
annual rate of 44 percent from january through may 
since 1983 inflation has risen at an annual rate of between 3 
percent and 4 percent 
david blitzer the chief economist at standard amp poors said 
the weaker dollar has pushed up prices of imported goods while 
food prices are up because of the midwestern drought 
in addition blitzer said rising industrial production and 
higher capacity utilization are causing some manufacturing 
industries to charge more 
the economist said he does not expect prices to soar this year 
because the federal reserve will move to rein in inflation but if 
current trends continue prices could rise by 5 percent in 1989 he 
said 
the drought will force food prices to rise at a faster pace than 
the general inflation rate as soaring futures prices force the cost 
of poultry bread pasta and cereals higher standard amp poors 
predicted but competition among producers for other products 
should help keep food prices to a 5 percent to 6 percent overall 
increase the forecast said 
clothing prices are expected to rise as much as 7 percent 
because of higher prices for imported apparel and increased costs 
for wool and synthetic material standard amp poors said 
prices for domestic cars are expected to remain at current 
levels through the end of the year standard amp poors said 
competition from foreign automakers will help keep increases below 
the rate of inflation 
homeowners should find their natural gas bills will rise about 2 
percent while the cost of electricity will decline because of 
lower corporate tax rates 
oil prices are expected to remain at current levels which 
should translate to lower gasoline prices the forecast said 
standard amp poors also predicted liquor prices would remain 
stable unless taxes are increased but rising wholesale prices and 
a possible federal tax increase for cigarettes could drive their 
cost up as much as 15 percent 
the cost of taking a vacation is expected to continue to soar 
following a 9 percent increase in air fares during the first 
quarter hotel room prices are expected to be up between 4 percent 
and 5 percent

members of congress began a campaign wednesday 
against a hostile takeover attempt they said would thwart the 
pioneering antismoking policies of the nations seventhlargest 
insurance company 
the lawmakers cited testimony by officials of londonbased 
bat the worlds largest tobacco company that following a 
bat takeover of the farmers group the insurance company would 
have to stop publicizing the us surgeon generals findings that 
smoking is hazardous 
rep thomas luken dohio chairman of the energy and commerce 
subcommittee on transportation tourism and hazardous materials 
said bat officials told the oregon insurance commission last 
month that bat believes the surgeon general was wrong 
farmers group says it was one of the first insurance companies 
to offer nonsmoker discounts for life insurance policies and led 
the industry in offering nonsmoker discounts for auto and 
homeowners insurance 
william braddock vice president of marketing for the group 
said the company distributes antismoking brochures and has 
sponsored antismoking campaigns with public health groups he said 
the company bans smoking at its home and regional offices helps 
pay for nonsmoking clinics for employees and bans tobacco ads in 
its monthly magazine 
we urge you to consider whether it is in the public interest 
for a massive british tobacco company to take over americas 
premier antismoking insurance company braddock said in 
testimony submitted to the subcommittee 
it is inconceivable that a parent organization whose existence 
depends on tobacco and the avoidance of tobacco liability would 
permit a subsidiary insurance company to actively engage in 
advocating nonsmoking braddock said 
bat a holding company is mounting the takeover attempt 
through its subsidiary batus the owner of brown amp williamson 
tobacco corp one of americas largest tobacco companies 
william rosenblatt a lawyer representing batus said batus and 
bat officials have consistently told state insurance 
commissioners that farmers will be encouraged to continue to 
market its nonsmoker policies this makes good business sense 
in his own testimony to the subcommittee rosenblatt also said 
the officials have testified that farmers generally would be left 
to determine how to promote its nonsmoker policies 
if however a particular brochure makes affirmative 
statements inconsistent with batus position on smoking and health 
batus officials have testified that they would not permit such a 
publication to be distributed rosenblatt added 
luken said tobacco conglomerates formed through takeovers and 
mergers accentuate the insidious power of the cigarette 
manufacturers to prevent the development of antismoking health 
policies 
no legislation is pending on the matter but luken said he 
wanted to raise public and congressional awareness of the issue 
luken was joined by rep ron wyden dore who said farmers 
assets could be jeopardized as a result of health lawsuits pending 
against bats tobacco subsidiaries 
rep john bryant dtexas said the takeover also would be 
detrimental because bat is 10 percent owned by foreign 
governments 
batus launched its hostile takeover attempt jan 13 by offering 
60 a share to holders of farmers stock it raised the offer to 63 
a share for a total of 45 billion on march 3 that offer is 
still in effect and as of june 17 holders of 28 percent of farmers 
stock had offered to sell their shares 
batus is seeking permission to operate an insurance company from 
regulators in nine states where farmers does business arizona has 
approved the companys application while california has rejected 
it on the basis of the foreign government ownership a decision 
batus is appealing in court 
hearings have been completed in oregon idaho and illinois and 
are in progress in ohio insurance officials in kansas washington 
and texas still must hold hearings

pennzoil co cashrich after receiving a 3 
billion settlement from texaco inc is eyeing the oil and gas 
operations being sold by neighboring tenneco inc a pennzoil 
spokesman said wednesday 
tenneco headquartered a few blocks from pennzoils main office 
in downtown houston announced in may that it would sell off its 
tenneco oil co division which includes vast oil and gas 
properties and refining and marketing divisions to reduce its 85 
billion debt analysts said the division could fetch 5 billion to 
7 billion

oil 
we havent gotten anywhere near that point yet spokesman 
robert g harper said were looking at a number of investment 
situations since tenneco has put its oil operation on the market 
thats one of those were looking at were kind of analyzing the 
situation 
harper downplayed a report quoting pennzoil chairman randal 
mcdonald as saying the company is interested in buying tenneco oil 
and would use the 3 billion legal settlement from its protracted 
legal battle with texaco 
mcdonald was quoted as saying the company is looking at the 
tenneco assets but has not decided if it will make a bid 
tenneco has received a number of quieries on the properties 
company officials said 
analysts have speculated that pennzoil probably doesnt have the 
financing to buy all of tenneco oil although it could combine with 
one or more partners or make a limited bid for some of the 
companys producing properties 
mcdonald said the company is particularly interested in oil and 
gas properties but would consider buying everything including the 
refining and marketing division 
pennzoil received a 3 billion payment from texaco as settlement 
for a lawsuit in which texaco was ruled to have interfered with 
pennzoils plan to buy oil and gas properties held by getty oil co

the man accused of making millions on 
insider trading in the united states is said to be a rich taiwanese 
socialite divorcee with a doctorate degree a penchant for buddhism 
and a history of stockdabbling 
the us securities and exchange commission filed a civil 
complaint monday accusing fred c lee of making 19 million by 
trading on tips about impending corporate takeovers given by a 
junior analyst at the morgan stanley and co brokerage firm 
stephen wang jr 
wall street and sec sources in the united states have described 
lee 38 as a wealthy member of a taiwanese family who had several 
trading and bank accounts interests in real estate importexport 
operations and public utilities he has homes in hong kong and 
mclean va a washington suburb 
taiwan newspapers identified the man as lee chuanhong and said 
he was a major investor in the taiwan stock market several years 
ago 
the masscirculation china times reported wednesday that lees 
contacts with highleval political and financial circles made him 
somewhat famous lee himself and his story are legendary 
the masscirculation united daily news said lees acquaintances 
included tsiang yiensi former secretary general of taiwans 
ruling nationalist party and former taipei mayor yang chingtsun 
it did not elaborate on the nature of the relationships 
an official at the governmentrun taiwan power co speaking on 
condition of anonymity confirmed that lee chuanhong has been a 
director of the utility since 1978 a city bank of taipei official 
also requesting anonymity told the associated press that lee had 
previously been on the banks board

the government said wednesday its chief 
economic forecasting gauge dipped slightly in may the first 
setback since january but analysts shrugged off the tiny downturn 
as no threat to prospects for the rest of the year 
the commerce department reported a 01 percent decline last 
month in the index of leading economic indicators primarily 
reflecting weakness in the stock market manufacturing orders and 
the labor market but at the same time the department revised 
upward from 02 percent to 05 percent the gain it had initially 
reported for april 
economists dismissed the may estimates small decline the first 
since a 02 percent decrease in january and said it did nothing to 
shake their belief that growth would continue at least through the 
remainder of 1988 with no danger of recession 
this tiny onemonth decline in the leading index will likely 
turn out to be an isolated event the message is that we have an 
economy that should be expanding throughout 1988 and into 1989 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
in a second report wednesday the commerce department said that 
new home sales edged down a small 03 percent in may to an annual 
sales rate of 658000 units while it was the first drop in sales 
since january analysts said the decrease was so tiny it indicated 
that demand for homes was holding firm despite increases in 
mortgage rates 
analysts said the june leading index figure from what is 
already known about the performance of the economy during the 
month should show a resumption of the string of gains 
the current economic expansion is in its 67th month a record 
for peacetime while many analysts originally feared that the 
economy could topple into a recession following the october stock 
market collapse they have jettisoned those forecasts in light of 
strongerthanexpected growth in the first three months of the year 
the reagan administration last week issued a revised forecast 
predicting that the overall economy as measured by the gross 
national product will climb 3 percent this year a significant 
revision from the administrations original 24 percent gnp 
forecast made at the beginning of the year 
this estimate is in line with the expectations of many private 
economists who now say that the stock market downturn had no impact 
on the real economy 
we are expecting steady growth this year with the strength 
coming from exports and capital spending said richard peach 
senior economist for the mortgage bankers association 
the gnp grew at a robust annual rate of 36 percent from january 
through march and peach said he expected the current apriljune 
quarter would show similarly strong growth of around 3 percent he 
said this rate was likely to hold for the rest of the year 
but lawrence chimerine president of the wefa group an economic 
consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa said he was expecting some 
slowing of economic activity as the year progresses in part 
because of the fact that farm production will be curtailed by the 
severe drought in the midwest 
we have a mixed economy where some parts are doing well and 
others are slowing that is one reason we have seen the leading 
index flatten out in recent months chimerine said 
in may five of nine available indicators registered declines 
the biggest factor holding the index back was a 25 percent drop in 
the value of the standard amp poor 500stock compilation without the 
drop in stock prices the index would have registered a 01 percent 
increase for the month 
the four other business barometers which registered weakness 
were a drop in plant and equipment orders a rise in initial 
unemployment claims a decline in the average workweek and a fall 
in building permits 
analysts said the small labor market weakness only represented a 
pause following a period of exceptional strength and should not be 
cause for alarm 
four of the nine indicators made positive contributions to the 
index the biggest positive force was a slowdown in business 
deliveries from suppliers this is seen as a sign of rising demand 
and is thus viewed as a good sign for future economic activity 
other positive forces were a rise in manufacturers orders for 
consumer goods a rise in raw materials prices also viewed as a 
positive for the index and in increase in the money supply 
the various changes left the index at 1926 percent of its 1967 
base of 100

led by general motors ford and boeing the 
nations top exporters had a banner 1987 as a cheaper dollar 
pushed overseas sales up and in turn helped chip away at the trade 
deficit fortune magazine says 
exports by fortunes top 50 rose 8 percent to nearly 80 
billion last year while total us exports jumped 11 percent to 
253 billion the largest oneyear increase this decade the 
magazine said in its july 18 issue 
and more encouraging the trend shows no sign of abating 
fortune said exports continued to climb this year reaching 29 
billion in march for the highest monthly showing ever 
auto parts electronic components computers chemicals and 
other industrial goods were the hot products last year accounting 
for 200 billion in exports or roughly 80 percent of all goods 
moving overseas 
but fortune noted that even farm equipment down for three 
years made a dramatic turnaround with exports rising 10 percent to 
29 billion 
experts attribute the favorable performance to the weaker 
dollar which has made us goods cheaper for foreign buyers 
gm headed fortunes list for the sixth straight year with 1987 
exports totaling 873 billion ford eased out boeing for the no 2 
slot 
boeing slipped after losing more than 1 billion in sales on 
overseas sales of 747s other aerospace companies had similar 
difficulties including lockheed which dropped 14 places because 
of fewer deliveries of its c130 hercules transport planes and p3 
antisubmarine aircraft fortune said 
general electric with 1987 exports of 483 billion held the 
no 4 spot ge spokesman george jamison noted that despite the 
exports the company imported about 276 billion in raw materials 
and parts putting the companys balance of trade at about 2 
billion 
jamison said he anticipates more exports and fewer imports this 
year due largely to a changing product mix 
current import figures were not immediately available from gm 
but a company spokesman said that in 1986 imports of vehicles and 
materials from countries excluding canada amounted to less than 2 
percent of total sales 
among new companies to appear on fortunes annual list were 
cummins engine xerox hoechst celanese and ethyl which makes

the head of the agency that regulates 
federally insured savings institutions said wednesday that the 
cases of 259 grossly insolvent thrifts would be resolved by 
1990 at a cost of 174 billion 
danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board said 
in a speech to a us league of savings institutions conference 
that the ailing savings and loan industry is getting better

are getting sicker

grossly insolvent institutions he said 
we are clearly on a track that will have us resolving 259 
institutions as a minimum by the end of next year wall said 
he said he expected it would cost 174 billion to shut down or 
bail out the sick institutions about 50 cases have been dealt with 
this year he said

estimated that some 500 sampls are insolvent more than 200 of them 
hopelessly so 
last month the bank board reported that the 3118 federally 
insured savings institutions suffered losses of 38 billion in the 
first three months of this year more than half of the record 76 
billion loss in 1987

the environmental protection agency on 
wednesday formally unveiled massive new draft regulations aimed at 
upgrading protection of 25 million farm workers from pesticides 
the agency said it was unable to estimate how many worker 
poisonings would be avoided as a result because no one knows how 
many are occuring now 
farmers using hired labor chemical manufacturers and others 
will have to spend an estimated 170 million to comply in the first 
year the regulations are effective and smaller sums after that 
said louis true head of program management and support in epas 
pesticide program 
the agency believes that a reduction in poisonings by onehalf 
to 1 percent would make the cost worthwhile he said without 
giving the basis for the calculation and insisting the agency does 
not know how frequent such poisonings are 
the regulations would extend protection to 300000 workers in 
greenhouses nurseries and forests who are not covered by existing 
rules they would not apply to noncommercial use in forests as by 
a park agency or to home use research use on rights of way or 
where the chemical is injected directly into the plant 
the agency circulated a draft of the new rules late last year to 
interest groups and congressional staffs in response early this 
year farm groups and labor organizations attacked various 
provisions but the draft released wednesday made no major changes 
the regulations will be open for comment for 90 days after 
publication next week and should be adopted sometime next year 
true said the 55 pages of two new regulations would replace a 
onepage regulation adopted in 1974 
major provisions include a requirement that fields be closed for 
24 hours or 48 hours after treatment with the most toxic carbamate 
and organophosphate compounds 
a host of other new provisions would be added ranging from the 
requirement for blood tests of employees of commercial applicators 
to the provision of water for washing off spills in the field and 
posting addresses and telephone numbers of the nearest emergency 
treatment facilities 
other important provisions try to fix responsibility more 
precisely for mishaps generally placing it on the farm owner or 
lessee and spelling out when hired applicators or others may be 
blamed 
true said it was implicit in the regulation that owners or 
lessees must make sure that contractors are aware of the new 
provisions perhaps well make that explicit after the 
comments he said 
true said the agency believes there are thousands of pesticide 
poisoning incidents every year but doubts estimates of hundreds of 
thousands a contractor once came up with an estimate of 12000 
which could not be supported he said 
the regulations do not apply where epa already has established 
rules for specific chemicals they are meant to add general 
protection while the agency is carrying out its laborious review of 
the 650 active ingredients in pesticides something it expects to 
finish only in the next century 
mark maslyn pesticide specialist for the american farm bureau 
federation said farmers would accept the new requirements in some 
instances but would oppose them in others i dont think theres 
any question people are willing to provide protective equipment to 
their mixers and loaders he said 
but as for the rules barring workers from reentering fields for 
certain periods after applications i think theres going to be 
an enforcement problem maslyn said in some particular cases 
its too long for farmers under pressure to get a crop to market 
he added 
shelly davis an attorney with the migrant legal action program 
said the proposed reentry intervals are not long enough and should 
be based on more than just acute toxicity she said i would 
establish a long interval for anything thats an actual or 
suspected carcinogen cause of cancer in animals like a week 
rep george brown dcalif complained that the new standards 
still arent stiff enough more stringent standards have been 
proven and accepted in california and texas without harm to the 
agricultural economy he wrote the epa

sales of new homes edged down 03 percent in 
may the first decline in four months the government reported 
wednesday 
the commerce department said new singlefamily homes were sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 658000 units last month 
following an increase of 11 percent in april 
the decline was the first since a 12 percent fall in january 
but analysts said they were relieved that the setback wasnt worse 
especially in light of a report last week that housing starts 
plummeted 122 percent in may 
that drop had raised fears that builders were sharply cutting 
back on construction plans in light of worsethanexpected sales 
activity 
analysts said last months small dip in sales should reassure 
builders that the housing industry is not facing a disastrous year 
although activity will be lower than in 1987 
this lessens the concerns raised by the big drop in housing 
starts it tells us that people are still buying homes so there is 
reason to believe that builders will pick up the pace in june 
said mark obrinsky senior economist at the us league of savings 
instituions 
for the first five months of the year home sales have been 
running 78 percent below the pace of the same period in 1987 
analysts blamed higher interest rates for much of the slowdown 
for all of 1988 obrinsky predicted sales would total 650000 
units down about 5 percent from the 1987 level 
this forecast is achievable assuming we dont have a sharp 
runup in mortgage rates he said 
mortgage rates which dipped into the singledigit range briefly 
in february and march have been rising in recent months and now 
stand at 104 percent for 30year fixedrate mortgages 
david seiders chief economist for the national association of 
home builders predicted that rates would hit 11 percent or higher 
by the end of the year pushed upward by tighter credit conditions 
imposed by the federal reserve in an effort to fight inflationary 
pressures 
seiders said he believed sales hit their peak in the justending 
apriljune quarter and will be headed lower for the rest of the 
year 
the median price of a new home edged down 09 percent to 
110000 in may compared with april the median price is the point 
where half the homes sold for less and half sold for more the 
average sales price during the month rose 02 percent to 135900 
the small sales decline was led by a 73 percent drop in sales 
in the northeast where new homes were purchased at an annual rate 
of 101000 units last month 
sales fell 07 percent in the south to an annual rate of 271000 
units sales were up 64 percent in the midwest to a rate of 
100000 units while sales in the west edged up 05 percent to 
185000 units

the supreme court issuing a key civil rights 
ruling on the last day of its 198788 term made it easier 
wednesday for workers to prove their bosses are guilty of illegal 
discrimination 
the court by an 80 vote said employees can use statistical 
evidence to prove that some subjective decisions made by theilate federal 
law 
the decision means clara watson a former bank employee in fort 
worth texas gets a new day in court in her effort to prove she 
was discriminated against because she r 
employers viois black 
although involving a complicated aspect of federal antibias 
law wednesdays decision carries a significant direct impact on 
numerous lawsuits filed by women and members of racial minorities 
who say they have been treated unfairly 
it will have very broad ramifications said julius l 
chambers of the naacp legal defense fund that the court approved 
of statistical evidence in such cases is a major step 
but chambers and other civil rights lawyers voiced concern over 
language used by four justices in discussing how difficult it 
should be to prove with statistics that subjective decisions are 
illegally discriminatory 
its not clear how lower courts will implement that part of 
o a drivein 
teller and in 1980 was promoted to be a commercial teller in the 
banks main lobby 
over the course of the next year however ms watson applied 
unsuccessfully four times for promotions to supervisory positions 
in the bank 
she sued in 1981 charging racial bias in part her lawsuit 
contended that the bank discriminated against all blacks when it 
came to filling supervisory jobs 
ms watson offered statistics claiming that the same white 
supervisors who hired only 35 percent of black applicants hired 
148 percent of white applicants her lawsuit said the same 
supervisors rated blacks an average of 10 points lower than whites 
on annual salary evaluations and also promoted blacks from one 
salary level to another slower than they promoted whites 
her suit was dismissed by a federal trial judge and the 
dismissal was upheld by the new orleansbased 5th circuit court 
the appeals court rejected ms watsons contention that she had 
proved statistically that the bank discriminated against blacks 
the banks lawyers argued successfully before the 5th circuit 
court that statistics are irrelevant when evaluating subjective 
employment decisions 
but most other federal appeals courts had ruled that the 
disparate impact approach allowing the use of statistics may be 
used in challenging subjective employment decisions 
the reagan administration urged the justices to uphold the 5th 
circuit courts ruling saying employers otherwise might resort to 
fixed quotas in their selection practices 
in the courts main opinion wednesday justice sandra day 
oconnor said allowing the use of statistics in attacking objective 
employment policies would be rendered ineffective if statistics 
could not be used to challenge subjective management decisions as 
well 
we are persuaded that our decisions in 1971 and succeeding 
cases could largely be nullified if disparate impact analysis were 
applied only to standardized selection practices oconnor said 
so long as an employer refrained from making standardized 
criteria absolutely determinative it would remain free to give 
such tests almost as much weight as it chose without risking a 
disparate impact challenge 
that portion of her opinion attracted eight votes justice 
anthony m kennedy did not participate in the case 
but oconnor was speaking for only herself and three other 
justices when she said that offering statistical proof that an 
employers subjective management decisions are illegal will be 
tougher than attacking objective policies

senate republicans on wednesday tried to make 
democrats vote against a massachusetts plant closing law touted by 
presidential candidate michael dukakis as the price for allowing 
federally mandated layoff notices 
democrats balked calling the maneuver a triviabuster but 
the gop move temporarily delayed further action on a bill to 
require 60 days advance notice of plant closings and layoffs 
affecting 50 or more workers 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva took the bill off the 
floor and said he would reconvene the senate next wednesday 
cutting short 11 days of uninterrupted campaigning many lawmakers 
had planned over an extended july fourth holiday 
but there were doubts that enough of the 46 republicans would 
show up then to permit votes on ending what sen edward m kennedy 
dmass called a triviabuster by the gop through the use of 
several trivial amendments 
byrd on wednesday could muster only 58 all 53 voting democrats 
plus five republicans of the 60 votes needed to end six days of 
debate and bring the bill to a final vote 
if there is an agreement from the other side that we can pass 
the bill today im receptive byrd said but were not going 
to sit around here and fiddlefaddle with these little amendments 
that dont mean anything 
byrd made the remarks after senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas said he planned to introduce a substitute bill that mirrored 
the 1984 state plant closing notice law that dukakis won as 
massachusetts governor 
dukakis boasted throughout the presidential primaries that 
because of his efforts massachusetts is the one state that has a 
comprehensive plant closing law 
but labor leaders and other critics claim the massachusetts law 
has no teeth because employers are only requested not required 
to give advance notice as a condition for obtaining state economnic 
development aid 
lets vote on the dukakis plan lets see how many votes he 
has dole said hes for giving notice in his state but he 
wants to give it voluntarily 
dole said he thinks president reagan would sign a bill seeking 
voluntary rather than mandatory notices and offering incentives 
rather than fines as an inducement 
vice president george bush has endorsed a similar measure that 
would condition federal contracts and tax incentives to companies 
on a pledge to voluntarily provide advance layoff notices as part 
of their affirmative action hiring plans 
democrats had hoped to win both senate and house passage of the 
bill before recessing for the july fourth holiday that would give 
reagan 10 days to exercise his expected veto and congress enough 
time to vote on overriding it before the democratic national 
convention opens july 18 in atlanta 
this is a priority for the democratic convention but 
somehow those plans have failed dole quipped i know that its 
big on organized labors list and they have a lot of clout in this 
body 
aflcio leaders had threatened to withdraw their pivotal support 
for a revised plant closing bill that reagan vetoed last month 
because of the layoff notices if congress did not first vote on the 
plant closing provisions as a separate measure 
byrd denied that he is dancing to the tune of organized 
labor saying he promised aflcio president lane kirkland united 
auto workers president owen bieber and united mine workers 
president richard trumka only to put another trade bill on reagans 
desk 
byrd acknowledged that a trade bill unincumbered by a plant 
closing provision is not likely to win senate approval without 
completing congressional action on the layoff notices first 
after the democratic convention maybe after the republican 
convention we can do the trade bill he said

foreign currencies in us trading wednesday despite a late selloff 
incited by rumors of aggressive central bank intervention currency 
brokers said 
gold prices eased further in new york after falling sharply in 
europe at of 4 pm edt republic national bank quoted bullion at 
43530 a troy ounce down from 43720 at the same time tuesday 
money traders have attributed the dollars persistent rise in 
value over the past several days to an increasing perception that 
the major industrialized democracies are willing to tolerate a more 
expensive us currency 
but the dollars growing attractiveness in foreign exchange 
markets was dampened somewhat wednesday after japans central bank 
governor satoshi sumita said tuesday in tokyo that he was ready to 
stem the rise if necessary 
rumors also spread that other central banks sold dollars late 
wednesday concerned that the us currency quickly was becoming 
overvalued the rumors sent some money traders scurrying to sell 
dollars 
today was kind of a mixed day said arthur liming money 
market analyst at lns financial group inc in chicago most 
people kind of took a chance to sit back and look at whats been 
transpiring theyre trying to decide whether the central banks are 
trying to stem rise of dollar or make sure the rise doesnt get out 
of hand 
in tokyo the dollar broke the 133yen level for the first time 
in nearly seven months before retreating to 13240 yen up 145 yen 
from tuesday in london it was quoted later at 13370 yen later 
in new york the dollar closed at 13293 yen up from its 13274yen 
close on tuesday 
the british pound fell sharply in london to 17060 from 17200 
late tuesday but recovered partly in the united states the pound 
fetched 17132 in late new york trading up from 17085 late 
tuesday

tuesdays rates included 18225 west german marks up from 
18220 15118 swiss francs up from 15080 12147 canadian

for the slide in gold prices

grain and soybean futures prices tumbled wednesday on the 
chicago board of trade as showers in the droughtstricken midwest 
created panic in the trading pits and spurred some of the steepest 
declines in the exchanges history 
on other exchanges cotton futures plunged livestock and meat 
were broadly mixed precious metals were lower energy futures were 
mostly lower and stockindex futures retreated 
it was just panic liquidation on the grain markets said jay 
homan an independent oat trader 
many traders who had bet on higher prices and worsening crop 
yield prospects rushed to sell in reaction to heavy rains in 
wisconsin and illinois and lighter showers in indiana minnesota 
iowa missouri and south dakota 
most contracts for future deliveries of corn oats and soybeans 
plunged their daily limits at the opening on the chicago board of 
trade 
but the price limits on contracts for july delivery of grains 
and soybeans were routinely removed wednesday pending the july 20 
expiration of those contracts without limits prices for july 
delivery fell freely 
july soybeans finished 83 cents a bushel below tuesdays 
settlement price all other soybean contracts were limited to 
losses of 45 cents july corn plunged 28 cents a bushel and july 
oats dropped 38 cents other corn and oat contracts were permitted 
to fall only 15 cents 
mario balletto a soybean analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets inc in new york said the markets overreacted to the rain 
you always see some rain somewhere in the middle of a 
drought he said but everybody wants it to be bone dry or else 
they get nervous 
despite the rain no one was declaring an end to the drought 
the national weather service predicted abovenormal temperatures 
and belownormal rainfall for most of the midwest in both its 
6to10day and 30day forecasts 
we see the drought continuing balletto said 
wheat settled 11 cents to 19 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in july at 353 a bushel corn was 15 cents to 28 cents 
lower with july at 309 a bushel oats were 15 cents to 28 cents 
lower with july at 335 a bushel soybeans were 27 cents to 83 
cents lower with july at 931 a bushel 
cotton futures also plunged their limits in reaction to the 
rain and the new york cotton exchange announced expanded limits 
an increase from 2 cents to 3 cents a pound after the close 
cotton settled 2 cents to 272 cents lower with limitless july 
at 6370 cents a pound 
the crashing grain markets also had a resounding impact at the 
chicago mercantile exchange where livestock and meat traders 
scurried to undo their drought spreads analysts said 
the sharp rise in grain prices in recent weeks had stirred 
livestock traders to bet on falling cattle and hog prices through 
the end of the year followed by a sharp rise in prices next year 
but as grain prices turned around and began to fall livestock 
traders bid up the price for summer and fall deliveries and sold 
off contracts for 1989 delivery analysts said 
some contracts made limit moves livestock futures carry limits 
of 150 cents a pound frozen pork bellies are permitted daily 
moves of 2 cents a pound 
live cattle werer 115 cents lower to 20 cent higher with 
august at 6482 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent lower to 
150 cents higher with august at 7455 cents a pound hogs were 
130 cents lower to 23 cent higher with july at 4580 cents a 
pound frozen pork bellies were 45 cent to 2 cents lower with july 
at 3707 cents a pound 
precious metals futures finished lower on the commodity exchange 
in new york pressured by lower grain prices and the stronger 
dollar said john norris chief preciousmetals trader for citibank 
gold was 210 to 230 lower with august at 43830 a troy 
ounce silver was 138 cents to 17 cents lower with july at 6622 
a troy ounce 
most energy futures tumbled on the new york mercantile exchange 
despite an american petroleum institute report indicating 
recordhigh demand for gasoline 
peter beutel an analyst with elders futures inc in new york 
attributed the sharp selloff to the united arab emirates statement 
that it did not feel obliged to stay within opec crudeoil 
production quotas

750 per 1000 in face amount giving back most of the gains 
achieved tuesday its yield rose to 892 percent from 885 percent 
late tuesday 
bond traders remained skeptical about the dollars strength and 
nervous about the future of commodity prices in spite of the good 
news on both fronts wednesday analysts said 
grain and soybean futures prices tumbled on the chicago board of 
trade as showers in the droughtstricken midwest created panic in 
the trading pits and spurred some of the steepest declines in the 
exchanges history 
the dollar finished mostly higher against foreign currencies in 
us trading despite a late selloff incited by rumors of aggressive 
central bank intervention 
the bond market just doesnt know what to concentrate on 
said jay goldinger who heads an investment banking firm capital 
insight inc in beverly hill calif 
one factor depressing the treasury bond market was a rumor that 
the government would issue a 30year bond at its quarterly 
refunding auction in august said f ward mccarthy chief financial 
economist for merrill lynch capital markets who said he 
disbelieved the rumor 
expectations that a new long bond would not be available had 
pushed up the price of existing 30year issues 
david resler chief economist for nomura securities inc said 
some investors are still gunshy after a sharp decline in bond 
prices earlier this month that was brought about by concerns about 
rising interest rates here and abroad 
the bond market was just whipped around by the end of the 
day it had to feel like michael spinks only it took longer than a 
minute and 31 seconds goldinger said 
by late wednesday in the secondary market for treasury bonds 
prices of shortterm government issues were unchanged to 332 point 
lower intermediate maturities fell between point and point and 
longterm issues fell from point to point according to figures 
provided by telerate inc a businessinformation service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer fell 006 to 11003 the shearson lehman hutton 
daily treasury bond index which makes a similar measurement stood

a federal judge has ruled that ice cream 
maker haagendazs did not violate antitrust laws by withdrawing 
from a distribution arrangement that sold competing brands 
the state and federal laws may not be used as an ally in the 
dispute between haagendazs and two california companies us 
district judge charles a legge ruled tuesday 
the case which made headlines nationwide in 1985 involved two 
count a northern californiabased ice cream distributor and 
double rainbow a san francisco ice cream maker haagendazs was 
sued 
the decision said the haagendazs policy which has national 
implications neither violated antitrust laws nor the contractual 
rights of the distributor or manufacturer 
our company is delighted with this ruling said mark l 
stevens at haagendazs headquarters in teaneck nj our 
distributor policy is healthy for competition protecting our 
product at every step until it reaches our consumers hands is 
essential 
judge legge ruled haagendazs terminated two count because 
haagendazs has a marketing policy of requiring exclusive 
distribution which two count violated by agreeing to distribute 
ice creams of double rainbow as well as other brands that compete 
with haagendazs 
competition in the ice cream market is flourishing and 
interbrand competition is intense antitrust laws are no substitute 
for such true competition separate distribution has led to 
increased and successful interbrand competition

a delaware judge delayed decision wednesday on 
the robert m bass groups request for a preliminary injunction to 
block macmillan incs planned restructuring 
jack b jacobs the delaware chancery court judge who earlier 
this month temporarily blocked macmillan from proceeding with the 
restructuring heard four hours of arguments from both sides a 
bass spokeswoman said the judge said he would rule as promptly as 
possible 
the bass group has made an unsolicitied 19 billion takeover 
bid for the publishing giant 
on the new york stock exchange macmillan finished unchanged at 
7512 
separately on tuesday macmillan disclosed that its chairman 
edward p evans had told security pacific national bank in a 
letter that it felt the bank had improperly agreed to provide 
financing for both the macmillan restructuring and the bass bid 
macmillan said security pacific had been given confidential 
materials about macmillan in midjune so it could consider the 
possibility of providing financing for macmillans restructuring 
plan on june 17 security pacific said it would commit 200 
million for macmillans restructuring 
but evans said macmillan was surprised and outraged when the 
bass group announced its own financing plans for its tender offer 
on june 23 that security pacific was listed as committing 500 
million in financing for the bass groups offer 
in the letter evans said macmillan was offering security 
pacific an opportunity to correct breaches of confidentiality 
undertakings and fiduciary duty before pursuing a legal remedy 
in los angeles richard warner an executive vice president for 
security pacific said wednesday he had no comment on macmillans 
request that the bank withdraw its commitment to the bass group 
but said the charge of breach of confidentiality is absolutely 
untrue 
the two pieces of business that came in came in through two 
different offices and our policy of client confidentiality was 
maintained throughout the process warner said 
he said security pacifics new york office made the financing 
commitment to macmillan while the chicago office handled the 
commitment to the bass group 
the bass group proposed paying 64 a share for macmillan in may 
macmillan responded with a restructuring valued at 6415 a 
share that included splitting the company into separate publishing 
and information services companies and paying shareholders a cash 
dividend of 5235 
the bass group subsequently said it would offer 73 a share in 
cash or alternatively a restructuring plan comparable to the 
macmillan package but including a dividend of 58 a share 
earlier this week macmillan said a special committee of its 
board had again considered and rejected the bass offer

bank of new york co threatened wednesday to 
abandon its hostile 14 billion bid for irving bank corp unless 
it receives a favorable court ruling within two days or reaches an 
amicable settlement with irving 
bank of new york said in a statement that it submitted a written 
request to the new york state supreme court for a ruling by friday 
on the validity of irvings antitakeover poison pill and 
numerous other pending legal issues 
irving in its own letter to state supreme court justice herman 
cahn said it is not up to bny to attempt to dictate deadlines 
and ultimatums either to this court or the irving board 
the letter noted that top irving executives will be unavailable 
until the middle of next week we would anticipate the scheduling 
of a meeting of the irving board on tuesday or wednesday to 
consider bnys revised proposal the letter said 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady denied the bank was 
issuing an ultimatum its just pointing out the realities of the 
situation that if we dont get an answer were running out of 
time 
bank of new yorks deadline for conditional merger approval from 
the federal reserve board expires on july 9 and brady said the 
bank needs time to prepare a request for an extension we believe 
we cant go to the fed unless we can point to some progress he 
said 
bank of new york also is seeking to overturn the results of a 
proxy battle in which shareholders chose irvings incumbent board 
over bank of new yorks nominees 
bank of new york presently is offering 1575 shares of its stock 
and 15 in cash for each outstanding irving share or a total of 
about 11 billion 
the company said it would reinstate a june 15 offer that would 
give irving sharesholders 1675 bank of new york shares 15 in 
cash and 5 in special dividends if the state supreme court removes 
the takeover obstacles 
that offer for all of irvings 185 million shares outstanding 
is valued at about 76 a share or 14 billion which is about 25 
percent higher than the existing hostile 11 billion tender offer 
bank of new york also would revive the offer if requested to do 
so by irvings board as the basis for an amicable resolution of 
all outstanding matters 
the offer also would be revived if irvings board favors a 
merger with banca commerciale spa italys second largest bank 
which is offering 80 a share for 51 percent of irving or about 
760 million the proposal is part of a complex defensive 
restructuring plan approved by irvings board the plan includes 
among other things sale of irving assets costcutting measures 
and a special cash dividend 
separately a florida bank regulator said banca commerciale 
might have to seek separate approval from the state to acquire 
irvings florida subsidiary

the pentagons top purchasing official faced 
with hostile questions from congressmen wednesday backed away from 
a proposal he made just last month to give defense department 
officials the power to prevent searches of contractors facilities 
by fraud investigators 
under blistering questioning robert b costello undersecretary 
of defense for acquisition policy said he had changed his mind and 
would not now write the same memo he had written may 5 outlining 
the plan 
costello asserted however that current reagan administration 
policies work in uncovering misdeeds in military equipment 
procurement and that there is less corruption in the process now 
than before 
our acquisition system works he told the packed hearing 
room at the first congressional hearing into defense procurement 
problems since the disclosure that investigators have issued 275 
subpoenas conducted more than 40 searches and listened in on more 
than 4000 wiretapped conversations in the probe of fraud and 
bribery in sales to the pentagon 
among the congress members clearly frustrated by costellos 
defense of present policies was rep patricia schroeder dcolo 
you drive me crazy youre in an absolutely protective 
mode she told him at the house armed services committee hearing 
in other developments wednesday 
henry hudson the us attorney who is heading the 
investigation said in court papers filed in brooklyn ny that 
he has learned of several instances of documents being destroyed by 
people under investigation in the probe 
neither hudson nor assistant us attorney joseph aronica who 
wrote an attached affidavit provided details on who destroyed 
documents or how they might be related to the investigation 
sen carl levin dmich asked the fbi to give congress its 
file on melvyn paisley a former pentagon procurement official 
under investigation in connection with alleged fraud and bribery in 
defense purchasing 
the current chairman and ranking republican on the armed 
services committee sens sam nunn dga and john warner rva 
said in a statement wednesday night that the committee has 
researched the records it currently holds on paisleys nomination 
the only records it has the senators said are financial 
disclosure forms and associated memoranda and the standard letter 
from him required by the committee concerning his financial 
situation 
although costello defended his plan for pentagon decisionmaking 
on searches of contractors facilities during most of the 
questioning he backed down as the hearing wore on into the 
afternoon 
rep j roy rowland dga told costello his proposal is not 
appropriate it doesnt look good it doesnt smell good 
costello declined to agree the memo was inappropriate but added 
that he wouldnt write it now 
i can change my mind he explained to rowland he said that 
he and june gibbs brown the defense departments inspector 
general had a discussion and i listened to her and i said 
june youre right 
he noted that defense secretary frank c carlucci rejected the 
proposal after brown complained 
in the worst case such a policy could be interpreted as 
placing constraints on or interfering with the criminal 
investigative process brown wrote in her own memo such an 
approval would be unprecedented within federal law enforcement and 
unwise as a matter of law enforcement and procurement policy 
costellos may 5 memo suggested that he and other top pentagon 
officials be given power to veto searches of the private 
contractors who supply military equipment the associated press 
obtained a copy of the memo tuesday 
he said he wrote the memo after a contractors office in st 
louis was searched he explained he didnt object to the search 
but that it should not have been conducted without a prior review 
at the upper levels of the pentagon 
the system at that point had been shortcircuited 
costello said if the system had been allowed to function as it 
was constructed to function the access to the information could 
have been achieved without resort to the use of force 
committee chairman les aspin dwis told costello that the 
memo itself sends the wrong signal to defense contractors the 
whole tenor of that the memo is awfully sympathetic to defense 
contractors he said 
carlucci talking to reporters during a visit to the state 
department said he disagreed with aspin i dont think this 
sends any signal at all that we are letting up on our monitoring 
activities or on inspection activities he said 
in costellos defense of reagan administration policies he said 
military procurement changes had reduced fraud and waste in the 
governments largest department 
so if we have accomplished so much why have there been so 
many cases of procurement fraud costello asked rhetorically 
is there more corruption now 
we dont think so due to our improvements we can conduct 
viable enforcement to apprehend prosecute and jail procurement 
fraud perpetrators he said 
at one point aspin interrupted to ask how come were seeing 
this now in reference to the widespread investigation 
in one word greed costello replied 
an another occasion rep john r kasich rohio said every 
time we suggest legislation youre opposed 
later rep andy ireland rfla told costello i simply 
dont agree we have all the laws and regulations we need 
another defense department witness general counsel kathleen 
buck agreed with costello that no new laws may be needed this 
is something thats pretty oldfashioned after all its bribery 
she said 
when mrs schroeder said the current investigation may show 
weve been overcharged for some weapons costello answered that 
we may have been undercharged and explained that the 
investigation is still incomplete 
at that point mrs schroeder said you drive me crazy 
she told costello i want you to be a pit bull and he 
answered by saying i do have a great dane 
mrs schroeder shot back i dont want you to have a great 
dane i want you to be one 
when aspin noted that 85 contracts worth billions of dollars may 
be involved in the current investigation buck answered that we 
will revisit every single contract involved here on a 
casebycase basis 
if contracts are found to be tainted she and costello said the 
pentagon has several options including rebidding or reletting the 
contracts or barring contractors from bidding on future contracts

the us dollar edged higher early thursday against 
the japanese yen although it declined from its opening highs 
while stock prices rose in active trading in tokyo 
the dollar opened at 13290 yen up from wednesdays close of 
13240 yen but retreated to the 1324513255 yen level by 
midmorning 
the dollar fell because market participants were closing their 
positions prior to the long fourth of july holiday weekend in the 
united states said a dealer with a major securities firm speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
financial markets will be closed monday in the united states 
those who were buying the currency at the 133yen level at the 
start of trading moved down to 132 yen because of the upcoming 
holiday he said 
the dealer also attributed the dollars decline to bullish 
movement overnight in new york where the dollar briefly shattered 
the 134yen level 
the market today thursday is taking a break the dealer 
said 
but he added that he expected the dollar to bounce back against 
the yen as soon as the us holiday weekend was over so long as 
the bank of japan does not intervene in the market 
lack of intervention by japans central bank since last week has 
fueled the dollars surge on the tokyo foreign exchange market 
during a regular press conference earlier this week finance 
minister kiichi miyazawa ruled out the possibility of intervention 
and dismissed the current market gyrations as ordinary fluctuations 
however bank of japan governor satoshi sumita told a news 
conference wednesday the nations central bank was ready to take 
appropriate action to brake the dollars rise depending on how 
the us currency moves in the future 
the dollar has risen 345 yen in the past two trading days in 
tokyo 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues up 20924 points on wednesday rose another 12303 
points to 2773036 by the end of the morning trading session
