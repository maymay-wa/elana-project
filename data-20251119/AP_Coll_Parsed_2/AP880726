a critical testfiring of space 
shuttle discoverys three main engines on the launch pad has been 
put off 24 hours until sunday to give crews more time to seal the 
engine compartment 
a practice countdown the first of two leading to the firing 
was halted monday when the launch team decided it could not close 
out the compartment work in time to conduct the test on saturday as 
intended 
the postponement was announced as engineers assessed two major 
candidates for fixing a small shuttle gas leak without having to 
take discovery off the launch pad a move that could delay the 
planned early september launch by as much as two months 
national aeronautics and space administration officials believe 
that even if the leak can be fixed on the pad the launch will be 
delayed past the middle of september 
the two most promising approaches for reaching the inaccessible 
leak for a launch pad fix are 
cutting a hole through the rear wall of the shuttle cargo bay 
and clamping a clamshellshaped device over the leak filling it 
with a sealant 
running a flexible tube topped by a badmintonlike shuttlecock 
through the 20foot gas line filling in the area behind the 
shuttlecock with a sealant 
tests of both systems have been promising nasa officials said 
shuttle managers were scheduled to meet again thursday to consider 
the latest test findings

the explosion in the number of financial 
planners in the 1980s has been matched by a surge in fraud and 
abuse state securities regulators told congress today 
the north american securities administrators association in a 
report to the senate banking subcommittee on consumer affairs said 
losses to fraud and abuse totaled 397 million between mid1986 and 
mid1988 
the losses were suffered by 22100 investors in 79 separate 
cases pursued by officials in 30 states 
that compares with 91 million lost in 31 cases between mid1983 
and mid1985 the association said 
the absence of effective national oversight of the financial 
planning industry has created an enormous opportunity for con 
artists and others who have few scruples about how they earn 
their living the association said 
the group which represents regulators in all 50 states said an 
alarming rise in large swindles contributed to the increase it 
also said more aggressive enforcement probably led to more cases 
being uncovered 
most disturbing is that we are seeing a substantial surge in 
the number of big ticket cases with investor losses in the 
eightfigure range said james c meyer tennessees top 
securities regulator and president of the association 
a 1985 association survey turned up only one case where 
investors lost more than 10 million while the latest check found 
five cases where losses totaled more than 30 million 
with the proliferation of investment options in recent years 
millions of americans have turned to financial planners for advice 
on saving for retirement college education or buying a house 
the securities and exchange commission requires companies 
offering advice concerning securities to register as investment 
advisers but in contrast to stock brokers who are required to 
pass an exam there are no educational standards 
also financial planners offering advice that does not involve 
buying securities do not have to register neither do lawyers and 
accountants whose advice is incidental to their work and 
individuals can work for a registered planner without registering 
themselves 
another contentious issue is how financial planners who are 
supposed to offer independent advice are paid some work only for 
fees paid by their customers but according to an sec study in 
february 85 percent are compensated at least in part through 
commissions on what they sell 
in may the sec censured and suspended a new mexico firm for 
failing to disclose it received commissions for the securities it 
recommended 
the international financial planning association based in 
atlanta says its membership has tripled from the end of 1982 to 
about 25000 it estimates there are as many as 150000 financial 
planners overall about 13000 firms have registered with the sec 
as investment advisers 
charles finn a financial planner in hartford conn and 
chairmanelect of the association said his group has been pushing 
for more federal regulation including the creation of a 
selfregulatory organization similar to the national association of 
securities dealers which oversees brokers who trade 
overthecounter stocks 
were talking here about rotten apples and my feeling is we 
should get those rotten apples out of the barrel he said one 
of the things im concerned about in this business is that somebody 
can call himself a financial planner with impunity 
in a related matter the sec is scheduled to consider a rule 
thursday which would require investment advisers to keep records 
for five years to back up performance claims made in their 
advertising 
the 30 states included in the most recent nasaa survey were 
alabama arizona arkansas california colorado connecticut 
florida georgia idaho illinois indiana maine maryland 
massachusetts missouri nebraska new jersey new york north 
carolina ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania tennessee texas 
utah virginia washington west virginia and wisconsin 
connecticut oregon and wisconsin were not included in the 1985 
survey delaware michigan and wyoming were part of the earlier 
study but not the 1988 survey

the navy is studying why the promotion of 
blacks in its ranks lags behind that of the other services 40 
years after president harry s truman ordered the nations military 
to integrate 
the navy has launched an intensive twomonth study to report to 
chief of naval operations adm carlisle trost on why the service 
has so few black officers and why so many blacks are subject to 
disciplinary action 
the study was initiated at the suggestion of vice admiral la 
edney chief of naval personnel 
progress has slowed we need to find out why edney said at 
a convention of the mostly black naval officers association 
earlier this month in atlanta 
the review coincides with the 40th anniversary today of trumans 
executive order 9981 for equality of treatment and opportunity 
for all persons in the armed forces without regard to race color 
religion or national origin 
the road has been slow especially in the navy the number of 
black officers in the navy has grown from 254 in 1965 to 2518 
today but that means that only 34 percent of the navys officers 
are black far behind the armys rate of 103 percent and the 66 
percent in the military as a whole 
in the air force 54 percent of the officers are black and in 
the marine corps 54 percent 
the navy goal is to reach 6 percent by 1996 that would be quite 
a change for a service which declared as recently as 1933 that 
blacks would be accepted only as mess stewards and which did not 
name its first black admiral samuel l gravely jr until 1971 
according to the weekly navy times 
navy rolls now list six black admirals two of them promoted 
this year the highest ranking black in the navy is twostar rear 
adm benjamin t hacker commander of the navy base and naval 
training center at san diego a major port for the pacific fleet 
while we have experienced significant growth in numbers and 
opportunities for minority personnel we have clearly not met all 
of our challenges edney said in his speech given july 8 
despite our best efforts the navy still suffers from 
shortages in minority officer accessions officer promotions 
enlisted advancement and while lower than past years slightly 
higher minority involvement with uniform code of military justice 
violations he said 
the navy has ordered a separate report due by the end of the 
year to determine why the courtmartial rate for blacks last year 
was 165 percent compared to 134 percent for all naval personnel 
within two months a task force is to report to edney and trost 
on ways to improve the promotion of blacks in the service 
edney proclaimed a commitment to keep equal opportunity on the 
front burner as a top priority it is the right thing to do equal 
opportunity is fundamental to good leadership morale and 
discipline 
the white majority of navy officers he said have a natural 
tendency to be less sensitive to the perceptions and human needs of 
minorities be they minorities of race religion or gender 
top leaders must recognize this tendency and not tolerate such 
insensitivity we must have checks and balances to make sure the 
chain of command is responsive edney said 
the admiral promised that this will not be just another study 
of equal opportunity programs it will be a hard introspective 
look

government biologists are discussing a 25 
percent cutback in duck hunting seasons this fall saying drought 
has produced the worst habitat conditions biologists have ever 
seen 
reduced hunting is one suggestion that advisory committees are 
being asked to consider before the fish and wildlife service holds 
hearings early next month on guidelines for states to use in 
adopting actual hunting regulations 
also put up for discussion spokeswoman megan durham said 
monday are a threebird bag limit the typical recent limit has 
been four and an early closing of the period when hunting is 
permissible jan 1 instead of jan 20 
in other droughtrelated activity in washington president 
reagan wrote key members of agriculture committees in congress on 
monday that some features of a bipartisan drought relief bill for 
farmers might violate principles he believes should be followed 
the president did not say specifically what troubled him but 
during a tour of droughtstricken corn and soybean producing areas 
in southern illinois earlier this month reagan voiced concern that 
the relief package might take on the appearance of a christmas 
tree in which lawmakers attach favored amendments on legislation 
they know will pass the congress 
the advisory committees discussion is beginning with a 
prediction by the fish and wildlife service that the fall duck 
migration will total 66 million ducks second lowest behind only 
the 62 million of 1985 
all the reduction from last years 74 million will come in the 
mississippi and central flyways the migration on the atlantic and 
pacific flyways is expected to be unchanged 
the service has warned several times that hunting most likely 
would have to be restricted this fall not only because of this 
years drought but also because of drought throughout most of the 
1980s in the marshy breeding areas of canada and the northern 
plains states 
the earlyseason guidelines for bluewinged teal hunting in 
september call for canceling the season outright in 13 states and 
for major reductions elsewhere 
last week the service released population counts showing the 
breeding populations of 10 major duck species down 37 percent from 
1987 and 17 percent below the longterm 19551987 average the 
northern pintail duck is at a record low of 258 million 18 
percent fewer than in 1987 and 54 percent below average 
biologists are beginning to worry that continued low water 
conditions in the areas waterfowl use for migration stopovers and 
wintering will concentrate the birds and make them more vulnerable 
to disease later this year the service said in a survey of 
drought problems as seen by its biologists around the country 
there are fewer statistics on nonduck species but the service 
reported the platte river in nebraska has been turned into a 
river of sand exposing the nesting piping plover and the 
interior least tern to threats of predators and death of aquatic 
food species 
pheasant quail and grouse may not be affected until next 
spring when theyll have less cover during nesting season 
some other highlights from the survey 
geese are faring better than ducks since they nest on more 
permanent wetlands and are better able to protect their young from 
predators 
federal hatcheries in south carolina and georgia report rising 
water temperatures are increasing mortality of young trout and on 
monday north carolina state hatcheries were reported rushing 
600000 fish to the states cooler streams a month earlier than 
usual 
fish and wildlife service biologists on the great lakes report 
flows on tributaries are so low they cannot safely apply chemicals 
to control lamprey which prey on lake trout and that dredging 
necessitated by low water will spread contaminated bottom sediment 
threatening other aquatic life 
without significant rain soon a neartotal failure of the 
acorn crop from oak trees in the midwest and south will occur 
spelling problems for deer squirrels and wild turkey dependent on 
acorns for food 
all 750 seedlings of the green pitcher plant an endangered 
species planted by the service in alabama this spring have been 
killed 
the duck population surveys recorded increases and in some cases 
record numbers of ducks in northern canada and alaska this means 
they couldnt find suitable wetland areas further south and may 
not have the energy left to breed at all after their longer flights 
frank dunkle director of the fish and wildlife service said 
last week he expects increased emphasis on habitat management he 
said marshland managed specifically for waterfowl has provided the 
only relief for ducks and other species dependent on prairie 
wetlands

defense secretary frank c carlucci says he 
hopes to curb pentagon purchasing abuses by ordering new limits on 
the number of final offers that defense contractors can make on 
a single deal 
carlucci said at a news conference monday that he was surprised 
to learn how frequently companies were allowed to revise supposedly 
final bids although he described it as the exception rather 
than the rule 
in the past contractors have been allowed to amend their final 
offers in consultation with the pentagon to change prices or 
technical specifications to meet military needs 
the pentagon has been rocked in recent weeks by allegations that 
private consultants working for defense contractors bribed top 
military purchasing officials for secret contract information 
many of the alleged abuses disclosed in the justice department 
investigation involve contractors who through the consultants 
learned the price or other specifics of bids by competing 
companies and then submitted a new best and final offer 
tailored to win contracts some of them worth billions of dollars 
it is the best and final offer that seems to us to create 
the most intensive point in the competitive cycle and that means 
that information is at a premium carlucci said 
we intend to continue with our competitive process but when 
you repeat it once twice or three times then it can readily 
become subject to abuse carlucci added 
carlucci who was scheduled to testify before the house armed 
services committee today also said his aides had drawn up a 
protocol for the military to follow as more information is 
disclosed from the justice department investigation carlucci said 
the department has 
required that 17 companies implicated in the investigation 
certify they did not engage in illegal or improper activity to 
obtain a defense contract 
required those 17 to agree in any new contract greater than 
100000 to include a clause allowing the government to recover 
profits or 10 percent of the contract value if the deal is tainted 
started procedures to lift the security clearances of six 
people including one suspended without pay from the navy 
department and five others transferred to other duties pending 
results of the investigation 
sent letters to the top 200 defense contractors urging them to 
implement strong internal ethics programs stringent management 
controls and asking them to report back to us on their 
selfgovernance programs 
reviewed federal acquisition regulations to tighten controls on 
consultants employed by defense contractors 
formed an audit task force to review the cost imposed on the 
military budget by consultants employed by private defense 
contractors 
carlucci said the certification requirement was being applied 
only to the 17 implicated companies to avoid penalizing contractors 
who were not under suspicion 
this is a rifle action it is not a shotgun action he said 
we are directing this at certain contractors we do not intend to 
apply it indiscriminately because it does impose a burden on 
people 
and where there are burdens there are costs and those costs 
may come back to the pentagon and the us taxpayer he said 
it is only where we have reason to believe that people are under 
suspicion that we are doing this 
carlucci declined to identify people whose security clearances 
were being lifted saying only that we are taking steps to revoke 
the security clearances of individuals who have been involved in 
illegal or improper actions 
in a related development the white house announced that 
president reagan intends to nominate milton l lohr to the new 
position of deputy undersecretary of defense for acquisition 
since 1983 lohr has been president of the defense research 
corp in la jolla calif before that he was executive vice 
president of flight systems inc from 196983 
lohr a 63yearold native of revere mass graduated from the 
university of southern california in 1949 and the university of 
california at los angeles in 1964

president reagan is praising canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney at a time when mulroney is encountering 
opposition to a sweeping uscanadian freetrade pact 
at the same time reagan had kind words monday for a us 
congress that often has come in for his criticism saying lawmakers 
had put the agreement on a fast track just as he asked 
the setting for the presidents remarks was a roosevelt room 
ceremony at which reagan signed letters transmitting to congress 
legislation to implement the agreement 
throughout north american history whenever and wherever trade 
barriers have been lowered weve seen our economies bloom like 
mountain meadows after a spring rain the president said 
this agreement is a sun rising on a new morning of economic 
vitality he said it will save us consumers up to 3 billion 
a year it will help keep the north american economy growing for a 
generation to come 
on jan 2 reagan and mulroney signed an agreement that provides 
for the elimination of all tariffs in the two countries 150 
billionayear trade it also would reduce many nontariff 
barriers liberalize investment practices and provide new rules 
covering crossborder trade in services 
reagan did not allude to the political situation in canada 
where mulroneys liberal party opposition has threatened to stall 
legislation implementing the accord there until mulroney calls new 
elections 
but reagan quoted his canadian counterpart as saying the 
choice couldnt be more clearcut the voices of the past against 
a vision of the future 
i asked the congress to put this on a fast track which it 
did and then some he said auto racing driver rick mears 
couldnt have driven it any faster which shows what we can do when 
democrats and republicans work together 
the accord ran into trouble last week in canada when the 
opposition liberal party vowed to block ratification until mulroney 
calls a general election 
but mulroney in a heated house of commons exchange rejected 
demands for an immediate election to settle the freetrade issue 
a debate that has divided canadians for a century 
at an appropriate time there will be an election mulroney 
said last wednesday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he did not believe 
us officials would comment on the internal affairs of canada in 
terms of their elections 
however he said were still hopeful that they proceed with 
the free trade agreement and that theyll be able to get that 
passed up there as well 
fitzwater also said he hoped canada would not amend or modify 
the agreement he said he did not know whether such a move would 
require a renegotiation of the treaty 
the free trade agreement is scheduled to go into effect jan 1 
1989 provided congress and the canadian parliament pass 
implementing legislation the changes will be phased in during a 
10year period 
the house of commons approved it in principle july 6 and has 
scheduled a third and final reading in midaugust after committee 
hearings the legislation then goes to the senate which has a 
large liberal majority 
canadas two opposition parties the liberals and socialist new 
democrats have accuse mulroney of sacrificing the nations 
sovereignty but mulroney claims the deal will create prosperity 
and shield canada from us protectionism

secretary of state george p shultz completed 
his sixth year in office just a few days ago and its hard to 
recall a time during that period when things looked better for him 
east european nations are showing an increasing tendency to 
diversify their diplomatic contacts reflected in planned visits to 
washington this week by hungarian communist party leader karoly 
grosz and polands foreign minister tadeusz olechowski years have 
passed since either of these soviet allies sent highlevel visitors 
to washington 
in southwestern africa prospects have never seemed brighter for 
the withdrawal of cuban and south african troops from angola and 
for namibian independence from south african colonial rule 
pushed along by a us mediation effort south africa cuba and 
angola have agreed to a statement of principle governing future 
negotiations and are to meet next week to discuss a timetable for 
the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the region 
as shultz sees it the withdrawal of cuban forces from angola 
will free the area of superpower competition for the first time 
since the cubans began arriving there in 1975 in addition a south 
african pullback from namibia would create conditions for 
independent rule in africas last colony 
perhaps the best news for shultz lately is irans decision to 
accept the terms of a united nations security council resolution 
aimed at ending the 20th centurys longest major war 
the administration has been working hard to encourage negotiated 
settlements in both southwestern africa and the persian gulf and 
administration officials in recent days have been feeling heady 
about the progress in both areas 
but its difficult to say whether these gains are the result of 
administration policy or just plain war weariness among the 
combatants the fighting in angola dates back to the early 1960s 
the war in the gulf has claimed more than 1 million lives 
even vietnam is showing a far friendlier face to the outside 
world these days vietnamese forces have occupied neighboring 
cambodia for more than nine years but hanoi has promised to 
withdraw 50000 troops this year and the rest in two years 
it also has demonstrated a far more forthcoming attitude toward 
the united states on such issues as accounting for the nearly 2400 
american servicemen still listed as missing from the vietnam war 
and its treatment of former officials identified with the former 
usbacked regime in saigon 
an american team of technical experts is in hanoi for 
discussions on arrangements for joint onsite inspections to help 
resolve the fate of the missing americans 
all this raises the possibility of eventual diplomatic ties with 
hanoi for the first time since north vietnam became independent 
more than 30 years ago for now however the administration 
refuses even to discuss that possibility waiting instead for a 
complete vietnamese withdrawal from cambodia and a satisfactory 
accounting of mias 
on at least two issues shultz is unable to claim progress his 
efforts to promote arabisraeli peace talks have not borne fruit 
in nicaragua although a fragile ceasefire remains in place the 
peace process is at an impasse and there is talk once again of 
renewed american military aid to the contras 
still the world seems like a far less contentious place to 
shultz than it was at the time of the last presidential election 
in those days shultz was able to cite the us victory over the 
grenadan army as an achievement but not much else 
that was before the rise of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
a time when democrats were criticizing president reagan for being 
the first us president in more than 50 years who had not met with 
a kremlin leader that was four sovietamerican summits ago

over free trade with the united states could force a canadian 
government out of office 
the precedent was set in 1911 when longserving liberal prime 
minister sir wilfred laurier proposed free trade but was pressured 
into an early election and defeated by the conservatives 
the roles are reversed this time 
a conservative prime minister brian mulroney has negotiated 
the uscanada free trade agreement with washington while the 
liberal opposition claims the deal will turn canada into little 
more than a resource base for the americans 
the agreement to dismantle duties and nontariff barriers over a 
10year period is scheduled to take effect jan 1 president reagan 
presented final legislation monday to congress and the canadian 
house of commons is expected to approve the deal in august 
in a bid to halt the ratification process liberal leader john 
turner played his final card last week the commons member asked 
the liberaldominated senate an appointed chamber that can delay 
and amend legislation not to consider the bill until mulroney 
calls an election on the issue 
mulroney accused turner of hijacking the authority of elected 
members of parliament meaning the commons where conservatives 
hold 207 of the 282 seats turners argument is that mulroney has 
no mandate for entering a treaty that radically changes the future 
of canada in 1983 mulroney spoke against free trade and the issue 
was not part of the conservative election platform in 1984 
the agreement should not go into effect until the people of 
canada have had the opportunity to vote on it said turner who 
maintains that such a pact would make canada subservient to its 
giant neighbor 
he urged mulroney to call a september election one year before 
his fiveyear term expires that would provide enough time to 
implement the agreement if voters return mulroney to office the 
liberals would tear up the deal if they win turner said 
polls show canadians divided 5050 on the issue and in favor of 
an election 
but mulroney reacted calmly to what he termed turners act of 
desperation and said he has a full legislative agenda to complete 
before an election 
he got a political boost monday when a prominent liberal george 
van roggen resigned as chairman of the senate foreign affairs 
committee so he could speak out in favor of free trade 
mulroneys camp hoped more liberals would break ranks 
theres a lot bubbling around here and well have to wait and 
see what kind of stew comes out of the pot bruce phillips a top 
mulroney aide said john turner has put a helluva lot of 
pressure on a lot of senators 
canadas second opposition party the socialist new democrats 
dislikes free trade but party leader ed broadbent has accused 
turner of abandoning democracy by using the senate to impede the 
will of the elected parliament 
the conservatives have climbed steadily in the polls this year 
while the other two parties have slumped 
for turner deploying the senate is a gamble because he gave the 
conservatives two diversionary election issues his judgment in 
defying elected legislators and the need for senate reform 
the election outcome may very well be determined more by 
peoples feelings about the senate than about free trade 
columnist orland french wrote monday in the globe and mail the 
national newspaper 
the situation has many parallels with 1911 the conservatives 
then stirred up public opinion with the slogan no truck nor trade 
with the yankees and filibustered for five months to force 
laurier into an early election then as now the government had 
not included free trade in its election platform 
but in 1911 the conservatives did not use the senate to stop 
the treaty

more than 300000 mercedesbenz automobiles 
are under investigation to determine if hundreds of reports of 
unintended acceleration are true the national highway traffic 
safety administration says 
the agency said monday it had broadened its probe into 
allegations that the vehicles speed up without the operators 
intervention to encompass 309000 cars made by mercedes from 1984 
through 1988 the cars are all equipped with gasoline engines and 
automatic transmissions 
nhtsa in october had begun an investigation into 42353 
19861987 mercedes model 124 300e cars the new engineering 
analysis broadens the regulatory case to include the mercedes 
models 107 sl 126 se sel and sec and 201 190e 
nhtsa said it has received reports of 301 instances of sudden 
acceleration in the mercedes cars the agency said 217 of the 
instances reportedly resulted in accidents that injured 92 people 
and killed one person 
mercedesbenz of north america will cooperate fully with the 
nhtsa investigation said ab schuman a spokesman for the company 
in montvale nj 
he said in the companys investigation of 283 
suddenacceleration reports our technicians have never found any 
electrical electronic or mechanical defect in our cars that could 
cause unintended acceleration 
the mercedes case is among six nhtsa investigations into alleged 
sudden acceleration involving at least 48 million vehicles other 
makers and the number of vehicles involved are ford motor co 32 
million general motors corp 800000 audi 255000 nissan 
183000 and honda 62500 
the mercedes investigation was opened at the request of the 
center for auto safety a consumer group often at odds with the 
auto industry and its regulators 
the steady increase in sudden acceleration incidents in 
numerous mercedes models other than the 198687 300e demonstrates 
that mercedes entire line of recentyear gasoline engine cars with 
automatic transmissions is affected by this defect the center 
said 
the center said it had received 164 reports of sudden 
acceleration in mercedes cars resulting in 125 accidents 46 
injuries and one death

the governments peanut program restricts 
production and causes somewhat higher retail prices says an 
agriculture department economist 
but the program also helps provide a steady highquality 
supply of peanuts for consumers through a twotiered price 
support system says jim schaub of the departments economic 
research service 
the twotier system is scheduled to continue at least through 
the 1990 peanut marketing year it involves a support rate for 
peanuts grown under a national quota and a much lower rate for 
peanuts grown in addition to the quota 
quota peanuts are sold for domestic food and related uses while 
the additional peanuts are used for export or crushing into oil 
and meal 
schaub whose analysis is in the current national food review 
said net outlays by the departments commodity credit corp 
averaged 10 million annually between 1982 and 1986 well below the 
average of 30 million during the 1960s and the 61 million of the 
1970s 
the current program is expected to keep costs to us 
taxpayers to a minimum because the program is designed for quota 
production to equal domestic food and related demand he said 
however schaub acknowledged that the peanut program could cost 
substantially more if the national marketing quota greatly exceeded 
what processors want to buy at the quota rate should that happen 
the government would wind up buying the unwanted peanuts and hold 
them as surplus 
the 1988 price support or loan rate is 61527 per ton for 
peanuts grown within a farmers quota the support for additional 
peanuts is 14975 per ton 
farmers put their crop in storage arranged by grower 
associations the peanuts then are pooled and controlled by the 
associations and the ccc if the association sells the peanuts at a 
profit growers participating in that pool are eligible for 
dividend payments 
if the peanuts cannot be sold on the market at the quota price 
the ccc is obligated to buy them at the quota rate 
schaub said the peanut program does raise consumer prices and 
lower supplies by supporting farmers prices and setting quota but 
its difficult to say what prices would be without the program 
we do know that the breakeven price for peanuts the longrun 
average price needed for growers to recover all production costs 
was about 420 per ton in 1986 he said therefore a free 
market price would likely be closer to 420 than the 607aton 
quota loan rate set for that year 
but schaub added that even these numbers can be questioned 
because the peanut programs which go back to 1934 have existed 
so long that farmers have altered production and marketing 
practices accordingly 
americans consume an average of about 85 pounds of peanuts a 
year on a per capita basis including peanut butter and candy as 
well as roasted salted and from the shell 
schaub said the government programs probably have not had a 
significant impact on peanut demand at least partly because there 
are few good comparably priced substitutes in other words he 
said lower prices would not necessarily mean substantially greater 
consumption

some 46 million in public money to finance 
michael dukakis democratic presidential campaign is being held up 
temporarily by a tangle over running mate lloyd bentsens dual 
campaigns for vice president and the senate 
the national republican senatorial committee filed a complaint 
with the federal election commission alleging that any money 
bentsen spends on his senate reelection bid in texas will directly 
benefit the partys presidential ticket and give it an unfair 
advantage over the republicans 
the fec was considering the matter today commission spokeswoman 
sharon snyder said the commission has 10 days to decide how to 
handle the unprecedented issue 
the dukakis campaign filed its request for the money late 
friday and the existence of the gop complaint will add to the time 
it takes to release the federal campaign funds she said 
jann olsten executive director of the gop senate committee 
said at a news conference monday that bentsen is poised to spend 
more than 4 million on his senate reelection campaign at the same 
time he is running for vice president an unusual texas law permits 
bentsen to seek both offices simultaneously 
there is no denying that one race is going to impact the 
other olsten said a dollar spent by senator bentsen in texas 
whether for the senate or the vice presidential campaign is going 
to directly and immediately benefit both it just isnt fair 
the 1976 law that created public financing for presidential 
campaigns stipulates that candidates who receive the federal money 
cannot accept private funds for their campaigns the 46 million 
each for the democratic and republican tickets comes from a 1 
checkoff on individual income tax returns 
the nrsc in a complaint filed friday with the fec asked that 
the government withhold the federal campaign funds until it either 
bars the spending of bentsens senate campaign chest or determines 
to count any senate campaign spending against the 46 million limit 
bentsens senate opponent rep beau boulter rtexas said at a 
houston news conference that bentsen intends to circumvent the law 
and should either bow out of the senate race or not spend money 
raised for the senate race 
nobody expects him to do either boulter said he wants it 
both ways 
bentsen spokesman jack devore said bentsens legal advisers had 
researched the issue and believed there was no problem with 
conducting and financing both campaigns and said the gop was 
trying to win a free ride for boulter 
they know the bentsen senate campaign would help the national 
ticket whether sen bentsen was part of the ticket or not devore 
said what theyre really saying is theyre scared silly 
fec spokeswoman snyder noted that the only other case involving 
a similiar but not parallel situation was in 1976 when bentsen 
ran for president and for the senate 
the commission at that time was asked to rule on whether he 
could spend the legal limit for both his senate and presidential 
primary race the decision was that he could not because he would 
gain a significant publicity advantage over his rivals by 
spending more money overall throughout texas 
but that ruling is not a good precedent for this case because 
there are no limits on senate campaign spending any more and the 
issues are different said snyder 
it was a different legal situation she said 
the current case is more likely to revolve around how various 
campaign expenses are paid for such things as whether senate 
campaign photos of bentsen with dukakis could be paid out of his 
senate fund or would be considered presidential expenditures 
another potential gray area might involve which campaign would 
pay for signs stating vote bentsen without any further 
indication of what office was being referenced 
olsten said if the fec should rule against the republican 
complaint it was likely that the party would seek a federal court 
injunction to halt the flow of federal campaign money 
bentsens latest senate campaign report shows he has 39 
million in cash on hand for his senate race since the beginning of 
1987 he has raised more than 6 million

michael dukakis is maintaining his hybrid schedule 
of statehouse duties and presidential campaigning by tending to 
gubernatorial tasks today including a lawandorder event 
dukakis was spending most of today at the office with a visit 
to a new police post at a downtown subway stop to swear in six new 
members of the state transit authority police force 
the massachusetts governor spent all of monday at the 
statehouse putting aside state business for an hourlong meeting 
with hungarian prime minister karoly grosz before the communist 
leader headed to washington to meet president reagan 
wednesday also was to be a statehouse day for dukakis who kicks 
off an eightstate campaign swing thursday 
dukakis kept a low profile monday refusing to comment as he 
walked grosz out of his office to an elevator surrounded by 
reporters 
grosz is the first east european communist party leader to come 
to the united states in 10 years and the first hungarian leader to 
visit this country in more than 40 years 
at the top of dukakis state agenda is legislative unrest with 
some of the 138 million in planned spending dukakis vetoed from 
the states fiscal 1989 budget some lawmakers irate over the 
slashing of 91 million in local aid have asked the legislative 
leadership to halt a summer recess so they can attempt to override 
the vetoes 
not to worry all is well dukakis said when asked monday 
afternoon to discuss a meeting between the administrations top 
budget officer and house speaker george keverian 
dukakis schedule this week fits with his primary season 
practice of spending monday through wednesday at the statehouse 
before heading out to campaign he is expected to continue that 
pattern through much of the general election campaign 
the tentative schedule for this weeks trip includes stops in 
new jersey pennsylvania ohio michigan missouri illinois 
wisconsin and north carolina 
dukakis running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen took a weekend 
campaign trip with dukakis but was not scheduled to campaign with

disturbances broke out among inmates at a 
maximumsecurity prison injuring eight guards a prison 
psychologist and three inmates authorities said 
it appears to be under control luther starnes assistant 
press secretary to gov william donald schaefer said about an hour 
after ambulances were sent to the maryland penitentiary in downtown 
baltimore 
state police spokesman cpl greg shipley said no prisoners 
escaped 
schaefer met monday night with the prison warden and state 
prison officials and said afterward that he was satisfied with 
their handling of the disturbance 
shipley said the disturbance began in the recreation yard 
shortly before 1 pm spread to a crisis clinic where the 
psychologist was having a session with inmates and erupted again 
in another section of the yard he said a minor fire also was set 
in the clinic 
baltimore police carrying shotguns immediately surrounded the 
perimeter of the prison and a police helicopter flew overhead 
several downtown streets were blocked off causing traffic backups 
prison officials did not know the reason for the three incidents 
and do not think they were organized shipley said 
two homemade knives were recovered and several gunshots also 
were fired he said 
officials said the prison immediately was locked down with 
inmates locked in their cells 
two inmates one in critical condition and one in fair were 
being treated for gunshot wounds said anita hisley spokeswoman 
for johns hopkins hospital the third inmate was being treated at 
the prison hospital which handles lessserious injuries officials

neck but authorities believe he may have been wounded by another 
officer during the melee he and two other guards were 
hospitalized while the others were treated and released 
the psychologist was treated for facial injuries and released

state county and municipal employees which represents 
correctional officers 
the penitentiary which opened in 1811 ordinarily holds 700 to 
800 men but mondays inmate count was 1270 eighteen of its

president jose napoleon duarte 
called a central american peace plan a regional declaration of 
independence but accused nicaragua of not fulfilling obligations 
under the yearold effort 
also monday guerrillas set fire to a bowling alley in the 
capital to retaliate after police dispersed an antigovernment 
march the manager said 
no one was reported hurt and no group claimed responsibility for 
the attack 
duarte 62 appeared energetic monday during his first news 
conference since he returned to el salvador july 11 after six weeks 
of medical treatment in the united states he is suffering from 
terminal liver cancer and doctors give him six to 18 months more to 
live 
duarte accused nicaraguas leftist sandinista government of not 
adhering to terms of the peace plan signed aug 7 in guatemala by 
the five central american presidents 
the plan calls for negotiations between governments and 
insurgents to end civil wars in nicaragua el salvador and 
guatemala it also calls for amnesties for politically motivated 
crimes moves toward democratization and a ban on outside support 
for guerrilla movements 
the plan has fulfilled many of its objectives and must be 
considered a declaration of principles and for me it has been a 
second declaration of independence for central america duarte 
said 
in the short term some of the plans objectives have been 
fulfilled and some have not been fulfilled he said without 
elaborating 
nicaragua in signing the accord made an appearance of 
trying to put it into practice but obviously that put it into 
confrontation with democracy he added 
duarte accused the sandinistas of supporting leftist salvadoran 
guerrillas battling his usbacked government 
duartes government declared an amnesty for political crimes and 
lifted a state of emergency to comply with the peace initiative 
but there have been no talks between the government and rebels 
since october 
the foreign ministers of guatemala el salvador costa rica and 
honduras meet aug 1 in guatemala city with us secretary of state 
george shultz to discuss the plans achievements and shortcomings 
duarte said there are no plans for a meeting of presidents to 
mark the initiatives first anniversary 
meanwhile 10 to 12 masked men with pistols and at least one 
submachine gun set fire to a bowling alley after taking money from 
about 30 patrons and identifying themselves as urban commandos 
of the faribundo marti liberation front said guillermo castro 
manager of the bolerama jardin 
the front a coalition of five guerrilla groups has waged an 
8yearold war against the government 
castro said the guerrillas took money they said was a 
contribution to the cause they said the attack was in reprisal 
for the governments repression of thursdays march 
the guerrillas then doused several pool tables in a room 
adjoining the main bowling area with gasoline and set them afire 
castro said 
firefighters arrived within 15 minutes and extinguished the 
blaze 
castro said none of the bowling alleys owners has any 
connection with the government and that he did not understand why 
the business was targeted 
on thursday last week police used tear gas and fired shots in 
the air to break up an antigovernment demonstration in san 
salvador protesters then burned at least nine vehicles 
human rights groups estimate more than 65000 people have been 
killed in el salvador since the civil war began in october 1979

a judge has scheduled an impeachment 
trial for an 85yearold mayor who last week donned a turban and 
rubber snakes while declaring national voodoo week 
but an attorney for florala mayor ht mathis said the trial is 
moot because the mayors fouryear term ends oct 3 
really i think he is more interested in clearing his name than 
anything else said attorney james prestwood 
covington county circuit judge william baldwin on monday refused 
to dismiss charges of neglect of duty corruption and incompetency 
and set an aug 29 trial date 
last week while clad in a turban and rubber snakes mathis 
proclaimed national voodoo week at a midnight news conference 
on the steps of the county courthouse 
the mayor said national voodoo week was aimed at promoting 
publicity for the town and peace among the residents 
attorney general don siegelman has accused mathis of 
mismanagement and improperly pardoning about two dozen drunken 
drivers in florala a town of about 2200 residents on the 
alabamaflorida border 
mathis has said he has pardoned numerous dui convictions because 
of what he calls overzealous police officers 
siegelman said mathis voodoo antics may be an issue at the 
trial 
mathis said siegelman had no right to ask a judge to empanel the 
county grand jury that returned the impeachment recommendation 
prestwood said he was absolutely optimistic that mathis 
would be found innocent at the impeachment trial but may seek a 
delay to prepare for the trial

a soldier who was jogging in a neighborhood 
near clark air base became the first us serviceman to be killed 
in the philippines in nine months when gunmen shot him from a 
speeding car authorities said 
a us air force statement identified the victim as technical 
sgt richard blackmer 31 of the cleveland suburb of brook park 
blackmer was assigned to the 1961 communications group 
the statement said he was shot while jogging in the mountain 
view subdivision of angeles city less than a mile from the bases 
main gate angeles city is 50 miles northwest of manila 
a clark base spokeswoman capt maryellen jadick said initial 
reports indicate the shooting was criminal in nature and not 
politically motivated ms jadick interviewed by telephone from 
the associated press bureau in manila would not elaborate on how 
blackmer was killed 
police lt federico naguit said a car sped by blackmer as he 
jogged in mountain view and gunmen in the vehicle sprayed the man 
with automatic gunfire 
it was the first slaying of a us serviceman in the philippines 
since oct 28 1987 when gunmen killed two activeduty american 
servicemen and a retired us military man outside clark leftist 
guerrillas claimed responsibility for the october attacks 
the pentagon said the clark office of special investigations and 
local authorities are conducting a joint probe of the shooting

the nuclear regulatory commission is 
reevaluating the use of a wiring insulation found in most us 
nuclear power plants after discovering damaged electrical circuits 
at several facilities according to a published report 
uldis potapovs chief of the commissions unit that inspects 
vendorsupplied plant equipment said the insulating material known 
as kapton appears to damage easily under mechanical stress and even 
in routine handling by plant maintenance crews the fort worth 
startelegram reported in tuesdays editions 
worn or damaged kapton has been discovered on electrical wires 
that connect reactor containment buildings with mainplant control 
circuits located outside the reactor potapovs told the newspaper 
he said such damage is a significant concern because it 
could cause erroneous equipment readings or failure of equipment 
but there has never been a failure serious enough to produce a fire 
kapton can be found on wiring in most of the nations 104 
operating nuclear power plants potapovs said 
kapton made by ei du pont de nemours amp co is a thin 
lightweight insulation often used to wrap wiring in 
highperformance aircraft it has been cited as a factor in dozens 
of aircraft fires and is suspected of contributing to dozens more 
the startelegram has reported in a series of stories this week 
du pont has long maintained that its insulation does not crack 
or break any sooner than other insulation 
the us navy which has banned kapton in its aircraft says the 
material deteriorates prematurely cracks easily and even explodes 
under certain conditions 
but other kapton users including the air force and most 
commercial aircraft builders say the insulation is the best on the 
market for the job 
asked if the nrc might call for a ban on kapton in nuclear 
plants potapovs said that certainly would be a possibility 
but potapovs added that it seems more likely that the agency 
will issue a nonbinding notice to plant operators recommending 
that kapton wires be reinforced with a sleeve or coating and that 
maintenance crews be instructed in how to best handle the material 
the nrc has already issued one notice dealing with kapton 
problems at nuclear power plants agency records show the agency 
reported feb 4 1987 that wires wrapped with kapton had shorted 
out because of insulation degradation on two occasions at 
separate plants 
the wires were in small electric motors that regulated the 
opening and closing of steam supply valves at the plants

a gene found to be defective in a rare 
eye cancer has been linked to breast cancer and a common form of 
lung cancer researchers say 
the gene was the first of a new group of anticancer genes that 
normally protect against cancer but allow cancer to appear when 
defective said ray white of the howard hughes medical institute at 
the university of utah in salt lake city 
similar anticancer genes now have also been linked to colon 
cancer another common and lethal form of cancer 
the findings that the gene is linked to breast cancer and 
socalled smallcell lung cancer suggest that it and other 
anticancer genes could play a major role in many types of human 
cancer white told genetics students at the jackson laboratory in 
bar harbor on monday 
identifying those genes and determining how they go wrong does 
not mean cancer will then be eliminated white said but the 
understanding of these genetic abnormalities is crucial to 
ultimately being able to wipe out cancer he said 
over the shorter term he said understanding the genetics of 
cancer might allow doctors to diagnose subtypes of common cancers 
and learn to treat them better 
the gene was identified in children with a rare eye cancer known 
as retinoblastoma white and webster cavenee at the ludwig 
institute for cancer research in montreal were among the scientists 
who made that initial discovery and learned how the gene worked 
later those retinoblastoma children were found to develop 
osteosarcoma a bone cancer also as a result of defects in the 
retinoblastoma gene 
more recently researchers at the university of california san 
francisco led by wenhwa lee and eva lee have found that the gene 
is defective in certain breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory 
about the same time frederic kaye and colleagues at the 
national cancer institutenavy medical oncology branch reported 
seeing retinoblastoma gene defects in smallcell lung cancer cells 
in the laboratory 
it may well be that the majority of smallcell lung cancers 
involve a lesion in the retinoblastoma gene as well as several 
others said white 
retinoblastoma affects perhaps 1000 americans annually but 
smallcell lung cancer strikes 30000 people in the united states 
every year and breast cancer strikes 130000 
suddenly a gene that was important only in a rare disease is 
now seen to be significant in two of the most important and most 
devastating human cancers 
meanwhile white had identified a similar anticancer gene in a 
rare form of inherited colon cancer 
he said monday he has now shown that this anticancer gene plays 
a role in the much more common noninherited form of colon cancer 
that is another one of the countrys leading cancer killers 
bert vogelstein of the johns hopkins university school of 
medicine in baltimore also has identified several other genetic 
defects associated with colon cancer 
he estimated that perhaps as many as seven genetic defects must 
occur for colon cancer to develop he said he and white have now 
identified five of those defects 
you can look at these genetic alterations as the causes of 
cancer just as you can look at bacteria as the causes of 
infection vogelstein said in a telephone interview except 
its more complicated in cancer

david rose thought a clump of grass 
got caught in his cars suspension during a camping trip but he 
was in for a surprise when he tried to remove the object 
i touched it and it moved and then i moved too rose 33 
said monday i thought it was a snake or something 
the grass turned out to be a hedgehog a small spiny 
porcupinelike mammal the hedgehog hitched 350 miles underneath 
the car last weekend before rose found the prickly little beast 
curled up in the suspension 
i thought it was grass rose said 
rose said he found the hedgehog while cleaning the car and his 
camping trailer after a sevenhour drive from cornwall in 
southwestern england to long eaton near nottingham in the north 
i dropped a screwdriver under the car he said the 
hedgehog really surprised me 
rose a sheetmetal worker dismantled the suspension and 
removed the frightened animal taking care not to touch it he fed 
the ravenous little creature cat food and milk 
the royal society for the prevention of cruelty of animals later 
picked up the hedgehog and planned to release it in the 
countryside rose said 
hedgehogs which grow to a foot in length including the tail 
are covered with sharp spines and often roll into a ball when 
alarmed they inhabit the undergrowth in woodlands and along the 
edges of fields and rarely venture out in daylight

they pay no dues have no scheduled meetings and

they have a policy of kindly waves of the left hand to 
indicate fellowship with other riders 
they are the chickens from heck motorcycle and bridge club an 
organization not known for striking fear into the hearts of 
motorists small communities or other riders 
the chickens from heck motorcycle and bridge club do not 
consider themselves superior or patronizing in any respect said 
blair chotzinoff the fivemember clubs grand capon 
the club whose motto is ride slow and snack often 
undertakes no runs or major trips its haphazard ride schedule 
consists of lastminute phone calls when one of the chickens feels 
like a leisurely jaunt at highway speeds close enough to legal 
limits to be of no interest to police chotzinoff said 
a good thing one of the chickens is denver traffic court judge 
ray satter 
it would be a mistake to call them hardcore riders they have 
canceled more trips than they have taken because comfort plays a 
major role in their decisionmaking 
last thursday for example the chickens rode to the denver 
botanic gardens for high tea 
they bring pate and other gourmet treats on their denver 
symphony orchestra benefit rides a premium offered to those who 
donate 50 or more during the orchestras annual fundraiser they 
have yet to make an outofstate trip 
we were going to take our first and go to omaha but there 
were tornadoes and rainstorms that week and i dont know what 
else chotzinoff said so instead we went out to the pawnee 
grasslands but they had no more grass than anywhere else 
we did find a great truck stop south of greeley on that 
trip satter said

us officials say they have come up with no 
hard evidence that soviet troops are returning to afghanistan 
despite a statement saturday from pakistans president mohammad zia 
alhaq 
the officials did tell the associated press on monday however 
that the soviets would have difficulty meeting the aug 15 deadline 
for withdrawing half the 115000 troops they had in afghanistan 
state department spokesman charles e redman said monday we 
fully expect the soviets to honor their obligation under the geneva 
accords to have half their troops out of afghanistan by aug 15th 
and well continue to watch the situation carefully 
redman said the united states had received assurances from 
moscow that they intend to meet their afghan accord 
responsibilities 
the basic fact of the matter is there is no evidence of a 
reintroduction of soviet troops said one official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
we doubt they are sending new troops in but it will be very 
difficult to get the old ones out another us official said 
the pace of withdrawal stalled over the last two or three 
months but they have enough time to get out by aug 15 a 
third us official said 
us officials still expressed concerned that some soviet 
military leaders found withdrawing under rebel fire difficult and 
that the soviet military commander in kabul had indicated last week 
that thousands of new troops would be sent to the embattled country 
the commanders remarks were conveyed to zia by the united 
nations team that is monitoring the red armys withdrawal 
zia then touched off alarm bells on saturday with a statement 
that the soviets decided not only to stop their withdrawal but 
they have brought in something like 10000 troops back from the 
soviet union into kabul because kabul was under threat 
the soviet military commander in kabul may have spoken without 
the authorization of his superiors in moscow or he may have been 
trying to unsettle the pakistanis who channeled us weapons to 
the rebels and took in hundreds of thousands of afghan refugees 
officials said 
we may never understand what happened one us official 
said maybe the soviet general was speaking prematurely or they 
were trying to get the pakistanis off balance when he made the 
statement to zia 
in moscow the chief of the soviet general staff marshal sergei 
f akhromeyev rejected the pakistani charge over the weekend as 
pure slander and said the soviet withdrawal was proceeding in 
full compliance with the geneva accords 
the soviets pledged in the accords signed in may to withdraw 
half their troops by aug 15 and the remainder by feb 15 the red 
army has fought for 7 years alongside the prosoviet government in 
kabul against the usbacked rebels some of whom want to 
establish an islamic fundamentalist state along the lines of the 
one in iran

paul volcker the former head of the federal 
reserve board says the world bank is in danger of fading away as 
the biggest source of aid to the third world unless congress acts 
soon to make a new contribution 
the bank headed by barber b conable a former congressman from 
new york wants a us pledge of 701 million a year over the next 
six years for a badlyneeded increase in its capital 
our influence and leadership within the bank are certainly at 
stake and i would raise the question volcker told a news 
conference on monday if the united states is not going to 
participate in capital increases whether the bank itself can 
survive over a long period of time 
so far 140 of the 151 governments that own the bank have 
decided to contribute president reagan has urged approval of the 
us contribution but it has been held up in congress by 
disagreement over what should be done to handle the bulk of the

federal rules requiring shrimp fishermen to 
use devices to prevent sea turtles from being snared and drowned in 
nets would be delayed until next year under a compromise approved 
by the senate 
the senate on monday gave voice vote approval to a compromise 
worked out by opponents and backers of the regulation 
the amendment proposed by sen howell heflin dala says 
shrimp boats would not have to use turtle excluder devices in 
offshore waters before may 1 1989 or in inshore waters before may 
1 1990 
the agreement allows debate to move forward on legislation to 
reauthorize and strengthen the endangered species act which has 
technically been without legislative authorization since oct 1

horse shows for all breeds will be able to 
continue under new agriculture department regulations that were 
supported by horse organizations according to sen mitch mcconnell 
horse shows for many breeds were closed earlier this year after 
the american horse protection association filed a lawsuit seeking 
enforcement of regulations primarily for walking horses that had 
adversely affected much of the industry 
these recommendations were reached after weeks of negotiations 
with every major horse organization throughout the country 
mcconnell rky said monday now that the regulations are 
permanent horse shows throughout kentucky and the nation can 
continue without the fear of being shut down 
major provisions of the new regulations include a new uniform 
standard for pads that would apply to all horse breeds new rules 
on pad material rejection of a proposal by usda to further limit 
the weight of horseshoes and new guidelines on examination 
procedures for horses exhibited in walking horse shows

filipino officials announced tuesday 
they were indefinitely suspending talks on the status of us 
military bases because of substantial disagreement with us 
officials over compensation 
but an american spokeswoman said the break in the talks that 
began in april was only temporary and that the us side expects 
the negotiations to resume shortly 
as has happened several times in the past there has been a 
temporary break in the talks said us embassy spokeswoman mary 
carlin yates in a telephone interview mrs yates is also the us 
panels spokeswoman 
we do not consider the talks suspended she added such 
temporary break occur from time to time particularly when one side 
needs time to consider a proposal from the other 
the current talks are held every five years to review terms of 
the 1947 agreement allowing the united states to keep clark air 
base subic bay naval base and four smaller installations 
the manila government is pressing for an increase in the 180 
million it receives annually from washington for use of the bases 
before the talks began foreign secretary raul manglapus said the 
amount of 12 billion annually would be more realistic 
the amount offered by the americans was far far below what 
we were demanding said leonides caday a member of the 
philippine panel he added that the suspension would last 
indefinitely declined to elaborate 
i dont see the point in continuing these talks juanita 
amatong another philippine panel member quoted manglapus as 
telling us ambassador nicholas platt before the talks broke off 
on monday manglapus said that the two panels were nearing 
agreement but that they may not complete the negotiations by an 
endofthemonth deadline 
tuesdays statement said only that there was substantial 
disagreement on the compensation issue as a result of which the 
philippine panel moved for the suspension of the talks 
the talks do not directly affect the status of the bases after 
1991 when the agreement expires but a successful review is 
expected to influence the manila governments decision on whether 
to extend the agreement beyond 1991 
president corazon aquino says she will honor the current 
agreement but refuses to say whether she will support an extension 
after 1991 
under the new philippine constitution any extension must be in 
the form of a treaty ratified by the philippine senate where 
opposition to the bases is currently strong

an animator has given in to a conservative media 
watchdog group and cut a segment from a mighty mouse cartoon but 
maintains the scene shows the cartoon character sniffing flowers 
not snorting cocaine 
these 3 seconds of footage have been taken totally out of 
context by individuals who seem to be searching for sinister 
undertones in a cartoon animator ralph bakshi said in a 
statement monday 
some have chosen to interpret the frames as showing a 
character using drugs continued bakshi who won an action for 
childrens television award for the mighty mouse series on cbstv 
nothing could be further from the truth 
but the rev donald wildmon head of the american family 
association called bakshis decision a victory for his group 
this is a de facto admission that indeed mighty mouse was 
snorting cocaine wildmon said from his tupelo miss office 
we have been vindicated by cbs itself 
wildmon on monday also demanded bakshis removal as producer of 
the saturday morning cartoon and reiterated his call for the firing 
of judy parker cbstvs vice president for childrens programming 
he asked for a public apology by the network because of the april 
23rd episode titled the littlest tramp 
cbs said the cartoon has been rerun twice and will be shown 
again but no date was given 
the 11minute episode involves mighty mouses efforts to save 
polly a poor but industrious flower seller from a villain who 
destroys her flowers 
just before vanquishing the villain mighty mouse either sniffs 
cocaine according to wildmon or inhales the aroma of flowers in 
typical cartoon fashion according to cbs 
mighty mouse was happy after smelling the flowers because it 
helped him remember the little girl who sold it to him fondly 
said bakshi creator of the xrated fritz the cat animated 
movies in the 1970s 
but even if youre right their accusations become part of the 
air we breathe and thats why i cut the scene i cant have 
children wondering if mighty mouse is using cocaine 
bakshi said the work of the american family association is the 
same thing as mccarthyism 
the principal thrust of this episode is to show the redeeming 
quality of love and kindness said cbs entertainment president 
kim lemaster in a statement supporting bakshi there is nothing 
in the story line the dialogue or the behavior of mighty mouse 
that would suggest otherwise 
wildmon last year pressured cbs into scrapping plans for a 
cartoon based on the garbage pail kids cards 
other targets of the fundamentalist preacher have been the 
bloom county comic strip and adult magazines like penthouse 
and playboy the 711 and stopngo convenience store chains 
dropped penthouse and playboy in part due to pressure from wildmon

an oil exploration ship crashed into a 
barge and overturned leaving 71 people missing and feared dead in 
the second major boat accident in southwestern sichuan province in 
four days reports said today 
the sichuan daily said the yunhang no 24 a wooden vessel 
leased by the sichuan petroleum administration overturned monday 
morning in the yangtze river after colliding with a barge 
twentyfive people were rescued 
most of those on board were workers from a geological 
prospecting team the report said 
the collision took place in yunyang county about 280 miles east 
of the provincial capital of chengdu 
the daily said the boats engine died after the vessel slammed 
into a rock the boat then began drifting backward with the rapid 
current crashing into the oncoming barge 
the report said the yangtze chinas longest river is deep and 
swiftmoving in the area of the accident making rescue efforts 
difficult it said 675000 of oil surveying equipment sank with 
the ship 
the daily also said 77 bodies had been recovered from a 
passenger boat which sank on thursday after hitting a rock in the 
min river a tributary of the yangtze 
it said 153 people were rescued from the chuanyun no 24 while 
more than 100 remained missing 
the official xinhua news agency late monday said 72 deaths had 
been confirmed 152 were safe and about 30 were unaccounted for 
estimates on the number missing have varied considerably partly 
because of poor communications with the remote mountain area where 
the accident occurred and partly because of confusion over the 
number of passengers aboard 
the ferry reportedly stopped at several places along its route 
from yibin to leshan letting people off and taking on new 
passengers 
china has been plagued by disasters on its overcrowded 
transportation system this year five fatal train accidents have 
left 169 dead while the crash of a chinese airliner also in 
sichuan in january killed 108

last week he is expected to make a decision the first week of 
august 
jeff lublin howdeshells lawyer said his clients rights are 
paramount to those of the grandparents since the childs mother is 
unable to care for crystal 
but mrs shamp said in an interview that taking crystal away 
from them would be just like taking one of our own away 
we have raised that little girl she said the only reason 
we filed for temporary custody is because patti asked us to we all 
want crystal to stay here 
everybody seems to treat patti as though she doesnt exist 
like she was dead mentally there is absolutely nothing wrong with 
her it seems that her feelings about crystal dont count because 
shes handicapped she said 
ms shamp met howdeshell when her family lived in morenci in the 
late 1970s but shortly after they were married in 1979 their 
relationship soured 
after they separated several years ago howdeshell gained 
custody of their son shane now 7 ms shamp had custody of

the government sought to cool trade 
tensions today by lifting a 3yearold ban on imported beef but 
limited this years shipments to 14500 tons 
agriculture minister yun kunhwan who made the announcement 
did not say how much beef will be imported after this year but 
indicated imports will be limited in order to protect the local 
beef industry 
officials said the government will maintain an import quota 
system which has been opposed by washington 
the end to the import ban was designed to avoid trade friction 
with foreign countries while at the same time alleviating domestic 
beef shortages yun said 
washington has been pressing south korea to drop the ban on beef 
and many other imports to help correct seouls 10 billion trade 
surplus with the united states 
there was no immediate reaction from local farmers who have 
strongly opposed imports of beef unless the government guaranteed a 
definite price support system before lifting the import ban 
many korean farmers went bankrupt due to an excessive import of 
foreign beef cattle before the last ban was imposed in 1985 
farmers have staged demonstrations to demand retention of the 
import ban

scriptwriters strike continued past midnight mondays deadline set 
by a federal mediator 
at the opening of contract talks monday afternoon 
representatives of the writers guild of america and the alliance of 
motion picture and television producers were told they had nine 
hours to end their labor dispute that has crippled the industry 
at 12 midnight were going to be through said floyd wood 
district director for the federal mediation and conciliation 
service im going to conclude the negotiations at midnight 
but the talks continued after midnight 
wood one of two mediators taking part in mondays talks did 
not say what would happen if the two sides were unable to reach a 
settlement by that time he did say however the deadline was 
imposed to keep these people thinking about solutions and push 
them toward a settlement 
wood also had said the writers and producers were making 
progress in the marathon contract talks which were ordered by 
mediator leonard farrell last week and began saturday both sides 
are working hard wood said 
because of a news blackout ordered by farrell neither the wga 
nor the producers alliance could comment on the negotiations 
wga sources familiar with the negotiations speaking on 
condition of anonymity said earlier monday that the producers 
alliance so far has made few concessions in weekend bargaining 
sessions the first two of which lasted 13 hours each 
at issue in the strike which began march 7 are payments for 
onehour television programs rebroadcast domestically and all 
television shows rebroadcast overseas 
on june 22 the wga roundly rejected the producers last 
contract offer which the producers alliance has repeatedly 
described as final 
the strike has resulted in a delay of the fall television season 
and sweeping layoffs throughout the entertainment industry 
the wga is proceeding with pickets called for wednesday morning 
at the offices of television producer aaron spelling and the warner 
bros and columbia studios

president fidel castro today marks the 
35th anniversary of his revolutionary fight to power facing a 
battle against inefficiency that has dogged the economic 
performance of his communist state 
castro traditionally gives his most important speech of the year 
on the anniversary of his failed effort to take the moncada 
garrison here on july 26 1953 he came to power less than six 
years later on jan 1 1959 
the government has a 2yearold rectification campaign to 
eradicate employee absenteeism low productivity and other signs of 
inefficiency in the island nations economy 
but domestic commercial production fell by 32 percent last 
year while cubas foreign debt grew by 6718 million to 56 
billion the economy is heavily dependent on the sugar industry 
which has suffered poor harvests for three consecutive years 
because of severe drought 
in marked contrast to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
perestroika or restructuring that involves economic 
liberalization castro has moved away from economic incentives and 
loosening state economic controls to focus on moral persuasion in a 
bid to increase productivity 
i dont see why one thing should be linked with the other 
manuel menendez diaz editor of the cuban communist party monthly 
magazine el militante told foreign correspondents monday when 
asked about the apparent differences between cuban and soviet 
policy the problems are our problems stemming from our own 
situation he said 
menendez diaz said that political work was neglected in favor of 
economic incentives in the decade preceding the rectification 
campaign the government implemented then abandoned such 
experiments as a restricted free market for agricultural goods 
the formation of the new man was lost a little menendez 
diaz said 
although a possible cuban agreement with south africa and angola 
that could lead to the withdrawal of nearly 50000 cuban troops 
from angola has drawn heavy international attention officials in 
cuba have been reluctant to discuss the issue and there is little 
mention of ongoing talks in the domestic news media 
cuban newspapers instead have focused almost entirely on the 
anniversary celebration including extensive historical 
recollections of the failed battle and the startlingly young faces 
of castro and his companions 35 years ago 
the attack castro led on the moncada military barracks in 
santiago cubas second city after havana failed but the 
brutality with which it was suppressed by the regime of fulgencio 
batista triggered popular support for castros later revolutionary 
insurrection 
celebration plans called for pioneer youth groups to recreate 
each step of the moncada attack 
castro has been in the santiago area since last week to 
inaugurate public works projects including the nations second oil 
refinery built with soviet help and a new hotel held up as an 
example of what can be done to expand the tourist industry and 
attract badly needed foreign exchange 
castro timed the attack on moncada now a museum and elementary 
school to coincide with the traditional carnival celebration to 
take government forces by surprise carnival still is celebrated 
these days simultaneously with the moncada anniversary

a representative of thencandidate ronald reagan 
asked the palestine liberation organization in 1980 to try to delay 
irans release of the american hostages until after the us 
presidential election a plo offical said 
the white house quickly denied the allegation made to playboy 
magazine by an aide to plo chairman yasser arafat 
also in the magazines september issue arafat said a close 
adviser to thenpresident jimmy carter sought the plos help in 
speeding the release in the wake of the 1973 war between israel 
and its arab neighbors the united states agreed not to have 
contacts with the plo because the organization refuses to recognize 
israels existence 
minutes after reagans inauguration on jan 20 1981 the 52 
americans held 444 days at the us embassy in tehran were freed 
in the interview arafat said he was instrumental in helping 
thousands of americans escape from beirut in 1976 and 1977 and in 
winning release of some of the us hostages in 1980 
we released the first hostages from the embassy the first 13 
embassy personnel arafat said they were released according to 
my personal efforts 
arafat said he undertook the mission at the request of carter 
there was a special and permanent contact between me and 
president carter arafat said i have written documents from 
president carter himself 
arafat said that although he had a letter of thanks from former 
secretary of state henry kissinger for his help in 1976 and 1977 
the us government never acknowledged his alleged role in the 1980 
hostage release 
arafats chief adviser bassam abu sharif said in the interview 
that a member of reagans 1980 campaign staff asked the plo to help 
stall the release 
reagans supporters in 1980 made much of carters failure to 
obtain the release of the hostages 
we were told that if the hostages were held the plo would be 
given recognition and the white house door would be open for 
us said sharif 
it is not true white house spokesman roman popadiuk 
countered monday in a telephone interview from washington popadiuk 
declined to elaborate 
sharif said he met in beirut with one of reagans closest 
friends during the 1980 presidential race he identified the 
supporter as a major financial contributor to the campaign but did 
not name the individual 
sharif said the reagan associate asked that i contact the 
chairman and make the request 
carter was not available for comment monday but a spokeswoman 
said he had been asked previously about reports that a reagan 
supporter had attempted to delay the hostages release 
we have reports similar but i never sought or received any 
confirmation of the allegations melissa montgomery quoted carter 
as saying 
neither arafat nor sharif was paid for the interviews which 
were conducted in april and may said magazine spokesman bill paige 
he said he did not know if arafat was present when sharif made 
the allegation that a reagan ally had sought the plos help in 
delaying the hostages release arafat made no comment on the 
allegation in the printed interview

iran claimed iraqi troops pushed further 
into iranian territory today as a united nations team arrived in 
tehran to discuss a truce between the persian gulf enemies 
iraq after a series of sweeping attacks during the weekend 
denied the claim and said it was moving its forces out of iran and 
would take its dispute to the bargaining table 
meanwhile the national liberation army of iran an iraqibacked 
forced opposed to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini claimed its forces 
had taken two iranian towns and had marched 95 miles into iran

maintain a ceasefire irans islamic republic news agency said 
the agency monitored in cyprus said the seven officials would 
remain in tehran for three days then fly to baghdad 
another team of un experts is already in tehran to determine 
the status of prisoners of war 
the peace moves were made possible after iran announced july 18 
that it accepted a un resolution calling for a ceasefire iraq 
accepted the resolution shortly after it was adopted in july 1987 
but since then iraq has sought to take as many iranian 
prisoners as possible saying it captured more than 8000 in three 
days in attacks that began friday apparently as a bargaining chip 
during peace talks 
a communique carried by the official iraqi news agency said 
iraqi troops would be withdrawn in line with our declared policy 
that we have no territorial ambitions in iran 
announcers on staterun iraqi television said troops would pull 
back today from qasre shirin sumar and sare pole zahab all on 
the central war front 
a military spokesman said on baghdad radio today that iraqi 
forces had pulled out of gilane gharb in the morning and would 
soon withdraw from the other towns 
but the iranian news agency said iraqi troops thrust further 
into iran early today and tried to take the town of karand 35 
miles from the border and the nearby town of eslamabad 
it said iranian fighters launched a counteroffensive and pushed 
the iraqis out of karand killing or wounding hundreds with the 
help of residents 
it said the iraqis still held eslamabad but iranian forces were 
battling to free the town in heavy fighting 
the deputy speaker of the iranian parliament mehdi karrubi 
announced the legislature was to be temporarily closed so that 
the deputies may go to the war fronts the islamic republic news 
agency reported 
in baghdad information minister latif jassem called the iranian 
claims lies and fabrications and reasserted that iraq planned 
to complete its pullout on the central front today 
a spokesman in baghdad for the national liberation army an 
alliance of antikhomeini exile groups claimed it took karand 
large numbers of iranian troops in the area defected to the 
opposition army bringing their weapons and equipment said the 
spokesman alireza jafarzadeh 
he said several divisions of the army were 95 miles inside 
iran and heading toward the provincial capital of bakhtaran 
the conflicting claims could not be independently confirmed 
perez de cuellar said monday in new york that he will meet 
separately with iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati and his 
iraqi counterpart tariq aziz he said iran is not yet prepared to 
have direct talks with its enemy but the un chief said he may 
suggest direct meetings later 
we have certainly contemplated direct talks he said he 
predicted a truce could be implemented within 10 days 
the resolution provides for a ceasefire withdrawal to 
recognized borders prisoner exchange peace negotiations and an 
investigation of which side started the war 
in a related development members of the un security council 
began private consultations monday on an iranian complaint that 
iraq used chemical weapons in the weekend offensive the use of 
chemical weapons violates the 1925 geneva convention 
in washington president reagan said monday the united states is 
prepared now to talk to iran about american hostages held in 
lebanon an administration official said the potential end of the

ten elementary school pupils from one of the 
citys poorest roughest neighborhoods were leaving for a 
threecountry tour of africa after studying french and raising 
30000 for the trip 
the pupils at suder elementary school on the west side have 
worked since october studying african culture after school and 
getting shots passports and visas in preparation for their 
departure this afternoon principal brenda daigre said monday 
the children aged 11 to 14 will make a oneday stopover in 
brussels belgium then its on to dakar senegal abidjan ivory 
coast and lome togo they are scheduled to return to chicago aug 
9 
in preparing for their trip the youngsters have heard african 
speakers and visited the us customs service branch at ohare 
international airport here mrs daigre said in a telephone 
interview 
we taught them how to set longrange goals and how to meet 
shortterm goals along the way she said i think we have made 
them much more sophisticated about meeting people how to carry 
themselves 
mrs daigre one of five adults going on the trip helped 
organize it 
she said setting up travel to any country would be instructive 
for the students but that for students from an allblack school it 
would be particularly beneficial to visit countries dominated and 
run by blacks 
i have traveled extensively and nothing hit me as hard as 
when i went to africa said the principal who also is black 
there is a kinship that you feel there is an openness that you 
feel 
i felt as though i went home i really did she said 
yoseanda baines 13 who will be an eighthgrader at suder this 
fall said shes anxious to meet people in africa and see how 
they dress and the food they eat she also wants to see what 
houses and clothes look like in africa 
yoseandas mother vernya baines said she thinks the trip will 
be a beautiful experience for her daughter who has never been 
on an airplane or traveled out of illinois 
were poor but i think itll give them a chance to see people 
that are poorer than we are mrs baines said maybe shell 
appreciate some of the things she maybe takes for granted 
more than 30000 was raised for the trip from churches 
community groups and fundraising events such as candy sales said 
mrs daigre who is paying her own way the cost for each child is 
2700 
school officials told the students that some african cities 
would look much like american cities and that the old stereotype 
of africa as a land of villages and huts may not apply mrs daigre 
said 
abidjan is referred to as the paris of africa she said 
when you go downtown you think you are in a small metropolitan 
city 
the lesson from that is travel and find out for yourself

two states louisiana and texas ended fiscal 
year 1988 in the red while arkansas and alaska expect deficits in 
1989 according to a national survey 
the study released monday by the national conference of state 
legislatures said the total budget balance of the 50 states on 
june 30 the end of fiscal year 1988 was 61 billion 
that equaled 26 percent of overall generalfund state spending 
in fiscal 1988 about half the minimum surplus economists 
recommend 
the margin of safety for many states is not much said steve 
gold fiscal affairs director for the lawmakers group but its 
amazing i think that more states didnt have problems 
louisiana showed an 189 percent deficit for 1988 and texas a 
34 percent deficit 
in last years survey louisiana and texas also were the only 
states with deficits 
the new survey also found arkansas projected a 102 percent 
deficit in 1989 and alaska a 35 percent deficit for that year 
in addition it found that 43 states estimated they had 
surpluses for fiscal 1988 
wyoming led with a 177 percent budget surplus this year 
followed by nebraska at 157 percent hawaii at 155 percent 
delaware at 153 percent nevada at 148 percent indiana at 131 
percent and rhode island at 101 percent 
those were the only states with doubledigit percentage 
surpluses this year according to the survey of 49 states complete 
information from massachusetts did not come in time to make the 
survey 
overall the preliminary survey indicated that a strong national 
economy helped 20 states become better off in 1988 than in 1987 
while 18 states held their own and 10 states declined 
in many states there has been an improvement over the past 
few years gold said at the meeting of 1500 of the nations 
state legislators who are in town through friday for their annual 
conference 
gold said many of the fiscal problems have been caused by 
budgeting uncertainty because of unpredictable federal policies 
states like california new york florida and washington are 
traveling in unchartered waters because of several us law and 
policy changes he said 
those include tax reform federal mandates for new state 
programs that lack the necessary funding and reduction of federal 
funding in areas such as housing welfare education and 
transportation 
people were really working in the dark gold said states 
are gradually taking on more and more roles where the federal 
government has cut back the states have taken up the slack 
ted strickland president of the national legislatures group 
agreed 
uncertainties in budgeting are growing and states must 
continue to be cautious in their budget and revenue decisions he 
said

an israeli delegation including two sovietborn 
jews headed today for moscow on the first such official trip in 21 
years 
the five israelis will kick off their visit by attending sabbath 
prayers in a moscow synagogue where they hope to have a chance to 
meet informally with soviet jews said sovietborn diplomat meron 
gordon who heads the group 
in addition to gordon 41 who came to israel at the age of 10 
the delegation includes yaakov kedmi a former soviet dissident 
named yasha kazakov who came to israel in the 1960s 
we are both very moved gordon said on israel television 
when we left there we were young i dont think either of us 
ever thought we could return to the soviet union certainly not as 
official representatives of israel 
the delegates left for the hague where they are to pick up 
twomonth visas and then travel to moscow on thursday 
the soviet union severed ties with israel in 1967 after the six 
day war to protest israels occupation of the territory captured 
from three arab countries 
the two countries still have no official diplomatic relations 
but links between moscow and jerusalem have recently improved 
in the summer of 1986 israeli and soviet delegates met in 
helsinki finland for the first official session since 1967 last 
summer a soviet delegation arrived in tel aviv on twomonth visas 
that since have been extended

friday evening for sabbath prayers 
the delegates most of whom speak russian will work out of an 
office in the dutch embassy which represents israeli interests in 
the soviet union one of their first jobs will be to inspect the

postcard from greece the day before the twa airliner he is accused 
of hijacking departed from athens according to evidence introduced 
today 
the postcard introduced by prosecutors during hamadis trial on 
air piracy and murder charges was dated june 13 1985 and had 
been sent to the brother of hamadis west german girlfriend 
twa flight 847 was hijacked on june 14 1985 and diverted to 
beirut lebanon after it had departed athens a us navy diver 
was fatally shot and 39 americans were held hostage for 17 days 
the postcard was read by chief judge heiner mueckenberger at the 
start of the fourth week of hamadis trial in a courtroom on a 
frankfurt prison compound on charges of hijacking murder and 
possession of explosives 
the postcard written in german is addressed to paul mueller 
brother of hamadis former west german girlfriend birgit mueller 
hamadi lived in west germany for two years until november 1984 
the postcard carries a stamp june 13 1985 and reads i send 
you this card after seven months because you are my friend and 
brother take care of my daughter lydia your brother mohammed 
in the text hamadi purportedly wrote today is my birthday 
and i am now in greece 
mueckenberger said the postcard was sent from greece 
hamadi is being tried by a frankfurt juvenile court which is 
attempting to determine his age at the time the twa hijacking 
began depending on the courts decision on the age issue hamadi 
could receive a maximum prison sentence of 15 years as a young 
adult or life imprisonment as an adult if found guilty as charged 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem allegedly sent another 
postcard dated june 11 1985 to his girlfriend in the southern

family he was born on june 13 1964 which would have made him 21 
when the hijacking took place

has said the year of his birth on official records was altered by 
his father making him one or two years older to gain more 
social support payments for his family in warntorn lebanon

both sides refused to speculate on how 
negotiations were going today in the 20weekold writers strike 
after a federal mediator stopped the clock on his own deadline 
keeping representatives at the bargaining table 
the talks continue and the mediator is still present 
writers guild of america spokeswoman cheryl rhoden said early 
today the mediator stopped the clock talks were supposed to 
end at midnight 
there was no comment on whether the two sides were nearing 
agreement as a news blackout was imposed by leonard farrell the 
federal mediator who ordered both sides to resume negotiations last 
week 
theres just no way to predict the outcome ms rhoden said 
at the opening of contract talks monday afternoon 
representatives of both the guild and the alliance of motion 
picture and television producers were told they had nine hours to 
end their dispute 
at 12 midnight were going to be through said floyd wood 
district director for the federal mediation and conciliation 
service who imposed the deadline im going to conclude the 
negotiations at midnight 
wood also said at time that the writers and producers were 
making progress in the talks both sides are working hard he 
said 
guild sources familiar with the negotiations speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the producers had made few concessions 
in bargaining sessions saturday and sunday which lasted 13 hours 
each 
however there were reports on the guilds computer bulletin 
board monday that farrell had threatened the producers with fines 
for refusing to bargain at the commencement of talks saturday the 
threat was confirmed by an independent guild source familiar with 
the negotiations who spoke anonymously 
adding pressure on the producers to settle was the teamsters 
union which said its hollywood members may strike next week a 
teamsters strike could halt almost all film production in hollywood 
studios 
i certainly hope we dont strike said earl bush secretary 
treasurer of teamsters local 399 but theres always that 
possibility when a contract expires 
the teamsters contract with the producers expires sunday at 
midnight 
at issue in the writers strike which began march 7 are 
payments for onehour television programs rebroadcast domestically 
and all television shows rebroadcast overseas 
the strike has delayed the fall television season and has led to 
sweeping layoffs throughout the entertainment industry

ferdinand marcos offered to give 5 billion 
to the philippines and back president corazon aquino if he is 
allowed to return without being prosecuted the los angeles times 
reported today 
a marcos spokesman in hawaii called the report of the offer 
absurd 
the offer is part of a package being pursued by marcos aides 
that includes a pledge to promote national reconciliation in the 
philippines if he isnt charged with wrongdoing in the united 
states the newspaper said 
if there is no indictment he will support the government of 
the philippines said col arturo aruiza at marcos honolulu home 
in exile there will be a national reconciliation 
representatives of marcos are talking with philippine officials 
including mrs aquinos brother jose cojuangco and philippine 
ambassador to the united states emmanuel peleaz trying to work out 
the 5 billion deal according to a james gregor a university of 
california berkeley political science professor 
gregor who has been in direct contact with the marcos camp in 
hawaii and with us officials in washington dc said marcos 
has agreed to stay out of filipino politics stay out of the 
capital manila and support mrs aquino if he is allowed to return 
but the ousted ruler accused of siphoning billions of dollars 
from the national treasury during his tenure as president has 
asked that his son ferdinand marcos jr be allowed to run for 
political office perhaps for governor of the familys home 
province of ilocos norte gregor said 
asked about the 5 billion offer pelaez said you have long 
ears im not sure whether i can talk about it or not id 
rather you didnt ask me 
marcos spokesman in honolulu gemmo trinidad however quoted 
marcos as saying the report about a 5 billion offer is totally 
absurd 
the president marcos told me negotiations are going on but 
they do not involve any money trinidad told the associated 
press he said he was not privy to information on who was 
particating in the negotiations 
estimates of the amount of money allegedly diverted from the 
philippine treasury by marcos and his associates range from 1 
billion to 10 billion 
the 5 billion offer was so high it reportedly caught philippine 
officials by surprise and raised suspicions as to how much money he 
may have put away 
thats why the negotiations havent been easy gregor said 
everyone in the philippines is saying if hes got 5 billion 
maybe hes got 40 billion 
in the two years since the revolution that led to marcos flight 
to hawaii mrs aquino has repeatedly said he couldnt return to 
the philippines 
but recently she has softened that position saying marcos could 
return if he agreed to stand trial 
federal officials in new york city have recommended that marcos 
be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges stemming from his 
alleged use of philippine government funds to buy art and real 
estate in the united states while concealing their ownership 
in manila quintin doromal an official of the presidential 
commission on good government said he was unaware of the offer 
the commission is responsible for tracking down and recovering 
money marcos allegedly stole during his 20 years in office 
i dont think the commission knows anything about it 
doromal said if there is such a thing we would know something 
about it but its zero no information along that line

besides auctioning the valuables ministry officials expect to 
auction cars trucks a train heavy equipment some motor homes

cambodian resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk today rejected the vietnameseinstalled 
governments latest peace plan but said he was willing to meet 
with prime minister hun sen 
the warring cambodian factions today met for a second day of 
informal talks at the dutch colonial summer palace of indonesias 
late president sukarno at bogor about 35 miles outside jakarta 
sihanouk resigned july 10 as president of the guerrilla 
coalition fighting the government and vietnamese troops in 
cambodia he is widely considered central to any settlement in the 
9 year civil war but vowed he would not attend the peace talks 
that began monday 
the talks bring together prime minister hun sen of cambodia and 
the leaders of the three resistance groups khieu samphan of the 
communist khmer rouge son sann of the khmer peoples national 
liberation front and prince norodom ranariddh who represents his 
father sihanouk 
in a meeting today with japans ambassador in jakarta sihanouk 
rejected a sevenpoint plan proposed by hun sen as an old proposal 
aimed at preserving the current phnom penh government japanese 
reporters said 
sihanouk told ambassador sumio edamura that he was willing to 
attend talks in jakartas presidential palace wednesday with hun 
sen and sihanouks guerrilla coalition partners khieu samphan of 
the khmer rouge and son sann of the khmer peoples national 
liberation front 
sihanouk said he would make a very important speech then 
according to the japanese journalists sihanouk who ruled cambodia 
from 1941 to 1970 also said he would meet with president suharto 
of indonesia at a dinner wednesday 
indonesias foreign minister ali alatas who organized the 
talks today and monday said the atmosphere at mondays session was 
good and that the talks would last as long as it takes he said 
the cambodian factions agreed on the need for a new coalition 
government and a neutral nonaligned cambodia 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and has more than 100000 
troops there supporting the hun sen government vietnam met the 
guerrillas for the first time ever during the talks monday 
officials said the cambodians previously have agreed that an 
early political settlement is necessary that a new coalition 
government must be formed and cambodia must become a neutral and 
nonaligned nation 
but hun sen told reporters he and the guerrilla leaders resolved 
no concrete problems monday he presented at the talks a 
sevenpoint peace plan containing proposals already rejected by the 
guerrillas 
the plan said that before elections for a new government the 
status quo must be maintained defying guerrilla demands that hun 
sens government be dismantled before elections 
in one new move hun sen said that in order to bridge this 
dispute he was proposing formation of a national reconciliation 
council headed by sihanouk to implement any peace agreements and 
organize elections 
the plan also repeated demands for elimination of the khmer 
rouge leadership and dissolution of its army the largest of the 
guerrilla forces only this hun sen said would ensure the khmer 
rouge cannot return to power 
from 1975 until vietnam invaded the fanatical khmer rouge 
regime killed hundreds of thousands of people in cambodia and 
launched bloody attacks on vietnams western border 
diplomats in thailand say the khmer rouge is storing arms for 
allout attacks when vietnam withdraws all its troops by 1990 as 
it has pledged 
however china which arms the guerrillas recently indicated it 
was prepared to lessen its onceunequivocal support for the khmer 
rouge and said it supported a government in which the group would 
not have a dominant role

orders for big ticket durable goods 
propelled by a big jump in aircraft orders increased 88 percent 
in june the largest advance in 42 months the government reported 
today 
the commerce department said orders totaled 12523 billion last 
month an increase of 1014 billion over the may figure 
virtually all of the gain reflected a big jump in orders for 
aircraft the transportation category shot up 355 percent to 
3824 billion last month 
without this gain total orders would have risen only 01 
percent the government said 
the big increase in total orders had been expected because of 
announcements by the seattlebased boeing co of a string of giant 
orders for commercial aircraft in recent weeks 
those orders have totaled 8 billion but the report said that 
demand for commerical aircraft rose by about 3 billion indicating 
that the rest of the boeing orders will show up in coming months 
the overall increase of 88 percent was the largest singlemonth 
gain since an 89 percent increase in december 1985 also a month 
when the orders report was propelled by a big jump in the 
transportation category 
while there have been concerns that high factory operating rates 
would contribute to inflationary pressures economists said they 
were not too alarmed by the big jump in manufacturing orders in 
june since it was contained in one industry 
the 01 percent rise in demand excluding the transportation 
category was slightly below expectations 
the overall increase of 88 percent followed a 19 percent drop 
in may which had been the biggest setback since last august 
manufacturing has been one of the top performers of the economy 
this year as us companies have benefited from rising export 
demand 
the 355 percent jump in transportation orders was the biggest 
increase since a 453 percent rise in december 1985 in addition to 
the strong gain in aircraft the shipbuilding and tanks categories 
also reflected big increases as the military stepped up its orders 
the total defense category showed a gain of 886 percent last 
month the biggest advance since a 1232 percent rise in december 
1982 
the category of nondefense capital goods posted a 98 percent 
increase to 3457 billion with the 31 billion increase 
reflecting the rise in commercial aircraft orders 
orders for electrical machinery were up for the third 
consecutive month with the june increase a 06 percent advance to 
203 billion orders for nonelectrical machinery rose 13 percent 
to 208 billion 
orders for primary metals fell 35 percent to 4115 billion 
this was the first decline since january 
shipments of durable goods rose 15 percent to 1163 billion in 
june following a 18 percent increase in may

aerospace plc and foreign partners former trade and industry 
minister kenneth clarke said monday clarke who did not name the 
foreign partners was appointed health secretary after making the 
announcement

its all in the nose a doctor told a man 
afflicted by attacks of sneezing after lovemaking 
a nose spray recommended by a california doctor in a 
questionandanswer section of the journal of the american medical 
association has given a 60yearold man relief and should clear up 
his problems his family doctor said 
he would have four to five sneezes starting at about one 
minute after as soon as they finished lovemaking his wife would 
run and get a box of kleenex said dr william h hunter of his 
60yearold patient who had what appeared to be an allergy for 
about two years 
in describing the mans symptoms in jama hunter wrote this 
is the most unusual problem i have ever been presented with by a 
patient 
the sneezing is probably due to a condition called vasomotor 
rhinitis a fairly common syndrome in which the nasal passages 
are chronically swollen responded dr jeffrey a wald of san diego 
in last weeks issue of the journal 
the swelling of the tissue inside the nose leads to an increase 
in secretions which probably trigger the sneezing wald said 
somehow the ama always finds an answer no matter how obscure 
the problem said hunter a past president of the south carolina

irancontra prosecutor lawrence walsh says 
oliver north is trying to turn his trial from a criminal to a 
political one and should not be allowed to use politics to win a 
sixmonth delay 
walsh urged us district judge gerhard gesell on monday to 
reject norths motion for a delay until after the presidential 
election 
having failed in several attempts to avoid completely the 
trial of this case while proclaiming his innocence in speeches 
the defendant oliver l north is now grasping at the criminal 
defendants maneuver of last resort delay walsh said 
this trial in particular should not be held hostage to a media 
which the defendant himself has strenuously sought to inflame 
walsh said in a brief filed with us district judge gerhard gesell 
walsh also rebutted norths contention that his actions had been 
approved 
the government knows of no presidential decision that north 
can point to as authorizing his activities walsh said adding 
the government also is not aware of any superior except 
norths coconspirators robert c mcfarlane and john m 
poindexter who knew enough about norths activities to have 
conveyed even informal or implicit approval 
had walsh found reagan responsible for authorizing norths 
activities the prosecutor would have been unable to charge north 
in march with defrauding the united states because north would have 
been acting with the necessary presidential approval 
the prosecutor included 15 newspaper clippings reporting norths 
recent speeches about his case and in support of republican 
congressional candidates he quoted norths own statement after his 
indictment last march i have now been caught in a bitter dispute 
between the congress and the president over the control of foreign 
policy it is a shame that the new battleground for such a 
fight will be a courtroom 
delaying the trial would give court approval to norths 
transparent attempt to transform this trial from a criminal into a 
political one walsh argued 
a retired marine corps lieutenant colonel and former white house 
aide north is the first of four defendants scheduled to be tried 
on charges including a conspiracy to defraud the united states by 
illegally diverting profits from usiran arms sales to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
last wednesday one of norths attorneys barry simon told the 
court that no fairminded person could argue that this trial 
should be started seven weeks prior to the presidential election 
the intense publicity generated during the final seven weeks of a 
presidential campaign would deny north a fair trial 
but walsh said to the extent that norths trial may become a 
political issue in the upcoming elections north bears at least a 
substantial measure of responsibility and therefore has little 
credibility in complaining walsh said north has made many 
pretrial speeches and statements in which he had claimed that the 
charges should be evaluated in a political context 
walsh said norths trial could begin sept 20 as planned with an 
impartial jury despite the presidential campaign and urged gesell 
to reject norths motion for a sixmonth delay which walsh said 
was filed simply as a stalling tactic 
walsh said courts in the district of columbia are well trained 
by their experience with watergate and other political scandals to 
conduct trials in cases which receive a lot of publicity he said 
the trial would draw media attention no matter when it occurred and 
that much of this publicity has been favorable to the defendants 
of the 16 counts against north walsh said those involving false 
statements and obstruction of justice personal enrichment and tax 
fraud could easily be tried sept 20 
to meet that date for the conspiracy theft of government 
property and wire fraud charges walsh said gesell would have to 
modify a july 6 order granting north access to additional 
classified documents 
walsh enclosed a letter from cia general counsel russell j 
bruemmer to support such a modification bruemmer said some of the 
documents already had been provided others including excepts from 
the presidents daily brief on intelligence matters and summaries 
by the central american joint intelligence task force could be 
ready in four weeks but others are not readily available and would 
require several months to gather 
walsh noted that gesell ordered the documents on the basis of a 
meeting with defense lawyers from which prosecutors were excluded 
walsh said no defense argument he could envision would make the 
documents relevant to the case he indicated that most of them 
refer to other government covert actions abroad and said no other 
covert action had ever involved the transfer of funds from one 
operation to another 
walsh asked gesell to require north to come up with more 
specific reasons for seeing items before they are ordered turned 
over to him 
gesell did not rule on the motion immediately

gunmen in a speeding car shot and 
killed a us air force sergeant while he was jogging with his dogs 
in a neighborhood near clark air base police said today 
in a separate incident us navy authorities said the filipino 
wife of an american serviceman was robbed and slain sunday night 
near the base located 50 miles north of the capital manila 
police said both incidents appeared to be criminal and not 
related to the 19year communist insurgency communist rebels 
operate in the angeles area and have threatened to attack american 
military personnel 
news of the killings came as talks between the philippines and 
the united states over us bases here broke down over 
compensation the rift was expected to fuel filipino sentiment 
against the bases 
mary carlin yates a member of us panel in the talks 
described the suspension as a temporary break in the talks but 
the chief filipino negotiator said the two sides were so far apart 
he doubted talks could resume 
police said tech sgt richard blackmer 31 of the cleveland 
suburb of brook park was jogging near his home in the mountain 
view subdivision about 930 pm monday when gunmen opened fire 
with m16 rifles his home is about one mile from the bases main 
gate 
the assailants also killed his two german shepherd dogs police 
added 
police officers who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
preliminary investigation indicated the killing may have been the 
result of a marital dispute 
they said blackmer was estranged from his filipino wife and was 
living with another woman police picked up the wife maria for 
questioning late monday but said no charges had been filed 
blackmer was the first american service member slain in the 
philippines since october when communist rebels killed two air 
force enlisted men a retired air force sergeant and a filipino 
civilian of us ancestry 
but a filipino investigator who also requested anonymity said 
the style of the killing and weapons used did not fit the pattern 
of guerrilla atacks 
rebel assassination teams normally use 45caliber pistols and 
fire at close range he said 
in the other incident us officials said esther billa heacox 
41 wife of navy petty officer james a heacox was found fatally 
stabbed late sunday about three miles north of clark air base 
master sgt james katzman of the clark public affairs office 
said mrs heacoxs body was found in the car after witnesses saw 
the vehicle run off the road and two filipino males flee 
her husband assigned to a navy communications station in nearby 
arlac province said the victim left their home to drive clark and 
was carrying about 150 which was missing 
a base spokeswoman air force capt maryellen jadick said us 
authorities had not imposed any new retrictions on the nearly 
26000 american troops defense department civilians and dependents 
living in this city of some 200000 
nearly 40 people have been killed in angeles and other 
communities around clark air base this year police say many of the 
slayings are politically motivated 
communist rebels have been fighting to overthrow the philippine 
government since 1969 
in december last year an assistant us defense secretary for 
east asia karl d jackson said the pentagon was taking steps to 
protect the 8000 us servicemen stationed at clark and 6000 
uniformed personnel at the subic bay naval base they are the two 
largest american military installations outside the united states 
jackson said measures included tighter security on the bases 
reductions in offbase leaves antiterrorist training for 
servicemen reduction in travel to the bases and increased police 
patrol in the city outside clark 
philippine officials have agreed to improve security but no 
details have been announced 
about 40000 us servicemen civilian personnel and dependents 
live near clark subic bay and four smaller us military 
installations

the director of the national zoo where four 
panda cubs have been stillborn or died shortly after birth said 
today an unprecedented technological effort is planned to save the 
expected offspring of female giant panda lingling 
were in fact taking a step thats altogether unprecedented 
but really on the best medical advice said dr michael robinson 
the zoos director in an interview on abcs good morning 
america 
lingling who lives with her mate hsinghsing in the zoos 
panda house gave birth to three stillborn cubs before giving birth 
to a live cub last year zoo employees hopes were raised when that 
baby was born apparently healthy and screaming lustily but the cub 
died four days later 
what happened last year is that the baby had no immune 
system said robinson when we did the autopsy we found 
there were no immunoglobulins in the babys blood and that means 
that it had no protection against any kind of bacteria that it 
could encounter in the world around it 
robinson said zoo officials who in the past have not intervened 
with panda births for fear of alienating the mother from her baby 
will be aggressive from the start this year they believe the 
female panda will give birth this weekend or early next week 
were going to remove the baby from the mother and inject it 
with immunoglobulins weve extracted from his hsinghsings 
blood and hope that that will confer a greater immunity than the 
last one had robinson said 
were going to be extraordinarily careful about that of 
course he added the baby will be removed by our veterinarians 
wearing surgical gloves and gowns and masks in the usual way so it 
shouldnt acquire any human odor and we will treat it before we 
return it to lingling with materials from the mother so that it 
acquires her odor 
zoo offiicals believe lingling is pregnant because she mated 
with hsinghsing three times in april during her brief annual 
period of fertility according to robinson he said her hormone 
levels are similar to those she displayed at this stage in her 
pregnancy last year 
zoo officials believe the 19yearold lingling is nearing the 
end of her childbearing years 
nobody knows how many years pandas are fertile robinson said 
the estimates are between 19 and 23 or 24 years but there are no 
good longevity records on pandas from anywhere in the world so 
thats just guesstimating 
only about 1000 of the endangered giant pandas are alive in the 
world today including just 14 outside of china

the philippines broke off talks today 
with the united states on us military bases and foreign secretary 
raul manglapus said differences over compensation were so wide he 
doubted the talks could be revived 
manglapus made the remark to reporters after a meeting with 
president corazon aquino during which he informed her the nearly 
4monthold talks were suspended indefinitely 
i dont know whether the talks can resume but right now 
our positions are so far apart that i dont think we can resume 
he said 
manglapus head of the philippine panel in the negotiations 
said mrs aquino realizes that our position is a reasonable one 
and that we should stick to it he declined to elaborate saying 
revealing more details could create more difficulties 
the manila government is pressing for an increase in the 180 
million it receives annually from washington for use of the bases 
before the talks began manglapus said 12 billion annually would 
be more realistic 
the talks are held every five years to review terms of the 1947 
agreement allowing the united states to maintain clark air base 
subic bay naval base and four smaller installations 
us spokeswoman mary carlin yates told the associated press in 
a telephone interview the break was temporary and the us side 
headed by ambassador nicholas platt expects the talks to resume 
shortly 
she denied the us panel approved a statement that filipino 
spokesman leonides caday described as a joint statement and read to 
reporters it said there was a substantial disagreement on the 
compensation issue as a result of which the philippine panel 
moved for the suspension of the talks 
as has happened several times in the past there has been a 
temporary break in the talks mrs yates said we do not 
consider the talks suspended such temporary breaks occur from time 
to time particularly when one side needs time to consider a 
proposal from the other 
during previous interruptions however neither side had 
described the talks as suspended in previous instances 
spokesmen for both sides said talks had been temporarily recessed 
because of foreign travel by negotiators or to allow time to study 
proposals 
on monday manglapus said that the two panels were nearing 
agreement but that they may not complete the negotiations by an 
endofthemonth deadline the talks had initially been scheduled 
to end during the first week of july 
us secretary of state george shultz has said the united states 
did not oppose an increase in compensation but would not agree to 
paying any staggering amount 
the talks do not directly affect the status of the bases after 
1991 but a successful review is widely expected to influence 
manilas decision on whether to extend the agreement mrs aquino 
has refused to reveal her position 
meanwhile the communistled national democratic front accused 
mrs aquino maneuvering for an impending sellout of our national 
sovereignty and interests 
the front an umbrella organization of 12 marxist rebel groups 
said in a statement delivered to news agencies by courier that the 
aquino administration has actually agreed to retain the bases 
beyond 1991 in exchange for us assurance of its survival

the united states may abandon an 
international cultural exchange agreement if it loses a court 
battle with documentary filmmakers over allegations of censorship 
a federal official suggested in a court filing 
the threat by charles z wick director of the united states 
information agency is the latest development in a battle over 
allegations the agency has hampered international distribution of 
documentaries with liberal themes 
movies that are certified by the usia as being of an 
educational scientific or cultural nature are exempt from import 
duties in some 60 countries under a 40yearold international 
treaty known as the beirut agreement 
the suit filed in december 1985 on behalf of makers of movies 
on subjects ranging from nicaragua to nuclear power accuses the 
usia of in effect censoring the work of liberal moviemakers by 
making it more expensive to export their work 
two courts have sided with the moviemakers ordering the usia to 
rewrite its rules for determining whether a movie is of an 
educational scientific or cultural nature 
if the government fails to get the rulings reversed wick said 
in a statement to be filed in us district court in los angeles 
it is my intent to recommend that the united states terminate its 
participation in the beirut agreement 
an attorney for the seven moviemakers in the case david cole of 
the center for constitutional rights in new york called wicks 
response unreasonable 
its like the kid with the football who says if i cant win 
the game im taking the ball home cole said in a telephone 
interview monday 
justice department officials handling the case did not respond 
to a telephone request for comment 
us district judge a wallace tashima sided with the 
moviemakers in 1986 ruling that the usia policies violated the 
moviemakers constitutional rights to free speech he ordered the 
agency to redraft its rules 
last may tashima rejected new rules which included a provision 
allowing the government to brand a movie propaganda 
the usia has appealed that ruling and has asked the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals in san francisco which upheld a challenge 
to tashimas original ruling to reconsider 
wick wrote that the redrafted rules were a goodfaith attempt to 
implement the court order and that broadening the rules further 
would amount to abandoning the treaty 
in keeping with its interpretation of the treaty the agency 
demanded that movies that advocate a point of view acknowledge that 
another point of view exists wick said 
cole said his organization a public interest lawyers group and 
the american civil liberties union have drafted a proposed set of 
rules for movie certification but usia officials had refused to 
consider it

the last newspaper union to oppose a proposed 
partial merger of detroits two major newspapers has dropped its 
objections and backers say the plan now meets all requirements for 
federal approval 
the newspaper guild of detroit on monday said it would not 
oppose a joint operating agreement between the detroit free press 
and the detroit news after receiving concessions from the free 
press according to don kummer administrator of newspaper guild 
local 22 
the us justice departments antitrust division and an 
adminstrative law judge along with suburban detroit newspapers 
remain opposed to the plan five other newspaper unions have 
endorsed the proposal 
knight ridder inc owner of the free press and gannett co 
inc owner of the news filed a statement with the justice 
department saying the merger application meets the standards for 
approval set by the newspaper preservation act 
the newspapers asked the justice department in 1986 for an 
exemption in antitrust law allowing them to merge business 
advertising and circulation departments editorial departments 
would remain separate 
a spokesman for attorney general edwin meese iii who must rule 
on such exemptions has said he will decide on it before he leaves 
office which a spokesman has said will be by aug 15 
meese said monday in washington that the guilds new position 
would not affect his ruling he declined further comment 
knightridder has said if meese rejects the request it would 
close the free press resulting in the loss of 2200 jobs both 
newspapers claim they have lost millions of dollars in recent years 
the guilds agreement with the free press reduces the number of 
guild members to be laid off at the free press under a joint 
operating agreement from 100 to no more than 75 the agreement also 
guarantees the jobs of 45 maintenance workers at the news 
the guild represents about 650 editorial and business employees 
at the free press and about 300 editorial workers at the news 
the guild filed a statement with the justice department which 
urges that the merger be approved the statement said the 
union has become convinced that the closing of the free press is 
inevitable if the joa is not approved 
knight ridder issued a statement monday welcoming the guilds 
decision news president and publisher louis a weil iii declined 
to comment 
the free press had 1987 circulation of 639720 daily and 724342 
on sundays while circulation of the news was 678720 daily and 
839319 on sundays according to the audit bureau of circulation

shoot to stop anyone caught fighting in the citys park 
there has been too much fighting in the park young men from 
louisville young men from bartow young men from wadley and the 
only way to break it up is for police to shoot them johnson said 
monday 
the mayor said fighting in the 12acre hope williams memorial 
park has been a frequent problem but sundays brawl involving 
eight youths who used big sticks with nails driven in them as 
weapons prompted him to take action against such skirmishes 
he said no one was seriously injured in the fight but it 
presented a threat to the families and children who wanted to use 
the park as well as a threat to the towns reputation 
johnson has ordered an increased police patrol in the park 
during weekends there will be a fulltime policeman every 
friday saturday and sunday johnson said they are to shoot 
from the waist down only 
were going to fix it so decent people can go to the park all 
the hoodlums in bartow stay in bartow he said all the 
hoodlums in louisville stay in louisville and all the hoodlums in 
wadley have been suspended from the park for the rest of the year 
johnson said he also has increased the fine for fighting in the 
park from 7150 to 125 
reports from the police department said seven of the eight 
involved in sundays fight were juveniles and were turned over to 
juvenile authorities the adult was charged with fighting and 
released on a 125 bond 
wadley louisville and bartow are in a rural area of eastern 
georgia about 130 miles southeast of atlanta 
johnsons shoot to stop order is the latest in a series of 
such orders he has issued in the past three years 
in 1986 johnson issued a shoot to wound order instructing 
police officers to shoot suspected burglars from the waist down 
after a rash of burglaries in the east georgia town of 2700 
in 1985 johnson ordered police to shoot stray dogs on sight to 
control the animals which city officials said roamed the streets 
in packs destroyed property snapped at children and howled at the 
moon he even offered a bounty of 3 for every dog shot 
no shooting ever took place and both orders were eventually 
rescinded 
also in 1985 johnson ordered police to arrest anyone using 
profane language in public the order was aimed at young people 
playing basketball in the city park whose games were frequently 
accompanied by loud streams of what thencity administrator lee 
garner described as pure unadulterated profanity

local 250 of the hospital and institutional workers which has

burmas ruling party today chose its no 4 
ranked leader sein lwin as party chairman to replace ne win 
who wielded authoritarian power over this southeast asian nation 
for a quarter century 
a brief news release said the central committee of the burma 
socialist program party elected the 64yearold retired army 
general during a special session 
sein lwin a hardliner widely criticized for his ruthless 
handling of student demonstrations has served as the partys joint 
general secretary since 1985 he also holds the government post of 
council of state secretary 
his elevation to the countrys top post appeared to dash hopes 
among the public here that ne wins retirement would lead to 
widespread reform of burmas oneparty militarybacked system 
shortly after the announcement state radio reported that prime 
minister maung maung kha and attorney general myint maung had been 
dismissed from their posts after being found reponsible for bloody 
student riots here last march 
it was sein lwin who was widely criticized in burma for the 
brutal suppression of those riots in which 100 people are said to 
have been killed 
the radio annoucement gave no further details 
ne win asked to step down saturday after 26 years in power on 
monday a special party congress accepted his resignation and that 
of the second most powerful figure in the country party vice 
chairman san yu also the countrys president 
the 77yearold ne win who came to power in a 1962 military 
coup cited violent antigovernment rioting in march and june for 
which he acknowledged some reponsibility and his age as reasons 
for stepping down 
todays news release said the vice chairmanship of the party was 
left vacant and aye ko who some had expected to succeed ne win 
retained the no 3 job of general secretary it was not clear why 
aye ko was passed over for the top job 
a threeday special party congress ended monday with little but 
vaguelyworded statements issued to the public possibly reflecting 
splits within the party over recent events 
after the congress ended the 1061 delegates were suddenly 
summoned back some from areas outside rangoon but the session 
did not reconvene 
official radio rangoon announced monday that delegates had 
firmly suggested rejecting a referendum called by ne win which 
could have ended 26 years of oneparty rule 
it marked the first known instance in which the party did not 
rubberstamp ne wins proposals 
state radio announced late sunday that an emergency parliament 
session would convene wednesday apparently to act on the 
referendum proposal although the parliament is empowered to order 
a referendum by majority vote it is not expected to oppose the 
party decision 
the emergency session could also deal with the appointment of a 
new president to replace san yu by tradition a party leader who 
quits his party post also resigns his government job 
the political changes in burma follow months of street riots and 
deepening public discontent over the countrys deteriorating 
economic situation 
public anger peaked last october when the government withdrew 
several currency notes from circulation and failed to provide any 
compensation sparking the first major riots in burma since 1974 
sein lwin commanded the military forces that brutally put down a 
student protest in rangoon last march in which more than 100 people 
are said to have died recently the government admitted that 41 
protesters suffocated in a van after their arrests 
he also commanded an army company which killed 22 students 
during antigovernment demonstrations at rangoon university in july 
1962 
efforts to liberalize the economy last year failed to stop 
burmas downward spiral inflation is soaring government stores 
are virtually empty and the country is saddled with a foreign debt 
of about 4 billion 
sein lwin was among several party members who offered their 
resignations alonmg with ne win last week but the party congress 
rejected them saying the leaders were still young enough to rule 
succeeding sein lwin as joint general secretary was kyaw htin a 
member of the central executive committee as well as deputy prime 
minister and defense minster

a woman who hijacked an airliner with 146 
people aboard to cuba 19 years ago has been arrested in albany 
where she has lived for five years under assumed names authorities 
said 
linda joyce grinage 39 was arrested monday said fbi agents 
who added they have 14 aliases listed for her she was living under 
the name of haziine eytina with her husband and five children 
a hearing to certify grinages identity was postponed until 
wednesday grinages husband milo eytina told acting us 
magistrate joseph scully that a new york city lawyer had agreed to 
represent his wife but could not get to albany today 
eytina also a lawyer said the identification of his wife as 
the hijacker was absolute poppycock 
grinage and her thenhusband tyrone ellington austin took a 
2yearold boy hostage on an eastern airlines flight from new 
yorks kennedy international airport to miami on jan 2 1969 then 
forced the pilot at gunpoint to fly to havana authorities said 
while running up the aisle austin shouted black power and 
havana according to authorities none of the 138 passengers or 
eight crew members was hurt 
grinage and austin were indicted on air piracy charges later 
that year although they remained in havana for a time after the 
passengers and crew returned according to the fbi austin died in 
1971 from wounds he received during a shootout with new york city 
police while fleeing a bank robbery 
authorities did not say how or when grinage and austin 
reentered the united states 
grinage had been living in the albany area since 1983 but police 
were not tipped about her whereabouts until receiving an anonymous 
phone call in july 1987 said barbara cottrell an assistant us 
attorney police did not make an arrest until monday because they 
needed time to confirm her identity she said 
authorities did that through writing samples and telephone 
records of a phone call made to the rev walter staten of new york 
city grinages grandfather according to an affidavit made for a 
search warrant 
grinage who wore a red bandanna jeans and a tshirt in court 
walked by reporters without commenting 
eytina said he believed the arrest was a mistake 
the charges are completely inconsistent with the person i 
know eytina said its absolute poppycock it makes excellent 
fiction 
in court eytina said his wife has roots in the community is 
gainfully employed in the community and has resided in the 
community for 10 years 
she is unable to respond in her present state eytina told 
scully describing his wife as distraught 
if convicted she could be imprisoned for 20 years to life 
cottrell said grinage had at least six addresses in albany since 
1983 the prosecutor said she wasnt aware that the woman had a job 
cottrell said she would ask that grinage be held without bail 
and would not comment on whether authorities would pursue charges 
against eytina

firefighters today called in helicopters and said they would use 
natural barriers to try to maneuver a forest fire that burned 
within 10 miles of old faithful geyser in parched yellowstone 
national park 
helicopters slinging torches that spit a napalmlike substance 
were called in and ground crews used meadows and streams as a wall 
against the fire said incident commander larry caplinger a final 
decision on sending out the helicopters was expected later today 
what we can do we can go out to one side or the other of the 
head of a fire and ignite fire and get it to building and have it 
draw the head of the fire in one direction or another he said 
this morning 
we would just be trying to further influence the fire its 
going in the direction that we want it to go but the more we can 
get it going in a more northerly direction the better bob 
smart fire planning coordinator said today 
about 450 firefighters moved into the area monday and by 
tonight the total was expected to swell to 800 to protect the old 
faithful complex of hotels and cabins from the north fork fire 
which covered more than 2700 acres 
while officials earlier had said the fire burned to within eight 
miles of the geyser caplinger said it was still 10 to 12 miles to 
the west today and burning toward the northeast 
the fire will burn to the northeast and will miss the old 
faithful area fire information officer lee poague predicted late 
monday were not in as much jeopardy as we thought we were 
blazes in americas oldest national park have blackened about 
52400 acres of its 22 million acres which is mostly in wyomings 
northwest corner but extends into idaho and montana in addition to 
wyoming wildfires burned in sections of seven other western states 
and alaska 
nearly 15 miles southeast of old faithful hot embers monday 
night rained down on grant village burning through power lines as 
the 4500acre shoshone fire and the 3000acre red fire approached 
the area 
the fire did not damage a small hotel national park service 
staff apartments and several house trailers in the area because 
they were made of cinder block and other nonflammable materials 
poague said 
the area was evacuated last weekend along with the lewis lake 
campground nearly 10 miles to the southwest and the parks southern 
entrance was closed 
at lewis lake the fires burned to within oneeighth of a mile 
of the campground and crews hosed down structures to keep them 
from catching fire poague said about 500 firefighters battled 
both blazes 
the threat to the old faithful area had seemed more serious 
because of aerial surveys and misleading winds poague said 
ground winds blew the blaze northeast into backcountry where it 
could burn untended away from the geyser that erupts every 30 to 
100 minutes poague said but another wind at a higher altitude 
blew smoke west toward old faithful making it seem the blaze was 
headed that way 
no services or accommodations at old faithful have been closed 
but visitors have been advised such action may be necessary said 
park spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
about 1200 guests generally spend a night at the historic old 
faithful inn the snow lodge and cabins in the area around old 
faithful said park assistant superintendent ben clary 
crews also fought the 31500acre clover mist fire in the parks 
eastern half to keep it out of adjacent shoshone national forest 
poague said 
in the teton wilderness along yellowstones southern border 
more than 700 firefighters made progress today along the northern 
side of the 24400acre mink creek fire working to keep it from 
spreading into yellowstone meadows and shoshone officials said 
precipitation at yellowstone is 75 inches below normal for the 
year and the old faithful area got just 075 of an inch of rain in 
june the national weather service said 
other fires crackled across hundreds of acres of brush and 
forest elsewhere in wyoming and in parts of idaho washington 
oregon utah colorado and montana temperatures monday climbed to 
more than 100 degrees in sections of oregon and washington 
firefighters in central and northern california mopped up dozens 
of little fires while more lightning strikes were reported in the 
sierra nevada range crews virtually extinguished a pair of fires 
in calaveras county that burned about 11000 acres and eight homes 
officials said 
in alaska where more than 50 fires have charred about 12 
million acres firefighters were battling only 22 of the blazes 
among the many fires in alaska one near waring mountain east 
of kotzebue in northwest alaska had jumped in size by 10000 
acres spreading to 207000 acres the bureau of land management 
reported monday 
blm spokeswoman sue mitchell said the blaze destroyed an 
unoccupied cabin and authorities were unsure if it was abandoned or 
in use 
fire lines were holding in check a 323000acre fire near 
livengood in interior alaska it was just seven miles from the 
transalaska oil pipeline but the line was in no danger mitchell 
said

the communist party leadership in armenia today 
sharply criticized activists who led a sixmonth campaign to annex 
an armenian region in a neighboring republic 
the party position outlined in the newspaper pravda reflected 
an unusually harsh line against those pressing for armenian control 
of nagornokarabakh a mostly armenian enclave in neighboring 
azerbaijan 
coming after a hardline speech by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev in which he rejected ethnically motivated claims it 
seemed designed to show proannexation activists they could no 
longer count on highlevel support armenias parliament voted in 
june to annex nagornokarabakh 
azerbaijani authorities opposed the change and the kremlin last 
week deemed annexation impossible 
pravda reported that party leaders in armenia met monday to 
discuss the instigatoray character of speeches at meetings held 
in yerevan the armenian capital 
the armenian leaders condemned the extremist instigatory 
politically harmful speeches and urged all the ideological 
agencies to launch effective efforts to expose the antipeople 
character of the activists pravda reported 
armenians account for about threequarters of nagornokarabakhs 
162000 residents and they have complained of mistreatment by the 
government of azerbaijan which is predominantly moslem most 
armenians are christians 
labor unrest that brought nagornokarabakh to a virtual 
standstill for two months began subsiding monday when tass said 78 
percent of the regions workers showed up at their jobs 
both the staterun media and activists in stepanakert 
nagornokarabakhs central city reported monday that the strikes 
were over and business was proceeding at a normal pace 
some have vowed to continue the fight for annexation but 
central authorities have made it clear that a tougher stance will 
be taken by police in future demonstrations or work stoppages 
activists in yerevan called last week for a fiveday strike to 
protest the july 18 decision by the presidium of the supreme 
soviet but most residents ignored the proposal

the government is dropping forfeiture 
proceedings against the owners of a top ocean research vessel that 
had been seized under the governments zero tolerance antidrug 
policy an attorney said 
the multimilliondollar vessel is being released because the 
woods hole oceanographic institution of massachusetts didnt know 
any drugs were aboard according to its attorney raymond zvetina 
zvetina said he was notified monday that the us treasury 
department has decided to drop forfeiture proceedings the vessel 
had been seized may 18 after customs officers found a trace of 
marijuana and two drugrelated pipes when the vessel returned from 
a trip off the coast of south america 
atlantis ii a 210foot vessel that participated in the 1986 
exploration of the sunken liner titanic had been allowed to 
continue its scheduled scientific voyages but the institute was 
required to inform customs of its movement pending the outcome of 
forfeiture proceedings 
according to the treasury department the forfeiture proceedings 
will be formally terminated after woods hole pays the expenses of 
the seizure 
however zvetina said the institute may not have to pay any 
expenses because its personnel operated the ship during the entire 
seizure period 
the treasury department which has authority over customs 
determined the institute was innocent because it had no knowledge 
of the drugs and had taken reasonable precautions to prevent a 
violation zvetina said 
richard f morris the crew member in whose stateroom the 
marijuana was found pleaded guilty in may to a misdemeanor charge 
of possession of a controlled substance morris 27 of buzzards 
bay mass was sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation and 
fined 100 
capt joe coburn marine operations manager for the institute 
said morris also was put on three months suspension

the us ambassador to the united nations said 
today it would be very difficult to restore normal relations 
with iran before the release of hostages held in lebanon by 
proiranian extremists 
vernon walters said he thought it was unlikely there would be 
any reestablishment of relations with tehran at least in the next 
couple of months because of the hostage situation 
walters made the remarks amid statements from the reagan 
administration that it is prepared to discuss the hostage problem 
with iran but only with authoritative figures and with no 
dealmaking 
president reagan asked monday whether the time had come to talk 
to iranian officials about the hostages replied if theyre 
willing and ready to talk its time 
the administration has expressed interest in establishing a 
dialogue with authoritative iranian leaders but no official 
has yet publicly suggested that a rapprochement could take place in 
the absence of a hostage release 
in an interview on cbstvs this morning walters was asked 
if it was possible to normalize relations with iran before the nine 
american hostages are released 
well it would be very difficult he replied theres no 
question that the people that are holding the hostages have some 
kind of allegiance or connection with iran i think it would be 
very difficult for us to justify anything unless they released the 
hostages 
walters said iranian officials would have to explain why the 
hostages remain in captivity 
i mean what are they holding these people for that have 
nothing to do with the policies they dont like the ambassador 
said these people are college professors and doctors and 
librarians and what have they got to do with the us government 
policies that the iranians dont like its a totally illogical and 
rather cowardly thing to hold those hostages 
i think the whole fact that they seized our embassy and held 
150 people there hostage for a year theyve probably destroyed the 
embassy or seriously damaged it walters said he said there 
would have to be arrangements about where wed go and a whole 
lot of other complicated logistical arrangements 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said us officials hope 
that irans acceptance of a un ceasefire resolution will lead 
to an improving relationship and circumstances where we might be 
able to have a dialogue 
but that does not diminish the fact that we will only have a 
dialogue with authoritative representatives of the government 
the spokesman said and that has not occurred 
the white house often has said that it was doing all it could to 
win the release of nine americans held hostage in lebanon by 
proiranian elements and recent developments have prompted new 
speculation about a possible hostage release 
reagan made only a terse statement in response to a reporters 
question monday as the president concluded a rose garden ceremony 
honoring youths selected for the american legions boys nation 
political studies program 
the president has steadfastly defended his administrations 
clandestine sale of us antitank and antiaircraft missiles to 
the revolutionary government of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in 
198586 
reagan has offered conflicting accounts of whether the sales 
amounted to an armsforhostages deal 
two hostages the rev benjamin weir and david jacobsen were 
released during the time of the transfers of us arms to iran 
money from the arms sales eventually was diverted to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels leading to the reagan administrations worst scandal 
reagan did not elaborate on his terse statement of monday 
but fitzwater told reporters that our position remains the 
same that were always available to talk any time any place about 
the safety or the release of the hostages but we will not negotiate 
for them and we dont anticipate any negotiations 
an administration official noted earlier monday that the united 
states had sent a new message to iran last week asking about the 
possibility of talks aimed at normalizing relations tehran still 
has not sent an authorized reply the official said 
the official who asked not to be identified said the united 
states would like to talk to the iranians about ending the persian 
gulf war the nine americans held hostage in lebanon and 
terrorism but he said the us message did not specify conditions 
for a resumption of relations which were severed in 1980

doctors are asking american indians to 
consider donating bone marrow for a transplant to save the life of 
a 4yearold indian girl suffering from a rare form of leukemia 
the appeal to potential indian donors for rae lynn geshick was 
made because heredity factors make this the best approach doctors 
said monday 
without the transplant the girl will probably die within six 
months said dr philip mcglave director of the adult bone marrow 
transplant program at the university of minnesota 
if she gets the transplant her chances of surviving are 1 in 3 
mcglave said during a news briefing at the american indian center 
rae lynns four siblings and her biological parents do not have 
compatible bone marrow and a search of the national bone marrow 
donor registry found no match among the 18000 registered donors 
said dr david stroncek medical director of the registry most of 
those registered are caucasian 
rae lynn who lives with her foster parents was diagnosed as 
having a rare form of blood cancer chronic myelogenous leukemia 
when she was 8 months old she received intensive chemotherapy and 
her disease went into remission for about three years but she 
became ill again last april 
all of my people please get out and help this little girl 
said her foster mother lillian bruehl who is a chippewa indian 
if 1000 american indian volunteers can be tested two or three 
may be found with bone marrow that matches rae lynns stroncek 
said

the former head of the justice departments 
criminal division said today he had told edwin meese iii in 
resigning that he thought the attorney general had probably 
committed felonies in doing favors for his longtime friend e 
robert wallach 
i advised mr meese on the day i resigned said former 
asssistant attorney general william weld that wallach had 
certainly violated the federal law barring the giving of 
gratuities to publich officials in exchange for official acts and 
that meese probably had violated the statute as well 
weld said that as a lesser justice department official he had 
won convictions of massachusetts building inspectors and a 
congressman with less evidence on the same charge 
weld listed for the senate judiciary committee 63 items of fact 
concerning the attorney generals relationship with wallach which 
weld said bolstered his contention that meese had violated ethics 
regulations and probably had violated the gratuities statute 
weld questioned meeses actions in assisting the scandalplagued 
wedtech corp an iraqi oil pipeline project and regional bell 
telephone companies 
another top aide who resigned with weld told the committee he 
had quit because the departments morale and performance were 
deteriorating due to meeses legal problems 
that aide former deputy assistant attorney general arnold 
burns testified that from my vantage point i could see that 
performance by the department of justice was being impeded by a 
deep malaise that was setting in by virtue of mr meeses problems 
and the public outcry for his resignation 
weld told the committee that meese had certainly violated 
federal ethics guidelines prohibiting public officials from 
committing acts which give any appearance of impropriety 
because i had concluded that mr meeses conduct over the 
years had given the appearance of partiality to mr wallach and 
constituted the use of mr meeses public office for mr wallachs 
private gain i would have resigned from the justice department 
when i did irrespective of whether i had felt mr meeses conduct 
also infringed the provisions of the gratuity statute 
a possible defense against a gratuity charge being applied to 
mr meese is that all of the things of value he received from mr 
wallach were done in the name of friendship and had no relation to 
any of the official acts performed by mr meese which benefited mr 
wallach weld said 
my conclusion was that there were simply too many official 
acts performed by mr meese to benefit mr wallach and too many 
things of value conferred by mr wallach on mr meese for a 
prosecutor to conclude as a matter of fact or law that the gratuity 
provisions would not apply 
not only did mr meese perform many official acts for the 
benefit of mr wallach but his efforts in that regard were 
unusual in the case of wedtech the oil pipeline and meeses 
decision following a receipt of a memo from wallach on behalf of 
the regional bell telephone companies 
in return mr wallach appears to have become over time the 
financial johnnyonthespot for mr meese said weld 
according to weld as well as an 814page report by independent 
counsel james mckay some of the items of value which were provided 
to meese by wallach included legal services for which wallach did 
not charge meese arranging to provide meese with the services of 
financial manager w franklyn chinn and helping arrange a 
40000ayear job for meeses wife ursula 
weld said that he had outlined his views of meeses culpability 
to president reagan and vice president bush as well as 
congressional leaders and other white house aides 
it is welldocumented that mr wallach enjoyed unparalleled 
access to mr meese and saw him frequently throughout the time mr 
meese was in the white house and at the justice department weld 
said i concluded that if mr meese were an ordinary public 
official he would be prosecuted under the gratuity law when i was 
the us attorney in boston we successfully prosecuted building 
inspectors who accepted gifts from friends who maintained they 
merely wanted to get in good or say thanks or expedite an 
otherwise lawful official action 
and when i was head of the justice departments criminal 
division in washington i reviewed and approved the indictment of a 
sitting us congressman who took an action to benefit a company in 
his district and received two free trips to florida from a business 
and social acquaintance who had an interest in the company the 
congressman was indicted and convicted of a violation of the 
gratuity provisions 
the federal gratuity law is a felony punishable by up to two 
years in prision mckay came to the conclusion that meese had not 
violated the gratuity statute based largely on the conclusion that 
the things of value that passed between wallach and meese were done 
in the name of friendship 
testifying before weld burns said that meese was recused in a 
number of matters and recusals multiplied by virtue of his being 
defended by a law firm which had many matters in the department of 
justice this coupled with the devotion of enormous amounts of 
department time and resources to mr meeses defense adversely 
affected morale and performance 
in addition burns testified there have been a number of cases 
where other department employees ranging from senior officials to 
line personnel were placed with meeses approval on administrative 
leave while serious allegations of misconduct against them were 
under investigation 
i was confronted with the argument that it was wrong for us to 
place an employee on administrative leave where allegations were 
not as serious as those facing attorney general meese and that the 
same standard should apply that the attorney general should be 
measured by the same standard as any other department employee and 
if there were a difference in the standard the one applying to the 
attorney general should be more stringent burns said 
i had no answer to this argument he said 
burns said that he held discussions with weld and others in the 
department had discussions with white house counsel ab 
culvahouse and white house chief of staff howard baker and that 
i decided that i had to leave 
it became clear as a bell to me that i could no longer bear 
silent witness to the deterioration of morale the paralysis and 
performance setting in in the department and the continuing erosion 
of public confidence in the department he said 
burns said he was prohibited by the 1978 ethics in government 
act from discussing his concerns directly with meese during the 
criminal investigation of the attorney general 
there was only one way i could make a statement that something 
was wrong burns said i chose it i resigned 
meese on monday attacked burns and weld saying they failed to 
conduct a competent and thorough departmental inquiry of meese 
in the spring of 1987 resulting in the criminal probe by 
independent counsel james mckay 
mckay recently concluded that meese probably broke criminal 
laws on four occasions but the independent counsel did not seek an 
indictment 
meese has announced he will resign probably by midaugust 
claiming he is completely vindicated 
in a speech at the national press club meese declared that 
the evidence now shows that if a competent and thorough 
preliminary investigation had been directed by the thendeputy 
attorney general and the former head of the criminal division 
there would likely have been no cause for referral to an 
independent counsel the attorney general did not refer to burns 
and weld by name 
meese said the decision to launch a criminal investigation of 
him was based on hearsay from executives of the scandalplagued 
wedtech corp who had pleaded guilty to felony charges

republican george bush today proposed 
rewriting conflictofinterest rules that govern federal employees 
to cover a wider variety of misconduct and said members of congress 
no longer should be exempt from the provisions 
those who take on the peoples trust must hold themselves to 
an exacting code of conduct we can expect and indeed tolerate 
nothing less from the people who work for the government the 
vice president said 
bush the allbutcertain republican nominee discussed the 
subject of ethics and standards of conduct in a speech to a 
gathering of congressional interns at the library of congress it 
comes on the heels of democrats charges of sleaze in the 
reagan administration 
bush said that in his many years of government he has been 
guided by a moral compass of decency integrity fairness and 
public purpose 
he said his philosophy is its a privilege to serve its an 
honor to hold the public trust and its a disgrace to violate it 
bush said that as president he would establish an office of 
senior counselor to the president whose first responsibility would 
be ethics he said the counselor would be in charge of a white 
house ethics office that would complement the work of the existing 
office of government ethics 
bush complained that the present system of federal ethics law 
is a confused quiltwork of executive policy statements 
administrative regulations criminal laws indeed virtually every 
agency of government issues its own set of standards of conduct 
he said that under his administration the code of conduct would 
be clear uniform and reflect common sense nothing will be 
overly technical what is intuitively right what your conscience 
tells you will invariably be the written rule he said 
he said the standards he would prescribe would eliminate 
needless restrictions to avoid discouraging good people from 
serving in government 
the sanctions imposed by law for breach of the standards of 
conduct must be fair and proportionate the vice president said 
today there is little or no room under the conflicts law for the 
exercise of discretion and the fashioning of a measured response 
to put it in high relief one is either charged with a felony 
or nothing at all bush said this is plainly unacceptable 
he said prosecutors should be free to exercise their judgment to 
pursue civil remedies as well as enhance criminal sanctions 
a wider variety of misconduct will consequently be reached 
with fair and proportionate responses for all he said 
he said the conflictofinterest statutes must cover members of 
congress to exempt congress from any of these rules as does 
current conflictofinterest law is to establish a double standard 
that breeds suspicion breeds cynicism and in my judgment breeds 
abuse he said 
in a break with the current administration bush said i 
wholeheartedly endorse the concept of an independent counsel 
but again said that the independent counsel law should apply to 
members of congress as well 
more than 100 administration officials have been accused of 
wrongdoing during reagans term including some of his closest 
advisers such as michael deaver convicted of three counts of 
perjury and lyn nofziger convicted of three charges that he 
illegally lobbied the executive branch for private clients 
bushs speech has been long in the making but was delayed until 
the release of a report on the investigation of attorney general 
edwin meese iii by independent counsel james m mckay who found 
that meese probably broke two tax laws and twice violated a 
criminal conflictofinterest statute however mckay decided not 
to prosecute meese who is resigning 
bush talking with reporters on air force ii over the weekend 
said the democrats are going to try to run against meese he 
wont be around 
the vice president said the justice department in particular 
must be above even the perception of wrongdoing 
i would have to reluctantly conclude reluctantly because i 
like meese that those standards were not met bush said 
but he said he disagreed with the description of meese as a 
sleaze by assistant us attorney edward little in the wedtech 
bribery and corruption case in new york 
in accepting the democratic presidential nomination to run 
against bush michael dukakis said the government should set high 
ethical standards for itself 
were going to have a justice department that isnt the 
laughingstock of the nation he said were going to have a 
justice department that understands what the word justice means 
 
and in the dukakis white house if you accept the privilege 
of public service you had better understand the responsibilities 
of public service if you violate that trust youll be fired if 
you violate the law youll be prosecuted and if you sell arms to 
the ayatollah dont expect a pardon from the president of the 
united states

the only statesupported school in 
florida for the deaf and blind has tightened its hiring procedures 
as a result of sex charges brought by male students against a 
former dormitory teacher 
the florida school for the deaf and blind whose alumni include 
musician ray charles now requires six instead of three 
references from prospective employees and includes more questions 
on job applications about contact with children 
in addition nonteaching staffers must undergo fingerprint and 
criminal background checks all new florida teachers including 
those at the st augustine school must already undergo such checks 
to be certified 
dormitory teacher charles johnston 22 was fired in april when 
he was charged with sexually molesting 17 of the boys he was 
entrusted to protect 
johnston hired in 1985 pleaded innocent and is being held 
without bail in the st johns county jail pending a september trial 
his accusers include 19 deaf boys aged 9 to 14 who are students 
at the school founded in 1885 most of the 550 students at the 
school are deaf and live on campus 
there has been an enormous shock because the individual 
alleged to have done this is a person who had earned the trust of 
many kids parents principal kenneth d randall said in an 
interview published in mondays editions of the tampa tribune 
as a dormitory teacher johnston looked after the boys and 
taught them how to dress clean and study he also supervised them 
in games 
johnston is the fifth school employee since 1986 to be arrested 
and fired on charges involving students at the school 
in separate unrelated cases a classroom teacher and three 
dormitory staffers pleaded no contest to charges including child 
abuse attempted lewd and lascivious assault or solicitation of 
sexual activity by someone in a custodial position 
school administrators have hired a psychologist as a consultant 
and are offering counseling to the students and their families

heat at home over budgetline veto decisions in his role as 
massachusetts governor 
bush the expected republican nominee to succeed reagan said 
recently he expects the democrats are going to try to run against 
meese a reference to attorney general edwin meese iii who faced 
a conflictofinterest investigation but was not charged but bushfinterest 
rules that govern federal employees to cover a 
wider variety of misconduct and said members of congress no longer 
should be exempt 
in his administration bush said the code of conduct would be 
clear and would reflect common sense nothing will be overly 
technical what is intuitively right what your conscience tells

today there is little or no room under the conflicts law for 
the exercise of discretion and the fashioning of a measured 
response he added to put it in high relief one is either 
charged with a felony or nothing at all this is plainly 
unacceptable 
reagan at the outset of a white house meeting with republican 
congressional leaders today lambasted the democratic party 
to hear the opposition talk you would think growth in our 
economy had come to a dead halt said reagan adding that 
criticism emanating from the democratic convention in atlanta got 
my irish up 
the opposition talks about growth we deliver he said 
the opposition talks about jobs we deliver 
reagan reading his statement to reporters said george bush 
will cut taxes again what will their nominee do i mean what will 
he really do 
the president said he will be an active participant in the fall 
campaign he gave his own version of a campaign line associated 
with the late president harry s truman im going to give the 
opposition the truth and theyll think its hell 
reagan was consulting with republican congressional leaders on 
his threat to veto legislation requiring companies to give workers 
60 days notice of plant closings and layoffs the democrats have 
made the plantclosing measure a campaign issue 
dukakis carrying out his duties as massachusetts governor while 
campaigning as the democratic nominee for president was spending 
most of today at his statehouse office 
he faces legislative unrest over some of the 138 million in 
spending he vetoed from the states fiscal 1989 budget but he was 
upbeat monday afternoon after a meeting between the 
administrations top budget officer and house speaker george 
keverian declaring all is well 
dukakis planned to break for a lawandorder appearance in 
boston visiting a new police post at a downtown subway stop to 
swear in six new members of the state transit police

chairman of the senate finance committee today as the panel began 
writing a bill to correct errors and make changes in the 1986 tax 
overhaul 
discussing todays white house meeting on plant closings 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan probably would 
veto the bill but no final decision had been made 
the administrations stand on the issue has been repeatedly 
assailed by democrats who say employers owe it to workers to tell 
them when they are about to lose their jobs reagan says business 
should have the flexibility to close plants and lay off workers 
without the 60 days notice 
bush certain to win his partys nomination at the republican 
convention next month has stated sentiments similar to reagans on 
the issue there have been reports however that the bush campaign 
would prefer to see the president let the bill become law to ease 
the political heat on bush 
bentsens dual campaigns for vice president and the senate have 
caused a temporary setback for the dukakis campaign some 46 
million in public money for the campaign is being held up because 
of a complaint from the national republican senatorial committee 
the federal election commission planned to begin reviewing the 
issue today 
the republican complaint says any money bentsen spends on his 
senate reelection bid in texas will directly benefit the 
democrats presidential ticket and give it an unfair advantage an 
unusual texas law permits bentsen to seek both offices 
simultaneously

defense secretary frank c carlucci is 
expected to make an unprecedented visit to a soviet air base near 
moscow and naval facilities on the black sea during a visit to the 
soviet union beginning next week a senior pentagon official said 
today 
carlucci is scheduled to leave washington on thursday rest in 
helsinki finland arrive in moscow on monday and travel to 
sevastapol in the soviet crimea before heading for turkey next 
thursday said the official 
while in moscow carlucci is expected to visit the general staff 
military academy in moscow the kubinka air base about 30 miles 
west of the soviet capital and a base housing the truman division 
an element of soviet ground forces he is expected to fly to 
sevastopol on wednesday 
the official who spoke on condition that he not be further 
identified expressed chagrin that the soviets have not notified 
carlucci of his exact itinerary 
he said carlucci would not accept soviet offers to negotiate 
arms control agreements through the defense department 
the soviet union frequently tries to engage various parties in 
government and out of government as surrogate negotiators in the 
arms control area we are there in the capacity of the defense 
department we are not there to negotiate arms control agreements 
or to play these kind of games said the official 
carluccis visit to moscow is the latest in a series of military 
talks that began during the washington summit last december 
carlucci met with his soviet counterpart gen dmitri yazov in 
switzlerland last march and in moscow in june 
at the beginning of july soviet military chief of staff marshal 
sergei akhromeyev took a tour of us facilities that included a 
cruise aboard the aircraft carrier uss theodore roosevelt to watch 
flight operations and a look inside a b1 bomber and minuteman 
missile training facility 
in return us officials let it be known that they wanted to 
see the soviet blackjack bomber and visit soviet ships at sea but 
so far they have not received confirmation 
our formal agenda has not been agreed to yet said the 
official we let marshal akhromeyev know in detail what was 
going to happen

the top republican on the senate foreign 
relations committee made a public appeal today for lloyd bentsen 
the new democratic vice presidential nominee to continue to vote 
for aid to the nicaraguan contras despite the opposition of michael 
dukakis 
we believe we ought to have that vote sen richard lugar of 
indiana told reporters he voted consistently in support in the 
past 
my guess is there will be a lot of criticism of sen bentsen 
if he abstains or doesnt vote on the contra aid package he 
said he has stood for that and been part of the bipartisan 
coalition and to suddenly opt out now would be very strange 
bentsen has supported president reagans requests for aid to the 
contra rebels in the past a forthcoming vote that is expected in 
the senate would be his first opportunity to cast a vote on the 
issue since becoming the runningmate of democratic presidential 
nominee dukakis who opposes contra aid 
lugar commented after a meeting of gop congressional leaders 
with the president at the white house 
he said the contra issue was discussed and there was a general 
consensus that the legislation ought to proceed 
he said there was no discussion of figures 
we believe there ought to be military assistance lugar 
said we believe those funds will bring about some credibility in 
negotiations 
without there being humanitarian assistance at least with 
some military on the way if it doesnt work out the thing really 
wont accomplish what we want he said

the senate finance committee today approved a 
bill of several hundred pages designed to correct errors in the 
1986 tax overhaul 
attached to the bill which won unanimous approval was a 
provision exempting farmers from paying the federal tax on diesel 
fuel they buy for offroad use a 1987 change requires them to pay 
the tax of 151 cents a gallon and then apply for a refund at 
yearend 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the committee said the 
technical corrections bill is too important to clutter with 
other amendments that might delay its enactment but he said 
committee staff will attempt to put together a package of unrelated 
tax amendments that would be added to the bill when it reaches the 
senate floor if a majority of committee members can agree 
that presumably would include for example an amendment 
allowing freelance writers and artists to deduct certain expenses 
even before a book or painting begins producing revenue another 
likely amendment would free owners of mutual fund shares from 
paying a tax on certain operating expenses of the fund 
those provisions and numerous others were added to the 
technicalcorections bill by the house ways and means committee as 
were selected tax increases targeted to pay for the tax benefits 
the house bill for example would impose a tax of 267 a pound on 
pipe tobacco and bar moonlighters and others who work out of their 
homes from deducting any part of their base monthly telephone bill

west germans increasingly are snubbing 
their traditional wurst and potatoes for vegetables 
vegetable consumption climbed from 152 pounds per person in 1982 
to 170 pounds last year and is expected to continue to increase 
according to the central marketing association for german 
agriculture 
west german officials are among those lining up for plates of 
leafy greens and vegetables theres a new daily salad buffet 
available at the commissary for employees at the office of 
chancellor helmut kohl 
vegetable dishes have also become a favorite at the cafeteria 
for federal lawmakers even though the traditional breaded cutlet 
sausages and ham sandwiches still are popular 
the environmentalist greens party led the charge in altering the 
menu at federal government cafeterias to include vegetarian dishes 
chefs at kohls personal kitchen say the chancellor sometimes 
orders food from the commissary available to his employees but 
they refuse to say whether the portly politician is among those who 
make a beeline for the salad buffet

the vaticans daily newspaper on tuesday 
criticized advertisements on italian television that recommend 
using condoms to prevent the spread of aids 
the article in losservatore romano reaffirmed the vaticans 
opposition to promoting the use of condoms in the fight against 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome declaring that as with 
smoking the best medical advice is abstinence 
the vatican commentary said the theory of not striking at the 
roots of evil but only its consequences has resulted in the 
promotion of condoms as the routine remedy of dealing with what 
is presented as the evil of the century 
in a major statement in march the vatican newspaper said the 
issue of sexual permissiveness was the true cause of the aids 
problem 
the latest commentary said the tv spots fit into the logic that 
the essential issue is not to prevent the evil but to control its 
effects 
the spots contracted by the ministry of health begin tuesday 
on raitvs three channels and run through aug 8 and then again 
in midseptember

a team of israeli diplomats including a former 
soviet dissident left tuesday for moscow in a visit seen here as 
critically important to sovietisraeli relations which were 
severed 21 years ago 
the five delegates plan to join in sabbath prayers at the main 
synagogue on friday evening in moscow and to make themselves highly 
visible among soviet jews many of whom have been choosing to 
emigrate to the united states and europe instead of israel 
prime minister yitzhak shamir who met tuesday with visiting 
russian orthodox metropolitan filaret said he hoped for a 
substantial improvement in sovietisraeli relations 
the visit will be especially emotional for two of the israelis 
delegation head meron gordon emigrated from the soviet union at the 
age of 10 and yaakov kedmi 43 is a former soviet jewish 
dissident who came here at the age of 24 
we are both very moved gordon 41 said on israel 
television when we left there we were young i dont think 
either of us ever thought we could return to the soviet union 
certainly not as official representatives of israel 
yeshayahu anug deputy director of the foreign ministry spent 
the last year heading efforts aimed at gaining soviet permission 
for the official israeli visit 
he called it a major event and added the atmosphere is 
promising but we dont intend to conquer the soviet union in 
one day 
he said the immediate purpose of the delegation was to help 
process israeli visas both for soviets wishing to emigrate and 
those wishing to visit 
from january to june 6017 soviet jews emigrated and 840 of 
those went to israel according to the genevabased 
intergovermental committee for migration 
in addition the team will inspect the empty israeli embassy 
building for which israel pays about 100000 annual rent 
anug said the delegations limited mandate could be expanded 
although there was no plan for it to take part in political talks 
with soviet officials 
the diplomats traveled tuesday to the hague where they are to 
pick up twomonth soviet visas and then leave thursday for moscow 
israel hopes the delegates will be allowed to stay longer 
the soviet union severed ties with israel after the 1967 middle 
east war to protest israels occupation of territory captured from 
three arab countries 
israel and the soviet union still have no official diplomatic 
relations but links between moscow and jerusalem have recently 
improved 
in the summer of 1986 israeli and soviet delegates met in 
helsinki finland for the first official session since 1967 last 
summer a soviet delegation arrived in tel aviv on twomonth visas 
that since have been extended

george bush jr says his father was 
right where he was supposed to be as vice president in response 
to the rhetorical attack from massachusetts sen edward kennedy and 
other democrats of where was george 
kennedy in a speech at last weeks democratic national 
convention in atlanta wondered why the likely republican 
presidential nominee didnt take a stand against such controversial 
reagan administration policies as the sale of arms to iran in 
exchange for hostages 
where was george the massachusetts senator asked repeatedly 
but the younger bush in a brief campaign stop monday said 
george was right where he was supposed to be as vice president of 
the united states a loyal solid vice president who is willing to 
take the good news out of this administration and the bad news

drought has reduced the expected fall duck 
migration to the second smallest on record and could mean a 25 
percent reduction in hunting this year federal wildlife officials 
say 
the migration will total about 66 million ducks according to 
biologists of the fish and wildlife service only 1985s estimated 
migration of 62 million was lower and last years was a hopeful 74 
million 
all the decline will come in the central and mississippi flyways 
because of steady loss of marshy breeding areas in the northern 
plains states and southern canada in the 1980s the flight on the 
atlantic and pacific flyways should be unchanged from last year 
the service has been warning for weeks that major new 
restrictions probably will be needed for hunting seasons starting 
in october 
states are in charge of actual hunting regulations but they 
must choose from possibilities set out by the service earlyseason 
guidelines for hunting the bluewinged teal in september call for 
no season at all in 13 central and mississippi flyway states 
regularseason guidelines will be decided upon next week after a 
public hearing in washington advisory committees meeting in denver 
on monday were asked to discuss a 25 percent cutback in the number 
of days during which duck hunting is allowed a reduction in bag 
limits from the typical four to three and an early closing of the 
season on jan 1 instead of jan 20 said megan durham spokeswoman 
for the fish and wildlife service 
it isnt just this years drought that has reduced breeding 
activity in the marshes there have been many dry years in this 
decade allowing farming to be extended into areas previously too 
wet for crops particularly in canada 
surveys released last week showed record numbers of ducks in 
northern canada and alaska with populations up 9 percent there 
those ducks couldnt find suitable areas farther south and the 
longer flights may have tired them too much to breed biologists 
fear 
overall the census by us and canadian biologists showed the 
breeding populations of 10 major species down 37 percent from last 
year and 17 percent from the 19551987 average there were only 
258 million northern pintail ducks 18 percent fewer than last 
year and 54 percent below average 
mallards in southern saskatchewan fell below 1 million for the 
first time 
biologists are beginning to worry that continued low water 
conditions in the areas waterfowl use for migration stopovers and 
wintering will concentrate the birds and make them more vulnerable 
to disease later this year the service said 
frank dunkle director of the service was quoted as expecting 
increased emphasis on management of wetlands for waterfowl as 
provided for under the 1986 north american plan agreement with 
canada because such areas in many cases have provided the only 
relief for droughtstressed waterfowl 
some other findings from the survey 
the platte river in nebraska has been turned into a river of 
sand exposing the nesting piping plover and the interior least 
tern to threats of predators and death of aquatic food species 
geese are faring better than ducks since they nest on more 
permanent wetlands and are better able to protect their young from 
predators 
flows of tributaries to the great lakes are so low biologists 
cannot safely apply chemicals to control lamprey which prey on 
lake trout dredging necessitated by low water will spread 
contaminated bottom sediment threatening other aquatic life 
the acorn crop from oak trees in the midwest and south could be 
a neartotal failure without major rain soon spelling problems for 
deer squirrels and wild turkeys dependent on acorns for food 
pheasant quail and grouse though doing well in kansas and 
nebraska now could be hurt next winter and spring through 
droughtcaused loss of food and cover poor production of pheasant 
grouse and hungarian partridge is expected in the dakotas 
some fish wont spawn in the upper mississippi and missouri 
rivers because of low water and high temperatures in the dakotas 
has eliminated or reduced production of walleye northern pike 
smallmouth bass and largemouth bass at federal hatcheries

the reagan administrations top mideast 
official will meet next week with his soviet counterpart to discuss 
developments in the persian gulf and the stalled arabisraeli peace 
process a us official said tuesday 
assistant secretary of state richard murphy will meet in geneva 
early next week with vladimir polyakov a specialist on the middle 
east at the soviet foreign ministry said the official he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the murphypolyakov meeting is part of regularly scheduled 
contacts between the two officials although they have increased 
the pace of their meetings this year said the official they last 
met in march 
murphy will travel to the mideast after the geneva meeting said 
another official he declined to elaborate or to be named 
arabisraeli peace moves have been moribund since attempts 
earlier this year by secretary of state george shultz to bring the 
sides to the negotiating table and defuse the palestinian uprising 
in israelioccupied territories 
the united states appears to have placed its peace plan on hold 
pending the outcome of general elections in both countries in 
november 
the soviet union is seeking an increased role in the peace 
process which so far has been dominated by the united states 
in the gulf the superpowers are cooperating in supporting 
attempts by un secretary general javier perez de cuellar to bring 
about a ceasefire between iran and iraq 
the two neighbors who have been at war for almost eight years 
agreed last week to accept a yearold un ceasefire resolution 
designed to end the conflict perez de cuellar is meeting this week 
in new york with representatives from both sides to work out 
implementation of the ceasefire 
murphy and polyakov are also expected to discuss implementation 
of the ceasefire as well as rehabilitation plans for the 
devastated region japan has offered to provide financial help for 
rehabilitation projects 
the soviets enjoy good ties with both parties while the united 
states is seeking to renew the dialogue it had with iran before 
ties were broken following the 1979 takeover of the us embassy 
in tehran by iranian militants

iran and un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar today held 
the first round of peace talks on implementing a ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war 
as he arrived at un headquarters velayati condemned the 
latest iraqi offensive and said iraq was jeopardizing peace efforts 
by using outlawed chemical weapons 
perez de cuellar said he would hold negotiations today with 
velayati on a ceasefire troop withdrawal prisoner exchange 
formal peace talks and a un peace plan the talks had been set 
for wednesday 
further talks with velayati and his iraqi counterpart tariq 
aziz are to be held wednesday 
aziz was scheduled to arrive in new york later today it was not 
known if he would see the secretarygeneral today 
un officials said perez de cuellar was aided by senior 
political military and legal officers perez de cuellar said 
monday he is optimistic a truce date can be set within 10 days 
iran announced july 18 that it accepted the yearold security 
council resolution calling for a ceasefire in the nearly 
8yearold war iraq previously accepted the resolution 
since friday iraq has captured iranian territory and prisoners 
in a series of attacks but has said it did not intend to keep the 
land iraq has said it intended to take the prisoners to improve 
its bargaining position in ceasefire talks 
they have intensified the war on the front in the last few 
hours they have attacked some cities and invaded our border 
velayati said today 
he said iraqi officials declared monday that their forces would 
withdraw from iran by midnight however he said iraq invaded two 
northwestern cities and still the war is going on very seriously 
and they have used chemical weapons on a large scale 
velayati declined to answer reporters questions about the 
possibility of restoring a dialogue with the united states 
vernon walters the us ambassador to the united nations said 
today it would be very difficult for the united states to 
normalize relations with iran before the nine us hostages were 
freed from captivity in lebanon 
theres no question that the people that are holding the 
hostages have some kind of allegiance or connection with iran 
walters said in an interview on cbs this morning 
i think it would be very dfficult for us to justify anything 
unless they released the hostages he said 
the longestheld among the 18 foreign hostages believed held in 
lebanon is terry anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
state department spokesman charles redman on monday reaffirmed 
the us willingness to hold a dialogue with iran he told 
reporters the united states sent iran a message last week raising 
the possibility of talks but no reply had yet been received 
the united states broke diplomatic relations with tehran after 
iranian revolutionaries stormed the us embassy there in 1980 and 
took hostages the last 52 us hostages in iran were freed 444 
days later 
a sevenmember un team meanwhile arrived in tehran today to 
work out the technical details of the ceasefire and was to visit 
baghdad later in the week 
un team leader lt gen martin vadset said he would explore 
ways to implement and maintain a truce irans islamic republic 
news agency reported in a dispatch monitored in cyprus 
five of the officials are from the jerusalembased un truce 
supervision organization and two are from united nations 
headquarters in new york 
other un experts already were in tehran to determine the 
status of prisoners of war an exchange of prisoners is a key 
aspect of the un ceasefire resolution

the senate today sidestepped a controversial 
pension issue during debate on the fiscal 1989 health and human 
services spending bill after having rejected attempts to terminate 
the nations family planning program 
the massive 137 billion bill which also contains money for the 
departments of labor and education is traditionally a lightning 
rod for controversy 
president reagan has said he would veto the entire bill based on 
a senate provision permitting medicaid funds for abortions where 
pregnancy is the result of rape or incest current law permits 
payments only where the life of the mother is endangered 
senators agreed today to leave out another provision opposed by 
reagan a oneyear moratorium on companies cashing out overfunded 
pension plans the senate appropriations committee had approved the 
moratorium but the full senate instead passed a resolution 
directing the finance committee to deal with the issue 
hundreds of companies have dipped into their plans and labor 
leaders say the money is often used for mergers or other business 
moves not in workers interests company after company has turned 
its pension plan into a piggybank while paying meager benefits to 
retirees said sen howard metzenbaum dohio chief sponsor of the 
provision 
sen don nickles rokla a leading opponent of the moratorium 
said the metzenbaum approach would have encouraged companies to 
underfund their plans he also said the appropriations committee 
had no expertise in the complicated area of pension law 
sen jesse helms rnc lost attempts monday to eliminate the 
140 million title x family planning program and to require 
unmarried minors seeking contraceptives from federally funded 
clinics to have written parental consent 
the senate voted 6521 against getting rid of title x and 5434 
against the mandatory parental consent proposal 
in other action monday on the laborhhs spending bill the 
senate approved by voice vote an abortion conscience clause 
sponsored by sen gordon humphrey rnh 
the provision says none of the money in the bill can be used to 
require any person or entity to perform or facilitate abortions it 
applies to medical personnel or denominational hospitals with 
religious or moral objections to abortion 
title x provides money to states local health departments and 
private groups for family planning clinics serving primarily 
lowincome women 
helms alleged that title x recipients are using federal funds 
for abortionrelated services and for secret sex programs for our 
nations teenagers 
the federal government takes money from american parents and 
then uses that money to give contraceptives to their 
children helms said this is wrong this is immoral 
sen lowell weicker rconn countered that title x is not an 
abortion program its a knowledge program it has been enormously 
successful

six stolen artworks discovered a year ago hidden in 
the paris home of an italian have been returned to italy the 
cultural ministry announced tuesday

the senate finance committee on tuesday 
stripped away all issues of controversy and unanimously approved a 
bill correcting hundreds of errors in the 1986 tax overhaul law 
the chairman sen lloyd bentsen dtexas won quick approval of 
the bill by promising colleagues that the committee staff would 
attempt to put together a separate package of their favorite 
unrelated tax provisions if such a package could win approval of a 
majority of the panel bentsen said it could be offered as an 
amendment when the bill reaches the senate floor perhaps in 
september 
that package likely would include amendments to permanently free 
about 20 million mutual fund shareholders from a tax on certain 
fund operating expenses and to allow freelance writers and artists 
to deduct expenses before a book or painting starts producing 
income 
most of the finance committees bill is designed to correct 
mistakes in the 1986 law but there is a new provision which 
would exempt farmers and some other diesel users from paying tax 
on fuel used for offroad purposes a 1987 law requires that such 
users pay the tax of 151 cents a gallon and apply for a refund at 
yearend 
this is the last major piece of legislation we expect to come 
out of this committee this year said bentsen the running mate 
of democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis he cautioned 
that many tax incentives that members want to add to the bill 
cannot be accepted because of budget constraints 
while members of the committee probably would have no trouble 
agreeing on some relatively small selective tax increases bentsen 
said the problem would come in deciding which of many pet tax 
incentives would go into the final bill 
unless we follow what you suggest said sen bob packwood of 
oregon senior republican on the committee we will have no bill 
at all 
the committees action left in doubt the fate of several major 
provisions that the house ways and means committee added to its own 
version of the technical corrections bill 
these include tax credits for business research and 
experimentation for owners of lowincome rental housing and for 
employers that hire the poor as well as a tax exemption for bonds 
used to help lowincome families buy their first home 
the ways and means committee also approved several tax increases 
to pay for those and other incentives those provisions range from 
a new tax of 267 on a pound of pipe tobacco to a reduction in tax 
benefits for singlepremium life insurance policies 
there is a whole litany of things we would like to do but were 
are not going to be able to get them in this bill bentsen said 
accountants and tax lawyers are especially eager to have the 
technicalcorrections bill enacted because many provisions in the 
massive 1986 law are unclear or ambiguous

sein lwin first rose to prominence in 
burma by commanding an army company that shot and killed 22 
protesting students in a 1962 riot at rangoon university 
last march when thousands of students went on a rampage in some 
of the worst rioting in burmas history it again was sein lwin who 
led the forces that put them down 
analysts had suggested the 64yearold hardliner would be a 
logical scapegoat as the government of ne win his close ally 
sought to appease critics and stabilize the country 
instead sein lwin emerged tuesday as burmas most powerful 
leader succeeding ne win who resigned saturday 
the new chairman of the burma socialist program party 
virtually the countrys sole political institution is like almost 
all of its members a retired military officer 
he joined the army in 1942 when burmese officers including ne 
win were siding with japan against the allies specifically 
britain which had colonized the onetime kingdom 
as the war progressed the officers switched allegiance to the 
allies realizing japan posed as much a threat to burmese 
independence as had the british independence from britain in 1948 
was followed by a chaotic 14year experiment with democracy 
that experiment ended in 1962 the year ne win seized power in a 
military coup and began to enforce his brand of economic socialism 
militarybacked authoritarian rule and isolation from much of the 
world 
that same year sein lwin led his army unit in quelling the 
protest at rangoon university firmly establishing his reputation 
as an unbending leader prepared to wield an iron fist to root out 
opposition 
little has been pubished about sein lwin and others in burmas 
senior hierarchy most of whom live secluded lives away from the 
public eye 
sein lwin retired from the army and in 1977 became a member of 
the partys guiding body the central executive committee he took 
the no 4 party slot of joint general secretary in 1985 
also in 1985 he was named secretary of the council of state 
the no 3 position in the government after president and vice 
president the 28member council directs all state organs 
he has also held ministerial portfolios for cooperatives 
transport communications and home affairs 
on march 18 in a day that was later dubbed bloody friday 
thousands of students stormed through downtown rangoon burning 
cars and shouting antigovernment slogans for the second time in 
three months 
the lon htein or riot police were called out reinforced 
by regular army units and armored vehicles according to western 
diplomatic and burmese sources sein lwin commanded the police from 
a tactical command headquarters at the government broadcast station 
sein lwin overruled some leaders who wanted to handle the riot 
more leniently the sources said the government has since admitted 
to 43 deaths but more than 100 people are believed to have been 
killed 
analysts among them the respected hong kongbased far eastern 
economic review had suggested sein lwin would take the fall for 
the violence which deepened antigovernment sentiments 
home minister min goung resigned several other officials were 
sacked or reprimanded on tuesday the nations prime minister and 
attorney general were dismissed in connection with the riots and 
sein lwin emerged as leader

nasa has selected two sites in mississippi as 
the best locations for proposed governmentowned facilities for the 
production and testing of a new space shuttle solid rocket motor 
the space agency announced today 
a location in northeastern mississippi known as yellow creek was 
selected as a production site for the space shuttle advanced solid 
rocket motor nasa said and the stennis space center near bay st 
louis miss has been selected as a site for the testing of the 
motor 
yellow creek is owned by the tennessee valley authority and 
stennis is a nasa facility 
the national aeronautics and space administration said work at 
the yellow creek site could provide about 1400 new jobs and an 
additional 600 jobs would be created at bay st louis 
the space shuttle advanced solid rocket motor is planned to 
replace the current redesigned shuttle rocket motor in the 
mid1990s the advanced motor is expected to provide more 
reliability and safety and enable the space shuttle to carry more 
cargo into orbit 
under the nasa advanced rocket motor plan the space agency will 
now ask for contract proposals for work on the rocket motor at the 
two mississippi sites companies will be asked to make bids on 
building a governmentowned facility that would be operated by the 
contractor 
companies may also propose that the work be done in facilities 
built and owned by contractors at a privately owned site of the 
contractors choosing 
after evaluating the options nasa will make a final decision on 
the advanced solid rocket motor contract 
nasa said that an advanced solid rocket motor program in 
mississippi will make maximum utilization of the michoud 
assembly facility and the slidell computer complex both located 
nearby in southeastern louisiana

the spine specialist who prescribed back 
surgery for football star joe montana says at least twice as many 
operations as necessary are performed for ruptured discs in the 
lower back 
dr jeffrey saal of the san francisco spine institute said 
surgeons generally use the wrong criteria in deciding to operate 
he reported findings of his threeyear study cowritten with his 
brother dr joel saal to the north american spine society in 
colorado springs colo on monday 
these include severe pain leg weakness failure to respond to 
bed rest and diagnostic exams showing a fragment of the discs 
nucleus has broken through the disc wall and is pressing against a 
nerve root 
none of those saal said should be used as overwhelming 
evidence that surgery is needed instead the decision should be 
based on the patients level of function and whether that can be 
improved by an active rehabilitation program he said 
more than 20 percent of patients with lower back disc 
problems have surgery but less than 10 percent may really need it 
if there are no other problems such as stenosis or narrowing of 
the spine saal said in an interview 
other studies have noted the presence of stenosis as a reason 
for failed lumbar disc surgery and estimated the presence of 
stenosis in 30 percent of those patients 
rapid progressive weakness in the leg is an indication surgery 
is needed saal said montana had those symptoms along with 
stenosis before his surgery in 1986 
montanas back surgery was so successful it was commonly 
referred to on the sports pages as a miracle at midseason 
doctors said the surgery would sideline him for the rest of the 
year possibly forever but he was back on the field in weeks to 
lead the 49ers in the playoffs 
most patients with ruptured lumbar discs have less severe 
symptoms and can return to work and sports within four months after 
starting active nonoperative treatment saal said 
hes probably correct said frances conley chief of 
neurosurgery at the palo alto veterans hospital and associate 
professor of surgery at stanford university far too much surgery 
has been done on lumbar discs and were becoming more aware about 
how much its been overdone now because we have better tools such 
as magnetic resonance imaging 
saals treatment included teaching patients how to reduce the 
risks of further injury training for spine stabilization and 
exercises to develop overall body strength and flexibility while 
the disc heals itself injections or drugs sometimes were used to 
block pain and reduce swelling 
such treatment he said can cost up to 3500 compared with 
more than 30000 for surgery and postoperative care while 
involving much less risk 
more than 2 million americans suffer from ruptured discs in 
their necks and lower backs and they spend more than 3 billion 
annually on lumbar disc treatment according to the american 
academy of orthopedic surgeons 
an estimated 237000 operations on discs in the neck and back 
were performed in 1986 according to the national center for health 
statistics 
ronald mortara neurosurgeon at university hospital in boston 
and associate professor at the boston university school of 
medicine said he agreed that lumbar disc surgery is sometimes 
performed unnecessarily but was unaware of any studies indicating 
how often that occurs 
but he was skeptical of saals claim that 90 percent of lumbar 
disc patients could be healed without surgery if they have severe 
pain 
were quite conservative here as a rule he said but if 
the patients have failed bed rest physical therapy pain 
medication antispasm drugs and are out of work and cant do the 
things they like then surgery is probably indicated 
saals study based on 59 patients averaging 35 years old and 
thought to be free of stenosis found their symptoms sciatic pain 
in their toes legs or buttocks a tingling sensation in their toes 
and weakness in their feet lasted an average of five months 
only six patients required surgery after the nonoperative 
program but four of those were found to have stenosis 
eighteen patients asked surgeons for a second opinion of their 
cases and all were recommended for surgery as soon as possible to 
avoid long term complications fifteen of those however rated 
themselves good or excellent after treatment without surgery

the blue diamond coal co said it will 
build a 20 million plant that will process 1250 tons of coal an 
hour 
construction is to begin in july 1989 at beech fork hollow in 
southeastern kentucky and be finished by october 1990 everett 
kelly blue diamonds general manager of mines said monday 
kelly said the plant should help the knoxville tennbased 
company expand to meet the needs of more utilities the plant 
which would be among the largest in the eastern united states will 
provide 2 million to 3 million tons of coal a year kelly said 
kelly said the facility could allow the company to hire more 
people to work in blue diamonds mines but the plant itself will 
be highly automated and may employ fewer people than now run the 
companys grinding and washing plant at leatherwood he said 
the company also plans to develop a 12 million longwall mining 
system at two new eastern kentucky mines 
a longwall uses a large cutting machine that runs back and forth 
on a track shearing hundreds of tons of coal off a seam as it 
passes hydraulic systems keep the track and temporary metal 
roof supports above it advancing as the machine cuts into the 
seam 
blue diamond will finance the projects with roughly 30 million 
it received from the georgia power co when that utility bought 
itself out of a highcost contract last year

rains have relieved drought stress in 
parts of the corn belt but crops have shown little improvement a 
report by the joint agricultural weather facility said tuesday 
the precipitation gave most crops a boost in the central and 
southern great plains delta and southeast the report said 
soil moisture improved but was still mostly short in the eastern 
half of the nation 
in the central and eastern corn belt rain during the week of 
july 1824 may have come too late to improve corn harvest 
prospects the report said

the house judiciary committee today approved 
17 articles of impeachment against us district judge alcee l 
hastings of miami and sent the historic bribery case to the full 
house 
hastings 51 is the first federal judge to face impeachment 
after his acquittal in a criminal trial on the same charges and 
the first black to face removal from federal office under the 
impeachment procedure 
in miami hastings said that those who voted against him acted 
in blind ignorance they could not have read the material 
the committee voted 321 to approve all the 17 impeachment 
articles 
a number of committee members said they had done considerable 
soul searching because they feared hastings may have been correct 
in his assertion that he was the victim of racism but those 
expressing such reservations said that factual circumstances of the 
case showed impeachment was warranted 
hastings would be removed from his lifetime office if the full 
house votes for impeachment and he is convicted in a senate trial 
hastings is accused of conspiring to solicit a bribe from two 
defendants who appeared before him and of lying about the scheme to 
a federal jury he also is accused of leaking information about a 
wiretap 
william borders a washington attorney accused of participating 
with hastings in the bribery scheme has been convicted of the 
charges hastings in a separate 1983 trial was acquitted 
the first of the articles of impeachment which are similar to 
an indictment accused hastings of engaging in a corrupt conspiracy 
to obtain a 150000 bribe from two brothers other articles 
accused him of lying about the scheme at his trial by denying 
specific parts of the conspiracy of leaking wiretap information 
and of undermining the confidence of the federal judiciary 
eleven impeachment cases have come to trial before the senate 
and five defendants all judges have been removed from office

the williamsburg bridge closed when inspectors 
discovered such extensive corrosion they feared it might collapse 
was reopened tuesday following nearly 10 million in surface work 
the bridge is now stronger than its been since world war

buggies by the time it was closed april 12 it was carrying more 
than 100000 vehicles and 420 trains daily 
the closing of the bridge affected millions of daily commuters 
not only on that structure but on the neighboring manhattan and 
brooklyn bridges to which displaced traffic was rerouted 
two lanes for motorists were opened in may and another two in 
june tuesdays ceremony marked the opening of all eight lanes to 
cars brooklynbound trucks remain forbidden but should be allowed 
on the bridge by midaugust sandler said 
sandler said the city was able to complete the work two weeks 
ahead of schedule because contractors and city employees worked 
seven days a week adding some 150 tons of steel to the structure 
more extensive longterm work particularly on the approach 
roadways leading to the bridge is still needed sandler said 
a 350 million sevenyear project will begin once federal and

contaminated rainwater in the slums of 
new delhi is blamed by city officials for an epidemic of 
waterborne diseases that killed 14 more lives tuesday bringing 
the death toll to 157 
at least 317 people suffering from gastroenteritis and cholera 
were hospitalized tuesday and that the epidemic is spreading to new 
areas of the indian capital 
more than 4400 residents mostly children are hospitalized 
with the diseases caused by contaminated water from monsoon rains 
that has seeped into the citys primitive pipes and wells 
about 1200 new cases were reported monday from nine areas of 
new delhi with a combined population of half a million people most 
of the earlier cases were reported from only two neighborhoods 
more than 11700 people have sought treatment since july 9 
officials say they have inoculated more than 200000 people to 
halt the spread of the diseases 
dr raj saxena a physician in the district of sunder nagri 
says he and his team are inoculating 30 people every hour 
but it seems its not working he said frankly speaking 
the situation is out of our hands the damage has been done we are 
just trying to check it 
hit hardest by the epidemic are slums built after 1975 in 
outlying areas to the east 
of new delhis 8 million people 24 million people live in 
slums 25 percent of which have no power supply 49 percent no tap 
water and 32 percent no toilet facilities 
the impoverished nand nagri district east of the yamuna river 
was the first area hit by the epidemic and is worstaffected it 
has 50000 residents 
garbage in the area has not been collected for four or five 
months after a dispute between the delhi development authority and 
the municipal corp over which agency was responsible for the slum 
areas 
health officials say rain water flowing through garbage and 
sewage into shallow wells is spreading the diseases among the 
congested dwellings 
health officials ordered city wells shut off and water tanked 
in prime minister rajiv gandhi toured the area last week and 
ordered the garbage cleared 
but the indian express newspaper reported tuesday that the slums 
still looked like cesspools 
dr ts rana a private physician with a clinic in nand nagri 
said the number of cases may be greater than reported 
at least four to five people are dying of cholera from this 
area daily who are not reported he said 
people here do not have money to take patients to hospitals 
he said they try the local doctors and then just pray and 
cholera is a disease which does not respond to prayer 
the monsoon rains began in new delhi in the last week of june

a fourth mediterranean fruit fly was found 
just hours before a pair of helicopters sprayed presticide over a 
16squaremile suburban area but officials said tuesday they dont 
plan to repeat the airborne effort 
the next step in efforts to eradicate the mediterranean fruit 
fly one of the most destructive cropdestroying insects will be 
the release next week of about 20 million cobalttreated sterile 
flies said bill edwards chief deputy for the los angeles county 
department of agriculture 
after that he said there will be daily releases of sterile 
flies to prevent females that escape the poison from reproducing 
the fourth medfly was found monday in a peach tree at a home in 
the san fernando valley community of reseda a quartermile west of 
the zone treated with the pesticide malathion 
gov george deukmejian proclaimed a state of emergency for the 
county last week after two female medflies were found in traps the 
proclamation was a necessary step for spraying the pesticide a 
third medfly a male was found monday morning about a mile from 
where the two females were found july 20 
the helicopters laden with 1100 gallons of the malathion mixed 
with a cornsyrup bait began spraying the infested area at 10 pm 
monday and finished early tuesday 
each helicopter made three passes at 500 feet over the area 
said edwards 
there were no complications it was a good clean operation 
he said 
the medfly common in hawaii and probably carried into southern 
california on fruit brought in by tourists has a potential for 
spreading rapidly 
the insect is considered a major threat to californias 
multibilliondollar agricultural industry in 1981 california 
spent about 100 million to eradicate a statewide medfly 
infestation that destroyed 100 million in crops 
meanwhile concerned residents deluged hospitals and the 
countys medfly hot line with questions about possible health 
hazards from the spraying 
weve had a few a few thousand calls said robert 
dingfelder a county agricultural inspector 
medical experts say most residents need not fear the pesticide 
which has been diluted to about one ounce for every acre of land 
sprayed only people with serious respiratory ailments might be 
affected doctors said 
nonetheless officials advised residents to hose down lawns 
after the spraying especially if they have pets and to cover 
their cars because the spray can corrode auto paint

force sergeant while he was jogging with his dogs near clark air 
base in an incident that may have been caused by a marital 
dispute police said tuesday 
in a separate incident police said the filipino wife of an 
american serviceman was slain sunday near the base about 50 miles 
north of manila 
in a third incident police said two belgian embassy officials 
were shot and wounded sunday south of the capital and the filipino 
companion of one of them was shot dead police said robbery 
appeared to be the motive in the last two cases 
tech sgt richard blackmer 31 of the cleveland suburb of 
brook park was jogging near his home about one mile from the 
bases main gate about 930 pm monday when gunmen in a car opened 
fire with m16 rifles killing him and his two dogs police said 
investigators who requested anonymity said a preliminary 
investigation indicated the killing may have been caused by a 
marital dispute 
they said blackmer was estranged from his filipino wife and was 
living with another woman police monday picked up the wife maria 
for questioning but said no charges were filed 
police capt gener mangune said mrs blackmer refused to answer 
questions and expressed resentment over receiving a smaller amount 
of financial support than blackmer was paying to his commonlaw 
wife 
meanwhile us authorities said esther billa heacox 41 the 
wife of navy petty officer james a heacox was found stabbed to 
death about three miles north of clark air base 
master sgt james katzman of the clark public affairs office

he said benoit standaert second secretary at the embassy 
suffered two gunshot wounds but was released from the hospital

batangas province as saying that they suspected robbery was the 
motive because the gunman fled with ms capistranos purse 
nearly 40 people have been killed in communities around clark

philippines since october when the rebels killed two air force

armenias communist party leaders leveled an 
unusually harsh attack tuesday on activists who sought annexation 
of an armenian region in a neighboring republic indicating the 
activists could no longer count on highlevel support 
the party position outlined in the communist party newspaper 
pravda came after soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev gave a 
hardline speech rejecting the transfer of nagornokarabakh a 
mostly armenian enclave in the republic of azerbaijan to the 
jurisdiction of neighboring armenia 
activists in armenia and in the disputed region itself have been 
pushing for the transfer since february and armenias legislature 
voted in june to accept the area 
but azerbaijani authorities opposed the idea and the kremlin 
last week deemed annexation impossible 
pravda reported tuesday that party leaders in armenia met a day 
earlier to discuss the instigatory character of speeches at 
meetings held in yerevan the armenian capital 
the leaders condemned the extremist instigatory politically 
harmful speeches and urged all the ideological agencies to 
launch effective efforts to expose the antipeople character of 
the activists pravda reported 
about threequarters of nagornokarabakhs 162000 residents are 
armenians and they have complained of discrimination at the hands 
of azerbaijani authorities armenians are mostly christian while 
azerbaijan is predominantly moslem 
widespread general strikes and work stoppages that have 
disrupted the disputed region for two months began subsiding 
monday when tass said 78 percent of the regions workers showed up 
at their jobs 
on tuesday more than 85 percent of the firstshift workers in 
the 17 largest factories in stepanakert nagornokarabakhs main 
city reported for work tass said 
it said all the regions factories stores service shops and 
public transport agencies were working for the second day in a row 
some armenians have vowed to continue the fight for annexation 
but central authorities have made it clear that police will come 
down harder on future demonstrations or strikes 
the tass report from stepanakert indicated communist party 
leaders were conducting a mass campaign to persuade 
nagornokarabakhs residents that the kremlins rejection of their 
demands was correct 
activists in yerevan called last week for a fiveday strike to 
protest the july 18 decision by the presidium of the supreme 
soviet but most residents ignored the call

gov madeleine kunin has announced a bid 
for a third twoyear term promising to work for a universal health 
care plan similar to that recently adopted in massachusetts 
its a basic need that must be met the 54yearold democrat 
said in a speech delivered monday at burlingtons new community 
boathouse every vermonter has the right to good health care 
services and no vermonter should be denied such services because 
he or she cant pay for them 
also on the agenda is implementation of a controversial law to 
control growth which kunin championed during the last legislative 
session the law requires that communities planning for growth 
follow specific guidelines it also increased the property transfer 
tax to help pay for planning 
kunin doesnt have a challenger in the september primary 
election she is likely to face house republican leader michael 
bernhardt of londonderry in november bernhardt also is unopposed 
in the primary 
kunin said after her speech that she did not have a specific 
plan to fund the health care program but suggested that it would be 
funded jointly by the public and private sectors 
the massachusetts law requires the state by 1992 to arrange 
pooled insurance for small businesses and individuals which 
participants can buy on a sliding fee scale based on income 
the law also requires businesses with more than five fulltime 
employees to offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment 
surcharge to help the state provide coverage to the uninsured 
kunin is a strong backer of massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
the democratic presidential nominee

hungarian prime minister karoly grosz dampened 
expectations tuesday of a unilateral withdrawal of soviet troops 
from his warsaw pact country saying any withdrawal of the red army 
should be linked to troop reductions elsewhere in europe 
grosz said he had talked about the presenceof 65000 soviet 
troops in hungary with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and we 
agreed to continue this discussion 
but in a speech and a news conference in washington on tuesday 
grosz who heads the hungarian communist party said to withdraw 
forces from hungary others would have to be disbanded as well 
he plugged hard for us trade and promised widespread economic 
and political reforms while acknowledging hungary was plagued with 
problems of alcohol and stagnant factories 
grosz said the hungarian constitution would be revised next year 
and that four times as many hungarians were permitted to leave the 
country to visit abroad in the first half of this year than in the 
first six months of 1987 
grosz in may succeeded janos kadar who took charge in budapest 
in 1956 as soviet troops suppressed what grosz called a 
counterrevolutionary uprising 
he will see president reagan on wednesday and has spent a week 
traveling in the united states sampling the products of capitalism 
and committing hungary to a more independent course than the 
country followed under kadar 
explaining hungarys economic problems grosz said the country 
had not moved fast enough on the political front to expand the 
rights of the individual workers and factory managers to make their 
own decisions 
political without economic reform no its not possible he 
said speaking through a translator 
on the same theme grosz said the two processes must be 
fitted to each other you cannot separate them practically 
political and economic endeavors take place in one body 
he said writers were gaining more freedom and all hungarians 
were able to express their views although the communist party also 
retains the right to do so 
at the same time grosz said works by hungarian expatriates were 
not permitted into the country if they are against the 
constitution and that he was against removing hungary from the 
sovietled warsaw pact 
speculation that gorbachev would withdraw the red army 
unilaterally from hungary has circulated for at least a month us 
officials citing intelligence sources kept the rumors moving but 
they have not panned out 
groszs remarks suggested gorbachev would blend any withdrawal 
from hungary into larger negotiations between nato and the warsaw 
pact on an overall reduction of conventional troops armor and 
aircraft in europe 
no date has been set for negotiations with the chief stumbling 
block a us demand that the soviets agree to hold simultaneous 
talks about human rights improvements at home and in eastern europe

international business machines corp has 
landed a 36 billion contract for a computer system that will 
replace voice communications between air traffic controllers and 
pilots with electronic messages and eventually may usher in the use 
of computers to actually direct aircraft 
the system expected to be in full operation at the turn of the 
century also would give controllers advance warning of overcrowded 
air traffic conditions 
an ibm executive called the contract the largest ever received 
by the company and officials said it was the largest ever awarded 
by the transportation department 
ibm bested hughes aircraft co a subsidiary of general motors 
corp for the 10year contract to develop the advanced automation 
system for the federal aviation administration ibm had spent 233 
million of the faas money and about 80 million of its own in the 
competition 
the system which is to be developed by ibm and more than a 
dozen subcontractors is designed to provide controllers with more 
modern computer capacity and flexibility to handle increased air 
traffic loads 
the project outlined in the contract is expected to be completed 
in 1998 although other enhancements are likely to be made after 
that to meet additional requirements officials said the new 
system is to be introduced in 1992 when it is scheduled to be 
installed at the faas air traffic control center in seattle 
faa administrator allan mcartor called the new system a 
significant milestone and a historic step toward the future of 
air traffic control 
the new computer system and radar screens will allow controllers 
to use modern computer terminals and provide clearer displays 
weather information and eventually the means to predict when 
airspace is expected to become crowded faa officials said 
controllers eventually will communicate with aircraft by data link 
computer messages instead of by voice 
although planners envision eventual modifications that would 
allow the computers to talk directly to aircraft through data 
links mcartor said there always will be a controller in the 
loop the new technology will allow controllers to work smarter 
not harder mcartor said 
the faa estimates that the increased automation represented by 
the new system would reduce the number of additional controllers 
needed over the next 20 years 
mimi dawson deputy secretary of transporation called the 
system to be provided by ibm an entirely new generation of air 
traffic control hardware and software that will provide the 
capacity needed for continually increasing air traffic well into 
the next century while substantially enhancing safety 
she said ibms federal systems division was selected over hughes 
aircrafts ground systems group largely because its bid was lower 
she declined to characterize how much lower the ibm bid was except 
to say the government benefited a great deal on costs from the 
strong competition 
both bids were extremely competent technically she told a 
news conference 
gerald w ebker an ibm vice president and head of its systems 
integration division said the contract is the largest contract 
that ibm has ever received either from the government or private 
industry 
about 50 percent of the 36 billion project will be 
subcontracted to other companies although a list of subcontractors 
has yet to be developed said william d carson the project 
manager 
two of the biggest subcontractors will be raytheon co of 
lexington mass which will design and manufacture the consoles 
and display equipment and computer sciences corp of falls church 
va which will develop the software 
first word of the contract being awarded to ibm came in a 
onesentence announcement late monday although at the time dot 
officials refused to elaborate or provide additional details 
the advanced automation system is the cornerstone of the 
governments broadranging air traffic control modernization 
program which is estimated to cost at least 16 billion when it is 
completed 
aviation experts have long complained that the faas current 
computer equipment is outdated recently the faa completed 
installation of an interim computer system also produced by ibm 
under a separate 197 million contract which is to serve as a 
bridge until the more advanced system is available

request for a stay of a lower court injunction against testing 
during the lawsuit 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san francisco on july 1

appelate action the bureau of prisons sought to set aside through 
the petition to justice oconnor who handles emergency matters 
from that circuit covering western states 
the american federation of government employees is suing to 
overturn the bureaus plan to require random testing of 5 percent 
to 10 percent of some 13000 prison employees each year the union

illegal drug use violates among other things the constitutional 
prohibition against illegal searches 
the supreme court is expected to hear arguments this fall on the

on a church bus probably would not have been prevented by a 
protective cage around the vehicles fuel tank a state fire 
marshal reported tuesday 
after examining fueltank cages on other buses investigators 
concluded the protective cage is to prevent the tank from being 
torn away during collision and not to protect it against 
puncture the report said 
the report confirmed that the fire which engulfed the bus owned 
by radcliff first assembly of god church was caused by gasoline 
gushing from a puncture 2 to 3 inches long in the fuel tank 
the bus carrying 67 people home from an outing at an ohio 
amusement park and a pickup truck going the wrong way collided 
near carrollton on interstate 71 on may 14 
the truck driver larry mahoney 35 of worthville was driving 
while drunk authorities said he was indicted friday on 27 counts 
of murder one for each victim of the crash and pleaded innocent 
the puncture probably was caused by one of the bus front leaf 
springs and the fuel tank was pushed 24 to 26 inches to the rear of 
its normal position the report said 
given the location of the puncture with respect to where the 
cage would have been it is doubtful that a protective cage 
would have prevented the puncture of this particular tank in this 
particular incident the report said 
the report said investigators could not pinpoint the source of 
ignition but investigators confirmed that the bus front door was 
knocked from its mounts blocking escape 
the 1977 superior bus bought by the church from a school 
system was among the last models manufactured before fueltank 
cages became a federal requirement on school buses 
the fire marshals report recommended escapeexit windows and 
roof hatches in new and old buses the state has ordered 
popout emergency windows on new buses and recommended them for 
old ones but decided against action on roof hatches 
the reports other recommendations included relocating fuel 
tanks away from the side door of a bus requiring emergency escape 
training for passengers who ride buses on daily or weekly 
schedules restricting use of flammable materials in seats and 
improved driver training 
meanwhile residents of carroll county where the accident 
occurred on monday turned over a petition to the county clerk 
calling for a referendum oct 4 on banning liquor sales 
a group called concerned citizens for better life gathered 1076 
signatures more than twice the 509 needed for the alcohol sales 
referendum by tuesday judgeexecutive robert westrick had not 
verified the signatures 
a 1985 vote that let carrollton businesses sell liquor by the 
drink was decided by just 13 votes

defense secretary frank c carlucci departs 
thursday on a soviet trip expected to include unprecedented visits 
to air ground and naval bases although a senior us official 
expressed chagrin tuesday that moscow had not set the exact 
schedule 
during four days in the soviet union carlucci will meet his 
soviet counterpart gen dmitri yazov to continue discussions on 
reducing military tension between the superpowers 
but carlucci will not be drawn into discussions of conventional 
and nuclear arms control issues that us officials say should be 
conducted in established and ongoing negotiations involving 
diplomats from the united states and its allies in the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
the soviet union frequently tries to engage various parties in 
government and out of government as surrogate negotiators in the 
arms control area a senior us official said 
we are not there to negotiate arms control agreements or 
to play these kind of games said the official who spoke on 
condition he not be further identified 
despite the tough talk pentagon officials were looking forward 
to a visit they hoped would provide their first close look at 
soviet bases since world war ii 
we find it useful to have greater access to the soviet union 
not only to tell our story but to see for ourselves firsthand the 
types of leadership they have and their approach to military 
issues the official said 
carlucci accompanied by assistant defense secretary ron lehman 
representatives of the joint chiefs of staff and state department 
and a planeload of other officials was to depart andrews air force 
base on thursday for helsinki finland there they will meet with 
finnish president mauno koivisto and other officials before 
arriving in moscow on monday for the talks 
after departing the soviet union next thursday carlucci will 
fly to turkey for meetings with turkish president kenan evren 
prime minister turgut ozal and senior defense officials 
he was to visit ankara istanbul and a nato base at izmir before 
returning to washington on aug 8 
in moscow carlucci was expected to visit the frunze general 
staff military academy the kubinka air base about 30 miles west of 
the soviet capital and the base of the tuman division part of the 
soviet ground forces he is expected to fly to sevastopol on the 
crimean peninsula on wednesday to look at elements of the black sea 
fleet 
at the beginning of july soviet chief of staff marshal sergei 
akhromeyev took a tour of us facilities that included a close 
view of flight operations on the aircraft carrier uss theodore 
roosevelt and a look inside a b1 bomber and a minuteman missile 
training facility 
in return us officials let it be known that they wanted to 
see a soviet blackjack bomber and visit soviet ships at sea 
we understand that carlucci will go out on the black 
sea but we have not heard the details as to whether that will be 
on a combat vessel or on a ferry boat the official said 
us officials said they did not know whether the soviets would 
allow reporters and photographers to accompany carlucci during his 
visit such coverage was permitted for parts of akhromeyevs trip 
a senior pentagon official who discussed the trip with reporters 
complained that the soviets had not given carlucci an exact 
itinerary 
generally when we are going there the details of the 
schedule are often left until the last few minutes the official 
said 
while we went out of our way to make sure that everything we 
showed akhromeyev was unclassified he saw real equipment and 
real troops he saw the real world what we are looking for is 
the real world not a rigid display or a potemkin village the 
official said 
carlucci will ask yazov more about the soviets highly 
publicized doctrine of defensive sufficiency which the kremlin 
says precludes the offensive use of military forces 
when marshal akhromeyev came here last time he indicated he 
would answer all of our questions let me say it is not clear that 
he answered any of our questions said the official so far we 
have seen no changes in soviet force posture production or 
military spending 
carlucci also will press the soviets to move ahead on an 
agreement announced on july 11 between akhromeyev and the chairman 
of the us joint chiefs of staff adm william crowe to set up a 
working group to discuss ways of avoiding dangerous military 
situations 
and he will try to nail down specifics of an agreement announced 
by akhromeyev and crowe for the exchange of visits by warships 
professors at military academies and senior staff and field 
commanders

foreign minister shimon peres on tuesday 
accused prime minister yitzhak shamir of possibly missing a chance 
to end the palestinian uprising by not accepting the us plan to 
resolve the dispute 
legislators who spoke on condition of anonymity reported on the 
shouting match in a closeddoor meeting of the defense and foreign 
affairs committee which signaled the start of israels election 
campaign 
also tuesday the supreme court rejected an appeal by the 
governing likud bloc to intervene in a preelections squabble 
paving the way for holding national and municipal elections on 
separate dates which peres leftofcenter labor party favors 
likud has asked the high court to intervene in mondays 
legislative decision to oust a likud committee chairman who blocked 
a bill separating national and local elections 
the decision means the bill will probably pass a defeat for 
likud which had hoped to ride on the coattails of strong local 
councils and win more votes to the parliament 
peres said shamirs rightist likud party inspired the 
palestinian uprising by rejecting secretary of state george p 
shultzs peace initiatives which include an international middle 
east conference 
aides to peres said he intends to make the peace negotiations a 
central element in his campaign for the premiership in the november 
elections 
peres rightwing adversaries led by shamir have also vowed to 
make peace in the occupied territories central to the campaign and 
to attack labor defense minister yitzhak rabin for his failure to 
quell the nearly 7monthold arab uprising in which 233 
palestinians and four israelis have been killed 
labor supports a retreat from the occupied territories in return 
for peace while likud opposes any concessions to the arabs the 
two parties have shared governmental powers after a 1984 coalition 
agreement was forged to break an election stalemate 
peres opened the twohour foreign policy briefing by lashing out 
at shamir who implied that labor sided with egypt in a 1986 
israeli government decision to submit a border dispute to 
international arbitration 
recent israeli news reports said the arbitors may restore to 
egypt the strip of desert beach called taba which israel seized 
when it occupied sinai in the 1967 middle east war 
this is the first time in my life that someone who also voted 
for the arbitration tries to absolve himself of responsibility 
peres was quoted by labor legislators as saying 
peres accused shamir of missing a chance for peace by 
failing to accept shultzs plan 
if it werent for the sabotage of the peace process of the 
shultz initiative by half the government then maybe we wouldnt 
be in the middle of the intefadeh peres reportedly said using 
the arabic word for uprising 
likud legislator eliahu benelissar interrupted peres shouting 
youre not coming here with clean hands 
he called peres a bolshevik referring to the labor partys 
leftleaning ideology 
peres responded by shouting at benelissar youre always 
slandering you act like a fascist according to labor legislator 
micha harish 
harish said the debate reflected the significance of the peace 
issue in the election campaign it will be without a doubt the 
central issue he said 
pollsters predict a tight race between labor and likud with the 
latter holding a slight edge largely due to support for israeli 
hawkishness in response to the palestinian uprising

major collective bargaining settlements in 
private industry during the first six months of this year provided 
for wage increases averaging 22 percent a year the labor 
department reported tuesday 
the department said this was a slight decline from the 29 
percent average wage increases in the contracts the last time they 
were negotiated generally two to three years ago the contracts in 
the first six months of the year covered 102 million workers 
while the report on collective bargaining agreements indicated 
no rise in inflationary pressures another report covering both 
union and nonunion employees did show a pickup in labor costs 
the department said that overall wages and fringe benefits rose 
46 percent for the 12 months ending in june compared to a smaller 
33 percent increase a year ago 
this report in addition to covering union and nonunion 
employees also measures total labor costs including salaries and 
such fringe benefits as health insurance and pension plans 
the report said much of the acceleration in labor costs came 
from rising health insurance premiums 
economists have been watching closely for accelerating wage 
demands at this advanced stage of the recovery from the 198182 
recession many economists believe that as long as wage demands 
remain moderate inflation will not be a threat and the federal 
reserve will be able to keep credit conditions loose enough to keep 
the recovery alive 
john hagens senior economist at the wefa group a private 
economic forecasting firm said that the slowdown in wage increases 
in collective bargaining agreements provided solid evidence that 
wage pressures are not beginning to build 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co called the rise 
in collective bargaining agreements a very modest increase but 
he said the pickup in overall labor costs as reflected in the 
governments employment cost index was more worrisome 
i think we are already seeing wage pressures in some 
industries such as services he said next year with 
unemployment rates in the current low range we will see even more 
pressure on wages

by an assessment of one quarter of 1 percent of the market value of 
all hogs sold in the united states and an equivalent amount on 
imported hogs pork and pork products

president reagan said tuesday his progrowth 
administration also has been staunchly proenvironment and the 
message being sent to polluters is youre out of luck 
in a white house ceremony honoring 94 volunteer efforts to 
preserve the nations natural treasures reagan recited a litany of 
successes by his administration in protecting scenic rivers 
endangered species of animals and fragile habitats 
he said the administration has cracked down on polluters with 
record numbers of criminal convictions he praised the 
environmental protection agencys handling of toxic waste disposal 
likening federal regulators to actor clint eastwoods toughguy 
movie cop dirty harry 
the message to polluters is crystal clear we told them in the 
words of dirty harry youre out of luck cleaner air cleaner 
water increased protection for american wildlife this progrowth 
administration has also been staunchly proenvironment reagan 
told the take pride in america awards ceremony eastwood is a 
spokesman for the program 
the same spirit of creativity and innovation thats created 17 
million jobs has also benefited the land itself making america the 
beautiful more beautiful reagan said 
but a spokesman for the sierra club attacked reagans claims and 
said the administrations record on the environment is absymal and 
ranks as the worst ever in history 
theres no question reagan and his appointees have cooperated 
to cut back virtually every environmental program we have and have 
ignored facts on some of our new problems said david gardiner 
legislative director of the sierra club 
gardiner said reagans speech was an attempt to boost vice 
president george bushs bid for the presidency because the 
environment has clearly become a campaign issue 
reagan praised the take pride in america winners for their 
stewardship of the nations crown jewels 
you helped clean litter out of the grand canyon have given 
medical care to alaskan wildlife planted gardens in philadelphia 
and helped preserve the wetlands of california and much much 
more he said 
more than 540 groups and individuals were nominated for the 
secondannual awards the program is a publicprivate partnership 
involving 44 states two us territories nine federal agencies 
and dozens of private organizations 
flanked by interior and agriculture secretaries donald hodel and 
richard lyng reagan used the occasion to say his administration 
has set the highest standards of enforcing the environmental 
protection laws and pointed to 852 civil enforcement actions 
filed in his first term nearly 2 times the rate of the carter 
administration 
but we didnt stop there we took it one step further and 
established the environmental crimes unit because in the past 
virtually no environmental cases were criminally prosecuted weve 
obtained over 400 criminal indictments and over 300 convictions and 
guilty pleas he said 
among his administrations other accomplishments are a 1 
billion restoration program to improve and protect national parks 
the addition of millions of acres to the national wilderness 
preservation system and the creation of 34 new national wildlife 
refuges totaling more than 400000 acres in 20 states 
the number of rivers protected as wild and scenic has tripled 
since 1981 he said and the administration has made 271 additions 
to the endangered and threatened species list 
emissions of manmade pollutants into the air have been 
significantly reduced reagan said 
the epa has used the superfund toxic waste cleanup program 
to complete work at more than 1000 emergency hazardous waste sites 
and work currently is under way at 700 sites on the national 
priority list for toxic cleanup reagan said 
weve kept americas commitment to land and wildlife 
management clean air clean water and a healthier environment for 
us all reagan said

the house agriculture committee approved on 
tuesday a drought relief bill totaling 6 billion including a 145 
million benefit pushed by dairystate lawmakers for milk producers 
despite president reagans warning not to create windfalls for 
some or bust the budget 
it is the duty of this committee to assure that there is an 
adequate supply of milk said rep james jeffords rvt as the 
panel adopted the provision to raise the price support for each 100 
pounds of milk by 50 cents 
the committee approved the dairy plan 1512 and then sent the 
entire 6 billion relief bill to the house floor where 
consideration is expected this week 
the bill already contained a provision to cancel a 50cent cut 
in the dairy price support scheduled for jan 1 the further 
benefit for the politically influential dairy industry would 
actually raise the price support 
the move brought warnings that the bill could be headed for 
trouble 
rep dan glickman dkan said that provision does tend to 
treat one segment of agriculture more favorably than other segments 
of agriculture 
this amendment makes the whole bill more vulnerable when we go 
to the floor glickman said 
there also was speculation that the dairy increase which would 
cost the government 145 million over two years by committee 
estimate might trigger a presidential veto of the legislation 
no similar provision is contained in the senates drought relief 
bill which also is expected to come to the floor this week farm 
lawmakers from the two houses are planning to meet in a conference 
committee next week to fashion a final version of the legislation 
the house panel acted despite a specific warning from president 
reagan not to provide windfalls to special interests or run to 
excess with spending proposals 
to put it very simply we must not bust the budget reagan 
said in a letter to house agriculture committee chairman e 
kika de la garza dtexas he also said that creating 
windfalls for some will mean less for the truly deserving 
he urged de la garza to avoid penalizing farmers who purchase 
federal crop insurance by providing equal benefits to those without 
it and he called on the chairman not to force farmers to do 
unreasonable things 
no program should for example include any incentive for a 
farmer to plow under his crops reagan said 
jeffords whose home state is a major source of the east coasts 
milk supply warned that dairy herds would dwindle without the 
increase in the support level and cause a milk shortage that would 
be hard to rectify 
cows dont drop from the sky he said he said the shortage 
would raise prices and then youre going to hear screams from 
consumers that you just wont believe 
proponents shrugged off studies by the agriculture department 
and a private group of agricultural economists holding that no milk 
shortage was in the offing under the program as it stands 
at the outset of the committees session deputy agriculture 
secretary peter myers told lawmakers that the administration 
already disapproved of provisions of the bill that would expand 
government feed benefits for livestock and dairy producers 
he also said the administration was opposed to a provision that 
would require farmers to buy federal crop insurance in the next two 
years in order to be eligible for disaster payments now 
the measure would provide disaster payments for growers of all 
crops whether or not they are covered by federal farm programs 
equal to 65 percent of crop losses in excess of 35 percent of 
expected yield 
there would be additional payments for farmers who suffered an 
almost total wipeout of their crops the senate agriculture 
committee was still struggling to add a similar provision to its 
version although the panel already has given final approval to its 
bill 
benefits for livestock producers primarily from expanded and 
streamlined federal feed assistance programs would be capped at 
50000 for each individual payments to crop producers would be 
limited to 100000 per person 
crop producers would not be required to repay socalled 
deficiency payments or federal income supports that they already 
have received in advance 
before approving the measure the house committee also showed 
compassion for texas cotton growers in the district of rep larry 
combest rtexas whose crops were damaged in 1987 by hail the 
panel approved a 24 million amendment that also would supply 
disaster payments to those growers 
proponents acknowledged that the damage had nothing to do with 
the drought but noted that there was a similar disaster relief bill 
in 1986 but not in 1987 they said the combest plan would fill in 
the gaps

dixon said the committee had decided to hire outside counsel 
when it formally opened its sixcount investigation of wright 
dtexas on june 9 but had withheld announcement of the decision 
until someone was chosen for the job 
the contract with phelans firm phelan pope amp john will be 
for no more than 300000 he said dixon said he could not 
estimate how long the investigation will take to complete 
as i see our job its to conduct an independent full review 
of all the facts that have been presented in the inquiry and report 
back to the committee phelan told reporters in a brief 
appearance outside the closed committee room 
the fact that im a democrat doesnt stand in my way of being 
fair and full he added i would hope that no citizen would be 
branded unfair or unobjective simply because he exercised his basic 
american right he said his selection was a great opportunity 
for me and i appreciate the confidence the committee had im 
going to do my very very best 
but dixon in response to a question said phelan would not be 
authorized to go beyond the scope of the sixcount resolution of 
inquiry unanimously adopted by the panel on june 9 
that drew a complaint from rep newt gingrich rga wrights 
chief accuser who said no inquiry could be considered independent 
if it does not permit investigators to follow leads to their 
conclusions 
the independent counsel has to be truly independent 
gingrich said he cannot be on a short leash held by the 
democratic chairman of the committee 
gingrich objected to the choice of phelan whom he called a 
partisan democrat the chicago lawyer has been a fundraiser for 
the presidential campaign of democratic sen paul simon of 
illinois according to an article in the january issue of the 
american lawyer 
phelans selection also was criticized by citizens for reagan 
which sent a mailgram to the committee saying the appointment of 
liberal democrat activist richard phelan as outside counsel in the 
wright case certainly calls into question the independence of the 
ethics committee inquiry 
wright complained that gingrich appears to be trying to set 
impossible standards for the investigation so he can criticize it 
no matter what the outcome as a whitewash 
failing to have any substance on which to rely they are 
trying to lay the impression that the inevitable result of a clear 
bill of health is somehow a whitewash wright said they would 
have said that no matter whom they chose as outside counsel he 
added 
wright is under formal investigation on charges of using his 
office to lobby federal officials and others on matters in which he 
had a financial interest and for alleged improprieties in the 
publication of a book by a campaign contractor for which wright 
received unusually high royalties among other charges 
just a few hours before the announcment the lobbying group 
common cause asked the committee to demonstrate publicly that any 
outside counsel will have authority and independence 
the request in a letter from common cause chairman archibald 
cox to dixon said that could be done by giving the investigator 
full authority to investigate review documents issue subpoenas 
and present evidence to the panel to hire whatever staff is needed 
to conduct the inquiry and to recommend formal charges be brought 
before the committee if warranted 
the panel also should guarantee that the outside counsel shall 
be free after discussion with the committee to make such public 
statements and reports as the counsel deems appropriate cox said 
dixon declined to respond publicly to the common cause letter 
he said the panel had been considering phelan as outside counsel 
for several weeks and said the chicago attorney had been 
interviewed individually by all republican and democratic members 
of the committee 
wright said he does not know phelan but added apparently 
hes a reputable attorney

top aides to michael dukakis said tuesday they 
expected jesse jackson to take a short vacation before campaigning 
for the democratic presidential nominee but that some jackson aides 
could join the dukakis effort within days 
were talking about people at every level and things look real 
good said donna brazile dukakis deputy national field 
director a lot of progress has been made since the convention 
top jackson aides were huddling tuesday in chicago to discuss 
their future and brazile said the dukakis campaign expected to 
receive a list of names of jackson workers interested in working on 
the fall campaign 
well be talking to them in the next 24 hours and hopefully 
well have something to announce within 72 hours or so brazile 
said in a telephone interview 
the dukakis campaign has several state director posts vacant and 
has said it will recruit jackson organizers for some of them 
brazile and charlie baker the dukakis campaigns national field 
director met with several jackson field staffers friday in atlanta 
before returning home from the democratic national convention 
as for jackson himself dukakis aides said no definite campaign 
schedule has been worked out as yet 
joseph warren the dukakis campaign secretary who has assumed 
the added title of general election campaign coordinator said it 
was his understanding that jackson wanted to take a brief vacation 
were anxious for him to get going but that hasnt been worked 
out yet said warren a college classmate of jackson and the 
ranking black in the dukakis campaign 
when jackson does travel warren said he expected the money to 
come from the democratic party because the trips will be focusing 
on voter registration and related efforts more than direct 
campaigning for dukakis 
but that has not been totally settled yet either warren 
said we know that that were going to find the money to get him 
around 
brazile said she has asked jackson aides interested in joining 
the dukakis camp to express their interest soon so that the 
campaign can draft its fall campaign payroll by early august 
in addition she said dukakis and aides would use the next few 
campaign trips to reach out to volunteers and elected officials who 
supported jackson during the primaries meetings are planned in 
cleveland and milwaukee during the dukakis campaign swing this 
weekend she said 
brazile who worked for jackson in 1984 said dukakis has moved 
to include jackson supporters much faster than 1984 nominee walter 
mondale 
it took a long time for the mondale people to get us on board 
late august she said were in a much better position

a married woman missing for nearly two 
months may have been killed and buried in a desolate grave beneath 
a crude cross the victim of her lovers suicidal obsession with 
voodoo police said tuesday 
caroline m rubias disappearance june 2 and the discovery of a 
makeshift altar and mystical paraphernalia in her boyfriends 
closet have led detectives on a search through the strange 
subculture of the primitive religion 
police theorize that rubia 52 was killed by her lover of 20 
years a roofing contractor who changed his name in 1979 from 
charles william turner to che francois toussaint 
toussaint 47 was found dead in his bed of cyanide poisoning 
when investigators broke into his barricaded home june 7 expecting 
to find rubias body 
investigators found a crude altar and other items in his closet 
including three snapshots of rubia covered with salt and three 
onequart mason jars turned upside down with a strip of tape 
labeled me on one a second labeled carol rubia with stop 
it written underneath and a third reading carol and i 
the jars were covered with salt and contained spices peppers 
and molasses a recipe found in toussaints garbage can mixed 
tartar powder crushed red pepper and crosses 
investigators went to a berkeley religion expert with the items 
they also presented the expert with desperate letters toussaint 
mailed before his suicide blaming rubia and her witchcraft for 
his bad health and business failures 
the expert theorized toussaint buried rubia in a way that would 
prevent her spirit from escaping he said the grave likely would be 
covered with salt and pins and that the victims hands probably 
would be tied 
salt and pins were to keep her spirit confined even in death 
and thats why the expert was sure she was tied too said young 
authorities are hoping the expert will help them find rubias 
body 
her bloody prescription glasses were found in toussaints pickup 
truck after he committed suicide 
the berkeley expert a selfdescribed good witch who police 
did not name told officers the items are those used in voodoo an 
africanborn religion based on a belief in sorcery 
the jars molasses and spices were supposed to seal in bad 
spirits and prevent them from attacking toussaint the expert said 
he wanted a barrier between him and her in both worlds 
young said toussaints exwife said toussaint was fearful of 
spirits when married to her and would cover her doll collection to 
smother its power 
toussaint told friends rubia was slowly poisoning him said 
detective sharon young of the san jose police departments 
missingpersons unit 
rubia attended a catholic retreat shortly before her 
disappearance at which she decided to leave her lover and devote 
herself to her husband and family young said

they were then laid out at nearby cremation grounds where sikh 
rites and prayers chanted by 3000 mourners accompanied the burning 
of the bodies on funeral pyres

former justice department criminal division 
chief william weld testified on tuesday that he resigned in protest 
last march after telling his boss edwin meese iii that the 
attorney general had probably broken the law 
and meeses former top deputy arnold i burns said he quit the 
same day because of the deep malaise at the department adding 
that meese was living in a world of alice in wonderland about 
his problems 
weld told the senate judiciary committee that if meese were an 
ordinary citizen he probably would have been prosecuted for taking 
gratuities from his longtime friend e robert wallach 
weld who resigned march 29 to protest meeses continued tenure 
in the face of a criminal investigation by independent counsel 
james mckay said that he told meese the day hequit that the 
statute barring the acceptance of gratuities in exchange for the 
performance of official duties certainly would reach the conduct 
of mr wallach and probably that of mr meese 
weld said he reiterated his views in april in a 40minute 
meeting with president reagan and vice president george bush 
weld said he concluded that the attorney general had certainly 
violated federal ethics guidelines prohibiting public officials 
from committing acts which give any appearance of impropriety 
before resigning weld said he decided that if mr meese were 
an ordinary public official he would be prosecuted under the 
gratuity law 
when i was the united states attorney in boston we 
successfully prosecuted building inspectors who accepted gifts from 
friends who maintained they merely wanted to get in good or say 
thanks or expedite an otherwise lawful official action the 
former assistant attorney general told the committee in short i 
came to the conclusion that this set of facts was sufficiently 
serious that i felt i could not continue as chief of the criminal 
division at the justice department 
weld and burns the former deputy attorney general disclosed 
new details about their white house meeting with reagan with burns 
describing bush as becoming florid very upset burns said 
reagan appeared distressed during what weld described as a 
very frank and candid discussion in which burns among other 
things outlined how a deep malaise had set in at the justice 
department because meese refused to step down 
weld listed for the committee 63 items of fact concerning the 
attorney generals relationship with wallach which weld said 
bolstered his contention that meese had violated ethics regulations 
and probably had violated the gratuities statute 
wallach publicly proclaimed his access to meese and wallach was 
paid from 13 million to 14 million by the scandalplagued 
wedtech corp 
thats too much for a san francisco tort lawyer helping out a 
company in a government contracting context and raises a 
question as to what hes doing for them said weld 
burns said meese ignored his advice to distance himself from 
wallach 
burns said that he told meese around april 8 1987 that wallach 
was in a lot of trouble and that weld had told meese that 
wallach was in deep yogurt wallach currently is under 
indictment for alleged racketeering in the wedtech scandal 
i advised mr meese to distance himself from mr wallach told 
him to sever his relationship with mr wallach told him to 
repudiate mr wallach my advice was not heeded said burns 
burns said he was shocked around may 1 1987 when meese weeks 
after being told that wallach was under criminal investigation in 
the wedtech scandal told burns that a job offer by meese to 
wallach to become his counselor in the justice department was still 
open 
mr wallach crept up on him mr wallach hornswoggled him 
burns said when asked by sen howard metzenbaum dohio to explain 
why meese would have continued to hold a post open for wallach 
meese last week categorically denied that he had entertained any 
idea of hiring wallach at the justice department once he learned 
that the san francisco personal injury lawyer was under 
investigation in the wedtech scandal 
burns responded bitterly to meeses suggestion monday that burns 
and weld had failed to carry out a competent and thorough 
preliminary inquiry in the spring of 1987 thus triggering the 
criminal investigation of meese by mckay who has decided not to 
seek an indictment of the attorney general 
burns disclosed a letter of may 11 1987 from meeses lawyers in 
which they ask that matters concerning meese be referred to a 
courtappointed independent counsel 
according to mr meese everybody is wrong said burns 
mr meese continued to defend one e bob wallach you can get 
the flavor of what life is like in the department of justice 
its a world of alice in wonderland a world of illusion and 
allusion a world in which up is down and down is up in was out 
and out was in into the various situations there was a 
common denominator that common denominator was e bob wallach 
mr wallach appears to have become over time the financial 
johnny on the spot for mr meese weld testified 
wallach was paid 150000 by a partner in a 1 billion iraqi oil 
pipeline meese assisted wedtech and the pipeline and both were 
subjects of mckays criminal investigation 
the 150000 was pooled with meeses money and that of other 
investors by financial manager w franklyn chinn who turned a 
40000 profit for meese on a 55000 investment in just 18 months 
in addition wallach provided meese with free legal counsel and 
introduced meese to chinn in the first place 
it is well documented that mr wallach enjoyed unparalleled 
access to mr meese and saw him frequently throughout the time mr 
meese was in the white house and at the justice department said 
weld

a woman accused of helping hijack an 
airliner to cuba in 1969 worked as a preschool teachers aide for 
the last five years before authorities ended her 19 years as a 
fugitive 
neighbors and her employer said tuesday they were surprised to 
learn that the quiet friendly woman they knew as haziine eytina 
had been using that name and 13 other aliases to keep the fbi off 
her trail 
we were just as shocked as everybody when the fbi was outside 
with guns pointed at everybody said betty bellino director of 
the masterson day care center a few doors away from eytinas 
apartment in a workingclass neighborhood of albany 
rifletoting fbi agents surrounded the home of 39yearold linda 
joyce grinage and her husband lawyer mylo eytina and took her 
into custody monday on a charge of air piracy which carries a 
sentence of 20 years to life in prison 
the glumlooking grinage who wouldnt talk to reporters while 
being led away in handcuffs from brief court appearances monday and 
tuesday had worked for five years as a bus monitor and teachers 
aide for head start a preschool for lowincome youngsters said 
robert burns of the organizations board of directors 
on jan 2 1969 authorities say grinage and her thenhusband 
tyrone ellington austin took a 2yearold boy hostage on an 
eastern airlines flight from new yorks kennedy international 
airport to miami then forced the pilot at gunpoint to fly to 
havana 
the woman who had an infant strapped to her back ran up the 
aisle of the plane screaming followed by austin shouting black 
power havana to terrified passengers and crew according to news 
accounts of the hijacking 
it was unclear how grinage returned to the united states but 
authorities said they lost track of her during the 1970s austin 
died in 1971 from gunshot wounds suffered in a bank robbery attempt 
in new york city 
an anonymous phone caller tipped off authorities a year ago that 
grinage was living in albany and time was taken to nail down the 
case said barbara cottrell an assistant us attorney 
eytina said the charges against his wife were absolute 
poppycock he said his wife had lived and worked in albany for 10 
years although police said they had only traced her albany 
residence to 1983 
i think people should speak highly of me and my wife because 
weve worked diligently to be spoken highly of eytina said 
tuesday after a federal hearing to establish his wifes identity 
was put off for one day 
the couple had six children but one was killed last year in an 
auto accident said wayne alford a spokesman for the fbis albany 
office he said he didnt know how long the couple had been married 
grinage who gave head start officials the name of haziine ey 
tina had caused no problems at work burns said he said officials 
checked child abuse records and references and made an informal 
check with local police 
if we had any indication that this was a hostagetaker we 
wouldnt be sitting here today burns said theres nothing 
significant in her fiveyear history that would indicate there was 
any abuse or violence toward children

a federal judge has ordered the veterans 
administration to refund 3 million to 6 million to veterans in 
washington state who lost their homes in foreclosures on vabacked 
loans 
the order received monday by attorneys in the classaction 
suit also ordered the va to erase at least 45 million in debt the 
agency has tried to collect from more than 3500 veterans who lost 
their homes to foreclosures 
us district judge william dwyer found the va had violated a 
state law governing the amount of money that could be collected 
under a section providing a shortcut for foreclosures 
david leen a lawyer representing five veterans said a similar 
suit is pending in federal court in san francisco and that more 
than 200 million in uncollected debts are at stake in california 
several other states have laws similar to washingtons which 
could mean hundreds of millions of dollars are due veterans who 
lost their homes leen said those states include oregon idaho 
alaska minnesota new mexico montana and texas said lisa 
donaldson a law clerk to leen 
the veterans administration basically wanted their cake and 
they wanted to eat it too plus a second helping leen said 
the washington state law established for lenders a shortcut way 
known as nonjudicial foreclosure to seize a home from a borrower 
who failed to make payments on a home loan 
in the five cases that made up the classaction suit the va 
chose the nonjudicial route to save time and legal fees believing 
it could rely on its own regulations to collect from veterans any 
extra costs it incurred such as legal fees court filing costs and 
losses on resale of the home 
however dwyer said washington state law provided that lenders 
could not collect such extra money from debtors when the 
foreclosure was settled nonjudicially or out of court 
dwyers ruling said the law was meant to protect debtors and 
that it superceded the vas regulations 
henry cohn staff attorney for the va in washington dc said 
tuesday the agency had not decided whether to appeal dwyers 
ruling part of that decision depends on what effect an appeal 
might have on other states he said 
dwyers ruling requires the va to repay veterans money collected 
in foreclosures since 1981 the effective date for the statute of 
limitations leen sued in 1987 
va officials estimated they had collected and would need to 
refund 3 million to 6 million 
last august the va said it was trying to collect more than 45 
million from veterans involved in foreclosures in washington state 
leen said papers the va filed in court now place that figure at 63 
million 
the va stopped trying to collect foreclosure costs in june 1987 
after leen filed the classaction suit the agency said the 
moratorium would last until the suit was settled 
leen filed the classaction lawsuit after winning a similar case 
for rudy vallejo 31 of seattle vallejo a roofer sued the va 
over 8700 in foreclosure costs it sought from him after he lost 
his home in 1982 
this is great vallejo said a lot of people are going to 
get their money back

both presidential candidates will make natural 
gas the key to their energy policies two texans working for the 
campaigns told the gas industry tuesday 
each promised a different menu of tax breaks to be phased out 
if prices rise to help domestic oil and gas drillers 
george bush feels strongly one of the ways we can solve this 
tremendous import problem is by playing the gas card said robert 
mosbacher sr the bush campaign finance chairman and houston 
independent oil and gas producer 
michael dukakis is going to be somebody who is absolutely the 
strongest advocate of natural gas we have ever had in this 
country said john sharp chairman of the candidates texas 
campaign 
mosbacher referred to the growing dependence on imported crude 
oil and refined products now more than 41 percent of consumption 
compared with 35 percent a year ago 
many domestic producers have advocated a tariff on oil imports 
but neither man mentioned such a measure in brief speeches before 
the natural gas roundtable a monthly luncheon sponsored by gas 
trade associations 
despite low prices the country is not consuming all available 
natural gas consumption last year was 25 percent below the 1972 
peak and according to industry estimates at least 10 percent to 15 
percent below what could be easily delivered from existing wells 
bush would use natural gas for transportation both as a vehicle 
fuel in its own right and a source for methanol mosbacher said 
this would help air pollution problems in cities where the strategy 
is followed he said 
his package of tax breaks some of which would restore tax 
treatment of some oil and gas practices to what it was before the 
1986 income tax changes would be phased out as the industry 
recovers and prices rise mosbacher said 
mosbacher said offshore oil drilling which dukakis has said he 
opposes in environmentally sensitive areas and nuclear energy must 
be part of the nations energy future dukakis opposes further 
construction of reactors until waste disposal questions are solved 
and a new design is available 
bush would grant tax credits for exploration expenses and would 
seek certain exemptions from application of the alternative minimum 
tax mosbacher said 
dukakis is exploring a strategic natural gas reserve in the 
form of underground storage dispersed around the country sharp 
said though many gas companies maintain storage a national 
program would help counter fears of a resumption of the shortages 
of the late 1970s he said 
dukakis also is considering a 5 per barrel premium for 
purchases from new domestic wells for the strategic petroleum 
reserve sharp said in some recent years mexico has supplied all 
the oil for the reserve and domestic producers have been reluctant 
to bid

two consumer groups tuesday asked the federal 
communications commission to order the five largest independent 
telephone operator services out of business claiming the companies 
charge excessive rates 
washingtonbased telecommunications research and action center 
and san franciscobased consumer action said their survey shows 
these providers rates are as much as 3 times higher than those of 
the major longdistance companies 
the companies called alternative operator services or aos 
companies provide service to guests in hotels and motels and at 
pay phones as well as at some hospitals and universities which 
receive commissions from the aos 
the companies handle credit card collect and thirdparty billed 
calls routing 0plus calls over lines leased from the major 
longdistance carriers 
david wagenhauser staff attorney for the center said consumers 
need to be protected from the high rates of these companies 
just because these are transient consumers doesnt mean they 
should be moving targets he said at a news conference outside 
the fcc headquarters 
the fcc prompted by a surge in complaints about aos companies 
last spring launched an investigation into the industry which 
began developing about a year and a half ago the agency also 
issued a consumer alert advising callers to ask operators what 
rates they will be charged 
the fcc does not regulate the rates aos companies charge for 
interstate longdistance calls several states however have begun 
considering regulation of the industry for intrastate calls 
the consumer groups criticized the fcc for failing to take 
action against aos providers 
greg vogt chief of the fccs telephone enforcement unit 
defended the agency against the criticism noting its inquiry into 
the industry and its work on behalf of irate consumers seeking 
credit for aos calls 
the fcc also has been meeting with aos companies vogt said 
ive been pleased with the response with the industry admitting 
there are problems and working out solutions 
the consumer groups said the fcc should revoke the operating 
authority of central corp of fort lauderdale fla international 
telecharge inc of dallas national telephone services inc of 
rockville md payline systems inc of portland ore and 
telesphere network inc of oakbrook terrace ill 
a roger pease president of payline systems acknowledged that 
there are some bad apples among aos providers but he said 
this industry has a right to compete 
pease said the consumer groups petition to the fcc is 
unwarranted he said the marketplace will shake out the unethical 
companies and a newly formed trade association for operator service 
providers will help establish a code of ethics for the industry

a minister and his community are taking a 
leap of faith and opening a supermarket 
the rev jerry young noticed that in recent years two chains 
opened and then closed supermarkets in the shopping center down the 
road from his new hope baptist church in northwestern jackson 
it seemed to him that retailers were deserting the area as 
lowincome people moved in forcing residents to leave their 
neighborhood to buy groceries 
so young decided to try to revitalize the shopping center 
he recruited some deacons and other church officials to form 
help inc and sold stock to area residents for 10 a share help 
ltd a partnership formed by community leaders bought the 
shopping center land and buildings church officials did not 
disclose the price 
today the shopping center renamed jackson north plaza 
includes an ice cream parlor and family dollar store a supermarket 
is to open next month it will be called broma a biblical word 
meaning food 
profit was not the primary motive said young but he did his 
homework in hopes of making broma a success the pastor and some 
deacons visited grocery stores around the state to get ideas on how 
to run theirs 
young also hired a former supermarket comanager to run the 
store about 60 other workers mostly teenagers will stock 
shelves and run the cash registers 
young admits the venture is a tremendous step of faith 
were trying to address a need the community will respond to 
that he said 
but the supermarket will have to survive with a handicap it 
will not sell beer its against our doctrine young said

minorityowned broadcast stations provide more 
programming of interest to minorities than nonminorityowned 
stations according to a congressional report 
the report by the congressional research service also found that 
stations owned by women cater to female audiences to a larger 
extent than maleowned stations though not to the degree that 
minorityowned stations program to minority audiences 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house energy and 
commerce telecommunications subcommittee requested the study for 
use in a pending federal court case challenging the 
constitutionality of the fccs policy giving preference to 
minorities and women in awarding broadcast licenses 
the fcc had argued in that case involving a new fm station at 
st simon island ga that its preference policy may be 
unconstitutional because it had no factual evidence that the 
policies contributed to diversity of programming at radio and 
television stations 
however congress last year added a stipulation to the fccs 
budget authorization barring the agency from eliminating the 
preferences 
in releasing the study this week markey said the commission 
wanted empirical evidence and now it has a clear record 
diane killory fcc general counsel said the agency was 
reviewing the study and had no comment on it 
the commission has to decide what position to take she said 
the study analyzed data from an fcc survey of 8720 us radio 
and television stations about 79 percent of the total 
it cautioned about difficulty in determining to what extent a 
stations programming decisions was driven by the racial ethinic 
or female makeup of its audience or resulted from 
minorityownership interests 
however the report concluded there is a strong indication 
that minority and women stationownership results in a greater 
degree of minority programming

palestinian identified as 39yearold mohammed rashid was set for 
aug 2 a judicial spokesman said 
rashid was sentenced july 13 to seven months for entering greece 
on a forged passport greece is considering a us request for his 
extradition on charges of planting a bomb on a pan am jumbo jet 
that killed a japanese teenager and injured 15 in hawaii in 1982 
police theorize that a machine gun and grenade attack against 
the city of poros cruise ship on july 11 was a bungled attempt to 
hijack the ship and force rashids release

defense secretary frank c carlucci said 
tuesday he will move decisively and quickly against defense 
contractors implicated in the ongoing bribery investigation as soon 
as he receives more details from the justice department 
carlucci has already ordered a number of changes in the way the 
pentagon buys weapons and more are likely as a result of the 
investigation he told the house armed services committee 
the justice department probe centers on allegations that defense 
contractors and consultants many of whom are former pentagon 
employes bribed defense department officials for inside details 
about contracts no charges have yet been filed 
carlucci said he had no new details about the twoyearold 
investigation which became public june 14 when subpoenas were 
served around the nation 
at one point carlucci ordered contacts frozen on nine military 
programs because of the possibility that they may have been 
tainted but he rescinded that order 10 days later when a quick 
review showed there were no problems 
carlucci acted after an affidavit for a search warrant was 
unsealed in dallas providing details about the justice department 
investigation 
the justice department has sought to have the affidavits sealed 
but several news organizations have challenged that action 
carlucci promised to move decisively as soon as we receive 
facts from the justice investigation 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the committee noted that 
in the next few weeks it is expected that the united states 
attorney will authorize the release of information on the 
investigation now under court seal 
when that information is available the department of defense 
will have more specifics on contracts or source selections that may 
have been influenced by improper activities he noted 
carlucci repeated his appeals to congress to wait until all the 
facts are made public before ordering sweeping overhauls in the 
complicated pentagon purchasing procedures 
carlucci said he meets daily with a special task force he set up 
last month to track the investigation and recommend changes 
my instructions do not limit the nature of the changes he 
said nothing is sacred neither organizational structure 
regulations nor the need to change existing law 
carlucci cast cold water on one proposal which has surfaced in 
congress holding corporate chief executives responsible for their 
firms actions i think its really impractical he said and 
would probably only result in firms declining to bid for pentagon 
contracts 
illconceived reforms can quickly convince many firms that 
defense business does not provide a sufficient chance for a 
reasonable profit to make it worthwhile or compensate for the 
perennial stops and starts of military business he said 
he said profitandearning ratios in the industry are alrady 
low if we drive them down further industry will lack the capital 
to keep up with modernization 
he also warned against wideranging bans that attempt to close 
the socalled revolving door between government and private 
employment such as working for the pentagon and then going to work 
for a defense contractor 
the problems we face in attracting into government service 
talented individuals from the private sector would be exacerbated 
by the imposition of a broad postgovernment employment bar he 
said

drug and alcohol abuse in the armed forces is 
steadily declining from the alarmingly high levels of 1980 
pentagon officials said tuesday 
we are pleased with this latest decline which can be 
attributed to the message that has been sent out to all our 
military personnel if you want to stay in you have to stay off 
drugs said pentagon spokesman dan howard 
the percentage of military personnel acknowledgng the use of 
illicit drugs in the 30 days prior to their being surveyed dropped 
from 27 percent in 1980 to 19 percent in 1982 9 percent in 1985 
and 55 percent in 1988 
alarm bells rang when the results of the first drug survey were 
released by the pentagon in 1980 comprehensive anonymous surveys 
have been conducted in 1980 1982 1985 and this year 
in the latest survey conducted for the pentagon by the research 
triangle institute the 17213 men and women taking part did not 
put their names on the forms and the exercise was not intended to 
root out abusers those answering the questionaires were chosen to 
provide a representative sampling of those in the armed forces by 
age sex ethnic group rank and branch of service 
military officials also conduct random urine tests of suspected 
drug abusers and those results also show a declining rate of use 
officials say 
the most common illegal drug was marijuana used by 3 percent 
within the previous 30 days down from 7 percent in 1985 and by 7 
percent within the previous 12 months down from 11 percent in 1985 
marijuana use was highest in the lower enlisted ranks with 6 
percent reporting use within the previous 30 days compared to 11 
percent in 1985 and 15 percent within the previous 12 months 
compared to 19 percent in 1985 
drinking also fell in the military according to the survey 
heavy drinking defined as consumption of five or more drinks at 
least once a week was reported by 9 percent down from 12 percent 
in 1985 
and cigarette smoking was down to 57 percent who reported no 
puffing in the previous 30 days compared to 54 percent in 1985 
twentythree percent smoked a pack a day or more compared to 27 
percent in 1985 
the final report with a more complete breakdown of drug 
alcohol and tobacco use was to be complete in december pentagon

israeli troops fatally shot a 13yearold 
palestinian girl and wounded three youths during fighting tuesday 
in occupied gaza city arab hospital officials reported 
the army confirmed the girls death but said it had not 
determined the cause 
defense minister yitzhak rabin toured a detention center in gaza 
and vowed to quell the eightmonth old palestinian uprising in the 
occupied gaza strip and west bank 
we dont accept the present level of violence rabin told 
israel television on the contrary today we have the methods it 
will take some time but we shall succeed he did not elaborate 
the military commander of the west bank lifted a curfew that had 
confined more than 120000 nablus residents to their homes since 
last thursday the army announced 
it said maj gen amram mitzna took the action as a gesture of 
goodwill for the holiday of eid aladha the moslem feast of 
sacrifice 
in gaza 13yearold suheir fuad afana of the beach refugee camp 
was critically wounded when she was hit in the stomach by army 
gunfire said a shifa hospital surgeon the girl died on the 
operating table according to the doctor who spoke on the 
condition he not be identified 
hospital officials said troops also shot and wounded three boys 
ranging in age from 11 to 15 and that all three were hit in the 
lower body 
army officials confirmed the death but said they were unable to 
determine the cause because the family took the girls body from 
the hospital 
they said an army unit sent to break up a riot in the beach camp 
opened fire when palestinians hurled bricks at it from a close 
distance 
the army said soldiers fired at the brick throwers and it was 
checking to determine if the girls death was a result of the 
shooting 
a curfew was imposed on the beach camp home to about 42000 
palestinians 
according to arab reports the clashes started about 6 pm and 
protests continued for several hours after the girl was killed an 
arab reporter said the body was brought back to the camp where 
residents marched shouting allahu akbar or god is great 
the fatality brought to 234 the number of palestinians killed 
since the dec 8 start of the uprising in which four israelis also 
have died 
in the west bank an army spokesman quoted mitzna as saying he 
lifted curfews after arab leaders had appealed to the armys civil 
administration to ease the restrictions 
rightwing israeli settlers who built their west bank homes in 
the heart of the arab city of hebron warned of an escalation of 
violence following a bomb blast earlier in the day 
the settlers told israel army radio they might retaliate for a 
small homemade bomb that caused no injuries when it exploded near 
a playground 
in the west bank town of beit jalla hundreds of palestinians 
mourned a man killed by soldiers sunday 
the mourners draped the dead mans home with outlawed 
palestinian flags and chanted with our spirit and blood we will 
avenge the martyr 
palestinians say jeris kunkar 40 was an innocent passerby who 
was shot to death by troops chasing a stonethrowing group of arab 
youths the army said kunkar who was hit by three bullets was 
shot when a soldier tripped and his gun fired accidentally 
troops stayed out of beit jalla during the service to reduce 
tensions israeli radio said 
in the predominantly arab israeli city of jaffa near tel aviv 
police arrested three arab citizens suspected of destroying 125 
million worth of jewish property through vandalism and arson the 
itim news agency reported 
all of the damage was done during the palestinian uprising and 
the suspects apparently were motivated by sympathies with the arabs 
in the occupied territories itim said

the judiciary committee controlled by democrats said it wanted 
to investigate the departures of burns and weld to determine 
whether operations of the department were affected by meeses legal 
troubles 
weld said that on the morning he and burns resigned the 
criminal division chief told meese 
ed i dont gainsay that there are other reasons why you might 
have wanted to push these two projects a 32 million engine 
contract for wedtech and the iraqi oil pipeline redeem the 
campaign pledge in the south bronx save our cities peace in the 
middle east that is not the question 
the question weld said he conveyed to the attorney general 
is whether mr meese is taking official actions that he knows are 
going to redound to the financial benefit of his friend wallach 
meese did a lot for mr wallach no doubt he was front and 
center for wallach said weld 
mr meese took unusual actions to advance the ends requested 
of him by mr wallach said weld 
in connection with the iraqi oil pipeline project involving 
swiss oilman bruce rappaport mr wallach within two hours of 
being retained by mr rappaport calls up ed meese said weld 
theres no doubt in mr wallachs mind about why he has been 
retained mr meese understands that hes been retained by mr 
rappaport mr wallach says help us with this pipeline meese 
arranged a meeting for wallach with national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane and the attorney general met briefly on the 
pipeline project with thenprime minister shimon peres 
weld also commented on the 150000 payment from rappaport for 
wallachs service which wallach directed be sent directly to chinn 
who in effect combined it with meeses and other investors money 
to obtain hardtoget brandnew stock issues weld said he knew in 
april 1987 that wallach had gone to meese and told the attorney 
general i am worried about how this looks 
according to mckays report issued earlier this month meese 
testified that wallach was somewhat apprehensive that someone 
would think that there was something strange about the payment 
wallach had not reported the 150000 on his tax return a fact 
which mckay said wallach apparently made no mention of to meese 
or rappaport said mckays report weld noted that meese did not 
relay that conversation about the disposition of the 150000 to 
anybody else 
even sen orrin hatch rutah was critical of meeses 
relationship with wallach but he placed the blame all on wallach 
saying i dont think he was a good friend of meese hatch 
said i dont think there is a dishonest bone in his body he was 
done in by his friends 
when hatch challenged burns assertion that morale was low in 
the department because of mckays investigation of meese burns 
replied there is no way one can draw down the shade 
as time went on it became apparent to me that morale at the 
department of justice was deteriorating rapidly burns said in 
his prepared testimony i heard complaints everywhere i heard 
stories of employees being embarrassed and ridiculed one employee 
had to leave a party of friends when the personal abuse became 
intolerable graffiti containing obscenities appeared in the very 
halls of the justice department one justice department employee 
was upbraided by a desk clerk at a hotel on checking in because he 
was associated with the meese justice department 
i say big deal sen gordon humphrey rnh responded 
humphrey dismissed the abuse at a party and being upbraided by a 
desk clerk as the kind of criticism that is leveled in a time of 
great public controversy 
asked by sen patrick leahy dvt what they would have done 
had they come under criminal investigation burns said he would 
have seriously considered stepping aside while weld said have 
seriously thought about the leave of absence route 
burns said he decided last november that he would leave in 
january and weld said the issue first came up in a discussion 
between the two men in december 
he was more concerned than i at the outset about problems 
the probe of meese was causing the justice department weld said 
in the end i passed burns on the outside lane in terms of 
concern leading to a decision to resign 
weld said he discussed resignation with solicitor general 
charles fried the departments no 4 official the day before 
welds departure weld agreed with a characterization by humphrey

four indian opposition parties announced 
tuesday they will merge to challenge prime minister rajiv gandhis 
governing congress party 
the announcement was made by vp singh a former defense 
minister and leader of the jan morcha or the peoples forum 
singh said the new party would spare no efforts to fulfill 
the aspirations of the people of india who are today groaning 
under the corrupt and authoritarian rule of the congress 
singh a former gandhi ally turned foe defeated the congress 
party candidate for a seat in parliament in a june byelection in 
uttar pradesh state 
the united opposition party to be called the samajvadi janata 
dal or socialist peoples party will be formed by aug 15 singh 
said the decision came after meetings with leaders from singhs 
party the janata party the lok dal and the congresss party the 
congresss is a splinter group of gandhis party 
the merger will shake these gentlemen a bit these congress 
wallahs said veteran opposition leader biju patnaik wallah 
is hindi for man 
the new party is expected to field candidates in parliamentary 
elections to take place before january 1990 
major opposition parties merged into the janata party to defeat 
the congress in general elections in 1977 but the government 
served only two years of its fiveyear term 
the parliament dissolved in 1979 after the coalition split and 
bickered over the choice for prime minister 
patnaik said the leadership of the new party has not been 
decided 
the four parties control only two of indias 25 state assemblies 
northern haryana and southern karnataka and their members hold 
just 21 seats in the 544member lawmaking lower house of 
parliament 
gandhis congress party holds more than 400 seats in the lower 
house but its fortunes have been declining since it swept to 
victory in the 1984 general elections 
the congress party has lost 10 of 14 state elections held since 
then it also lost four of the seven parliament seats in the 
byelections 
much of the congress partys decline has been blamed on 
allegations of inefficiency and corruption in government 
news media and opposition politicans have alleged that kickbacks 
were paid on major defense contracts and that some money may have 
gone to gandhi allies the congress party has denied that

bishop robinson the secretary of public safety who is heading 
the investigation of the riot said officials identified the 
inmates who took part and isolated them in the south wing of the 
downtown maximumsecurity prison 
there is no indication that inmates had planned the uprising 
robinson said 
inmates remained locked in their cells one day after prisoners 
attacked guards within a recreation yard and a crisis clinic and a 
minor fire was set in the clinic no one escaped during mondays 
riot and authorities restored order in about an hour

regular meeting with wardens to discuss grievances gov william 
donald schaefer said 
the warden said he was not able to give them possibly the 
answers that they wanted schaefer said 
prison officials said they did not know what caused the 
violence though 
the investigation isnt complete enough to be specific as to 
who the primary instigators were ms marable said 
officials are interviewing guards and inmates she said 
the prison the nations second oldest was built in 1811 and is 
designed to hold 700 to 800 inmates it has been chronically 
overcrowded though and held 1270 on monday

hawamda or seven other people arrested in the case last week

democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis slammed george 
bush on tuesday for taking a donothing approach to attorney 
general edwin meeses legal difficulties bush said if he wins the 
white house he will hold officials to an exacting code of 
conduct 
dukakis who formally won the democratic presidential nomination 
last week also criticized bush for not trying to block the 
armsforhostages deal at the center of the irancontra affair 
bush who receives the gop nomination at the republican national 
convention next month said that civil penalties as well as 
criminal sanctions should be used to punish ethical violations by 
government officials he said conflict of interest laws should be 
broadened to include congress departing from reagan administration 
policies bush also endorsed the use of independent counsels to 
investigate wrongdoing 
dukakis boosted by the positive reaction from the democratic 
national convention led bush by 17 points in the latest gallup 
poll of 1001 registered voters conducted friday through saturday 
the survey reported tuesday by radio station weei in boston 
found dukakis with 54 percent support to 37 percent for bush the 
poll reflected the frequent bounce enjoyed by presidential 
candidates after their nominating conventions 
nine percent were undecided in the survey which had a margin of 
error of 4 percent 
the two wouldbe presidents debated ethics long distance as the 
current occupant of the white house told reporters that the 
rhetoric at last weeks democratic national convention got my 
irish up 
to hear the opposition talk you would think growth in our 
economy had come to a dead halt said president reagan 
republicans were at work readying the superdome for next months 
national convention in new orleans while atlanta was settling back 
to normal after last weeks invasion of the democrats 
security officials said the lost and found bins in the 
democratic convention city were overflowing with items such as a 
womans silk suit eyeglasses keys watches and wallets they said 
anything unclaimed after 90 days would be turned over to the 
salvation army 
the federal election commission voted to release 46 million in 
federal campaign funds that dukakis is entitled to as the 
democratic nominee the 60 vote came despite objections from a 
republican group complaining about lloyd bentsens dual campaigns 
as dukakis vice presidential running mate and as a senator seeking 
reelection from texas 
bentsen tended to his senate duties chairing a meeting of the 
finance committee at which legislation was approved to correct 
errors in the landmark 1986 tax overhaul bill 
bush his nomination secure for early next month proposed 
rewriting conflict of interest rules that govern federal employees 
to cover a wider variety of misconduct and he said members of 
congress should be covered by the law 
those who take on the peoples trust must hold themselves to 
an exacting code of conduct we can expect and indeed tolerate 
nothing less from the people who work for the government he said 
in a speech before congressional interns at the library of congress 
in washington 
he said he would establish a new office senior counselor to the 
president whose first responsibility would be ethics issues 
bush complained that the present system of federal ethics law 
is a confused quiltwork of executive policy statements 
administrative regulations criminal laws indeed virtually every 
agency of government issues its own set of standards of conduct 
it was the second time in several days that bush has tried to 
ease a campaign problem 
democrats have long campaigned against the alleged sleaze of 
the reagan administration and the vice presidents ethics speech 
seemed designed to reassure the voters on that score over the 
weekend in a proposal widely viewed as an attempt to increase his 
appeal to female voters he called for giving tax breaks to 
lowincome mothers to help pay for child care 
he said he didnt intend to discuss ethical questions about 
meese 
but dukakis did 
at a news conference in boston he said the american people 
are embarrassed and ashamed by some of the things that they see 
in the reagan administration including the handling of misconduct 
allegations against meese 
dukakis said reagan should have asked for meeses resignation 
and bush should have demanded his ouster immediately after two 
former justice department officials told the president and vice 
president in april that they believed meese had violated the law 
i hope i never have a briefing like the one mr burns and mr 
weld gave the vice president three months ago dukakis said 
but if i do i wont sit there and do nothing 
dukakis referred to former deputy attorney general arnold burns 
and assistant attorney general william weld who told congress 
earlier in the day they briefed reagan and bush in april 
weld testified that he thought meese had probably committed 
felonies while in office although independent counsel james mckay 
said earlier this month he would not seek a criminal indictment 
meese contending the mckay report vindicated him has announced 
plans to resign 
on another topic dukakis denied reports that he plans to resign 
as massachusetts governor to pursue his quest for the white house 
meanwhile jesse jackson who contested the democratic 
nomination until last week met with aides in chicago to map out 
the next phase of his involvement in the campaign 
fundamentally it was about pulling everyone together to kind 
of wrap up the atlanta convention to sort things out to lay out 
our basic plan and the various tracks said jacksons longtime 
aide frank watkins 
watkins said the transition of some jackson aides to the dukakis 
campaign was discussed but said no specifics about jacksons role 
had yet been decided

political jockeying over where to locate a new 
defense reactor to produce raw materials for nuclear weapons 
spilled into the open tueday at a senate subcommittee hearing 
energy department officials testifying before the senate 
appropriations committes energy and water development subcommittee 
offered no clues as to what the department will recommend but 
various members of the committee tried to put their own spin on 
what an advisory panels report had found 
we should not gamble with the nations security and go with an 
unproven technology said sen ernest hollings dsc adding 
that the savannah river complex in his state long had been involved 
in producing materials for nuclear weapons 
hollings facetiously suggested that the ideal solution was to 
build two new production reactors at savannah river one in idaho 
and convert a mothballed plant at the hanford nuclear reservation 
in washington state 
but i question whether we have the money hollings said 
hollings took note of the split in the washington state 
congressional delegation over whether to convert the mothballed 
plant 
one senator says we should and another says we shouldnt 
hollings said 
washington republican sen dan evans supports the conversion 
proposal and washington democratic sen brock adams opposes it 
neither are members of the appropriations committee 
doe is scheduled to unveil by the end of the month its 
recommendation on where to locate the new production reactor and 
what technology to use 
possible sites for the multibilliondollar reactor which would 
produce tritium include the savannah river complex near aiken 
sc the idaho national engineering laboratory near idaho falls 
and the hanford reservation in southcentral washington state 
a report from an energy department advisory panel while making 
no recommendations concluded that construction of a new 
heavywater reactor at savannah river offered the best chance 
of ensuring a steady supply of tritium a key radioactive 
ingredient in nuclear weapons 
the report however did not completely rule out any of the 
other options including converting a mothballed washington public 
power supply system nuclear plant at the hanford reservation 
sen james mcclure ridaho said he had no objection to 
building a new production reactor at savannah river but urged that 
at least one more be built at a different location to avoid putting 
all our eggs in one basket 
mcclure said building only one reactor at one site could expose 
our national security unecessarily to events that can bring us 
to our knees in terms of nuclear deterrence capabilities 
whether its an act of god a terrorist attack an unfortuante 
safety concern or an unanticipated design flaw we could find 
ourselves without any production capability if we select only one 
site or one technology 
mcclure said his chief concern was national security and if a 
site other than idaho was selected it would be fine with me 
my goal isnt simply to get a reactor built in idaho 
oregon republican sen mark hatfield who opposes conversion of 
the nuclear plant at hanford said he thought conversion would 
violate nuclear nonproliferation laws as it would involve using a 
civilian reactor for defense purposes 
im deeply concerned about the implications hatfield said 
the nations three existing defense production reactors located 
at savannah river have been operating at less than 50 percent of 
full power because of safety concerns

there are significant problems and 
limitations in the pentagons fledgling trybeforeyoubuy 
program as evidenced by flawed planning and testing of the navys 
aegis air defense system and five other major weapons the general 
accounting office said tuesday 
the fiveyearold program ordered by congress still is not 
adequate to assess whether the weapons will work in combat the 
congressional watchdog agency reported 
the gao review centered on the pentagons office of operational 
test and evaluation which is headed by jack krings a former 
lobbyist for mcdonnell douglas it was the second time in two years 
the gao had criticized the operation of the office 
congress created the office in 1983 as part of an effort to do a 
more realistic job of testing weapons the legislation was 
triggered by the discovery of serious flaws in several major 
weapons systems after they were well into development 
among those weapons were the armys bradley fighting vehicle 
which has been plagued with problems and the armys sergeant york 
gun which was canceled because of poor performance but not until 
more than 15 billion had been spent on it 
the gao review looked at the testing of six new major weapons 
including the navys aegis air defense the sophisticated tracking 
system that was involved in the july 3 shootdown by the navy 
cruiser vincennes of an iranian jetliner in the persian gulf the 
pentagon says the shootdown was a case of mistaken identity 
the other weapons reviewed by the gao included the armys aquila 
drone plane the armys helicopter improvement program navy 
tomahawk conventional cruise missile the newest targeting system 
for the air force maverick missile and the air force lantirn 
system for nighttime targeting 
we found significant problems and limitations in the planning 
execution realism analysis and service test agency reporting of 
the six programs the gao said 
some of these problems are limitations were unavoidable due to 
time resource or safety constraints although numerous others were 
not it said 
the report was released by the congressional military reform 
caucus a group of 140 legislators created to seek pentagon 
management changes 
members of the caucus told a news conference that krings should 
quit its time for mr krings to resign said rep denny 
smith rore the sooner the better 
at the pentagon spokesman dan howard said i havent seen the 
report it is my understanding that gao was instructed not to 
contact dod for its views on the matter so we will have to wait 
and see 
i have a comment in general terms howard added i have 
seen several of these stories recently put out by certain 
congressmen the difficulty is that those who do not wish to 
inform themselves who very carefully guard their ignorance 
obviously are not going to learn about the details of our testing 
programs 
the stories attacking the aegis system that i saw in the press 
by and large were fouryearold stories they were based on an 
earlier phase of the aegis testing program in 1983 and subsequent 
to those tests and those reports an additional 30 million worth 
of testing was done on aegis and it performed magnificently in 
those tests 
other pentagon comment came from spokeswoman jan bodanyi who 
said this attack on mr krings is inappropriate and unjustified 
we feel that mr krings is successfully carrying out the 
responsibilities of his office 
rep charles bennett dfla said we need a backtobasics 
approach to weapons testing approving a weapon that doesnt work 
is like graduating a high school student who cant read its easy 
but it hurts everybody 
congress had ordered that testing be as realistic and close to 
combattype conditions as possible but that wasnt done the gao 
said 
for example the prevailing problem for operational users was 
that they were selected from an operator pool that was atypically 
high in skill or experience level that is socalled golden 
crews the review said 
another example cited was the fact that in some case 
contractors were permitted to help military crews maintain the 
weapons although that contractor support would not be available 
in the field it said 
when the test data was available it was often wrongly 
interpreted the gao said 
in five of six cases we found problems with the various 
assumptions underlying the analyses of the test data it said 
in at least two cases such assumptions led to overly optimistic 
estimates of the systems capability one of which was contracted 
by available data 
there were other questionable practices in interpreting data 
and their impact was significant the gao said they 
frequently allowed a system to appear to meet its performance 
requirements 
among the flaws cited by the report was the fact that crews used 
for both the army helicopter tests and maverick tests were 
specifically trained for the tests rather than being normal crews 
and tests of the tomahawk occurred only over pretested fight 
routes

a teenager fighting the most malignant type 
of brain tumor is being treated with a relatively new technique 
that involves inserting tubes and radioactive beads into his head 
michael anderson 18 was a week away from graduating from 
wolbach high school this spring when he suffered a seizure doctors 
found he had a brain tumor just under 2 inches in diameter 
dr kevin shewe a radiation oncologist at omahas clarkson 
hospital said standard therapy for the fastgrowing tumor is 
surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy but the average 
patient survives only 40 to 50 weeks 
about 20 percent of patients live two years none has survived 
five 
the new procedure combines surgery chemotherapy and external 
and internal radiation and doctors hope it will increase 
andersons survival rate 
preliminary tests on the newer treatment indicated the median 
survival time for patients has been extended to 87 weeks shewe 
said 
the treatment is a fivestep process shewe said 
the first involves completing in three weeks rather than six the 
external radiation given before surgery the compact treatment time 
may increase the effectiveness shewe said the second step 
chemotherapy takes place concurrently the doctor said 
step three is surgery to remove the tumor 
step four for anderson began when tiny radioactive beads were 
inserted through his scalp and into the center and around the tumor 
site to attack any remaining tumor cells doctors said 
the procedure utilizes sophisticated imaging equipment that 
shows crosssections of the brain and a computer that helps plot 
the precise location of the tumor site 
neurosurgeon john greene drilled seven tiny holes in the skull 
and inserted seven tubes or catheters each less than a tenth of 
an inch in diameter each of the tubes was glued to a tiny button 
sewn to the scalp to hold it in place 
a brain scan ensured the catheters were correctly positioned 
and shewe then inserted the radioactive beads the radioactive 
materials remain at the tumor site for 96 hours before being 
removed 
anderson is scheduled to go home this week hell return for 
chemotherapy once every six weeks for a year the fifth step in the 
therapy 
use of the implant began in 1977 in 1980 doctors first used 
the insertable catheter tubes with removable caps 
and in 1983 at the university of california at san francisco 
doctors began to use the implants to treat patients with socalled 
highgrade tumors

weary negotiators went home to sleep tuesday 
after 20 hours of talks and a mediators deadline failed to produce 
a settlement in the writers guild strike that has crippled 
hollywood 
representatives of the writers guild of america and the alliance 
of motion picture and television producers broke off talks about 11 
am tuesday the talks which featured two federal mediators had 
begun at 3 pm the day before 
one of the mediators floyd wood district director for the 
federal mediation and conciliation service said no new sessions 
were scheduled he declined to discuss what had happened in the 
talks or characterize them in any way 
on monday wood had set a midnight deadline for an end to the 
talks but declined to say what he would do if the no settlement 
was reached by that time when the hour came he extended the 
deadline 
the series of talks that began saturday were the first between 
full bargaining teams for both sides in a month 
del reisman cochairman of the wgas negotiating committee 
said tuesday that he was neither discouraged nor encouraged by 
the contract talks the wga strike which began march 7 is now 
entering its 21st week 
both sides in the strike have been asked by a federal mediator 
to maintain a news blackout and detailed information about the 
bargaining sessions has been scant 
but a source familiar with the talks who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said there were some signs of progress tuesday the 
source indicated that the wga and the producers had begun to 
address in earnest the divisive issue of television residual 
payments 
throughout the protracted strike which has led to sweeping 
layoffs in hollywood the writers and the producers have disagreed 
sharply over payments for onehour television shows rebroadcast 
domestically and all television programs rebroadcast overseas 
brian walton executive director of wga west said the talks had 
left him drained and that he was going home to sleep 
the union said it was proceeding with plans to picket the 
offices of television producer aaron spelling and warner bros and 
columbia studios wednesday 
meanwhile a collection of some of hollywoods top writers are 
taking out fullpage advertisements in wednesdays issues of 
entertainment industry newspapers in a show of support for guild 
leaders 
the advertisement is signed by 150 writers directors and 
producers including makers of the television shows family 
ties cheers and thirtysomething and the films down 
and out in beverly hills and sunset boulevard 
it is being published in response to actions by a group of 
dissident writers who are threatening to resign from the wga if the 
strike is not ended immediately 
i signed the ad because i was afraid that the producers 
alliance might be waiting to see what the fallout would be who 
would break ranks said allan burns a creator of the mary 
tyler moore show the alliance shouldnt count on anyone 
breaking ranks 
lionel chetwynd a spokesman for the dissident group the 
writers coalition dismissed the advertisement tuesday and he said 
his group feared that the recess of negotiations may mean that 
contract talks have collapsed 
were very pessimistic chetwynd said we are horrified 
that after all these talks they cant close a deal

the house agreed on tuesday to extend a law 
that proponents say has reversed a severe decline in atlantic 
striped bass over a 12state region 
rep gerry e studds dmass chairman of the house merchant 
marine and fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife said 
the striped bass is making a strong comeback because of the 
1984 law 
the studds legislation which passed the house on a voice vote 
would extend the atlantic striped bass conservation act and an 
emergency striped base study for three more years 
there are encouraging signs in some areas that the stocks may 
be on the road to recovery but the act must be reauthorized to 
assure that the recovery continues said rep walter b jones 
dnc chairman of the house merchant marine and fisheries 
committee 
the law allows the 12 atlantic coast states from maine to north 
carolina plus the district of columbia to create and monitor 
their own striped bass conservation programs but the states must 
comply with guidelines set by the atlantic states marine fisheries 
commission 
under the statute the federal government can declare a 
moratorium on all striped bass fishing in states that do not 
comply the states have complied and no moratorium has been 
declared 
dramatic declines in striped bass were seen in the late 1970s 
spurring the original congressional action 
the reagan administration supports extension of the conservation 
act but not the striped bass study the legislation would cost an 
estimated 5 million through fiscal year 1991 
a similar measure is pending in the senate environment 
subcommittee on environmental protection 
the house also passed on a voice vote another committee bill 
that would make several changes to the national marine sanctuaries 
program the measure by rep mike lowry dwash chairman of the 
oceanography subcommittee would speed up the governments 
procedures for designating new sites 
only seven us coastal areas have received the designation 
and the accompanying special federal protections since the law 
was enacted 1972

mine workers and the government held 
negotiations tuesday aimed at ending a nationwide strike affecting 
perus silver production officials said no progress was 
immediately reported 
the national federation of mine metal and steel workers and the 
labor ministry said the first negotiations since the strike began 
july 18 were held monday and tuesday 
the federation which claims to represent 75 percent of perus 
estimated 80000 to 100000 mine workers said strikers are 
demanding that all labor contracts for individual unions be 
negotiated jointly 
the federation said more than 90 percent of the mining industry 
has been paralyzed by the strike industry analysts who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the figure was closer to 60 percent 
peru is the worlds second leading producer of silver behind 
mexico and a major source of copper lead zinc and gold mining 
traditionally accounts for half of perus exports 
the government said last week it would not sign new sales 
contracts for statecontrolled silver about 42 percent of the 
nations annual output of 60 million ounces in an effort to boost 
its dwindling foreign reserves 
perus decision to boost its dwindling reserves is part of an 
effort to secure credits to combat consumer shortages and help the 
economy by importing food and capital goods

a property tax bill completed its stormy passage 
through parliament tuesday when the house of lords backed down from 
threats to amend it 
the house of lords the unelected upper chamber of parliament 
decided without a vote to not act on some memberss demands that 
changes be made in the measure opponents of the bill said the 
proposed flatrate community tax is unfair to the poor 
the government themselves are likely to come to regret todays 
decision said lord allen of abbeydale 
the bill is expected to be approved later this week by queen 
elizabeth ii 
prime minister margaret thatcher pledged in the 1987 election 
campaign to revise the system of local property taxes known as the 
rates that help finance local governments 
advocates of the new plan said the old rates system was unfair 
because the burden was not shared equally falling on local 
businesses and some householders while other people paid nothing 
the new measure will replace the rates with a flatrate system 
of payments mrs thatchers conservative party government calls 
the new system a community charge to be paid by almost everyone 
critics said it will especially hurt the poor because unlike a 
graduated income tax it takes no account of a persons ability to 
pay 
the house of lords withdrew its challenge to the measure in the 
face of a constitutional clash with the elected house of commons 
the commons approved the proposal in april 
the house of lords has no power to interfere with the 
governments taxation legislation but can delay enactment of other 
laws for up to 13 months 
members of the house of lords who wanted to ammend the tax 
measure said the bill did not come under the house of commons 
financial privilege because it affected local government 
though we should respect commons financial privilege with the 
greatest care we should also respect our own privileges and 
feelings and should not allow them to be eroded or diminished 
said lord henderson of brompton during the debate that lasted 
nearly three hours 
but lord hailsham said the house of commons always had claimed 
privileges when introducing general taxes it is the duty of any 
government minister to insist on privilege and give no further 
reasons for rejecting amendments by the house of lords he said

deposed philippines president ferdinand marcos 
on tuesday denied a newspaper report that he offered the philippine 
government 5 billion to allow him to return to his homeland 
without fear of criminal prosecution 
my going home depends on principle not cash marcos said 
yes negotiations are going on as they have for the past several 
months but money is not involved 
later through a spokesman marcos indicated he wouldnt discuss 
details of the negotiations on the advice of his attorney he said 
he had records that could prove he didnt offer any money 
a professor quoted in the story published by the los angeles 
times on tuesday also said it was inaccurate 
a james gregor political science professor and philippines 
expert at the university of california at berkeley was quoted by 
the times as saying marcos offered to return 5 billion to the 
philippines support president corazon aquino and stay out of 
politics to ensure his return to his home province of ilocos norte 
i heard that figure second or thirdhand during a meeting 
with a philippine official gregor said i have no direct 
knowledge of money being offered by anyone i have heard figures 
but indirectly ranging from 250 million to 20 billion 
tom mccarthy the night news editor in the times washington 
bureau who edited the story stood by the report 
it accurately reflects what we were told by him gregor and 
other sources he said 
marcos has been living in hawaii since he was deposed in 
february 1986 the philippines is trying to recoup billions of 
dollars marcos allegedly siphoned out of the country during his 
reign 
gregor said tuesday he met in june in washington with members of 
congress as well as philippine ambassador emmanuel pelaez to 
discuss ways to negotiate marcos return it was during a meeting 
that included pelaez that money was mentioned he said 
gregor said he advised us and philippine officials against 
indicting marcos in the united states because it would set a 
dangerous precedent for future political exiles instead he 
suggested that marcos be allowed to return to his homeland as long 
as he promised he and his family would stay out of politics 
pelaez sent the suggestion to mrs aquino even though he favors 
prosecuting marcos for allegedly taking funds from the philippines 
gregor said 
gregor said he saw one document during the negotiations that was 
addressed to mrs aquino and signed by marcos he said it did not 
mention any payment 
a state department spokesman said tuesday the united states was 
not involved in the negotiations but that marcos would have to get 
permission to return from the philippine government before the 
united states would let him leave hawaii

the un secretarygeneral met twice with 
irans foreign minister tuesday in the first formal round of talks 
to put a ceasefire into effect in the 8yearold iraniraq war 
ali akbar velayati said after the first afternoon meeting with 
un chief javier perez de cuellar that the talks were 
constructive and fruitful and covered the steps to carry out a 
truce and peace plan 
perez de cuellar has said he hopes next week he can announce the 
dates for a ceasefire 
we are trying to set a timetable for the implementation plan 
of the secretarygeneral and we also talked about the recent 
escalation of the war on our border with the iraqis velayati 
told reporters at the end of second talks tuesday night 
we said to the secretarygeneral that if they continue their 
attack we will give them a lesson that they wont forget 
velayati said 
perez de cuellar is to hold separate talks with velayati and 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz on wednesday the un chief said 
he dispensed with formalities and begin intensive peace talks 
tuesday one day ahead of schedule because the iranian envoy 
already had arrived 
velayati came to new york monday and aziz arrived tuesday aziz 
did not make an arrival statement 
before meeting with perez de cuellar velayati told reporters 
tuesday that iraq was trying to sabotage the peace process by 
invading iran and using chemical wapons on a large scale 
the war is still going on very seriously he said despite 
iraqs statements it was withdrawing from iranian territory 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman urged 
iran and iraq to exercise maximum restraint saying continuation 
of fighting does nothing to enhance the common goal of a negotiated 
settlement 
velayati and perez de cuellar discussed implementation of 
security council resolution 598 which was passed unanimously on 
july 20 1987 and which demands an immediate ceasefire in the 
persian gulf conflict it also calls for withdrawal to recognized 
borders prisoner exchange peace negotiations and an investigation 
to determine which side started the war 
iraq quickly accepted the resolution last year on condition iran 
do the same but iran waited until last week july 18 before 
announcing its acceptance 
although iraq asked for direct talks with iran in new york 
perez de cuellar said he would not try to compel the two sides to 
meet face to face initially 
while talks were under way in new york two un teams were at 
work in tehran the iranian capital one was laboring over truce 
details and the other was inquiring into the prisonersofwar 
situation 
the ceasefire would be monitored and supervised by about 250 
un peacekeeping troops 
vernon a walters the us ambassador to the united nations 
said tuesday on the cbs television program this morning that it 
would be possible to work out a ceasefire between iran and iraq in 
the next two months 
un officials have said the un budget crisis will make it 
hard perhaps impossible to finance the peacekeeping force unless 
the united states and other debtors pay their arrears 
such a force could cost 20 million to 30 million a year 
according to early estimates 
francoic giuliani spokesman for the secretarygeneral told 
reporters tuesday the organization is expected to run out of 
operating funds at the end of october 
washington has been withholding full dues payments to demand 
un spending reforms

north korea in a letter released 
tuesday said it would consider participating in the olympic games 
in seoul but repeated its demand to be a cohost of the event that 
begins in september 
the letter which came as a suprise to south korean leaders 
linked negotiations on the olympics with an earlier north korean 
proposal that the two countries hold parliamentary talks on a 
nonaggression pact 
it said in part we propose with courtesy that the scheduled 
northsouth joint parliamentary conference be held within august at 
the latest before the opening of the olympics and discuss as an 
urgent agenda such issues as your request for our participation in 
the olympics and our proposal for its cohosting 
there was no immediate comment from the south korean government 
which has not yet responded to the earlier north korean letter 
calling for parliamentary talks 
the peninsula was divided into communist north korea and 
capitalist south korea in 1945 at the end of world war ii they 
fought a war in 195053 and remain enemies 
the olympic games are to be held sept 17oct 2 in seoul 
when north koreas demand that it be a cohost of the games was 
rejected it announced a boycott 
south korea and the international olympic committee have said 
some events could be held in the north but that the games are 
awarded to a single host city and not to countries 
the committee has said north korea could stage archery table 
tennis womens volleyball preliminary soccer games and a cycling 
road race north korea insisted on more including its own opening 
and closing ceremonies in pyongyang the capital and a share of 
television revenue 
seoul olympic officials have said the invitation to north korea 
to participate would remain open until the last possible minute in 
hopes of promoting northsouth reconciliation 
aides to kim chaesun speaker of south koreas national 
assembly said the new letter was from yang hyong sop chairman of 
north koreas supreme peoples assembly it was received at the 
border truce village of panmunjom 
south koreas political leaders had been trying to resolve 
differences before sending a unified response to north koreas 
earlier letter calling for talks on a nonaggression conference 
many have been reluctant to agree to fullscale parliamentary 
talks saying preliminary negotiations are needed 
north korea is one of six countries that have not accepted 
invitations to the olympics the others are cuba ethiopia 
albania nicaragua and the seychelles 
a record 12000 athletes from 161 nations are expected to

official tass news agency 
tass said cartledge noted that trade and economic ties between 
london and moscow had been broadening during his stay in the soviet 
union and relations had improved 
from the point of view of the soviet side too our relations 
have grown richer gromyko said never before in the postwar 
period have they been at such a level as now but even this level 
can and should be raised further 
gromyko who served as foreign minister for 28 years said 
differences remained between the countries in the first place over 
nuclear weapons 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev has proposed a threestage 
plan to scrap all nuclear arms by the year 2000 but britains 
prime minister margaret thatcher credits the weapons with helping 
deter war between east and west since the end of world war ii 
britain a member of nato has its own nuclear arms 
being realists we do not close our eyes to existing 
disagreements first of all those concerning nuclear weapons 
gromyko said at the same time and this is confirmed by the 
experience of our relations sovietbritish cooperation in arms 
reduction is not only possible but absolutely essential 
he said british support played a positive role in bringing 
about the superpower treaty signed in december that bans all 
medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles 
cartledge arrived in moscow as ambassador in july 1985 four 
months after gorbachev became communist party chief tass said 
cartledge said he was greatly impressed by the changes under way 
in soviet society especially debureacratization as a part of 
gorbachevs reform drive 
i like your word debureaucratization although we dont use

president jose sarney said late 
tuesday that approval of a proposed new constitution could make 
brazil ungovernable spurring inflation and slashing economic 
growth 
there is no way to estimate the economic social and political 
impact of many of the articles sarney said in an address on 
national television if passed as it is the charter will cause 
economic and fiscal chaos and brazilians will pay the costs 
the broadcast was sarneys lastditch attempt to remove several 
proposals from the new document that will replace a 1969 
constitution handed down by military generals 
legislators doubling as a consituent assembly have been working 
on the document for 18 months and final voting on the draft began 
tuesday 
the document includes proposal to limit annual interest rates to 
12 percent to give brazilians control of all mining operations to 
cut the voting age from 18 to 16 and to grant the unrestricted 
right to strike and a sixhour work day 
all are clauses sarney would like to defeat 
he estimated the governments additional costs imposed by 
clauses in the new document would be 95 billion inflation now is 
23 percent monthly the foreign debt 121 billion and unemployment 
about 25 percent 
i am worried the constitution could turn this country 
ungovernable sarney said we dont have the funds to implement 
all the provisions people would be led to think were their due 
sarney called a clause that would grant an amnesty to thousands 
of debtors clearly unjust 
many small businessmen sweated to pay their debts he said 
the constitution will signal the type of country we will 
become sarney said as the constitution stands brazil 
will become a country that could have been but wasnt a country 
without a future 
the second round of voting is expected to last through september 
sarney a 57yearold provincial politician and poet from the 
poor northeastern state of maranhao came to power in march 1985 as 
the vice president for the popular statesman tancredo neves who 
died before taking office 
they were elected in indirect electoral college voting called by 
the military which put sarney on the neves ticket the vote was to 
pave the way for civilian government after 21 years of military 
rule

cardinal john oconnor of new york ended 
a pilgrimage across ireland tuesday saying he will ask president 
reagan to grant amnesty for irish and other illegal aliens in the 
united states 
oconnor said he would ask reagan next week very formally and 
with as much conviction as i can muster for an executive order 
granting amnesty 
our society and economy could absorb a lot more immigrants 
from ireland from latin american and many other countries he 
said 
the new york archbishops sixday pilgrimage was dedicated 
mainly to praying for peace and reconciliation in northern ireland 
but in the irish republic a far more pressing concern is irish 
citizens living illegally in the united states 
social service agencies estimate the number of illegal irish at 
between 125000 to 175000 with more than twothirds of them in 
the new york area 
preaching at st marys cathedral in his last public mass in 
ireland oconnor lamented the indignity of having sons and 
daughters have to leave for another land because their land offers 
them no opportunity 
many irishamericans even those who like oconnor were born 
in the united states are familiar with the hardship of 
immigration and feel today that they are living almost as 
exiles he said 
the roman catholic cardinal a former naval chaplain who has had 
close contact with the reagan administration told reporters after 
the mass that he hoped a presidential amnesty order would cover not 
only undocumented immigrants from ireland but a lot of others who 
were not included in that window of opportunity 
he was referring to the immigration and naturalization services 
amnesty program under which those who had lived and worked 
continuously in the united states since 1982 could apply for legal 
residency he said illegal irish immigrants in particular need an 
executive order because most arrived in the united states after 
1982 as irelands economy faltered 
the pilgrimage took the cardinal new york mayor edward i koch 
and about 500 other people from the shrine of our lady of knock in 
the wild boglands of west ireland to st peters cathedral in the 
urban battlefields of west belfast to st marys a 613yearold 
domed temple in the midst of busy dublin koch flew back to new 
york on tuesday

the spokesman for ferdinand marcos said the 
former philippine leader and his wife imelda were whisked from 
their mansion tuesday after security guards said that armed men 
cruised past the house 
the marcoses were driven to an undisclosed location said 
spokesman gemmo trinidad 
a honolulu police department dispatcher said the incident was 
not reported on police logs but arturo aruiza another marcos 
aide said the police department had been requested tuesday to 
assign more frequent patrols to the area 
trinidad said three cars drove slowly past the house at about 
530 am and aroundtheclock security guards stationed at the 
gate of the hillside home thought they saw guns sticking out the 
car windows 
the unarmed security guards who were on foot chased the cars 
but could not get a good description because it was still dark 
trinidad said no shots were fired and no one was injured 
the marcoses were awakened a short time later and went to a 
friends house i cant say where but theyre still on oahu and 
theyll come back as soon as its safe trinidad said 
aruiza said he expected the marcoses to be back home wednesday 
marcos and his wife imelda have lived in honolulus swank 
makiki heights district since he was ousted in a popular uprising 
in february 1986 that swept president corazon aquino to power 
aruiza said the marcos household had been warned tuesday morning 
by loyalists in manila of a rumored assassination plot 
were going to put more teeth in the security but we dont 
really want to sound the alarm too much because these threats have 
happened before he said adding that the marcoses had reacted 
calmly to the early morning rousting 
they know its for their safety he said 
in an interview with philippine radio station dzxl trinided was 
asked if he considered the alleged sighting of the men an 
assassination attempt he replied yes 
the security men saw that the occupants were all armed he 
said they tried to accost them but they escaped 
mrs aquino has refused to allow marcos to return from exile in 
hawaii in january 1987 us authorities barred marcos and his 
wife from leaving oahu island following a coup attempt in manila by 
his followers 
the government said the attempt which included armed attacks on 
media and military facilities was staged to pave the way for 
marcos to return 
just tuesday the los angeles times reported that marcos had 
offered the philippine government 5 billion to be allowed to 
return to his homeland in response marcos said that his 
representatives were negotiating with the aquino government about a 
return but denied that any money was being offered

president fidel castro told cubans tuesday 
to prepare for the return of thousands of their soldiers from 
angola if a peace agreement can be reached for that southern 
african country 
in a threehour speech marking the 35th anniversary of the 
launching of his leftist revolution castro also defended his 
rectification campaign for economic reform and said 
sovietstyle reforms are not needed in cuba he called capitalist 
economic policies complete trash 
castro confirmed reports that cuba recently sent reinforcements 
to angola where it is estimated that at least 50000 cuban 
military personnel are helping the marxist government battle rebels 
backed by south africa and the united states 
he said the reinforcements were needed to create proper 
conditions for a political solution in angola 
the governments of angola cuba and south africa reached an 
agreement this month for the removal of foreign troops from angola 
and independence for southwest africa the territory administered 
by south africa 
the united states was represented at the talks 
southwest africa also known as namibia lies between south 
africa and angola 
castro said he did not want to prejudice the continuing 
negotiations on angola by going into detail on their status but 
declared we really are on the threshholds of a political 
solution 
portugal granted independence to angola in 1975 and marxist 
forces defeated prowestern groups in the civil war that followed 
us state department sources have said cuba sent up to 15000 
more soldiers into angola since last fall to augment its presence 
of 40000 military personnel 
castro did not say how many reinforcements were sent but said 
the deployment was needed and could not be done halfway 
our objective was not a military victory but a political just 
solution to the conflict he said 
cuban forces will remain in angola until the minute a peace 
agreement is signed castro added 
he said cuban troops returning from angola once a peace pact is 
concluded would be welcomed back to the battle for the 
development of our country 
he rejected suggestions from the west that socialist countries 
must adopt capitalist policies to move their societies forward 
castro called capitalist methods complete trash and added 
we will not weaken the role of plans or development programs 
he said the same was true for cubas oneparty communist system 
and no room existed for opposition groups 
the communist party is the one responsible for our country 
here there is only one party he said 
referring to economic and political reforms being pursued by the 
soviet union under mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet bloc 
countries casto said those who urge adoption of those programs in 
cuba have an incorrect attitude an ignorant attitude 
we will never forget where we are located and it isnt in the 
black sea but in the caribbean sea castro he said not 90 
miles from odessa but 90 miles from miami 
in the past two years cuba has abandoned economic incentives 
aimed at boosting production and implemented a campaign of moral 
persuasion that emphasizes greater worker discipline 
it would be totally incorrect for us to copy mechanically the 
solutions of other countries castro said and what may be best 
for the soviet bloc may not work for cuba 
noting that japan achieved its status as one of the worlds most 
powerful nations economically with an average of six vacation days 
per worker each year castro called on cubans to achieve more 
during the working hours they have he said he wasnt suggesting 
taking away vacations or increasing work schedules in cuba 
two years ago castro declared that worker absenteeism and 
inefficient production threatened to make cuba a nation of 
freeloaders 
the cuban leader cited a lengthy list of recent industrial and 
public works projects in santiago cubas secondlargest city with 
a population of 962000 
earlier tuesday cubans marked the revolutions 35th anniversary 
by staging a symbolic attack on a military barracks that now is an 
elementary school 
castro attended a ceremony in santiago at 5 am the exact time 
his revolution began and watched youth groups mount a mock assault 
on the moncada garrison in this eastern cuban city 
although the 1953 attack failed the brutality with which it was 
suppressed sparked popular support for castros fight to overthrow 
rightist dictator fulgencio bastista 
castro was imprisoned and later released he fled the island 
but returned with revolutionary forces aboard the yacht granma in 
1956 to start his guerrilla war in the mountains 
the struggle ended in a triumphant march into havana on jan 1 
1959 to begin communist rule

two army commanders testified tuesday 
that they urged a private to abstain from sexual activity after he 
tested positive for the aids virus but they never ordered him to 
abstain or warned him that his sexual conduct could be a crime 
the commanders testified for the prosecution at the opening of 
the courtmartial of pvt adrian g morris jr who in march 1987 
became the first member of the military to be charged with 
aidsrelated offenses 
others to testify included a soldier identified only as jane 
doe and spec 4 patricia c pruitt who was engaged to morris for 
a time both women said morris told them prior to having sex that 
he had a rare incurable blood disease but did not mention aids 
morris 28 of caseyville ill is accused of having threatened 
the health of the two women and a third male soldier by failing to 
use condoms during sex and by failing to warn them he had tested 
positive for exposure to the aids virus 
col warren a todd a physician who commanded the hospital at 
fort huachuca in this southeast arizona town said he counseled 
morris in july 1986 after morris tested positive to having 
antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus hiv which causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
presence of the antibodies indicates the person has been exposed 
to the virus may develop aids and can spread it 
todd said he advised morris to use condoms if he had sex and to 
avoid highrisk partners but he said there was no order for those 
testing positive to abstain from sex nor any criminal sanction for 
sexual activity 
capt bernard e kulifay jr said he counseled morris strictly 
mantoman on several occasions between july 1986 and march 1987 
and advised him that he should not screw around 
kulifay said his soldiers including morris watched a film in 
1986 detailing aids and its transmission 
but under crossexamination kulifay acknowledged that the film 
did not say that soldiers who tested positive for the virus but 
failed to abstain from sex were committing criminal conduct 
both todd and kulifay said they never told morris his sexual 
activity might be criminal 
late in the afternoon the soldier identified only as ms doe 
testified that she had sex twice with morris in august 1986 the 
second time the night before her husband of one month arrived in 
sierra vista 
she said morris had told her that he had a rare blood disease 
and he could die at any moment she said morris said the disease 
was fatal but did not mention hiv or aids 
she acknowledged under crossexamination that she was testifying 
in exchange for immunity from charges of adultery which is a 
military crime she also said army medical officials have told her 
she no longer is at risk for contracting the disease 
the woman testified after the judge col raymond d cole 
reversed himself and allowed her to testify under a pseudonym 
despite defense objections the prosecution had claimed that 
identifying the woman could harm her mental health 
ms pruitt testified that morris told her in 1986 he had an 
incurable blood disease but didnt say until january 1987 that it 
was aids she said they had sex weekly from april to october 1986 
with morris using a condom about onefourth of the time 
she said they resumed relations in jaunary 1987 even though she 
knew morris test results and that aids is an incurable 
contagious fatal disease she said she understood the risk 
the soldier also said she and her child born last year and 
allegedly fathered by morris have tested negative for hiv 
morris has pleaded innocent to three counts of aggravated 
assault three counts of conduct bringing discredit upon the army 
and one count of sodomy he faces up to 17 years in prison 
dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all pay and allowances if 
convicted 
when he was charged morris was the first member of the military 
to face aidsrelated charges other cases have been brought since 
in april the army adopted regulations requiring commanders to 
warn soldiers testing positive for the aids virus that they face 
discharge or prosecution if they dont tell sex partners about 
their condition or use condoms the air force and navy have adopted 
similar regulations

bricklin says the agreements covered only rental of the property 
joseph coleman averys lawyer said bricklin cut off payments

take his home away he said tuesday

wasnt me because ive got some money and if it wasnt me it 
wouldnt be news

as captain of the ship i did my best to avoid a 
collision manji kondo the 30yearold captain of the fujimaru

at least half the thousands of operations 
on americans with ruptured discs in their lower back probably were 
unnecessary says a study showing 90 percent of such patients can 
be healed without surgery 
the threeyear study indicates that surgeons should change how 
they decide whether to operate on patients with lumbar disc 
problems one of the studys authors dr jeffrey saal of the san 
francisco spine institute said monday 
neurosurgeons often operate if a patient fails to improve after 
bed rest and suffers severe pain leg weakness and if diagnostic 
exams show the discs nucleus has broken through the disc wall and 
is pressing against a nerve root 
saal said none of those criteria should be used as overwhelming 
evidence that surgery is needed he said the decision should be 
based on the patients level of function and whether that can be 
improved by an aggressive rehabilitation program

imitation is the sincerest form of flattery 
goes the saying and in the tv business imitators are the best 
assurance your show is a success 
star trek the next generation has spawned another 
syndicated paramount science fiction remake series for the fall 
war of the worlds 
friday the 13th the scary syndicated series based on a long 
string of hit theatrical movies has prompted lorimar to come up 
with the series a nightmare on elm street freddys nightmares 
even double dare the kids game show has a competitor 
fun house though its producers insist they had sold the show 
before nickelodeons double dare became a success in 
syndication 
the 5monthold writers guild strike has affected syndicated 
series just as much as the networks shows 
producers of hourlong shows like star trek which is on 
hold until the strike ends predicted they couldnt get on the air 
with new episodes until october or november 
nightmare has about eight completed scripts and plans to 
premiere on schedule the first week of october war of the 
worlds will also premiere that week and has enough scripts to 
fulfill our obligation if the strike goes on for a long long 
time said stephen nalevansky vice president of creative affairs 
at paramount television he said the scripts from various 
sources would not be used once the shows striking writers 
returned the show is being produced in toronto nalevansky 
wouldnt say how many scripts the producers have in hand 
as a tribute to the success of star trek the next 
generation which is the highestrated weekly show in 
syndication war of the worlds has already been sold in 190 
markets covering 97 percent of the country 
the show premieres in the 50th anniversary year of the original 
orson welles war of the worlds radio show and the 35th 
anniversary year of the oscarwinning movie of the same name 
the premise is that the aliens who invaded the earth in 1953 and 
were killed by a mysterious bacteria are reviving because of 
radiation in the environment a band of scientists aided by a 
soldier struggles to alert a populace left with amnesia from their 
original encounter with the aliens 
freddys nightmares is set in a small town where the spirit 
of violent freddy terrorizes the townspeople who destroyed him 
its a show designed not to let its audience get to bed 
peacefully right after its over said executive producer robert 
shaye he said for television the producers would have to tone 
down the massive special effects of the movie version and rely more 
on suspense and the suggestion of violence 
also on tap for the fall in syndication is another 
realitybased show family medical center from lorimar the 
halfhour drama will says executive producer jay feldman touch 
you and move you but will also give you medical information 
the shows medical advisor is dr walter dishell who has served 
as advisor to the network hospital shows medical center 
mash and trapper john md

cancer showing that there are optional treatments the patient can 
select and the touchy subject of abortion shaye said the 
producers plan to offer both sides of controversial issues 
family medical center premieres sept 12 
dishell incidentally counts mash as the best medical 
show ever 
i dont think anything will ever touch that he said though

stars of star trek the next generation says he has asked the 
producers to allow his blind character geordi la forge to somehow 
in the future miraculously lose the odd device that he wears over 
his eyes to help him see but burton who counts his expressive 
eyes as one of his biggest assets as an actor says the experience 
of doing without has helped him become a better actor he told 
a meeting of tv critics it forced me to develop other ways to 
express myself still it seems enough is enough get that air 
filter off of him recommended costar jonathan frakes star 
trek the next generation is on hold until the writers strike is 
over but coexecutive producer rick berman said they would not 
resort to reshooting old scripts of the 1960s version of the show 
to take a script that would have mr spock and capt kirk and put 
it in to some semblance of order that we could do would require the 
kind of writing were not allowed to do under the terms of the

some of your smartest best educated friends 
never catch on to the rules of the game says allen cymrot they 
live in a capitalist society but they never learn to live as 
capitalists 
instead he states they live under constant financial stress 
forever frustrated by their inability to improve the quality of 
their lives and all because they do not know the name or rules of 
the game 
when youre on the football field you play football says 
cymrot and in a capitalist society you should seek to live like 
a capitalist 
in his view you should consider yourself a business with a 
balance sheet and profitloss statement you must understand net 
worth because it is that rather than current income he contends 
that raises the quality of life 
cymrot learned the lessons a long time ago practiced them as an 
executive responsible for buying and selling more than 1 billion 
worth of property and now as a labor of love wants to teach the 
lessons 
he has written a book every evening at home for a year on a 
yellow pad or personal computer to help preach his philosophy 
that a person is as responsible for personal wealth as surely as 
for personal health 
he calls it street smart real estate investing but it is 
more than that it is a strategy for increasing net worth and the 
key to a high quality material life a message that sounds simple 
but is forever overlooked 
because he is a real estate person he uses real estate to 
illustrate his concept that the mass of people live lives of 
quiet desperation because they try to finance everything on current 
income rather than business investments 
no matter how well educated cymrot laments people make the 
mistake but he says 99 percent of the academic curricula that 
tell how to make money offer nothing on what to do with it 
and what do most people do with it they use it but never 
really invest it 
they live like socialists in a capitalist country they dont 
know how to generate net worth so when they run into trouble when 
they seek to raise the quality of their lives they want government 
to legislate wealth for them 
the theme of cymrots book published by dow jones irwin is 
this 
you must develop a profit and loss statement any excess 
earnings from the pampl statement should go into good investments 
those investments move tangible assets to your balance sheet as 
these investments grow net worth increases 
when you seek to buy a home a car a boat or finance your 
childs education the money comes from your balance sheet your 
net worth not from your current earnings 
these expenditures are financed by the strength of your 
balance sheet your income may make the monthly payments but your 
balance sheet provides funds for the down payment he says 
he stresses the idea in the book income buys daily 
necessities and little frills assets buy other assets 
cymrot knows his subject and practices it he is chairman and 
director of the national multihousing council and former 
president and director of robert a mcneil corp one of the 
countrys largest real estate entities 
now chief executive officer of woodmont realty advisors inc of 
belmont calif a company that invests in properties for pension 
funds he continues to build his personal net worth through outside 
investment activities 
it is from experiences with both individual and executive 
investing that he draws the material for his book but the concept 
does not depend on real estate although cymrot believes it is a 
superior vehicle any good investment will do 
in his meetings with investors and students he lectures 
frequently to graduate students he says he has found all human 
beings have some aspect of success in business social life or 
through charitable involvements 
but the vast majority of people havent carried that success 
into their investment life he says in the book there seems to 
be a bridge that is missing 
he hopes this book can be that bridge connecting those 
principles that reflect your success in other aspects of your life 
with the investment side of your life

who says no now 
no one rivers replies quietly nobody wants to rock a 
boat gene saks was wonderful and gave me a lot of encouragement 
but youre really on your own out there 
if she faces the audience alone some of them dont recognize 
her when she first walks on stage a slightly stooped woman wearing 
no makeup and a faded housedress 
theres a lot of my mother in kate jerome in her strength 
the brooklynborn rivers says and my fathers patients 
particularly in her expressions he was a doctor who had a large 
jewish medical practice 
rivers began rehearsals for the show at the end of may 
at my age its hard memorizing a script she laughs i 
asked everybody for advice somebody told me it takes alec guinness 
a year to memorize a script he apparently types the whole thing 
out roddy mcdowell says he records it and listens on a walkman 
while she was working in las vegas rivers hired an unemployed 
actor and actress who fed her lines constantly when she wasnt on 
stage in a club 
her 20yearold daughter melissa who wants to be an actress 
came opening night and told her mother i hope my opening nights 
are as good as yours 
melissa now a college student calls every night phoning her 
mother in her dressing room at the broadhurst theater 
in august while starring in broadway bound rivers will 
work after the show at michaels pub an east side nightclub 
shell try out new material much like she does when shes in 
california at carlos n charlies another small nightspot 
rivers has never been shy about going after a job 
nothing has ever fallen in my lap she says ive always 
had to go out and get it when youre a working performer youre a 
gun for hire you do what comes along 
to reach her mass audience rivers still has that center square 
on televisions hollywood squares the neverending game show 
she tapes when she has the time 
i love playing the game and i like the exposure she says 
there is no other exposure for me at the moment im persona non 
grata at carson and also at letterman because letterman is a carson 
production 
she says she would go back to tonight where she reigned as 
johnny carsons leading substitute host until becoming his rival on 
the fox network 
he doesnt want any part of me rivers says hes angry 
because i dared to leave and take my own show after my contract was 
up i did nothing wrong 
rivers is selling her home in california and is buying a smaller 
house there but shes also purchased an apartment in new york 
when youre single its the only place to be she says 
in california you sit behind a big gate and its home 
entertaining i need friends at this point in my life who say 
lets go to the movies and get a bite afterward 
will she ever take the talk show road again rivers is not sure 
the fox thing was a nightmare she recalls the nightmare 
was that i was fired for bad ratings now when you look back the 
ratings were incredible they never got near our ratings again the 
tragedy was that the show wasnt given a chance it takes a year to 
build an audience 
still the thought of another try at a talk show persists 
i look at people on talk shows and i think oh no dont ask 
that question ask this question rivers says so obviously 
its still very much a part of my lifestyle but there are enough 
talk shows on television now lets all just wait and then well 
try again

the dollar reflecting its recent strength

rebounded in slow trading 
the dollar opened at 13225 yen and rose to 13260 before edging 
down to close at 13215 up 035 yen from mondays close 
although there is no energy in the market that could keep 
carrying the dollar higher the dollar seems to be receiving enough 
support to keep itself above the 132yen level at least for the 
time being a trader at the bank of tokyo said 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues which shed 117 points monday gained 12023 points 
or 044 percent to close at 2730376 in thin trading

investors on the stock market were taking a waitandsee 
attitude ahead of wednesdays scheduled announcement in washington 
of secondquarter figures for the gross national product the total

prime computer inc is withdrawing its 
mxcl5 minisupercomputer from the marketplace and taking a 5 
million charge against its secondquarter earnings 
the company also said monday it is canceling a marketing 
agreement with cydrome inc of milpitas calif which manufactured 
the computer 
prime attributed the withdrawal of the mxcl5 to slower growth in 
the minisupercomputer field and aggressive pricing by the 
companys competitors 
because of the intensely competitive pricing environment we 
determined that sales of this product would not contribute 
significantly to the overall profitability of prime prime 
president joe m henson said in a prepared statement 
henson said prime would continue to evaluate the specialpurpose 
processor market which prime entered in january in an attempt to 
compete with field leaders alliant computer systems corp of acton 
and convex computer corp of richardson texas 
company officials said the secondquarter earnings reduction 
would amount to about 10 cents a share analysts had forecast 
earnings of about 23 cents to 27 cents a share prime is to 
announce quarterly earnings thursday 
the base price for the standard mxcl5 system was 579000 while 
a more fully configured model was price at 774000 the unixbased 
system was designed for sophisticated engineering and scientific 
numbercrunching 
prime announced in may it was laying off about 700 employees 
because of job redundancies and attrition after a february merger 
with computervision inc the merger moved prime to second in the 
computeraided design and computeraided manufacturing market 
behind international business machines corp 
the company reported first quarter net income of 145 million 
of revenues of 3637 million including computervision operations

the government has uncovered evidence that shows 
drexel burnham lambert inc may have aided former stock speculator 
ivan f boesky in an alleged scheme to violate tax laws a report 
published tuesday said 
the wall street journal quoting unnamed sources familiar with 
the investigation said the government is focusing on a series of 
taxmotivated stock trades three years ago between the investment 
banking firm and boeskys seemala corp 
the newspaper said investigators are examining evidence 
suggesting boesky was permitted to buy and sell stock with drexel 
to claim immediate trading losses for seemala for tax purposes and 
that drexel later reimbursed the company for the losses 
drexel spokesman steven s anreder said tuesday the company 
would not respond to stories based on rumor or leaks we know of 
no wrongdoing by our firm or any of our people that remains our 
position 
since boesky was charged in the nations largest insidertrading 
case two years ago drexel along with its junk bond operations 
has emerged as the largest target of an ongoing federal 
securitiesfraud investigation 
drexel has yet to be formally charged but it has been the 
subject of numerous press reports the securities and exchange 
commission has recommended civil charges of securitieslaw 
violations against the firm and some key employees 
the journal article however suggests the case against drexel 
may be expanding to include questions of possible taxlaw 
violations 
the internal revenue service along with the sec and the us 
attorneys office in manhattan which reportedly are conducting a 
criminal investigation of drexel are probing the alleged tax 
scheme according to the newspaper 
boesky agreed in november 1986 to pay a record 100 million to 
settle insidertrading charges and was sentenced last december to 
three years imprisonment on a single felony count of conspiring to 
lie to the sec

wednesday on the gross national product for the second quarter of

the western european car industry the worlds 
largest is enjoying record sales as consumers from britain to 
italy flock to showrooms eager to buy new wheels 
while this is undoubtedly good news some industry people 
believe it or not find it distinctly worrying 
the reason is that the boom has attracted more competitors in 
what already is a fiercely competitive market that has heightened 
fears that the field will become overcrowded leaving the car 
makers vulnerable in a downturn which could come as soon as next 
year 
the market is booming said sanjay dabysing head of the 
automotive group at dri europe ltd a private economic forecasting 
firm in london 
sales which have been buoyant in europe since the mid1980s 
are expected to grow to a record 125 million cars this year from 
124 million in 1987 dri said 
in comparison 113 million cars were sold in north america and 
33 million in japan in the most recent year 
its a representation of the reasonably good economic growth 
in europe in recent years said garel rhys an automotive 
economist at the university of cardiff 
the sales growth stems from strong consumer spending created by 
income growth tax cuts and an increasing willingness among 
europeans to take on debt the experts said in addition more 
businesses are using company cars they said 
britain spain and italy have been experiencing particularly 
strong demand while sales have been slowed somewhat in west 
germany by a sluggish economy 
import restraints and the overall buoyancy of the market have 
encouraged japanese manufacturers to build more plants in europe 
the market also has attracted other asian and eastern european 
competitors like the makers of south koreas hyundai and 
yugoslavias inexpensive yugo 
us automakers have stepped up their activity by buying up 
european luxury car makers general motors corp has bought lotus 
group of cos chrysler corp has bought automobili lamborghini spa 
and ford motor co which already owns aston martin lagonda ltd 
is rumored to be interested in jaguar plc 
the market has become more competitive dabysing said 
most of the competition still comes from other europeans unlike 
the united states where the big three automakers control the 
market europe has a large number of domestically based 
manufacturers 
the top six auto makers and their market shares in 1987 
according to dri were volkswagen ag 149 percent fiat auto spa 
142 percent the combination of peugeot sa and automobiles 
citroen sa 122 percent ford 12 percent renault sa 106 
percent and general motors 106 percent 
the biggest rivalry among the europeans is between volkswagen 
and fiat both of which are trying to expand their markets across 
the continent in anticipation of the common markets elimination of 
most trade barriers in 1992 
fiat for instance makes 60 percent of its sales in italy but 
expects to face new threats at home once trade restrictions on 
imports are lifted across the european economic community 
the japanese meanwhile have already captured 114 percent of 
the european market mostly through imports dri said 
the japanese are now moving on to the next stage as they have 
in america trying to diffuse the controversy that their sales have 
created in europe rhys said 
the pioneer nissan motor co operates a plant in sunderland 
england and has already doubled its planned 1992 capacity to 
200000 cars 
there is no doubt that manufacturers like toyota motor corp 
and mazda motor corp and mitsubishi motors corp will follow 
this route where and when is difficult to answer but they will be 
coming dabysing said adding that the japanese might also bring 
over cars it makes in north america 
indeed john grant vice president for business strategy for 
ford of europe inc in brentwood england said thats the 
biggest worry we have 
the japanese companies already the most productive car makers 
will be able to cut costs further when they set up more operations 
in europe which will save them considerable transportation costs 
we will get an excess capacity situation again which will 
increase the cost pressures on everybody and will increase the 
competitive pressures grant said 
the market could develop an excess capacity of 1 million cars 
he estimated 
the 12nation eec has yet to decide whether it will restrict 
japanese imports after 1992 when it becomes a barrierfree 
marketplace the experts are expecting the eec to choose a 
voluntary quota on japanese car sales perhaps limiting them to 10 
percent of the market 
some people argue that there are too many independent 
manufacturers in europe rhys saidif the market turned off 
considerably in the future the firms would find it difficult to 
make profits and the question would be how do the firms survive 
the companies have toughened up by striving to become more 
productive and to produce higher quality cars in an effort to 
close those gaps with the japanese leaders 
western european makers have also joined forces either through 
mergers or through joint ventures to produce various components 
and in one case an entire car renault and volksagen are working 
together on an automatic gear box peugeot volvo ab and renault 
are working on an engine rover group plc and honda motor co 
developed a car together the rover 800 also called the honda 
legend 
this has helped the western european makers which do not enjoy 
the economies of scale the americans have to become more 
profitable 
although the drop in the dollar has hurt luxury car makers who 
export to the united states dabysing said that in 1987 they 
the major european car makers made money on the operations level 
for the first time in a long long time and 1988 is proving to be a 
good year too 
the cloud on the horizon is the setback the industry is 
expecting in 1989 the experts are forcasting sales of 115 million 
cars to 1175 million cars a decline of as much as 8 percent 
but the competitors wont be put off the experts said 
its entrepreneurship hope springs eternal in the human 
breast rhys said everybody feels they can make a lot of 
money its a very big market and they want to be in it and they 
want to be in it in a bigger way in the future

buffeted by a cheaper dollar and japanese 
competition european carmakers are hoping to hold on to their 
lucrative slice of the american market two of them are trying new 
incentives to keep americans buying 
at present the europeans have a 51 percent share of the 
american mmarket compared to 186 percent for the japanese 
fly to europe on mercedesbenz says a newspaper 
advertisement of the west german automaker the company offers a 
single businessclass seat or two coachclass seats to anybody who 
orders a mercedes in the united states 
it is the first time american buyers have been offered a free 
trip to pick up the prestige autos at the factory in stuttgart 
we offer them a luncheon and if they want a factory tour 
said fred chapman spokesman of mercedesbenz north america in 
montvale nj 
since the beginning of the advertising campaign earlier this 
year about 700 americans have accepted the offer chapman said 
with factory deliveries buyers save 3500 for the lowerpriced 
mercedes to almost 10000 for the luxury model chapman added 
after the buyer completes his european vacation the company 
arranges to ship the car without charge to the us dealer who 
handles customs arrangements and other paperwork 
for mercedesbenz cars delivered new in the united states 
prices range from 29190 for the 190e model with manual 
transmission to 77065 for the 560 sec 
last year 89000 mercedes were sold on the american market in 
the first six months of 1988 sales were steady at 44066 
porsche the west german builder of sports cars lost some 
business this year mostly because of the weak dollar that made 
our cars more expensive and less affordable said martha mckinley 
from the companys us headquarters in reno nevada 
porsche sold 12824 cars in the first six months of 1987 but 
sales declined to 8807 in the same period of this year 
the company is now trying to recapture some ground with an 
incentive program the companys trusttourist delivery program 
offers discounts between 7 and 10 percent depending on the model 
for all models ordered in the united states and picked up in west 
germany 
prices range from 26560 for the porsche 924 to 69380 for the 
porsche 928 
the company sees its main competition from japanese cars and 
from its german rival 
in the lowerpriced cars its the japanese product when it 
comes to the expensive models we have to fight mercedes she 
said 
the italian auto giant fiat which sells alfa romeos and lancia 
cars on the american market has similar fears the company took 
its own fiat models off the market because of the japanese 
competition in the smallcar area gualberto ramieri a fiat 
spokesman expects that the new alfa romeo 164 will capture some 
lost ground in america 
the price for the car on the american market has not been fixed 
yet he added 
in the first six months of 1988 fiat sold 2708 alfa romeos in 
the united states down from 3422 in the same period last year 
for the whole 1988 ramieri expects the sale of about 6000 cars 
through the companys 150 dealers across the united states 
frances peugeot also lost some ground in the united states it 
sold 9320 cars last year but only 3454 cars in the first half of 
1988 spokeswoman kim derderian said the company hopes a new model 
the peugeot 405 will recapture some buyers 
the british luxury car maker jaguar doesnt fear sales losses 
the car with a basic price of 45000 finds most of its admirers in 
california florida and the bigger cities according to company 
spokesman tom mcdonald last year the company sold 10028 of its 
cars in the united states mcdonald expects no major changes for 
this year 
bmw another german luxury carmaker has no plans to offer 
special incentives to us buyers 
we know about the free trips mercedes offers but we have no 
similar program said robert mitchell from bmw north america his 
company sold 87839 cars last year on the american market mitchell 
expects the same result for this year

at age 65 wayne greens calling came long 
before his landslide victory in the nonbinding republican vice 
presidential race in new hampshires earliestinthenation primary 
he is a publisher not a politician and while his brief 
campaign gave him a chance to speak out on everything from 
education to electronics he wont be at the side of george bush 
this fall 
its questionable whether he could carry his own towns of 
peterborough and hancock 
though he made peterborough nh population 4876 a major 
publishing center by pioneering such successful magazines as 
digital audio and byte residents like to say he also has fired 
half the town 
a few years ago a wayne green exemployees association sprang 
up and about 50 people showed up for a dinner to swap anecdotes 
even green attended 
green has had his problems elsewhere too hes been sued by the 
irs cbs the telephone company and his former wife 
at 65 he seems to make a lasting impression positive or 
negative on almost everyone he meets 
his message ballyhooed on the editorial pages of his 
publications is simple i get great satisfaction out of 
encouraging people to make money to be successful he said 
and he is generally respected even among those he has rankled 
as a man of considerable vision in the computer field 
he foresaw the future of computers in the early 1970s and ran 
articles on the application of computers said one former green 
executive who asked that his name not be used 
in the early 1980s he started a magazine on compact disks he 
was two years ahead of the others 
he played a role in the growth of fledgling industries such as 
microcomputers compact disks and the repeater relay business for 
ham operators by giving manufacturers a place to advertise and 
hungry consumers a place to learn about the new products 
green said he has started 25 magazines many of them still being 
published after selling out to international data group one of 
the largest computer magazine publishers in the world for a 
reported 16 million several years ago he started another 
publishing house wayne green enterprises in hancock which he 
claims is worth 20 million 
he writes industry newsletters biannually publishes a yearbook 
on compact disks puts together foreign travel tours for ham 
operators has written a 100 video for businesses to teach proper 
public relations and is thinking about producing classical music 
tapes 
his second wife sherry meanwhile has produced 22 dance videos 
that are selling like crazy he said 
he has mingled with king hussein of jordan and prime minister 
rajiv gandhi of india fellow ham radio operators and said he has 
convinced hussein to introduce ham radio in schools to get 
youngsters interested in electronics another goal is to sell 
electronics magazines to students in china 
oddly widely connected the anonymous executive called him 
green is a founding member of mensa an organization of people 
who score in the top 2 percent of intelligent tests a man of a 
thousand ideas and a solution to every problem his vice 
presidential campaign gave him a chance to air his thoughts on how 
to improve the quality of education increase the number of 
electronic experts in the country solve the drug abuse problem and 
get people off welfare 
strangely many of these opinions have found ample display on 
the pages of his technology publications which he churns out from 
an 18room farmhouse 
as long as i can remember he was always pushing pushing 
people to get out and be creative and to use their talents to get 
ahead in the world said another former employee jeff detray of 
troy nh 
hes happiest when new things are starting up and growth is 
taking place detray said he seemed less happy when new 
projects become routine 
life has been far from routine for green since he left new york 
city 27 years ago two years earlier he had been fired as an 
editor of a ham radio magazine so he started his own called 73 
i sold everything i had my 22foot chriscraft for 1500 my 
plane for 2000 and my porsche for 3500 enough money to print 
my first issue he said 
he moved to peterborough in his native new hampshire he was 
born in littleton because of the towns proximity to the 
2280foot pack monadnock mountain a ham radio center 
green provided jobs paid taxes on a multimilliondollar 
business and put the town on the map with a good grade of 
magazines selectman merton dyer said 
he was elected president of the chamber of commerce and by his 
own account raised attendance from eight to 100 within two months 
by presenting green said more interesting speakers 
but as detray put it hes not your average taciturn new 
englander he probably grated on a lot of townspeople 
he has bright ideas but no depth to them said tom 
westheimer another former employee he hires people to implement 
them and when it doesnt work he fires them 
he also has had personal problems green claims he was convicted 
of tax evasion in the early 1970s because he wrote editorials 
critical of the internal revenue service 
then bell telephone in los angeles sued after he published a 
circuit number he claims he was only repeating something that had 
been published elsewhere that enabled readers to make tollfree 
calls 
the case ended when he agreed not to publish any more 
information on various telephone company devices 
in the early 1980s he said he was sued by cbs inc which 
claimed the use of the name digital audio for one of his magazines 
was too close to one of their trademarks green said cbs later 
dropped the suit 
and there was the disagreement with his first wife virginia 
over who created byte considered the oldest and most successful 
computer magazine green said the magazine begun in the mid1970s 
was in her name because of his tax situation 
a lawsuit and countersuit ensued and green wrote about the 
dispute for years in editorials he even put up a billboard in 
front of his office that read merry christmas to all but one 
it is symptomatic of his special brand of success and perhaps 
his biggest regret that green has achieved more notoriety than 
acclaim 
ive accomplished a lot of things and not many people know 
about it he said that bothers me

today on the chicago board of trade but analysts said the markets

rains in the droughtstricken farm belt 
i think the markets gone too far down said cathy leow 
assistant vice president in charge of grain futures trading for 
thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
i think the markets overdone the rains weve gotten and its 
still ignoring the fact that we have a phenomenal amount of crop 
damage she said 
scattered showers in the midwest during the past week improved 
the condition of corn and soybean crops in most major growing 
states according to agricultural experts and the national weather 
services latest 6to10day outlook predicts normal precipitation 
in the region early next week 
but ms leow said losses totaling more than 2 a bushel in the 
soybean pit in the past seven sessions do not reflect the 
irreparable damage already done to the crop 
in early trading wheat was 4 cents to 6 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 365 a bushel corn was 11 
cents to 13 cents lower with september at 291 a bushel oats

south korea announced tuesday it was 
lifting a threeyearold ban on imports of foreign beef but said 
it would maintain an import quota system that has been opposed by 
the united states 
agriculture minister yun kunhwan said imports for 1988 would be 
limited to 14500 tons yun did not say how much beef would be 
imported after this year but indicated imports would be limited in 
order to protect the local beef industry 
the end to the import ban was designed to avoid trade friction 
with foreign countries while at the same time alleviating domestic 
beef shortages yun said 
the united states has been pressing south korea to drop the ban 
on beef imports to help correct seouls 10 billion trade imbalance 
with washington the united states is also pressing south korea to 
drop restrictions or bans on many other imports and opposes the 
beef quota system 
there was no immediate reaction from local farmers who have 
strongly opposed imports of beef unless the government guaranteed a 
definite price support system before lifting the import ban 
many korean farmers went bankrupt due to an excessive import of 
foreign beef cattle before the last ban was imposed in 1985 
farmers have staged demonstrations to demand retention of the 
import ban 
as reported previously yun said the proposed tonnage would 
include 3000 tons of high quality beef for use at tourist hotels 
to be imported from the united states officials said high quality 
beef could start arriving next month 
the remaining 11500 tons of both high quality and ordinary 
quality beef would be for general public consumption with sales 
open to the united states australia and other bidders 
yun said imported beef will be stockpiled for sales in case 
domestic sales prices exceed designated levels to seek price 
stabilization

republican congressional leaders told 
president reagan today to use his best instincts in considering 
whether to veto the plant closing bill one key gop senator 
predicted the legislation will become law no matter what the 
president does 
house republican leader robert michel of illinois told reporters 
that arguments were made on both sides of the issue in a 
meeting of gop leaders with the president at the white house 
some of us in the house of representatives made the point that 
we were within the range of being able to sustain the presidents 
veto if there were some work done and there wasnt a diminution of 
votes on the democratic side michel said 
there were arguments made on the other side too that frankly 
it was probably impossible to sustain in the senate and that maybe 
the president would want to give consideration to simply letting it 
become law he said 
michel said the president did not give an expression one way 
or another at all as to his intentions the president told 
reporters at the opening of the meeting that he never decides about 
a bill until it reaches his desk 
when asked what he believed the president would do michel said 
hes a very pragmatic individual and has been over eight years of 
time i think the last word that was said wasmr president just 
use your best instincts 
michel said that arguments were made with respect to how it 
may or may not affect the campaign but sen richard lugar 
rind said i dont think it will make much difference 
my guess is plant closing will become law but the parts about 
layoffs will be very controversial and will lead to some litigation 
later on he saidi think probably the vote is there in both 
houses to override 
lugar said the republicans in the meeting were expressing 
pretty good vote counts but saying the president ought to do his 
thing 
the bill requires companies to give workers 60 days notice of 
plant closings and layoffs 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that reagan 
is likely to go ahead and veto the bill 
but the spokesman also said no final decision had been made 
its always open until its done fitzwater told reporters 
after the arrived at the white house for reagans signature 
the legislation passed both the house and senate by vetoproof 
margins and some republicans have said theyre reluctant to vote 
against it because of polls showing broad public support for the 
proposal 
fitzwater disputed assertions that republicans may be preparing 
to deliver that sort of message to reagan saying i would say 
there are number of them who will recommend a veto 
reagan has until aug 3 to make a decision he could veto the 
bill sign it or let it pass automatically into law without his 
signature 
the administrations stand on the issue has been repeatedly 
assailed by democrats who say common decency requires that workers 
be told when they are about to lose their jobs reagan says 
business should have the flexibility to close plants and lay 
off workers without the 60 days notice 
vice president george bush certain to get the republican 
nomination for president in new orleans next month has stated 
sentiments similar to reagans on the issue although there have 
been reports the bush campaign would prefer to see the president 
let the bill become law to ease the political heat on bush

the house agriculture committee plowed forward 
today with efforts to fashion a droughtrelief package following a 
warning from president reagan not to bust the budget with aid 
to desperate farmers 
it aint over til its over and its never over in this 
committee house agriculture committee chairman e kika de la 
garza dtexas declared as the lawmakers scrambled to meet a 
selfimposed deadline of writing a bill and putting it on the floor 
of the house this week 
a mound of amendments still faced the committee which had 
announced prior to the congressional break for the democratic 
national convention that it had finished with all but the 
formalities but de la garza was still shooting for a quick wrapup 
followed by floor action this week and a housesenate conference 
committee next week 
as the lawmakers went back into session deputy secretary of 
agriculture peter myers told them that the administrations 
specific objections boiled down to two features now in the 
legislation 
one would streamline and expand the system under which the 
agriculture department provides feed aid to livestock producers 
the other would require farmers to buy federal crop insurance in 
the future as a condition of getting relief 
we dont think that makes much sense myers said major 
grower groups wrote to lawmakers on monday to urge an end to the 
cropinsurance provision 
in his letter monday to the lawmakers reagan warned against 
creating windfalls for some as part of the bill because it 
would mean less for the truly deserving he said farmers who 
bought crop insurance should not be penalized relative to farmers 
who did not act with such prudence 
the measure should not include any incentive for a farmer to 
plow under his crops reagan said he also said it was necessary 
to keep a rein on spending 
to put it very simply we must not bust the budget reagan 
said he reiterated that lawmakers should not start rewriting the 
1985 farm act 
earlier the chairman of a key house panel said he hoped to 
speed congressional approval of the drought relief package which 
could come to 6 billion or more much of it taken from 75 
billion in government savings arising from the drought 
rep charles stenholm dtexas said getting money to family 
farmers quickly was a top concern as the house agriculture 
committee began debate today on drought relief with an eye toward 
floor action thursday 
members of congress and administration officials have raised 
concerns that the plan may go too far in helping large farm 
businesses and president reagan has said he wants a trim and 
tightly targeted relief bill 
there are a number of things we would like to see not added on 
to these bills agriculture secretary richard lyng said today on 
the nbctv today program the president does not want this 
bill to be a christmas tree with ornaments hung all over it 
the aid money would come from an estimated 9 billion in 
government savings in federal subsidies this year for some farmers 
who are benefiting from higher agriculture prices 
rep charles schumer dny a member of the house budget 
committee called for slower deliberation to ensure the destination 
of aid money is controlled 
were spending money not just on the family farmer but to 
help agribusiness said schumer i would say we can do a lot 
better job of honing where the money will go instead of doing it 
this thursday lets do it next thursday if we have to 
the drought relief bill has pitted some farm groups against each 
other with dairy producers squared off against beef producers and 
some consumer groups 
dairy producers want congress to increase milk price supports to 
counter the rising cost of feed for their herds and a decrease in 
production due to the drought and heat they argue that shoppers 
will pay higher food bills if the relief isnt granted 
the droughthurt dairy farmers deserve some federal aid such as 
feed assistance but legislating a higher dairy support price is 
not justifiable said public voice for food and health policy a 
national consumer group 
once again the dairy producers are going whole hog for a 
special deal that would cost americans more as taxpayers and as 
consumers said public voice executive director ellen haas and 
higher food prices impact hardest on those least able to pay 
mandating higher support prices for milk after feed costs slacken 
would once again encourage overproduction and government costs

analysts said many investors were avoiding making big 
commitments in advance of the commerce departments report due out 
wednesday on the gross national product for the second quarter of 
the year 
private estimates generally call for inflationadjusted gnp 
growth to come in at about the same 36 percent annual rate

anything much higher than that might intensify worries about 
inflation and higher interest rates brokers said 
today the government said new factory orders for durable goods

regarded as conclusive because most of the increase came in 
military goods a category that is often subject to wide 
monthbymonth fluctuations

reported sharply higher earnings for the second quarter 
sears roebuck on the other hand dropped to 35 as the

compared with revenue gains of more than 10 percent in each of the 
companys three other major operating units sears said in a 
statement 
sears reported net income of 3694 million or 98 cents per 
share for the three months ended june 30 compared with 3904 
million or 103 per share for the same period a year ago

responsive to changing consumer tastes 
secondquarter revenue from the allstate insurance group rose

usx corp said tuesday its secondquarter 
profits rose 29 percent as its steel division outperformed the 
energy operations that had carried the company for most of the 
decade 
its back to being a steel company again in terms of 
generating profits said steel industry analyst charles bradford of 
merrill lynch amp co usx reported it earned 213 million or 74 
cents per share up from 165 million or 56 cents per share in 
the second quarter of 1987

billion 
the companys uss division the nations largest steelmaker

oil amp gas corp operated at a profit of 104 million on sales of 
24 billion 
marathons operating profit was 120 million on sales of 22 
billion while texas oil amp gas lost 16 million on sales of 201 
million 
usx chairman david roderick said lower crude oil prices and 
higher exploration costs dampened marathons performance 
but said analyst bruce lazier of prescott ball amp turben the 
energy division is still profitable despite 15 a barrel oil 
its not a drag on earnings he said 
usxs diversified businesses showed profits of 69 million on 
sales of 389 million up from 5 million on sales of 235 million 
in the yearago period 
usx acquired marathon in 1982 and texas oil amp gas four years 
later during the period when steel was still down the cash flow 
from these operations helped support the whole debt structure 
lazier said

compared to 93 million or 20 cents per share a year earlier

polaroid corp said tuesday its will 
give due consideration to a buyout offer from shamrock holdings 
despite its ambiguity 
the polaroid board in a regularly scheduled meeting said it 
has retained shearson lehman hutton inc to study shamrocks 
proposal to acquire the company for 40 a share but polaroid 
reiterated that it believes its strategic plan is sound 
the instantfilm company said shamrocks interest may be 
contingent on the absence of an employee stock ownership plan and 
on access to funds in the polaroid pension plan 
shamrocks offer values polaroid at about 288 billion based on 
719 million shares outstanding but shamrock has indicated it 
might not proceed unless it manages to get the recent issue of 10 
million shares rescinded that would lower the value of the bid to 
248 billion 
polaroid said the recently established employee stock plan has 
purchased about 97 million shares of common stock from the 
company polaroid said that purchase as well as the dedication of 
pension funds to benefit employees and retirees cannot be reversed 
shamrock is a california investment firm controlled by roy 
disney nephew of the late walt disney and his family 
after disney unveiled his proposal polaroid management issued a 
statement reiterating its support for a restructuring plan 
announced earlier this month that inclues layoffs and costcutting 
we firmly believe that this is without doubt the right 
course for polaroid and for all of its shareholders employees

soybean futures prices plunged for the seventh straight day 
tuesday triggering massive selloffs and huge price declines in 
several other us commodity markets as speculators took profits 
today the commodities had their black tuesday said bert 
ruiz vice president in charge of coffee futures at balfour 
maclaine corp everybody was getting out of commodities 
grain futures plunged along with soybeans on the chicago board 
of trade while prices for coffee sugar livestock and silver 
futures plummeted on other exchanges energy futures declined 
moderately while stockindex futures advanced 
the commodity research bureaus index of 21 commodities skidded 
811 points to 24552 the steepest oneday drop for the closely 
watched inflation barometer since its record 97point fall on dec 
11 1980 
most chicago crop futures fell their permitted daily limits on 
better rain prospects in the midwest and reports that recent 
showers had helped the crops 
its a real panic right now said katharina zimmer grains 
analyst with merrill lynch capital markets in new york youve 
got people just saying let me out theyre scrambling 
the contract for august delivery of soybeans settled at 755 a 
bushel the lowest soybean futures price since may 26 when the 
july contract settled at 754 
the national weather services latest 6to10day outlook 
issued late monday predicted normal precipitation in most of the 
midwest during the first five days of next week 
and the joint agricultural weather facility said tuesday that 
scattered showers in the midwest during the past week had relieved 
drought stress in parts of the corn belt state agriculture 
officials generally reported improved corn and soybean conditions 
cathy leow assistant vice president of grain futures trading 
for thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york said the soybean 
market was probably nearing a bottom after losing nearly 240 a 
bushel in the past seven sessions 
i think the market has overdone the rains weve gotten and 
its still ignoring the fact that we have a phenomenal amount of 
crop damage she said 
the next official estimate of the drought damage will be the 
agriculture departments next crop report on aug 11 
wheat settled 19 cents to the limit 20 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 351 a bushel corn was 9 
cents to the limit 15 cents lower with september at 287 a

september at 244 a bushel soybeans were 18 cents to the limit 
45 cents lower with august at 755 a bushel 
sugar and coffee futures tumbled on new yorks coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange in massive selloffs 
analysts linked the selling to disappointment over the markets 
inability to break free of the bearish influence of the soybean 
market even when positive news surfaced 
the sugar market for example ignored bullish news that china 
had bought 250000 tons of sugar said judith ganes an analyst 
with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
she described the sugar selloff as massive massive 
liquidation and profittaking 
coffee analyst ruiz said heavy news coverage of the midwestern 
drought had persuaded many small investors to gamble on rising 
commodity prices and today was the bloodbath 
coffee for september delivery settled 484 cents lower at 
13295 a pound october sugar was 241 cents lower at 1206 cents 
a pound 
most most livestock and meat futures prices fell sharply on the 
chicago mercantile exchange

the limit 150 cents lower with august at 4530 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 115 cents to the limit 2 cents lower with 
august at 3480 cents a pound 
gold futures advanced but silver fell steeply in mostly 
technical trading on new yorks commodity exchange analysts said 
gold settled 510 to 560 higher with august at 43170 a troy 
ounce silver was 156 cents to 177 cents lower with july at 688 
a troy ounce 
most oil futures prices headed lower on the new york mercantile 
exchange in quiet directionless trading highlighted mainly by 
technical factors 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 9 cents 
lower with september at 1596 a barrel heating oil was 39 cent 
lower to 20 cent higher with august at 4381 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 30 cent to 106 cents lower with august at 
5016 cents a gallon

representatives of the united transportation 
union and chicago amp north western railway on tuesday failed to 
resolve a labor dispute that could halt rail service for 40000 
chicagoarea commuters 
negotiations in the presence of federal mediators adjourned for 
the day without an accord but a government official said he would 
not characterize the talks as unproductive 
theyre still talking said charles r barnes executive 
director of the national mediation board all i can really say is 
that mediation is in progress and as far as were concerned its 
going to go right down to the deadline well be available as 
long as we can help 
while the two sides met behind closed doors at the boards 
washington offices an illinois congressman introduced legislation 
to push them closer to an agreement and block a threatened aug 4 
strike campnw provides the principal daily rail service for about 
40000 commuters in the chicago area 
although i dislike intervention by the federal government we 
cannot stand idly by said rep john porter rill congress 
may act if they fail to do so 
porters bill would require the company and union to accept as 
binding the recommendations of a presidential emergency board 
appointed to examine the dispute if the two sides fail to reach 
agreement on their own by the strike deadline 
at issue is a plan by chicago amp north western a subsidiary of 
cnw corp to cut costs by eliminating the jobs of 1156 of its 
2600 union brakemen 
company spokeswoman leslie cleveland said the nations 
eighthlargest rail carrier could save 51 million a year and 
become more competitive if it reduced the size of its train crews 
from an engineer conductor and two brakemen to only an engineer 
and conductor in most cases 
the company contends that improved technology has made the jobs 
obsolete the union insists safety would be compromised without the 
brakemen and said the cuts would violate its contract 
the outcome of the dispute could set a precedent for crew sizes

south koreas imports of advanced 
technology for machinery and other projects rose 49 percent in the 
first half of this year from the same period last year government 
officials said wednesday 
officials at the trade and industry ministry attributed the 
sharp increase to changing corporate strategies to cope with the 
appreciation of the korean won and increasing labor unrest 
japan was the largest technology supplier with 181 
contributions followed by the united states with 90 and european 
nations with 46 the officials said 
machinery and electronics accounted for nearly 60 percent of the 
technology introduced during the period the total also included 
chemical and textile technology 
the figures indicate south korean corporations largely rely on 
japan for machineryrelated technology the united states for 
electronic and electric technology and european nations for 
chemical technology the officials said 
imports included 36 technological imports for factory 
automation almost three times the figure for the first half of 
1987 officials said the increase reflected corporate efforts to 
cut or freeze employment to reduce risks of labor protests 
labor unrest is a growing problem for south korean companies 
officials have reported more than 1000 labor strikes so far this 
year most were settled through negotiation but some were violent 
and resulted in the closings of plants in some cases for months 
the korean won has appreciated by about 18 percent against the 
us dollar in the past year making us products relatively less 
expensive

san diego gas amp electric co which last 
month said it intends to merge with an arizona utility has 
received a rival 2 billion merger offer from the parent of giant 
southern california edison co officials said tuesday 
the friendly stockswap offer from scecorp values sdgampe at about 
2 billion based on tuesdays closing stock price 
sdgampe said in a news release it was studying the offer but 
refused further comment scecorp recently formed as a holding 
company for edison said it would pursue the merger which it 
conditioned on sdgampe dropping its proposed merger with tucson 
ariz electric power co only if it were accepted by sdgampe 
management 
analysts and scecorp termed the potential deal a boon to both 
consumers and sdgampe stockholders 
they predicted san diego county consumers whose electricity 
bills are among the nations highest would get a piece of edisons 
large generating capacity the 48 million customers of a combined 
company they said would benefit because the enhanced purchasing 
power of a huge merged utility would win better prices for power 
bought from utility companies elsewhere in the west 
it makes total sense said edward tirello a securities 
analyst who follows both companies for shearson lehman bros inc 
in new york 
he said scecorps announcement said a goal of the merged 
companies would be to reduce sdgampes rates which presently are 25 
percent higher than edisons 
the proposal made privately on monday and announced by both 
companies tuesday calls for scecorp to exchange 115 shares of its 
common stock for each of the approximately 558 million sdgampe 
shares outstanding preferred and other classes of stock would be 
swapped at comparable rates 
management ranks would be thinned through attrition and 
voluntary retirement scecorp said 
any merger would require the approval of the state public 
utilities commission federal regulators and the stockholders of 
both companies puc deliberations would likely take a year 
sdgampes stock price rose 125 a share tuesday to close at 
3412 in new york stock exchange composite trading scecorps 
stock price was unchanged at 3137 
on june 13 sdgampe announced a proposed merger with the tucson 
electric power co in arizona that the companies valued at 57 
billion 
that merger would allow sdgampe primarily a buyer of power rather 
than a producer to take advantage of tucson electrics excess 
generating capacity and give tucson a ready market for its power 
scecorp said a merger with edison would be more logical than 
sdgampes prposed merger with tucson electric because the companies 
coverage areas border on each other and their lines are 
interconnected 
edison has ample power both selfgenerated and purchased from 
other utilities in the west to provide for sdgampe said spokesman 
robert hull the san diego companys rates have been pushed up by 
rising power prices and by the need to build highcost transmission 
systems to serve booming developments in the county 
edison serves 38 million customers across most of southern 
california sdgampe with 1 million customers provides electricity 
and natural gas in san diego county and electricity in a slice of 
orange county 
howard allen scecorp chairman and chief executive officer 
stressed in a letter proposing the merger that it was a friendly 
proposal 
we have no intention of attempting to acquire your company 
other than in a transaction approved by your board of directors 
allen said in a letter to sdgampe released by scecorp 
shearson lehmans tirello author of a book predicting that such 
mergers will form huge regional power companies said a combination 
would save the companies more than 200 million a year 
the ratepayer does real well in san diego simply because 
southern cal edison has said we want to bring you down to our 
level as quick as we can tirello said the southern cal 
edison ratepayer gets the advantage of increased buying power

delivery of west texas intermediate crude the nations benchmark 
grade settled monday at 1605 per barrel off 33 cents from

wholesale gasoline fell 85 cent per gallon to settle at 5122

traders said activity was light as market attitudes turned 
bearish about the cartels chances for limiting overproduction and

the markets strong move last week stemmed from bullish 
interpretations of a proposed ceasefire between persian gulf 
combatants iran and iraq and reports that members of the

pillsbury cos new top executive has been 
criticized as lacking vital restaurant experience to turn around 
the companys flagging burger king chain but philip l smith says 
hes just waiting to test his management ability 
the troubled food giant on monday plucked smith from rival 
general foods corp where he served as chairman the 54yearold 
smith also served as vice chairman of philip morris cos inc 
which acquired general foods in 1985 he begins his new job aug 1 
unlike general foods which has rested on the success of its 
oscar mayer meats and jello gelatin pillsbury has few highgrowth 
products analysts said 
smith has been a big cheese in a company with a lot of easy 
brands said stephen carnes a managing director at piper jaffray 
amp hopwood in minneapolis 
but at pillsbury smith will have to get down to trench 
warfare and he was never in that mode before carnes said 
minneapolisbased pillsbury the nations fourthlargest food 
conglomerate produces green giant vegetables haagendazs premium 
ice creams and van de kamps frozen fish 
of greater concern to some is smiths lack of experience in the 
restaurant business pillsburys restaurant unit which also 
includes steak amp ale and bennigans accounts for nearly half of 
the companys total revenue 
in the fiscal year ended may 31 restaurant sales slipped 5 
percent as burger king continued losing market share to rival 
mcdonalds corp despite a 200 million advertising campaign 
pillsburys weakness has been more related to restaurants and 
if they got a guru in restaurants they may have been better off 
said edward froelich an analyst at pershing amp co 
echoing those concerns pillsbury stock fell 175 a share to 
3512 monday on the new york stock exchange 
but smith is confident he can transfer his management skills to 
a new industry 
in a telephone interview he said i feel i have a very good 
understanding of the operating fundamentals in the restaurant 
business im going to have an opportunity first hand to test 
whether my judgments about whats important are right or not 
smith follows in the footsteps of the hardcharging william h 
spoor who returned from retirement to run pillsbury on an acting 
basis nearly five months ago when former chairman john stafford 
resigned under pressure 
analysts have criticized pillsbury saying it lacked clear and 
vital leadership in recent years 
its aftertax profit plummeted 62 percent in fiscal 1988 to 
693 million on sales of 62 billion largely because of a 
restructuring charge associated with the sale of its godfathers 
pizza chain and a number of other restaurant operations and 
consolidations 
general foods performance under smith is not immune to 
criticism either some analysts say 
smith a 22year veteran of general foods counters that between 
1984 and 1987 general foods growth rate went from relatively 
flat to the point where were growing better than 3 percent a 
year 
as for management style smith said he typically tries to 
determine what the basic direction is we should be going and then 
in a very aggressive and determined kind of way provide clear 
direction to the organization and insist on commitment and 
dedication 
despite speculation on wall street analysts are divided as to 
how attractive a takeover candidate pillsbury may be carnes for 
instance said pillsbury had too many wrecks in the ditch right 
now 
some experts have estimated the burger king chain could fetch as 
much as 15 billion if it were spun off as a separate company but 
carnes said the chain would bring only about 900 million because 
it was at least two years away from a turnaround 
smith said he would be surprised if selling burger king made 
any sense 
it has been very successful in the past and i have to believe 
there is room for a strong no 2 in the fastfood hamburger 
business he said 
philip morris stated that smiths position would not be filled 
the heads of the subisidarys domestic foods coffee and oscar 
mayer units would report directly to hamish maxwell philip morris 
chairman

down to more of a normal pace its a slight slowdown in the 
marketplace but still a pretty healthy rate cedergren said 
erratic sales last year exaggerate fluctuations among 
manufacturers from 10day period to period he said it all 
depends who had incentive programs going last year and who has them 
this year 
overall he said gm with 49 percent of the market in 
domestically made cars has halted an erosion in its market share 
ford with 317 percent and chrysler with 137 percent have 
shown slight gains partly at the expense of imports facing price 
disadvantages because of changing exchange rates cedergren said 
sales of imported cars and trucks are reported at the end of 
each month 
honda motor co sold 6344 of its usmade cars in the midjuly
