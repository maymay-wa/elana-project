former president reagan before he left office 
told congress that the united states would be unlikely to certify 
this year that pakistan does not possess a nuclear bomb the 
washington post reported 
the newspaper in its saturday editions said reagan certified 
last november that pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive 
device but attached a letter to house speaker jim wright dtex 
saying the administration was nearing its limits of being able to 
continue making the certification 
the congress should be aware that as pakistans capabilities 
grow and if evidence about its activities continue to accumulate 
this process of annual certification will require the president to 
reach judgments about the status of pakistani nuclear activities 
that may be difficult or impossible to make with any degree of 
certainty the post quoted reagan as saying 
without certification required annually under the law pakistan 
will not be eligible to receive us economic and military aid 
beyond the current fiscal year which ends sept 30 
the reagan administration budget for fiscal year 1990 includes a 
request for 621 million in assistance to pakistan part of a 402 
billions sixyear package 
the post quoting unnamed congressional sources said reagan 
administration officials had told lawmakers privately that pakistan 
was so close to building a bomb that it had been a very close 
call in renewing the certification last november 
the newspaper said it was not known if president bush will accept 
its predecessors conclusion about pakistans nuclear capabilities 
although bush is known to be extremely concerned about the problem 
of nuclear weapons proliferation 
in his letter to wright the post said reagan said he had made 
his best judgment on the basis of available information to the 
us government based on the standard set by congress regarding the 
pakistani nuclear program 
the standard he said is whether pakistan possesses a nuclear 
explosive device not whether pakistan is attempting to develop or 
has developed various relevant capacities 
reagan said in the letter that the united states remained 
extremely troubled by the continuing risk of a nuclear arms race 
between pakistan and india the post said

cambodian prime minister hun sen ended 
an unprecedented visit to thailand on friday declaring the 
killings must stop in his country 
hun sens visit to thailand which previously shunned his 
vietnamesebacked government and supports the guerrilla coalition 
fighting it is considered an important move to end the conflict 
we are starting to build a foundation said thai foreign 
policy adviser kraisak chunhavan 
hun sen said his trip was successful but he brushed aside 
reports that the visit at bangkoks invitation implies recognition 
of his government by thailand 
the question of recognition or nonrecognition does not matter 
the question is to stop the killing as soon as possible he said 
the unexpected talks reflects thailands worry that other parties 
that might not represent its interests are taking major initiatives 
on the cambodian issue 
in the past bangkok derided cambodias leaders as puppets of the 
vietnamese 
in new delhi india meanwhile vietnams foreign minister friday 
said cambodian peace talks in indonesia would be held as scheduled 
despite prince norodom sihanouks statement that he will not attend 
nguyen co thatch compared the peace talks beginning feb 19 with 
the final 15 minutes of a soccer match where everyone is trying to 
score a point if anyone misses the match it is his 
responsibility 
the match will continue i only hope prince sihanouk will 
change his stand thach told a news conference 
sihanouk said he will not come to the talks because hun sen has 
rejected his fivepoint cambodian peace plan 
the role of prince sihanouk is very important but he cannot 
decide everything thach said 
thach was in india along with nguyen van linh secretarygeneral 
of vietnams communist party who was the chief guest at indias 
republic day celebrations on thursday 
vietnamese troops invaded camdobia in late 1978 and installed a 
prohanoi government in phnom penh vietnam says it will pull out 
completely from cambodia by the end of 1990 or perhaps sooner if a 
political solution is reached 
the vietnamese are fighting a coalition of three major cambodian 
resistance groups the communist khmer rouge the noncommunist 
khmer peoples national liberation front of former cambodian prime 
minister son sann and followers of sihanouk 
the vietnamese invaded cambodia in 1978 to drive the khmer rouge 
from power from the 1975 takeover of the khmer rouge to its ouster 
an estimated 2 million of cambodias 8 million people died from 
khmer rouge executions famine and civil unrest

at least 9500 gallons of highly 
radioactive nuclear waste leaked from aging storage tanks on the 
hanford nuclear reservation in 1988 according to department of 
energy documents 
seven of the 149 aging singlewalled storage tanks on the energy 
departments plutonium production site were suspected of leaking 
last year the documents said 
more than 500000 gallons have spilled into soil around the 1 
million galloncapacity tanks since the late 1970s but the energy 
department contends the wastes do not enter groundwater posing no 
environmental or health risks 
its a drop in the bucket when you consider leaks of 
500000 gallons said jim thomas of the spokanebased hanford 
education action league on thursday but environmental 
contamination is still happening 
the wastes are byproducts of more than 40 years of plutonium 
production for nuclear weapons at the southcentral washington site 
generally considered the most contaminated of the does production 
sites 
estimates for cleaning up the site run to 57 billion over the 
next 50 years 
bill klink a spokesman for westinghouse hanford co the 
contractor that handles the storage tanks said there is little that 
can be done to prevent the leaks 
klink said 115000 gallons that leaked from a tank in 1973 have 
stayed within 165 feet of that tank the tanks are no longer used 
and liquids from at least 95 of them have been into 28 newer 
doublewalled tanks on the site 
however a large volume of highly concentrated nonpumpable but 
moist salt cake remains at the bottom of the tanks doe 
officials concede they are unsure how to permanently dispose of 
those wastes 
reports on file at the energy departments reading room in 
richland along with its news eleases show at least seven suspected 
leaks during 1988 
a may news release said that four tanks previously considered 
stabilized showed signs of declining liquid levels and estimated 
about 1500 gallons had leaked 
the reports say that in july the level of liquid wastes two 
storage tanks was found to have dropped 
one leak was estimated at 3000 gallons the report said the 
other lost about 5000 gallons 
another tank also showed a gradual decrease in the waste level 
indicating a possible leak or evaporation of residual liquids 
according to an october unusual occurence report

rats are scurrying into residents toilets 
with increased frequency as a major sewer project is completed 
around the city a city official says his solution flush them 
right back down 
bernie fritz animal control supervisor for the city said 
wednesday the rodent problem has worsened as the new system 
gradually eliminated the rats usual exits from sewers 
streetcorner catch basins 
they are seeking food and water fritz said the toilet has 
the biggest opening so the rodents swim through the water and pop 
their heads right up 
the elimination of catch basins that trap refuse swept into the 
sewers also has hurt efforts to control the rat population the most 
convenient and effective way to kill the rodents has been by putting 
poison in the catch basins fritz said 
the rat problem has not reached a crisis stage he said but the 
increased number of rodents in areas where catch basins have been 
eliminated has left public health employees seeking a new way to 
control them 
the sewer project now in its fourth year creates separate lines 
for sanitary and storm sewers the sewers had been combined which 
occasionally posed health and environmental problems 
fritz told the city councils public works committee wednesday 
that workers have begun attaching poison to pieces of plywood that 
they then hang from manholes into the sanitary sewers that run down 
city streets 
workers have begun a threemonth test to make sure the plan works 
and to better judge how much more money it might cost the city 
fritz said 
fritz said residents in the vicinity of sewer separation work can 
make sure basement toilet lids are shut and floor drains closed 
and if they find a rat in the toilet 
the best thing to do is shut the lid and flush them right back 
down he said

whats black and white and red all over made 
from puckered polyester stretch fabric and covered with starfish 
the winner of the ugliest tie in america contest of course 
this revolting piece of neckwear and 1400 other contest entries 
were on display thursday evening at the italian trade commission in 
new york which advertised the competition in esquire magazine as a 
way to promote a tasteful alternative silk designer ties in 
subdued colors imported from italy 
among the top 10 ugly ties brightly colored nylon and large 
geometric shapes were common the grand prizewinning black white 
and red number was submitted by 18yearold asim siddique of dallas 
who said he had a hard time choosing from his fathers large 
assortment of hideous neckwear 
i thought i had a pretty good shot at winning said siddique 
a freshman at collin county junior college reached at home by 
telephone once you see the collection you would think the odds 
are on your side 
siddique won 50 italian designer silk ties as grand prize and he 
plans to stick a few in his dads closet when hes not looking 
each of the 10 runnersup won 25 designer ties 
one of the runnersup geraldine friedman of upper montclair 
nj sent in a brown gold and silver tie bearing a design of 
medallions diamonds and black and white checks 
she said her husband wore it to their sons bar mitzvah 15 years 
ago but i doubt hes worn it since my husband has so many of 
these ugly ties that you cant believe 
among the other runnersup were a velour tie covered with 
multicolored hexagons submitted by kevin shippy of akron ohio and 
a greenandyellow number with large flowers of which the owner 
colin mackenzie of vancouver canada wrote i wore it with a pink 
shirt and love beads 
the neckwear that didnt win included ties bearing smile faces 
sailboats american flags pieces of a patchwork quilt peace signs 
and even a naked woman 
most of the ugly ties were also very wide five to six inches and 
more the ideal width for a tie these days according to the 
february issue of gentlemens quarterly is 3 to 3 inches 
italian trade commissioner mario costagna said that when he saw 
the winners i was about to faint he said he doubted there 
would be quite so many klunkers were the same contest held in italy 
costagna said americans bought more than 62 million worth of 
italian ties last year 
esquires editorinchief lee eisenberg said he made sure to 
wear a perfectly boring blackandwhite tie to the party 
announcing the winners he blamed the profusion of ugly ties not on 
their owners but on giftgivers 
looking at the hundreds of fashion disasters on display he said 
i find it kind of melancholy to me it represents 1200 sad 
fathers day mornings

an army of farm wives bolstered by the 
latest cholesterol concerns prepares to fan out across the country 
to tout the health benefits of us soybean oil 
some of the nations biggest food producers agree to stop using 
highly saturated imported tropical fats like palm and coconut oils 
in processed foods following a bristling private ad campaign 
meanwhile malaysia a major palm oil exporter gears up a public 
relations effort to combat what it calls vicious scare tactics 
that target its product 
a vegetable oil war has heated up to full sizzle 
at stake is the 3 billionayear vegetable oil market in the 
united states where the dominant domestic soy oil producers are 
squaring off against foreign competitors such as palm oil producers 
soy oil accounts for about 72 percent of the 16 billion pounds of 
oil sold annually according to the st louisbased american soybean 
association 
us department of agriculture figures indicate tropical oil 
imports have slumped in recent years coconut oil imports fell 18 
percent to 450000 metric tons in 1988 from 548000 metric tons in 
1986 while palm oil imports fell 37 percent to 175000 metric tons 
from 280000 metric tons in the same period 
right now farmers in the heartland are benefiting from public 
concern raised about highly saturated tropical fats saturated fats 
have been linked to an increase in blood cholesterol that causes 
heart disease 
the american consumer will be the big winner with healthy food 
products and the farmers will benefit too said gunnar lynum of 
the american soybean association we represent the good product 
and we must promote it 
tropical oil purveyors see it differently malaysia has hired the 
new yorkbased public relations firm hill and knowlton inc which 
plans a news conference in march to present scientific claims that 
palm oil is a balanced fat that reduces cholesterol and has other 
nutritional values 
some 1500 farm wives in turn plan their own public relations 
blitz with visits in the coming weeks to newspapers radio stations 
and local groups to tout soy oil theyll carry boxes filled with 
commercial cookies crackers and cereal that no longer contain 
tropical oils 
the american soybean association which is funded by roughly 
400000 soybean growers plans to introduce a soymark to 
identify products made with soy oil and has spent 400000 for 
promotions over two years 
one of the more visible assaults in the oil wars has been a 
blistering ad campaign by omaha neb businessman phil sokolof who 
spent 2 million to establish his private national heart savers 
association 
one of his ads showed a coconut bomb and cautioned consumers 
that their health was threatened by coconut and palm oils it listed 
popular foods containing tropical oils under the caption the 
poisoning of america 
so far a number of giant food processors including general 
mills inc pillsbury co quaker oats co kellogg co and keebler 
have announced they will drop tropical oils in favor of other 
vegetable fats in formulas for certain cookies crackers and 
cereals 
tropical oil producers claim the switching doesnt mean the 
battle is lost rick mcelheny senior vice president of hill and 
knowlton said the companies made a pragmatic business decision to 
switch from tropical oils but predicted they would reverse 
themselves 
because of all this furor and the vicious scare tactics they 
dont want to fight that battle said mcelheny theyll let us 
do the education then come back into the market at another time 
some researchers also say the issue is not as simple as the 
antitropical oil ads suggest 
they say a small percentage of saturated fat in the american diet 
comes from tropical oils most is from meat and dairy products 
they also say some recipes require soybean oil to be hydrogenated 
and that increases the level of saturated fat 
to lower the risk of heart disease they advocate a balance of 
saturated and unsaturated fats in the diet along with exercise and 
a reduction in total fat consumption 
a lot of this is industrial hype they are worried about the 
competition for the oil market said patricia johnston a food 
chemist at the university of illinois i dont think eating a few 
cookies with soybean oil is going to make that much difference

hospital officials say a janitor should have 
known better than to take a vacuum cleaner into a room where even 
jewelry and credit cards are prohibited because of a powerful magnet 
inside a diagnostic machine 
the janitor whom allegheny general hospital officials declined 
to identify thursday was struck monday by the vacuum as it was 
whisked several feet toward the magnetic resonance imaging unit 
which uses a magnetic field to record images from inside the body 
the janitor part of a crew stripping wax from the floor escaped 
with bruises and a cut 
we take great pains to tell and show our housekeeping staff 
what they should and should not take in there said shawn haag 
the hospitals vice president of operations 
employees are told to remove any metal including jewelry before 
entering the room they are warned that even information coded into 
the black magnetic strip on the back of credit cards can be 
scrambled by the magnet which is 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet 
the mri unit has a few scratches but we expect it has only 
minor damage haag said

the debate over the use of tropical oils in foods centers on the 
role fat plays in the diet research shows that eating a diet high 
in fat particularly saturated fats causes elevated blood 
cholesterol levels in many people high cholesterol levels increase 
the risk of heart disease 
despite the war of words between producers of the various oils 
nutritionists say one can still be at risk if the total percentage 
of fat consumed whether socalled good fat or not is too high 
here is a brief explanation of fats 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
all dietary fats are mixtures of three kinds of fatty acids 
saturated monosaturated and polyunsaturated 
according to some studies the relative health merits of 
different oils and fats are determined by the proportions of each of 
the three different kinds of fatty acids in the individual oil or 
fat 
however all fats no matter what the proportion of the three 
fatty acids they contain provide the same number of calories 9 per 
gram 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fats with a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids are 
generally solid at room temperature research indicates they 
increase blood cholesterol 
animal fats have a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids 
than most fats from plants animal fats also contain cholesterol 
examples of animal fat are chicken fat lard precreamed or animal 
fat shortening beef fat and butter 
tropical oils are derived from plants and therefore contain no 
cholesterol however they are high in saturated fatty acids some 
tropical oils actually have more saturated fatty acids than the 
animal fats examples of tropical oils are palm oil coconut oil 
and palm kernel oil 
hydrogenated fats are other fats of plant origin that have been 
processed or hydrogenated and have become saturated fats the 
degree of saturation is dependent on the processing but generally 
the harder the product is at room temperature the more saturated it 
is examples of hydrogenated products are hard shortenings hard or 
stick margarines and some kinds of peanut butter 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fats with a high proportion of monosaturated fatty acids do not 
increase blood cholesterol studies suggest the monosaturates 
particularly olive oil actually reduce levels of cholesterol in the 
blood examples of monosaturated fats are olive oil peanut oil and 
avocado oil 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fats with a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids are 
found primarily in plants and in some kinds of fish polyunsaturates 
reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels in 
the blood examples of polyunsaturates are sunflower oil corn oil 
soybean oil cottonseed oil safflower oil and some fish oils

a decade after their avantgarde exhibition in a 
beijing park shook up the moribund chinese art world a group of 
pioneering artists has reunited in this british colony for their 
first retrospective 
the youthful chinese artists known as the stars shot to 
prominence in 1979 when they marched through beijing to protest 
police interference in a show they had set up without official 
approval 
the authorities gave in and allowed the artists to stage the 
exhibition unprecedented in communist china that featured 
onceforbidden topics such as nudes abstracts and works of 
aesthetic rather than political content 
after another show in 1980 however the 30member group 
disbanded while some remained active in beijing others scattered 
around the globe settling in europe japan and the united states 
six of the artists were recently in hong kong for a retrospective 
featuring the work of 12 group members the exhibition opened 
earlier this month in the basement gallery of a posh residential 
neighborhood and is scheduled to run for five weeks before moving to 
taipei taiwan and paris 
sculptor wang keping said the stars were significant by showing 
that artistic activity in china need not be organized or approved by 
the ruling party earlier art was all the same he said 
individuality was the driving force behind the group agrees 
chang tsongzung the owner of hanart gallery who organized the 
retrospective the only common aim of the artists when they first 
started was that they wanted to be different from each other 
bo yun a teacher at the academy of arts and design in beijing 
whose abstract scroll paintings are part of the retrospective said 
artistic freedom in china has advanced since the groups landmark 
1979 exhibition but limitations remain 
there is no problem he said if you use a work of art to 
satirize an opponent of the government but if you mock the 
government im afraid that will pose a problem 
members of the stars also say beijing no longer allows them to 
exhibit as a group thwarting two attempts in 1983 and 1986 the 
reason believes bo is that the groups name has become a symbol of 
the democracy movement 
the retrospective includes works that date from the groups 
heyday including wangs buddhalike bust of chairman mao tsetung 
signifying the deification of the communist leader during the 
ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution it is called the idol 
other pieces adopt obviously current themes including the 
mixedmedia work safe sex by ai weiwei that features a 
prophylactic attached to a rain coat prices run from hundreds to 
thousands of dollars 
the works are as different as the paths the artists have taken 
since they disbanded after their beijing exhibitions 
wang 39 a softspoken man with a wisp of a goatee who joined 
the fanatical red guard during the cultural revolution moved to 
paris in 1984 convinced he could not develop further in china 
largely because of political pressure art freedom is only 
possible in a democratic country with human rights he said 
the sculptor lives and works out of a workshop he rents from the 
french government and has been featured at the museum of 
contemporary art in paris and the olympic sculpture park in seoul 
south korea 
wang recently wrote a political play titled the retrial of wei 
jingsheng a contemporary of the stars who led a fledgling 
prodemocracy movement in china before being jailed for 15 years in 
1979 wang said the play will be performed in paris this march 
bo 40 has remained in beijing although he is considering a move 
overseas he supplements his 150 yuan 40 a month salary by 
selling his paintings to foreigners in china and at overseas 
exhibits he owns a tiny fiat a sign of financial wellbeing in a 
country where private cars remain rare 
other stars on display in the retrospective include huang rui and 
ma desheng the two leaders of the group and li shuang who was 
arrested in 1981 and sentenced to two years of labor reeducation 
for incitement to debauchery when she was arrested she was 
living with a french diplomat but had not yet married him 
the exhibition includes caligraphy by zhong ahcheng also known 
as ah cheng whose fictional work the king of children was 
translated to film and premiered at the cannes film festival last 
year 
although the stars have spread throughout the world they have 
stayed in touch with one another from the heady days of 197980 was 
forged a feeling of brotherhood that has not diminished bo said

carlos saul menem a peronist and 
leading candidate for president drives race cars flies planes 
smiles easily wears his hair to his shoulders and likes to be 
photographed with showgirls 
the 53yearold provincial governor is colorful in a way that 
intrigues an electorate weary of the burdens of argentinas foreign 
debt energy crisis tripledigit inflation rising unemployment 
and political and social tensions 
union members and the poor are the core of menems peronist party 
constituency they ignore his gaffes and policy gaps and remember 
his promises of a brighter tomorrow his visits to their factory or 
village the naturalness with which he slips a gaucho poncho over 
his head and sips mate tea and the five years he spent in prison 
during the 197683 military dictatorship 
its easy for me to communicate with people menem said in an 
interview at his campaign office i talk with everyone i feel at 
home in the most humble places 
menems main rival in the elections set for may 14 is eduardo 
angeloz of the governing radical civic union 
the peronist has been the frontrunner since his upset nomination 
last july though his lead narrowed from 37 percent to 30 in a 
recent nationwide survey by the agency mora y araujo noguero and 
associates 
two other candidates trail by wide margins in that and virtually 
every other poll the number of undecideds remained high at 19 
percent 
menem and angeloz once classmates at the national university of 
cordoba law school in the 1950s are as different as the 
sidebyside provinces they govern 
angelozs cordoba is a rich populous industrial hub of 25 
million 
he prides himself on being a good administrator and supports the 
policies of the president raul alfonsin including privatizing 
argentinas costly public services paying off the foreign debt and 
basing economic growth on increased exports 
menems la rioja is a poor sparsely populated province of 
200000 where high technology is needed to coax seedless grapes and 
jojoba whose oils are used in hair preparations from desert sand 
and heat as many people who can work for the government 
menem was born and reared in la rioja the second of four sons of 
syrian immigrants who founded a successful vineyard and winery 
he notes with pride he has been reelected twice and does not 
dwell on the fact that his deficitridden province issues its own 
currency that is worthless elsewhere nor on the national 
implications of his solution to economic stagnation increased 
public spending 
eager for middle class support to push him past the 50 percent 
minimum he needs in the popular vote to win the election outright 
menem says he will honor the countrys foreign debt obligations and 
promote political stability social harmony and economic growth 
businessmen and professionals however are wary of his plans for 
such things as a social pact between labor capital and 
government the pact would he insists help set budget policy 
resolve wage disputes establish price levels 
many middleclass voters are troubled by the gaps between menems 
proposed policies and his personal opinions 
argentinas nearly 60billion foreign debt will be honored 
menem says although he maintains that repayment is a true 
immorality given the countrys need for investment capital he 
says he will seek to negotiate a fiveyear moratorium 
menem also attracts criticism for random remarks that rarely are 
substantiated or followed up for example he has said 
the peronist party might try to impeach alfonsin on grounds of 
mishandling the economy 
col mohamed ali seineldin a military rebel leader is a 
brilliant soldier 
fidel castro has dramatically improved life in cuba 
paraguays dictator gen alfredo stroessner is a good 
friend of argentina 
what kind of government can we expect from that candidate and 
that party asks congresswoman maria christina guzman the 
argentine people know well enough there is a great danger that that 
government would be simply the waiting room to chaos 
angeloz who also heads the independent federal confederation 
ticket on which ms guzman is the vice presidential candidate calls 
menems proposals demagogic magic prescriptions and 
simplistic 
yet menems rallies are well attended his appearances in 
massmarket magazines frequent 
in speeches and interviews he quotes the bible european 
statesmen and philosophers and his partys revered founder and 
namesake gen juan domingo peron president in 194655 and for 10 
months ending with his death in 1973

angry meatpackers are suing a newspaper for an 
article that said their sausage was so bad that even cats cant 
stomach it but editors said they turned to a furry fourlegged 
jury that proved their point 
twentyfour sausage experts dont eat it at all five only eat 
high quality sausage or out of extreme hunger only one the 
2monthold kitten mura you can say actually sits down to the 
sausage the weekly literaturnaya gazeta said in announcing the 
feline findings 
the dispute started with the literary weeklys story on june 15 
titled the cat doesnt know and was brought up recently in 
the dzerzhinsky regional peoples court 
in a complaint signed by yu m luzhkov chairman of the moscow 
agroindustrial complex officials demanded a retraction of the 
newspapers report that producers were breaking the law by putting 
protein additives in the sausage known in russian as kolbasa 
because of a shortage of meat in many soviet stores finding good 
quality sausage has become a fixation for many people a cartoon in 
an october edition of the satire magazine krokodil showed a line of 
shoppers standing outside a theater not to buy tickets but to buy 
the sausage for sale in the theaters buffet 
the case also shows that the more aggressive style of reporting 
by the soviet press under president mikhail s gorbachevs 
encouragement of greater openness is likely to get it into 
occasional legal trouble the tass news agency said this week a 
court had dismissed a lawsuit against a film producer by a 
biochemical plant near leningrad that objected to his documentary 
about pollution 
literaturnaya gazeta reported about its dispute with the sausage 
manufacturers in an article in this weeks edition titled may the 
cats judge us it gave no indication that the case had gone any 
further than the initial complaint 
it said that using the permission of state quality control 
officials to add protein additives the factories were grinding up 
the skin and bones of cattle and throwing them into the sausage 
animal blood protein paste blood plasma starch flour and 
emulsions of protein and fat also were part of the gray 
unappetizing mixtures churned out by the factories literaturnaya 
gazeta said 
blocks of frozen meat werent unfrozen or washed before being 
chopped and were happily thrown in with knots of wool and even the 
trademarks of the factories that produced these blocks nails sand 
and glass have fallen into the sausage it said 
to judge the validity of its first story the newspaper said it 
sought out the fauna cat lovers club in the dzerzhinsky region 
where it is being sued 
boris berenshtein fed some sausage to kuzya his 2yearold cat 
but kuzya didnt find any joy in it just the opposite he gave a 
look like a person saying whats that for what did i do that was 
so bad master 
it said another cat gavrila tests the sausage for the whole 
family of maria klyueva if gavrila eats it the whole family will 
if she turns up her nose so does the family 
in the end out of 30 cats only mura the kitten eats the sausage 
regularly literaturnaya gazeta said 
all kitties like mura must loyally love sausage thats the 
way it always has been since man thought up sausage but why the 
devil take them wont they eat it the newspaper asked and why 
do we continue to eat it

there is no sign of foul play in the 
simultaneous deaths of three of four quadruplets on jan 13 the 
fulton county medical examiner said thursday 
the infants kia mia and deanthony were found by their mother 
tonja l walker at about 5 am on jan 13 the fourth infant 
deandrea was hospitalized but now is in good health 
im not telling you its a matter of black and white its 
not said dr joseph burton the scales just tip away from the 
direction of foul play at this time 
burton said the simultaneous unexplained deaths may be unique in 
forensic science he said autopsies revealed that two of the three 
had respiratory problems that could have contributed to death 
the cause he said will be listed as sudden unexplained death 
in infancy he said he probably always will have haunting 
suspicions about the case 
he said autopsies ruled out meningitis which doctors suspected 
at first as the cause of death 
there were no signs of strangulation or suffocation we tested 
for sedatives tranquilizers pesticides arsenic strychnine 
cocaine marijuana the whole shooting match he said we tested 
blood tissues stomach contents 
neuroforensic experts reported finding an unusual change in a 
brain cell in the base of one infants brain the brain stem 
controls breathing 
investigators initially suspected foul play because of deaths 
happened together and because of contradictory statements made by 
adults in the house 
maj l dwayne hobbs of the forest park police department said 
the case remains open but inactive

a truck industry group says it hopes to put 
thousands of professionally trained new drivers on the highway under 
a new certification program for drivertraining schools aimed at 
countering an impending shortage of drivers and weeding out the bad 
institutions 
the professional truck driver institute of amrica announced 
thursday that it was certifying eight schools with facilities in 14 
states to train drivers and it hopes more schools will qualify 
prospective drivers pay up to 4000 for six to eightweek 
courses that generally include two weeks in the classroom and the 
rest of the time driving trucks on special roadways 
jim johnston an institute board member and president of the 
owneroperators independent drivers association said the 
certification program offers a good chance to get rid of some of 
the bad apples among training schools 
he said some of the more than 300 drivertraining institutions 
around the country rip off students and dont prepare them for the 
road 
schools had to meet 107 standards ranging from a minimum number 
of hours of training to maintenance of uptodate equipment 
institute president edward e kynaston told a news conference 
that about 50 schools applied for certification and even those that 
got it had to upgrade their programs to qualify 
the certifications recommended by a threemember independent 
panel that visited the schools are good for 18 months the first 
graduates from the certified courses would be qualifying in a few 
weeks kynaston said 
the newly certified schools can train about 15000 drivers a 
year he said more than 300000 new truck drivers hit the nations 
highways each year with drivers currently numbering about 3 million 
the schools are american truck driving school of elm mott texas 
chicago truck driving school diesel driving academy of shreveport 
la crete carrier corp of lincoln neb united states truck 
driving school of wheat ridge colo american transportation 
education centers of crystal city mo cummins professional 
training center of indianapolis and commercial training services of 
portland ore 
george beaulieu president of the american truck driving school 
said his institution trains about 5000 drivers a year using more 
than 200 tractortrailer trucks on campuses in texas and michigan 
he said more women government retirees and recent immigrants are 
applying to be truck drivers as the industry faces a shortage of 
trained drivers 
joseph passananti of the chicago school which trains about 750 
drivers a year with 10 trucks said truck drivers who used to be 
the knights of the road have been suffering from a poor image in 
recent years 
but he said better equipment better pay and better working 
conditions including sometimes telephones in the truck cab are 
making the job more attractive 
truck drivers earnings range from 25000 and 60000 a year 
said thomas j donohue president of the american trucking 
associations inc he said tougher standards for drivers increased 
shipping demands and slower growth in the 2535 age group which is 
the most likely group from which drivers come are causing the 
driver shortage 
the professional truck driver institute is an organization set up 
by the trucking industry in 1985 to promote driver training and 
safety

government forecasters say us dependence on 
foreign oil is likely to reach historic peaks in the 1990s as 
consumption grows and production slides 
imports may account for more than half the nations oil 
requirements by 1994 up from 37 percent last year the energy 
information administration said thursday 
in a forecast to the year 2000 the agency also said the 
projected import surge would not necessarily make the nation more 
vulnerable to a supply crisis 
oil imports by 1994 may reach 99 million barrels a day or 55 
percent of supplies and by the end of the century the figures could 
be 11 million barrels a day or 59 percent 
the highest dependence on record was in 1977 when 46 percent of 
oil supplies were imported 
many oil industry officials particularly the smaller 
independent producers hurt most by sharp drops in world oil prices 
since 1986 have urged the bush administration to take action to 
limit the growth in oil imports they contend that further harm to 
the domestic industry would weaken national security 
the energy information administration report said that despite 
the trend toward rising imports there is no clear and simple 
answer to whether the nation was becoming more vulnerable to 
potential disruptions of world oil supplies 
it said us energy security was being preserved partly by a more 
competitive global energy market and by the growth in national 
stockpiles of oil 
the existence of substantial oil stockpiles in the united states 
japan west germany and other importdependent nations should even 
be adequate to discourage some countries from attempting to use such 
a disruption to achieve political objectives the report said 
the report also said 
despite a current surplus of capacity for generating 
electricity there is likely to be a need for substantial fresh 
construction of power plants in a relatively short time 
coal will remain a mainstay of the domestic energy industry 
accounting for 25 percent of the nations total energy consumption 
by the year 2000 up from 23 percent last year 
oil prices will move erratically for several years as opec 
struggles to restrain its production prices are likely to remain 
near current levels of about 15 a barrel at least until 1990 then 
begin moving gradually higher 
by 1994 the world oil price is likely to be 1890 per barrel in 
1988 dollars rising to 28 by the end of the century the current 
price is about 15 a barrel 
natural gas production will grow at a slower rate than 
consumption forcing the nation to import increasing amounts of gas 
much of the extra imports will come from canada

one of two policemen killed in a shootout 
with a transient who grabbed an officers pistol was fatally wounded 
by a shotgun blast not the pistol said a coroners report that 
apparently contradicted the police account 
the report raised the possibility that the officer was caught in 
crossfire during last fridays shootout in which other police 
officers some armed with shotguns killed the gunman 
thousands of police officers attended a memorial service thursday 
for the two slain officers gordon silva 39 and gene simpson 45 
afterward police spokesman officer don tietgens said police chief 
joseph mcnamara would have no immediate comment on the coroners 
report 
the chief thinks it is inappropriate to comment because of the 
fact that we just buried fellow officers he said until the 
results of lab tests and ballistics tests are turned in and our own 
investigations are complete we will have no comment 
police had reported that silva and simpson were both fatally shot 
by dale randy connors who had wrestled away simpsons 357caliber 
magnum pistol during a brief struggle near a downtown doughnut shop 
connors was later identified as a transient and petty criminal who 
associated with the homeless 
simpson was shot in the head with his service revolver but 
silvas death certificate conflicts with the initial police version 
of how he was killed connors only carried the pistol during the 
shootout and apparently did not have access to a shotgun 
silvas death certificate listed shotgun pellet wounds to the 
abdomen as the cause of death john manok chief investigator for 
the santa clara county coroner said thursday 
he added that his office has not issued its complete report in 
the case we are looking at the middle of next week for that 
mank said 
two other wounds to silvas legs were superficial said manok 
adding it could not be determined whether the superficial wounds 
were from a pistol 
part of the shooting was filmed by santa clara university 
students who were in the area taping a documentary for a class 
the blurred jumpy videotapes audio track recorded 26 shots in 
3 minutes with 21 of those coming during the final 30second 
volley that killed connors 
the shooting began with a noontime call of a disturbance at 
winchells donut house in downtown san jose where connors was 
reportedly threatening people and went into the street to direct 
traffic

scientists looking at nearly a century of 
records say they cant discern any warming trend to confirm the 
threat of a greenhouselike heating of the earth 
the heat and drought of last summer helped fuel concern about the 
greenhouse theory of climate change even though scientists 
cautioned that one unusual season didnt necessarily prove a 
longterm trend 
now researchers at the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration report that they have been unable to find evidence of 
any overall temperature increase for the united states 
the most important result of this study is that there is no 
statistically significant evidence of an overall increase in annual 
temperature or change in annual precipitation for the contiguous 
us 18951987 concluded the authors of the new analysis 
another leading climate expert however cautioned that the 
findings dont necessarily knock down the greenhouse theory 
james e hansen of the goddard institute for space studies in new 
york said that the new analysis is limited to the united states 
its not inconsistent with the greenhouse theory for some parts 
of the world to be warmer others cooler and some to show no change 
at this point he said in a telephone interview by the mid1990s 
he went on the data should show a clearer trend 
assuming the numbers are right they are not inconsistent 
with the greenhouse warming theory responded john topping of the 
climate institute also pointing out that the study covers only the 
united states 
the new study published in the january edition of geophysical 
research letters showed no significant change in the nations 
average temperature or precipitation between 1895 and 1987 
according to the greenhouse theory the growing amounts of carbon 
dioxide and some other gases in the atmosphere tend to trap heat 
from the sun warming the earth in somewhat the same way glass warms 
a greenhouse 
this drew widespread attention last summer as hot dry weather 
parched fields across much of the nation cooler fall temperatures 
dropped the national average for the year back to near normal 
however 
scientists at last months meeting of the american geophysical 
union in san francisco expressed skepticism about whether the effect 
has already begun 
in addition some climate experts contend that warmer weather 
would evaporate water to generate more clouds and that those clouds 
would then deflect some incoming sunlight and cool the earth 
and a study published in the journal of climate in november 
disclosed that an apparent climate warming of as much as 1 degree 
fahrenheit could be the fault of the heat generated by growing 
cities since many weather stations are located in urban areas 
the new report was compiled by kirby hanson of the noaa air 
resources laboratory george a maul of the noaa atlantic 
oceanographic and meteorological laboratory and thomas r karl of 
the national climatic data center 
they looked at both temperature and moisture since the greenhouse 
theory holds that a warming of the climate would likely result in 
changes in rainfall patterns causing drought in some areas 
the study analyzed records from some 6000 observing points over 
93 years and found considerable yeartoyear variation but no 
longterm trend other than an increase in precipitation in the 
fall between 1970 and 1987

a virus similar to the aids virus is closely 
associated with the crippling disease multiple sclerosis according 
to us and swedish researchers using a sensitive genetic test of 
blood cells 
e prem kumar reddy a researcher at wistar institute in 
philadelphia said a study published today in the journal science 
provides direct proof that the human tlymphotropic virus or 
htlvi is involved in the ms disease process 
although htlvi and the human immunodeficiency virus hiv that 
causes aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome are not causing 
the same disease their basic mechanisms of infection are very 
very similar reddy said 
something that works for hiv should also work for htlvi 
reddy said in a telephone interview 
reddy and his associates at wistar proved that there is htlvi in 
the blood cells of multiple sclerosis patients by performing 
extremely precise assays for the genetic pattern of the virus as a 
control similar assays were performed on blood samples from 20 
healthy people 10 from sweden and 10 in philadelphia 
the htlvi genetic pattern was found in each of six multiple 
sclerosis patients tested at the university of lund in sweden of 
the 20 healthy subjects reddy said the htlvi genetic pattern was 
in only one 
reddy said the research proves that htlvi is associated with 
multiple sclerosis but it does not prove that the virus by itself 
is the cause of the disease 
dr byron waksman vice president for research and medical 
programs at the national multiple sclerosis society in new york 
said the study could lead to an important shift in how we approach 
and treat this disease but the study does not settle a debate 
among experts on the precise disease process of ms he said 
he said some experts believe the crippling disease is an 
autoimmune process in which the immune system for unknown 
reasons attacks the body others said waksman believe that ms is 
caused directly by a virus and still others suggest it is a 
combination of both processes 
its an exciting lead but clearly you need confirmation from 
other laboratories said dr dale mcfarlin a ms expert at the 
national institutes of health 
he said much work still needs to be done to understand the htlv 
virus and its relationship to ms the virus he said is implicated 
in a number of diseases including leukemia and a nervous system 
disorder called tropical spastic paraparesis that resembles ms 
and yet said mcfarlin the vast majority of people infected 
with htlv never develop any of these diseases this suggests he 
said that other factors such as genetic patterns are involved in 
these diseases 
collaborating with reddy in the study were four other scientists 
at wistar a private research laboratory and magnhild 
sandbergwollheim of the university of lund in sweden 
science is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science 
multiple sclerosis is a chronic incurable disease that attacks 
the brain and other parts of the central nervous system the disease 
strikes most frequently between the ages of 20 and 40 and there are 
about 250000 ms patients in the united states 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections 
as of jan 9 1989 aids had been diagnosed in 83231 americans 
of whom more than half or 46678 have died since june 1 1981 
according to the cdc no one is known to have recovered from the 
disease

campbell soup co should have mentioned the 
sodium content of its soups in advertisements that claimed they were 
good for the heart because of being low in fat and cholesterol the 
federal trade commission says 
saying that the companys magazine ads a year ago were false 
misleading or deceptive the ftc issued a complaint thursday 
against campbells which said it would contest the allegation 
the commission also charged that campbells had no substantiation 
for its implied claim that most of its soups make a positive 
contribution to a diet that reduces the risk of heart disease 
healthrelated information is important to consumers and 
advertising is a principal source of that information said 
william macleod head of the commissions bureau of consumer 
protection this is why the commission demands accuracy in 
advertising 
the offending ads ran in magazines in the winter of 1988 and then 
were dropped for a new campaign company spokesman david hackney 
said the decision to end the ads had nothing to do with the 
commissions investigation 
macleod singled out a twopage ad that said campbells soups were 
high in fiber high in calcium when made with milk and low in fat 
and cholesterol 
a serving of regular chicken noodle or new special request 
with onethird less salt is low in fat and has just 15 milligrams 
of cholesterol and thats especially good to know because research 
tells us that a diet low in fat and cholesterol may help reduce the 
risk of some forms of heart disease the ad said 
campbells sells about twothirds of the 22 billion worth of 
soup sold in stores every year 
the commission proposed that campbells be required to disclose 
in its advertising the exact sodium content of any soup having more 
than 500 milligrams per eightounce serving if the company claims 
heart benefits for it 
there was no request that the disclosure say anything about the 
effects of sodium 
many manufacturers and cooks add it to food for better taste 
its in dispute just how much sodium part of ordinary table salt 
is bad 
humans need only 200 milligrams a day but most americans probably 
get 4000 to 6000 milligrams the national academy of sciences said 
in a recent report urging people to hold down intake to somewhere 
between 1100 to 3300 milligrams 
in many people extra salt makes their blood pressure shoot up 
but in others blood pressure remains constant over wide variations 
in salt intake 
hackney said campbell would present experts that would dispute 
any linkage between dietary sodium and high blood pressure we 
stand behind our advertising and dont think its misleading he 
said 
in a later statement from corporate headquarters campbells said 
it is the only major soup manufacturer to list sodium content along 
with other nutritional information on the label 
not counting such variations as its chunky line or its two 
kinds of lowsodium soups campbells makes 70 different condensed 
soups in the familiar redandwhite cans 
macleod declined to say what the commission staff knows about 
their average sodium content but a quick inspection of six on a 
supermarket shelf showed sodium ranging from 710 milligrams in 
turkey vegetable to 910 milligrams in chicken noodle the 
supermarket house brands were similar

many buildings in earthquakeprone areas 
should be constructed atop rubber shock absorbers to protect office 
contents such as computers as well as human lives experts are 
telling major us corporations 
its not adequate anymore to just think about stopping building 
collapse says robert j kuntz president of the california 
engineering foundation a nonprofit education group that sponsored a 
twoday conference to make engineers aware of the shock absorbers 
youve got to protect the hundreds of millions of dollars of 
equipment inside these buildings and allow the enterprise to remain 
functional he said this goes beyond protecting life and limb 
kuntz and others urged companies in quakeprone areas nationwide 
to consider building new low and mediumrise buildings and even 
refurbishing old ones using seismic base isolation which 
involves placing large flexible shock absorbers between a building 
and its foundation 
the meeting which ends today drew about 100 engineers and 
officials from major corporations and government institutions 
including the air force rockwell international trw and 
hewlettpackard co it was sponsored by kuntzs group the national 
science foundation the california manufacturers association and 
others 
participants took buses to nearby rancho cucamonga to tour san 
bernardino countys 4yearold 32 million foothill communities law 
and justice center 
the fivelevel courthouse was built atop 98 cylindershaped 
rubber shock absorbers or bearings which measure 30 inches across 
by 17 inches high and are made of alternating layers of rubber and 
steel said douglas way of base isolation consultants the san 
francisco firm that designed the system 
it was te first us building and largest in the world to be 
built on the shock absorbers and was designed to withstand a 
great quake measuring 83 on the richter scale on the san 
andreas fault 12 miles away 
engineers usually make buildings resistant to quakes by 
strengthening them and bolting them down solidly but even if 
buildings resist collapse the businesses inside can be crippled by 
damage to computers and other equipment kuntz said 
the shock absorbers are appropriate only for buildings up to 
about 12 levels said civil engineer professor james kelley of the 
university of california at berkeley taller buildings vibrate more 
slowly during major quakes and dont require the devices which also 
might make the skyscrapers vulnerable to tipover he said 
japan now has about 20 buildings on shock absorbers salt lake 
city has two new zealand one and a planned university of southern 
california hospital also will be built upon them kelly said 
less advanced shock absorbers unacceptable by us standards 
are beneath some buildings in china france mexico and yugoslavia 
he added 
rep george brown jr dcalif criticized the american 
construction industry for failing to keep competitive with japanese 
builders in using the shock absorbers 
the united states has done quite well in making new advances in 
earthquake engineering we have not done as well in using this new 
knowledge to make buildings safer brown said adding they should 
be used in new buildings and nuclear power plants 
at this rate in 20 years well just buy 
earthquakeresistant buildings from japan he added 
many corporations havent considered base isolation technology 
because it is new and expensive kuntz said 
kelly said the shock absorbers add about 5 percent to the cost of 
a new building but that the devices buffer a building from shaking 
so much that costs of reinforcement could be reduced 
the prevention of damage also makes them economical said 
alexander tarics president of base isolation consultants 
major and great quakes those measuring 7 to 8 or more on the 
richter scale could cause 20 billion to 100 billion damage in 
southern california and 40 billion to 60 billion in losses in 
northern california not to mention thousands of deaths according 
to a summary of previous government reports by the engineering 
foundation

john tower told senators it would be 
unrealistic to think star wars could shield everyone in the 
country from a nuclear holocaust an outlook that differs from 
former president reagans optimism about the spacebased missile 
defense system 
cautioning that he didnt want to get out in front of 
president bushs statements on the strategic defense initiative the 
defense secretarydesignate said that sdi was part of an effort to 
move nuclear strategy from an offensive to a defensive focus 
but he cautioned it remains to be seen whether that is a 
realistic objective 
on the second day of confirmation hearings thursday before the 
senate armed services committee tower also said he will be 
impartial despite having received more than 1 million in consulting 
fees from seven defense contractors 
i intend to be very very objective the former texas senator 
told the panel he once chaired there will always be people who 
will be skeptical i learned during the past two months that not 
everybody loves me 
tower made his remarks about sdi under questioning from sen al 
gore jr dtenn who said towers pessimism represents a view 
markedly different from the publics perception of president 
reagans advocacy of a perfect defensive umbrella 
reagan launched the program five years ago and said it should be 
aimed at building a ballistic missile defense bmd that would 
protect americans from soviet nuclear attack 
bush said during last falls campaign that he favored deployment 
of a limited sdi system as soon as possible 
tower told the committee to begin with i dont believe that 
we can devise a bmd umbrella that can protect the entire american 
population from nuclear incineration i think thats unrealistic 
discussing his consulting work tower testified that over a 
threeyear period he received 1028777 in fees from defense 
contractors including such industry giants as rockwell 
international martinmarietta and ltv 
other companies were british aerospace hicks amp associates 
jefordmcmanus international inc and textron inc 
tower said he broke his ties with defense companies on dec 1 
last year one day after learning from bushs transition staff that 
he was under serious consideration for the defense post 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the committee expressed his 
concern about towers former ties saying the difficulty here is 
not that you have worked for a contractor as a consultant but a 
number of them five or six or seven of the major corporations 
if you were to recuse not involve yourself on all of them 
you couldnt be secretary of defense he said 
in his testimony tower also urged congress to tighten 
revolvingdoor laws to prevent officials from profiting 
unfairly unethically or illegally or inordinately if they move 
between pentagon and industry jobs 
but he cautioned congress that it should write such laws 
carefully enough so that honest hardworking people who might want 
to engage in public service are not summarily proscribed from 
working at the pentagon 
under questioning from sen carl levin dmich about the soviet 
unions military superiority tower acknowledged that at this 
moment they have the capability to prevail in an invasion of 
western europe 
hearings on towers nomination resume on tuesday when 
conservative paul weyrich chairman of coalitions for america and 
william g phillips president of the national council for 
industrial defense are scheduled to testify against the nomination

jesse jackson broke bread with attorney general 
dick thornburgh and emerged saying he had great respect for his 
integrity and for his commitment to enforcing civil rights laws 
jackson contrasted the justice department under thornburgh a 
longtime member of the naacp to the department under former 
president reagans earlier appointees that sometimes attempted to 
sabotage civil rights by failing to enforce laws protecting 
minorities 
in some sense for the first time in eight years the lights 
have been turned back on in the justice department and hopefully the 
dust will be cleared from the books said jackson 
the civil rights activist said thornburgh asked him during the 
lunch thursday to submit a list of people he would recommend to head 
the justice departments civil rights division 
he said he urged thornburgh to appoint someone who is credible 
and reputable with a commitment to fulfill the laws passed in 1965 
earned with the blood of modest people 
there must be a facing up to the fact that the jugular vein of 
our democracy is justice jackson said 
jackson said that thornburgh is committed to enforcing civil 
rights law unlike william bradford reynolds who headed the 
division under the reagan administration 
there is a considerable gap between the positions of mr 
reynolds and attorney general thornburgh and their life history and 
their commitment to social justice said jackson who was an 
unsuccessful candidate for the democratic presidential nomination 
last year 
i have happened to know attorney general thornburgh for some 
time jackson told reporters i have great regard for his 
integrity for his intelligence and for his courage and for his 
commitment 
thornburgh standing next to jackson at a news conference after 
the lunch said this department is committed as is the 
president to the full enforcement of the civil rights laws of the 
united states and the full enjoyment of equal opportunity by all of 
its citizens 
we will differ i am sure from time to time as to how that 
can best be accomplished the attorney general said 
but i think it would be foolhardy not to sit down and counsel 
together the ideas that rev jackson gave us today will get full 
consideration and we hope to continue the discussion 
jackson also said he urged thornburgh to ask president bush to 
convene a white house conference on civil rights to take a 
comprehensive look at reviving and renewing our quest for justice in 
the country 
a senior justice department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said thornburgh would relay jacksons proposal to bush 
jackson was accompanied by rep john conyers dmich delegate 
jaime fuster of puerto rico and chairman of the house hispanic 
caucus and several other civil rights leaders

soil erosion from water runoff and wind is the 
main enemy of american farmers and consumers and will rank at the 
top of the agriculture departments hit list the rest of this 
century 
erosion control remains the top priority because of all the 
problems addressed by usda conservation programs erosion is the 
most widespread threat to longterm agricultural productivity and 
environmental quality the department reported thursday 
erosion is outpacing soil replenishment passing the 
tolerance level accepted by most conservationists on an 
estimated 277 million acres of nonfederal rural land an area 
larger than california and texas combined 
about 173 million of these acres are cropland on which erosion 
was 23 billion tons in 1982 the report said if left 
unchecked erosion will reduce the ability of the soil to produce 
needed food and fiber 
further it said the silt from eroded soil can damage land air 
and water total costs are virtually impossible to pinpoint but one 
study estimates that water erosion alone costs the nation 3 billion 
to 13 billion each year 
the report updated the departments national conservation program 
developed in 1982 in response to the soil and water resources 
conservation act of 1977 the law or rca required longrange 
conservation planning by the department for programs affecting soil 
and water conservation on nonfederal lands 
assistant secretary george dunlop said that the protection of 
water quality ranks with erosion abatement in the agriculture 
departments list of priorities in 1982 he said the priorities 
were erosion control and water conservation and upstream flood 
control 
in the early 1980s there was a drop in world demand a global 
recession and serious debt problems in many importing countries at 
the same time world agricultural production was rising and 
surpluses grew 
one result was renewed attention to conservation and the 1977 
laws process for looking ahead to solving soil and water problems 
the report said 
the 1985 farm law included authorization of the conservation 
reserve program or crp which enables farmers to take highly 
erodible land from crop production for 10 years and protect it with 
grass and tree plantings 
congress set a goal of 40 million to 45 million acres in the crp 
by the end of 1990 about 282 million acres have been enrolled in 
the program 
according to the report the crp already has had a major impact 
on erosion and is currently saving 530 million tons of soil 
annually by 1995 it said the fully operational crp is expected to 
save 800 million tons of soil per year thus reducing total us 
erosion losses on nonfederal land by 15 percent 
the 1985 law also included requirements that farmers have 
conservation plans completed to help protect land and water 
resources or risk losing price supports and other federal benefits 
robert j gray policy director for the private nonprofit 
american farmland trust said the usda figures on saving soil are 
impressive but that no one has been able to really spot check the 
fields to determine if the claims are correct 
the jury is still out on how effectively theyre going to 
enforce these conservation compliance plans gray said in a 
telephone interview they claim that theyre going to have all the 
plans in place by 1990

soybean farmers are still being affected by 
crop prospects in brazil and argentina according to an agriculture 
department report 
combined production of the two countries is forecast at 31 
million metric tons up 33 million tons from last year the 
departments economic research service said thursday 
however prospects are more uncertain this year because of 
delayed plantings in both countries and dry weather especially in 
argentina the report said the size of the south american crop 
will influence soybean prices and us plantings in 1989 
us soybean production last year the lowest since 1976 dropped 
to about 154 billion bushels or 419 million tons a metric ton is 
about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels of soybeans

a select group of scientists whose military 
work is often cloaked in secrecy is reviewing research that 
concluded a linear accelerator may be a cheaper safer and quicker 
way than building new reactors to produce nuclear weapons material 
the jason group which the defense department has consulted on 
projects involving complex technology since the late 1950s was 
briefed on the research late last week in la jolla calif 
participants included researchers from los alamos and brookhaven 
national laboratories and the westinghousehanford co who for more 
than a year have been exploring the possibility of using an 
accelerator to produce tritium 
in a summary report prepared last summer they said an 
accelerator could be built more quickly than a reactor would be 
cheaper to construct and operate and would produce far less 
radioactive waste 
but department of energy officials have said the linear 
accelerator technology is not mature enough to justify changing 
the departments plan to build two new tritiumproducing reactors 
the energy departments existing tritiumproducing reactors at 
the savannah river complex in south carolina have been beset with 
safety problems and are currently shut down 
the schedule for restarting them continues to slip leading to 
warnings that a tritium shortage may develop the radioactive 
substance must be periodically replenished in nuclear warheads 
william kato chairman of the nuclear energy department at 
brookhaven and one of those who attended the jason briefing said 
the groups members seemed to be very enthusiastic and highly 
supportive of the accelerator alternative 
kato said the normal practice of the jason group would be to 
write a report that i assume would go to the department of defense 
and department of energy 
the jason program is administered by mitre corp a nonprofit 
engineering and research firm which acts as a defense department 
think tank and is often engaged in classified programs a mitre 
spokeswoman confirmed that the briefing took place 
the jasons have not yet decided whether or not to give the 
matter further consideration said joanne briggs 
an accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic 
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target 
in this case lithium clad in aluminum the resulting collision 
produces tritium a radioactive gas 
chris sankey an energy department spokeswoman said thursday 
that as a longrange option to augment not replace our plans for 
two new production reactors we may undertake additional evaluation 
of the accelerator concept that would take place when a concrete 
proposal is presented to the department 
ms sankey said that while the department supports 
stateoftheart technology for our programs we cant appropriate 
money and base decisions on what we think is going on in the 
scientific community 
the department has announced plans to build new tritiumproducing 
reactors at savannah river and the idaho national engineering 
laboratory in idaho falls 
the jason group comprises about 55 scientists who do 
sophisticated scientific research and analysis in support of the 
national security community said jan bodanyi a spokeswoman for 
the defense department 
the jason group has studied everything from parts of the star 
wars missile defense system to ways to detect plastic guns she said

government lawyer kristina nygaard carries work 
home at night legal papers dealing with the licensing of 
hydroelectric power projects she spreads them over the dining room 
table 
morton klevan says he is proud of his work for the government 
but wouldnt advise his kids to go into it not unless they made a 
bundle first he owns a house he says he couldnt afford to buy 
now 
james mcgovern is assistant to the chief counsel of the irs he 
has seen five commissioners come and go he is very proud of his 
work does he think the public unfairly beats up on the civil 
service no comment on that he says 
they were among three government careerists the top of the 
cream senior civil servants earning between 67800 and 80000 a 
year who as they sat listening to their new boss thursday tried 
to explain to a reporter why they think they should make more 
in a nutshell they like the work but people with commensurate 
responsibilities on the outside earn far more 
im not unhappy i have made a free choice to stay in 
government said klevan but i had to borrow money to send my 
kids to college 
they were in the audience thursday when president bush drove 
around the corner to constitution hall to address 3000 of the 8000 
members of the governments senior executive service the career 
managers who stay when political appointees come and go 
he didnt tell them what they most wanted to know whether he 
would recommend that congress accept reject or modify the 
substantial pay raise thats before congress 
it would give congress and top officials 50 percent increases 
and top civil servants raises as big or almost as big a senior 
executive earning 67800 would go to 80000 one at the top 
getting 80000 would go to 120000 
but bush told his audience the next best thing that he 
considered himself one of them 
what we do have in common is that each of us is here to serve 
the american people he said each of us is here because of a

james a baker iii faced a major decision on 
his first working day as secretary of state deciding to evacuate 
the handful of us officials threatened by the spreading civil war 
in afghanistan 
baker remained out of the public eye at the agency on thursday 
but the increased turmoil in kabul required his immediate attention 
the secretarys circumspect day stood in sharp contrast to the 
last change of administration in 1981 when secretary of state 
alexander haig entered the building and boasted that president 
reagan had annointed him the vicar of american foreign policy 
a us official speaking on condition he not be named said 
bakers predecessor george shultz had decided to leave the 
decision on whether to close the us embassy in kabul to the new 
administration baker moved the morning after taking his oath of 
office the official said 
the decision to evacuate the us employees came as the soviets 
continued to pull out troops that have been in the country since 
1979 and as fighting has increased between the promoscow government 
and usbacked rebels battling for control 
although a more formal swearingin ceremony is scheduled for this 
evening at the white house baker had been sworn in privately 
wednesday evening at the state department hours after he was 
confirmed by the senate as president bushs chief adviser on foreign 
policy 
baker one of bushs closest friends and the man who managed the 
final months of his campaign for the white house kept a low profile 
during his first working day and no schedule was released about his 
activities 
department spokesman charles redman declined to specify any of 
bakers plans for the day except to say that he was getting 
established thats his first priority 
redman noted that baker had met with his top people 
asked by a reporter to identify those people so that clues 
might be drawn about those in line for top slots during the new 
administrations overhaul of personnel redman only smiled 
the spokesman did say however that the new secretary planned to 
accompany bush on his first major foreign trip overseas to japan 
and china next month 
true to the former treasury secretarys crisp and formal style 
baker wore a suit and tie as he held earlymorning meetings with top 
aides in his formal office workspace said one senior official who 
met with him 
shultz had been known for striking a more informal tone meeting 
with aides in the cozy sitting room next to the office doffing his 
suit coat for a sweater and poking intermittently at the embers in 
his fireplace 
the new secretary also took a cue from bush and emphasized high 
standards in the first message he sent to us diplomats and state 
department employees around the world 
i join with president bush in emphasizing that public service 
should conform to the highest standards of ethical performance 
baker wrote in the message cabled to all state department employees 
around the globe for me ethics means not only abiding by the 
letter of public service by also the spirit not only in what we 
do but how we do it 
bush had stressed ethics during his campaign in an attempt to 
neutralize the criticism aimed at the reagan administration for its 
ethical problems

farmers shellshocked by the 1988 drought are worrying anew 
whether the unusually warm winter will break sending them the 
precipitation they need for next years crops 
theres a pervading omen a feeling of ominous concern i sense 
it with other farmers i sense it with the salesmen of agricultural 
products said joe summer a corn and soybean farmer in mclean 
county in central illinois 
parts of the county have received 25 inches less rain than 
average in 22 months for the first time in 45 years of farming 
summer is taking out multiperil insurance on next seasons crop 
the warm dry winter had something to do with that decision he 
said thursday but so did bad crops in six of the last eight years 
in what used to be the nations top cornproducing county 
were all beginning to get a little paranoid about it the 
62yearold farmer said there is no frost in the ground this 
unusually warm weather is strange it is a harbinger of some sort i 
think 
according to the national weather service severe to extreme 
drought conditions continue in much of the northern great plains 
northern rockies and parts of the midwest 
the weather services most recent precipitation map shows extreme 
drought in montana the dakotas central minnesota eastern iowa 
northwestern illinois and much of wyoming eastern idaho central 
washington and eastern oregon said meteorologist dave miskus of the 
climate analysis center in washington dc 
however the most recent 30day forecast calls for abovenormal 
precipitation said meteorologist edward olenic also of the 
climate analysis center 
the northern great plains and northern rockies need as much as 8 
inches above normal rainfall to end the drought while iowa and 
illinois need 8 to 9 inches more than normal miskus said 
the weather service will not release its spring forecast until 
after the commodities markets close monday but olenic said there 
is no reason to expect more of the drought that hit the nation last 
summer 
even so farmers and farm bureau officials are worried 
at this stage were hoping for a terribly wet spring said 
minnesota farm bureau administrator gerald hagaman theres 
apprehension 
farm bureau officials in indiana michigan wisconsin illinois 
and iowa say much the same thing 
our moisture levels are still down we dont have adequate 
moisture in the soil and we could have a problem if we dont have 
aboveaverage rainfall this spring said don henderson vice 
president of the indiana farm bureau 
indiana farmers are also worried about the mild temperatures 
which have averaged a relatively balmy 341 degrees this month such 
weather doesnt kill a lot of the pests henderson said 
thats a major problem to us 
in wisconsin the real question for farmers is how much snow 
well get said state farm bureau president don haldeman we 
came off the driest year weve ever had and theyre wondering if 
well have another year of drought 
its a major topic of discussion when farmers get together 
agreed jerry snethen of the farm bureau in iowa which saw some of 
the worst of the 1988 drought 
spring rains will moisten the top inches but farmers have lost 
deep soil moisture their one insurance against drought said dennis 
vercler of the illinois farm bureau 
it sets up a scenario similar to 1988 he saidthis is 
concerning a lot of people even though it is fairly early theyre 
edgy about it were going into the season needing just the right 
rain at just the right time 
farmers arent the only ones affected by the winter of discontent 
in milwaukee springlike temperatures and belowaverage snowfall 
forced icebreaker winter funfest organizers to move icesculpting 
events inside a refrigerated ice house the us international snow 
sculpting competition a major festival event was saved only 
because huge blocks of snow from a storm last month had been saved 
in new england the lack of precipitation forced ski resorts to 
use machinemade snow until storms in the past couple weeks and has 
boston officials concerned there may be a water shortage this 
summer the warm dry weather has also cut heating and municipal 
snowremoval costs 
maine had more familiar weather thursday when a driving 
snowstorm dumped up to 6 inches of snow on the state closing 
schools and delaying flights 
its been an abnormal winter said george wiseman of the 
weather services portland maine office this is closer to 
normal

senators must decide whether to tie up the 
floor for six weeks or more with the impeachment trial of district 
judge alcee l hastings or sidetrack the proceedings into a 
committee 
lawmakers expressed concern thursday at a senate rules committee 
hearing that the case could drag out painfully and some said there 
was a possibility it would be prolonged even more by defense 
delaying tactics 
the 52yearold miami judge however said he is entitled to have 
the entire senate hear the evidence that prompted the house on aug 
3 to vote 4133 in favor of a total of 17 articles of impeachment 
against him 
this is not an agriculture bill hastings told reporters 
thursday following the committee hearing this is my office that 
is at stake here 
the impeachment articles say hastings conspired to obtain a 
150000 payoff from two convicted racketeers in return for keeping 
them out of prison 
hastings also is accused of lying during the 1983 trial in which 
a jury acquitted him of the bribery conspiracy 
the articles also say hastings disclosed wiretap information in 
an unrelated matter and thus scuttled a federal criminal 
investigation 
the rules committee must recommend by wednesday whether the full 
senate should hear evidence against hastings or delegate the task to 
a committee 
a committee was empaneled for the job two years ago when the 
senate convicted district judge harry e claiborne following his 
impeachment by the house at the time claiborne was in prison for 
tax evasion but attempting to keep his seat on the bench 
sen ted stevens ralaska expressed concern that hastings might 
employ delaying tactics to foil any effort to strip him of his 
89500ayear job 
how do we know that the senate will not be subjected to the 
same shenanigans that went on in the district court stevens asked 
conservative estimates put the length of the proceeding at six 
weeks but there is wide skepticism about that forecast i think it 
would be longer than that said sen wendell ford dky the 
committee chairman 
in another development hastings attorney terence j anderson 
demanded that the senate provide taxpayers funds to finance the 
defense 
the constitution guarantees that a judges compensation in 
office may not be diminished anderson said he acknowledged 
however that government payment of the defense costs incurred in an 
impeachment case would be unprecedented

atampt says it has labored under unfair pricing 
regulations for too long and the chairman of the federal 
communications commission tends to agree 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick says it may be time to give atampt a 
break sort of and perhaps save telephone users billions of 
dollars 
but some lawmakers say the fcc doesnt have the legal right to 
make such a change 
nonetheless the commission will consider the subject monday in a 
meeting that is sure to attract legions of attorneys and lobbyists 
whove formed battle lines on all sides of the issue 
the fcc under the deregulationprone patrick has proposed to 
change the way the telephone industry leader american telephone and 
telegraph co sets its prices for interstate services 
since the early 1960s the government has allowed atampt a certain 
profit beyond its costs but the fcc in august 1987 suggested 
replacing this rateofreturn regulation for dominant 
carriers such as atampt with ceilings on prices that would include 
the seven regional bell companies that atampt spun off in 1984 
the commission said the change would encourage greater efficiency 
and innovation and save customers 16 billion over four years if 
all the dominant companies participated 
the fcc last may proposed that atampt be allowed to raise rates 3 
percent less than annual inflation 
atampt applauded the proposal 
its a long overdue step larry garfinkel atampt vice 
president for marketing services said in an interview thursday he 
said atampt has been thwarted by a cumbersome regulatory process 
that has prevented speedy introduction of new services and discount 
rates 
he said competitors routinely file challenges to any new atampt 
discount pricing plan claiming the plans are designed to undercut 
competition 
they never intervene to drive our prices down they intervene 
to drive our prices up garfinkel said 
we have business customers shaking their heads in disbelief 
at what it takes for us to get a simple change in service 
offering said joe nacchio atampt vice president for business 
services 
if weve got better flexibility to earn we will then be able to 
take those investments and reinvest nacchio added 
members of congress are skeptical however a report last 
november from the democratic staff of the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications subcommittee said the fcc proposal fails to 
assure that rates for regulated phone service will be just and 
reasonable as required by the 1934 communications act 
congress intended the report said that rates balance carriers 
right for a return on investment and consumers right to prices in 
line with the costs of providing service 
as currently structured the price cap scheme will permit 
carriers to set prices that may deviate significantly from costs 
the report said there is no assurance that rates would remain 
even with a zone of reasonableness 
last week in an attempt to allay concerns on capitol hill 
patrick sent a sixpage letter and 60 pages of supporting documents 
to the chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee rep edward 
j markey dmass and to john d dingell dmich chairman of the 
full energy and commerce committee 
he assured markey and dingell that the process leading up to the 
price cap proposal had been subjected to a rigorous hearing process 
and that the record indicated that it might be possible to replace 
the distorted incentives created by rateofreturn regulation with 
more efficiencyoriented and consumeroriented price cap incentives 
by making modest changes in existing rules and procedures 
however he said he would recommend a number of changes in the 
price cap proposal including a delay in implementing the plan for 
the regional bell companies and other local exchange carriers 
he said he also would recommend establishing separate price cap 
baskets for atampts business and residential customers to prevent 
the company from raising residential prices to finance rate 
reductions for businesses 
these improvements also will provide residential customers 
greater assurances of rate stability and a larger share of 
potential atampt efficiency gains patrick said 
he also proposed an automatic stabilizer which he said would 
ensure that local carriers earnings remain within the zone of 
reasonableness and that consumers share in the efficiency gains 
price cap regulation is designed to generate

television broadcasters dodged a bullet today 
thanks to an appeals court ruling that stopped federal regulators 
from imposing a roundtheclock ban on indecent programs 
the congressionally mandated ban which was to have gone into 
effect at 1201 am would have ended the midnightto6 am safe 
harbor that the federal communications commission had established 
for sexually explicit tv programs 
but a coalition of broadcasters and civil rights groups 
challenged the ban on constitutional grounds and the court agreed 
to a temporary stay while it considered the case 
sen jesse helms rnc who wrote the indecency amendment into 
a 149 billion appropriations bill last year said thursday he felt 
he would win the issue in the supreme court 
with the makeup of the court as it is now i cant imagine 
theyll duck the opportunity to protect children and society in 
general from this sort of garbage helms said in a telephone 
interview i believe the founding fathers never believed that the 
first amendment could be so distorted to authorize to permit this 
sort of garbage 
during congressional debate helms had claimed the fcc was 
permitting broadcasters to air programs that included disgusting 
bestiality sodomy and child sex 
the 24hour ban was stayed on monday by the federal appeals court 
in washington the national association of broadcasters which was 
among 17 challengers to the ban said the courts ruling was a 
hopeful sign 
whats not at issue here is the kind of pornographic matter 
that much of the general public is concerned about steve 
bookshester associate general counsel for the nab said thursday 
indecency is a pretty loaded word how can you be in favor of 
indecency but the fcc definition of that term is pretty broad he 
said 
you dont have a bunch of people who are making dirty movies 
thats not what this case is about bookshester said 
indecent material according to the fcc is that which in 
context depicts or describes in terms patently offensive as 
measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast 
medium sexual or excretory activities or organs 
the washington appeals court last july upheld that definition 
but said the fcc had not justified the midnightto6 am safe 
harbor broadcasters had been seeking a 10 pm start of the safe 
harbor 
obscene broadcasts on the other hand do not enjoy 
constitutional protection such broadcasts are defined as those that 
appeal to prurient interests and lack serious artistic literary 
political or scientific value 
fcc spokeswoman maureen peratino said the court action had thrown 
the issue of indecent programming into limbo the court issued only 
a stay of the rules as it considered the challenge 
it keeps us where we are she said that means the fcc will 
continue to take action against indecent programming broadcast 
during daylight hours which the courts have upheld 
as for nighttime programs if we receive complaints those 
are being accepted and filed and put on hold until this whole matter 
is clarified she said 
the rules apply only to overtheair broadcasts not cable 
besides the nab those challenging the fcc rules were capital 
citiesabc cbs action for childrens television the association 
of independent television stations the radio and television news 
directors association aclu foundation infinity broadcast corp 
the motion picture association of america nbc national public 
radio the pacifica foundation people for the amercan way

some of president bushs highranking 
transition aides are staying away from the federal government 
deciding instead to pursue careers in the private sector 
in becoming consultants lobbyists and public relations 
executives the aides are moving through the welltraveled revolving 
door that separates government service from private business 
among those entering private business are craig fuller and robert 
teeter the codirectors of the bush transition office and sheila 
tate the transition spokeswoman 
teeter a longtime political consultant intends to start a new 
firm spending much of his time in washington even though his family 
will remain in ann arbor mich according to his assistant mary 
lukens 
before he joined the bush presidential campaign teeter ran a 
political consulting firm in detroit 
fuller former chief of staff to vice president bush will become 
president of a lobbying firm headed by anne wexler a former carter 
administration official and nancy reynolds who is a close friend 
of former first lady nancy reagan 
fuller decided to go into private business after he lost out in a 
power struggle with john sununu to be the white house chief of staff 
mrs tate mrs reagans former press secretary and a longtime 
public relations executive is going to work in public relations 
but she would not identify the company until the deal is completed 
people who worked in government such as fuller will be governed 
by existing postemployment ethics laws he is precluded from 
lobbying the white house for a year and you can bet he wont 
said mrs wexler 
fuller will be working on public strategies and corporate 
communications mrs wexler said among the firms clients are 
american airlines the motion picture association and allied corp 
like many others who worked in the bush campaign and transition 
mrs tate is not subject to the governments postemployment laws 
according to jane ley an attorney with the office of government 
ethics 
fuller is perhaps the most prominent exception based on his 
service in the vice presidents office he is covered by rules that 
impose a coolingoff period in which senior employees of an agency 
who enter the private sector are barred from contacting officials of 
that agency for a year except for social affairs 
there is also a lifetime ban that prohibits all executive branch 
officials from lobbying on any issue in which they had a personal 
and substantial involvement while in government 
another campaign operative choosing the private sector is rich 
bond 38 bushs deputy campaign manager bond has started a 
lobbying firm with frank donatelli 39 a white house political 
director under president reagan 
donatelli who also had served as assistant to reagan for 
intergovernmental affairs said his motive for leaving government 
was primarily financial but he also expressed a desire to run 
his own operation after spending five of the last eight years in 
government 
as a government official donatelli could earn no more than 
89500 
james pfiffner a george mason university professor who has 
examined the presidency and the federal government said government 
experience particularly a visible job can often enhance a 
persons future earning potential 
those entering the private sector do so at a time that bush has 
stressed ethics in his administration 
bush in the first days of his presidency has vowed to press for 
laws that clarify codes of conduct and protect the public 
interest 
i support what he is doing i think it is great said mrs

the leader of this weeks assault 
on an army base tried to overthrow the government in the 1970s and 
helped assassinate deposed nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza 
informed sources said 
enrique gorriaran merlo directed the attack monday on the 3rd 
infantry regiment base in the western suburb of la tablada that 
resulted in the death of 38 people government and security sources 
said thursday 
gorriaran merlo 47 once led the nowdefunct peoples 
revolutionary army which openly battled the military after it took 
power in a 1976 coup he is believed to have escaped during a 
27hour siege in which army and police forces retook the base the 
sources said on condition of anonymity 
among the dead were eight soldiers and two policemen one of the 
policemen died thursday of wounds suffered in the assault about 70 
others were wounded 
but gorriaran merlo was not thought to be among the bodies of 14 
armed civilians who remain unidentified the sources said 
the disclosure came as authorities probed links between the 
attackers and leftwing organizations the government claims the 
assailants were leftist subversives 
police on thursday raided several houses in mar del plata 250 
miles south of buenos aires and arrested three people but gave no 
other details 
gorriaran merlo a stocky former architecture student was 
involved in the marxist peoples revolutionary army which was 
decimated in the late 1970s during a harsh antisubversion campaign 
waged by the military leaders 
gorriaran merlo however escaped and went to nicaragua in 
published interviews he said he led a team of argentine and 
nicaraguan guerrillas who assassinated somoza in 1980 on a street in 
the paraguayan capital of asuncion somoza had been ousted by 
nicaraguas leftist sandinistas in 1979 
president raul alfonsin ordered the prosecution of gorriaran 
merlo shortly after taking office in december 1983 alfonsins 
election ended nearly eight years of military dictatorship 
gorriaran merlo was believed to be living abroad last year a 
leftist human rights lawyer jorge banos asked the courts to allow 
gorriaran merlo to return and face trial without being imprisoned 
police said among those killed in this weeks assault was banos 
he and at least two other attackers whose names have been released 
by police were active in a leftist political group the everyone for 
the country movement 
the littleknown movement formed about three years ago 
denounced earlier this month what it said were plans for a coup by 
rightwing extremists in the armed forces those elements have led 
three dramatic but shortlived insurrections against alfonsin since 
april 1987 
the army bases attackers carried a written proclamation that 
said their action was designed to stop a coup and foment civilian 
resistance to the military 
the incident surprised and chilled argentines and prompted 
alfonsin to set up a national security council to evaluate and 
curtail the threat of subversion 
the group composed of the chiefs of the military branches and 
several government ministers met for the first time thursday 
alfonsin presided no details were provided 
the centrist radical government with an eye to the excesses 
committed by the military during its socalled dirty war against 
subversion in the 1970s until now has barred the military from a 
major role in internal security 
human rights groups already have said they fear military 
participation might mean a return to the deadly antileftist 
repression of last decade when at least 8900 people were arrested 
and vanished without a trace they are presumed executed 
the buenos aires daily newspaper clarin quoting government 
sources said alfonsins decree gives military intelligence agencies 
authority to conduct domestic surveillance which previously was 
illegal

the purchase of montgomerys major tv 
news station by the state pension fund has triggered a political 
shootout among government officials and media executives who call 
it a dangerous conflict of interest 
the chief antagonists are david bronner who manages alabamas 8 
billion pension fund and gov guy hunt who charges that bronner 
and a major critic of hunts republican administration are secretly 
trying to lay claim to news operations up and down the state 
hunt said recently the purchase of wsfatv the state capitals 
dominant broadcast news operation was invalid because his state 
finance director did not approve it 
watch our lips said hunt its null and void 
make my day replied bronner who said the purchase of wsfa 
from cosmos broadcasting inc of greenville sc was a done 
deal and that the finance director robin swift had never asked 
for advance signoff approval on investments during hunts two years 
in office 
he said the state would lose 10 million in funds guaranteeing 
the purchase if it backed out 
bronner signed the deal to buy wfsa for 70 million in 
middecember he said the nbc affiliate was a cash cow that 
would benefit the pension funds 130000 members and could establish 
a precedent for purchases of media properties elsewhere 
thats what worried alabama newspaper and broadcast association 
leaders who said the deal created a dangerous conflict of interest 
by putting government officials in a position to influence news 
coverage at the capitol 
among those who oversee the pension program are hunt swift 
state treasurer george wallace jr state school superintendent 
wayne teague and not least paul hubbert the chief lobbyist for 
public school teachers in alabama and one of hunts biggest critics 
hunt made no public comment about the purchase until after a 
potential political rival former gov fob james lambasted the deal 
in print then hunt attacked it too in a manner that fired 
political conflicts 
i think its pretty obvious whos behind this deal its dr 
paul hubbert said hunt i think its time he and dr bronner 
now made public to the people their secret negotiations concerning 
the attempt to purchase a mobile tv station and how far they 
intend to carry this 
bronner had advised the pension board earlier that a mobile 
station walatv had been placed on the market he also said he was 
looking at various other media properties but he denied discussing 
any purchases with hubbert or other board members 
this is all beginning to sound like as the world turns he 
said 
hubbert said he wasnt aware of any master plan to buy up 
television stations around the state if there is im not privy 
to it he said 
the federal communications commission still must approve the 
transfer of wsfas broadcasting license from the current owners 
cosmos broadcasting inc of greenville sc 
however steve sewell assistant chief of the fccs video 
services division said thursday that the commission generally does 
not involve itself in matters of state or local law such as those 
raised in the alabama case 
the fcc has set a deadline of feb 6 for any petitions objecting 
to the wsfa purchase none had been filed by thursday 
sewell said there is no fcc rule or law that prohibits 
statecreated entities from holding broadcast licenses in fact he 
said there are numerous instances of state entities holding 
broadcast licenses the most common examples being public television 
stations 
so for now the soap opera continues state attorney general don 
siegleman has issued an advisory opinion upholding the purchase but 
hunt said sieglemans ruling is as worthless as the paper its 
written on 
the governor brought in his top political organizer birmingham 
lawyer john grenier to consider legal action hunt predicted that a 
lawsuit eventually would be filed although not necessarily by his 
administration

entertainment conglomerate has transformed the 19th century medicine 
show into the mall tour a celebration of consumerism aimed at 
americas new main street 
mca incs the magic of hollywood tour entering its first 
weekend on the road today at the topanga plaza shopping center aims 
to swivel the heads of about 4 million mall visitors in 45 cities 
nationwide in hopes of giving mca a slim advantage in the fierce 
battle for leisuretime dollars 
its a very effective way of promoting mca product said phil 
rosenthal vice president of mca event marketing it takes us 
right to the consumer right into the new main street the shopping 
mall 
yet there are already indications that the mall tour which mca 
pioneered in launching teenage singer tiffany in a 1987 mall 
junket may have become too popular for its own good 
the scheduled opening of the magic of hollywood tour was 
canceled last week when a glendale fire marshal said unpredictable 
attendance could threaten shopper safety 
and the boys an urban band that was to have performed alongside 
the more upscale boys club was dropped from the tour soon after a 
local december mall concert featuring the quartet became 
unmanageable 
there was a potential for a major disaster there said sgt 
mike effler mca says the band was dropped only because they 
became too big for mall venues 
the mall tours liability though is also its greatest virtue 
free unlimited access to entertainment and thats why mca is 
banking on strong turnouts across the country from seattle to 
chicago to miami to houston 
using a live performance by the young vocalists boys club 
interactive product displays occasional celebrity appearances 
hollywood memorabilia and an assortment of carnival games with 
prizes mca can expose shoppers to all of its entertainment 
divisions in one invasion 
the entire tour rosenthal said will cost less than 1 million 
while mca records is the star attraction boys club sings three 
songs to taped music including its top 10 hit i remember holding 
you universal pictures mca home video and the studio tour all 
receive exposure 
mcas video unit plugs the cassette for et the 
extraterrestrial while universal pictures displays posters for 
the new tom hanks film the burbs 
i think the tour will help launch the boys club and i think it 
will help build awareness for the various mca divisions among 
consumers nationwide said brad nye of creative entertainment 
marketing a firm developing mall tours 
boys club member gene hunt said that when the group was offered 
the same promotion that made tiffany a star he said i looked at 
tiffany and said yeah ill go with no shoes 
mca is not the only company using americas shopping centers for 
national promotions 
mattel toys has presented the barbies imagination mall tour 
complete with a reallife barbie nestle has sponsored the 
raisinettes summer sunsations fashions show polaroid used a mall 
tour to generate renewed interest in instant photography for its 
spectra camera and mountain dew has presented a nationwide mall 
tour highlighted by music videos 
on march 31 working woman magazine in cooperation with jeep and 
goodyear will open its own mall tour 
we like to get out there and talk to our readers said andrea 
kaplan the magazines director of corporate communications we 
think this is a very interactive visual way to give information to 
women i think its very smart marketing 
the working woman tour set for 22 cities will feature a fashion 
show cooking classes car displays motivational speeches and 
exercise tips an estimated 27 million people will see the 
presentations 
our vision is that you bring a page of the magazine to life 
kaplan said its almost like a mini womens worlds fair

a mother charged with forcing her 
9yearold son and 12yearold daughter into prostitution with up to 
80 adults may have found clients for them by advertising in 
pornographic magazines a prosecutor said 
katherine ann hubert 29 of el cerrito who was arraigned 
thursday on 19 felony counts and was being held without bail used 
the money she collected for sex acts by her children to buy drugs 
officials said 
police were seeking the youngsters grandmother a 48yearold 
concord woman who was not identified by authorities on a warrant 
charging her with pandering in the case 
hubert was arrested tuesday after a guardian who has been caring 
for the children told police they had been prostituted while the 
family lived in richmond in the san francisco bay area between 1986 
and 1988 said police lt ray howard 
the girl told investigators her mother forced her to have sex 
with 60 men and the boy said he was forced to have sex with 20 women 
we have reason to believe on some occasions there was physical 
violence involved in some of these acts howard said 
the children said hubert gave them such drugs as cocaine 
methamphetamine marijuana sleeping pills and alcohol in an effort 
to desensitize them to sex acts howard said 
the children were removed from huberts care last may after an 
allegation the girl had been molested 
the mother is charged with 16 counts of forcing the children into 
lewd and lascivious acts two counts of pandering children for sex 
and one count of supplying rock cocaine to her son 
hubert seemed nervous thursday when she appeared before bay 
municipal judge allen norris and said she could not afford to hire 
an attorney she was referred to the public defenders office 
the woman who was being held at the contra costa county jail in 
martinez is scheduled to appear in court again feb 2 
hubert has no criminal record according to deputy district 
attorney brandon baum 
baum said he has prosecuted other child prostitution cases but 
said this case is unusual because of the businesslike manner in 
which the acts took place it was not a haphazard type of 
thing 
hubert may have found clients by advertising in pornographic 
magazines he said 
baum said there were no signs the mother took any precautions to 
protect her childrens health or guard them from sexually 
transmitted disease 
the grandmother aided and abetted in making arrangements for 
the acts to take place baum said most occurred at the family 
home 
there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the 
grandmother her role here howard said 
officials believe the childrens father was not involved in the 
alleged prostitution and wasnt living with them at the time the 
lieutenant said 
shortly after the children were removed from their mothers care 
last may two other girls ages 2 and 4 were taken from the home 
authorities said their relationship to hubert was unclear

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze will travel to pakistan next week for talks with the 
countrys leaders on a settlement of the afghan problem the 
pakistani government said today 
a foreign ministry spokesman said shevardnadze would arrive in 
islamabad feb 4 for a day of talks with president ghulam ishaq 
khan prime minister benazir bhutto and foreign minister sahabzada 
yaqub khan 
according to a un brokered agreement signed last april all 
remaining soviet troops are to leave afghanistan by feb 15 
the situation in kabul the afghan capital has been 
deteriorating as the soviet troops prepare for final withdrawal 
shevardnadze will be the highest ranking soviet leader to visit 
pakistan in more than 20 years since thensoviet prime minister 
alexi kosygin visited in the late 1960s 
we hope our talks with the soviet leader will pave the way for 
a peaceful settlement although the situation on the ground in 
afghanistan is depressing said the spokesman who cannot be named 
under government rules 
western diplomats reported thursday that hundreds of civilians 
were killed monday in a major bombardment by soviet and afghan 
forces on a tunnel on the highway connecting kabul to the soviet 
union 
us and pakistanbacked afghan rebels had blocked the crucial 
road for the last several days causing severe shortages of food and 
fuel in kabul and other major afghan cities 
responding to the deteriorating security situation us 
secretary of state james a baker iii on thursday ordered the us 
embassy in kabul closed other western embassies have advised their 
nationals to leave afghanistan immediately while commercial flights 
are still operating 
senior pakistani diplomats described the upcoming talks between 
shevardnadze and pakistani leaders as crucial for preventing 
further bloodshed in afghanistan 
direct talks earlier this month between yuli vorontsov first 
deputy soviet foreign minister and ambassador to kabul and pakistan 
and iranbased resistance groups deadlocked because the resistance 
refused to include members of the present marxist administration in 
kabul in a proposed consultative council that is to elect the future 
interim government for afghanistan 
the resistance had insisted that only those officials of afghan 
leader najibs administration who have not committed crimes against 
the people during the 9year civil war be included in the council 
vorontosov said the government should have the right to nominate 
its representatives for the council 
pakistani officials said they hoped shevardnadze would bring a 
proposal to resolve the disagreement 
even a continuation of the deadlock will mean further bloodshed 
when the soviets leave afghanistan a senior pakistani diplomat 
said

feeling said sister cheryl donahue 37 a franciscan who will

drug traffickers in delaware which outlawed 
public floggings less than 30 years ago could be stripped to the 
waist and given 40 lashes if legislation introduced in the state 
senate becomes law 
the bill unveiled thursday requires the whipping post in addition 
to jail time for anyone convicted of dealing hard drugs or involving 
children in the drug world 
i think the drug problem is serious enough to warrant that kind 
of punishment said senate majority leader thomas sharp the 
bills sponsor im willing to take the barbs and criticisms but 
were going to debate it 
the democrat said he has support for the proposal and plans to 
bring it to a floor debate after a sixweek break for budget 
hearings that began thursday 
under the legislation a drug offender could receive no fewer 
than five nor more than 40 lashes well laid on a bare back 
asked if corporal punishment might be viewed as a violation of 
the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment sharp said 
it shouldnt be in a society that permits executions 
i dont know why beating them is any worse he said 
the legislation calls for whippings to take place at the delaware 
correctional center near smyrna under the state corrections 
commissioners supervision 
the commissioner did not return telephone calls thursday and the 
governors office had no comment on the bill 
sharp said the whipping post was used extensively in delaware in 
the 1930s and 1940s delaware was the last state to drop the 
punishment finally banning it in the mid1960s 
david swayze an attorney who helped develop new sentencing 
guidelines that took effect in 1987 said bringing back the whipping 
post was never considered 
swayze who researched delawares whipping post while in college 
said the last person sentenced to a flogging was a car thief in 1957 
or 1958 the sentence was never carried out 
most floggings were for theft and the average sentence was 20 to 
40 lashes swayze said the whip was a leather strap with a 
catoninetails or leather prongs at the end 
floggings were public but it was a misdemeanor to take a 
picture of it swayze said

a us trade group has offered to buy the 
unfinished us embassy building in moscow on which construction 
was halted after it was found to be riddled with soviet listening 
devices 
state department spokesman charles redman said thursday the 
government is studying the offer by the trade group headed by dwayne 
o andreas one of the nations richest men and chairman of archer 
daniels midland co 
no price has been discussed redman said adding that andreas had 
only informally proposed the plan to buy the building which was 
being built by a soviet construction company 
its only in channels in what we would call a very informal 
way in the sense that we have had a discussion through diplomatic 
channels of this idea with the soviets but as i say very 
informally and inconclusively redman said 
last oct 27 thenpresident reagan recommended that the building 
be razed and rebuilt from the ground up 
the united states had no choice reagan said at the time 
because theres no way to rid it of the many listening devices 
that we built into it 
the existence of bugs in the structure became widely known in 
1986 under the 1972 construction agreement a soviet 
governmentowned construction firm was permitted to build the 
american embassy 
for five months a soviet engineer worked with the american firm 
that designed the structure and large segments of it were assembled 
offsite out of view of us supervisors 
the united states has filed claims against the soviets for 29 
million in connection with what the united states claims are defects 
and delays in the construction those claims must be negotiated by 
an arbitration panel in stockholm sweden 
archer daniels midland is the worlds largest processor of corn 
soybeans wheat peanuts and other farm products 
andreas is also cochairman of the usussr trade and 
economic council which has tried to promote more trade between the 
two superpowers he made the offer on behalf of a consortium of us 
companies which would use the building as their moscow headquarters 
the soviets would have to approve any sale because the building 
was originally intended for use as a new american embassy in moscow 
built under a 1972 agreement between the two countries 
also affected by the controversy is the new soviet embassy in 
washington the soviets are barred from moving into the building 
until americans occupy the moscow building

former president chun doohwans 
intelligence chief was charged with corruption today and taken to 
prison after two days of questioning by criminal prosecutors 
officials said 
prosecutors said chang sedong exdirector of the agency for 
national security planning formerly the korean central intelligence 
agency was charged with misusing official authority and other 
offenses 
the action came as part of government and parliamentary inquiries 
into allegations of human rights abuses and corruption under the 
authoritarian chun government chang was the highestranking former 
official of that government to be charged so far 
the agency for national security planning the nations main 
foreign intelligence organization played a major role in enforcing 
chuns tough rule and suppressing domestic opposition 
chang an exgeneral who was one of the most powerful men in the 
nation under chun was whisked under guard to a prison outside seoul 
after formal warrants were issued he had been held by prosecutors 
since wednesday for questioning 
prosecutors said chang strongly denied any wrongdong insisting 
he merely followed presidential orders he was head of chuns 
presidential security before serving as intelligence chief from 1985 
to 1987 
chun who took power with military backing in 1980 is in rural 
exile at a remote buddhist monastery he apologized to the nation in 
november for abuses under his rule and went into exile 
the former president has denied any personal wrongdoing but some 
of his relatives and aides have been convicted or charged with 
corruption 
the charges filed against chang were vague and relatively mild 
they included illegal construction of a guest house and illegally 
using government office space 
opposition groups have been demanding the arrest of chang and 
several other former top chun aides on human rights abuses south 
korean press reports said prosecutors had difficulty finding hard 
evidence to use against chang 
the opposition contends president roh taewoos government is not 
making a sufficient effort to prosecute former chun aides roh a 
former general and once close ally of chun is closely identified 
with the expresident in the eyes of many south koreans 
the inquiry into the chun regime has dominated south korean 
politics for months and hampered the governments efforts to achieve 
broad acceptance 
on thursday chun refused to accept an order from a national 
assembly special committee to testify on his role in the bloody 
suppression of a 1980 uprising in the southern city of kwangju in 
which at least 200 people were killed 
the opposition is trying to use the kwangju incident and other 
legacies of the authoritarian chun government to weaken the roh 
government 
opposition parties demanded this week that roh keep an election 
promise to submit to a referendum on his rule it is not clear if 
roh could win such a vote and he might be forced to hold elections 
or step down if defeated 
chun stepped down last february at the end of a sevenyear term 
and was replaced by roh

roman catholic theologians from 
universities across europe have attacked pope john paul ii for his 
continued opposition to artificial birth control 
the criticism prompted the television network zdf to interrupt 
its regular news program thursday evening and broadcast an editorial 
saying the pope should be careful to keep too many catholics from 
walking out on him 
meanwhile in rome lithuanias visiting cardinal said thursday 
that communist authorities in his soviet republic would welcome a 
visit to the catholic stronghold by the pope but moscow continues to 
oppose the idea 
the theologians germanlanguage declaration complained that the 
pope has linked the churchs teachings on birth control too closely 
to fundamental articles of faith such as the holiness of god 
it said the link was made so strong that those who criticize the 
churchs ban on artificial birth control are accused of attacking 
the fundamental pillars of christian teaching 
the 170 university theology professors who signed the declaration 
contended the 1968 vatican encyclical regarding birth control did 
not place an absolute ban on artificial forms of contraception 
at the vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said i think we are 
talking of a local matter 
i can also say that some people who signed have withdrawn their 
support of the document he added without providing names 
the signers of the sevenpage document called the cologne 
declaration are from west germany the netherlands austria and 
switzerland 
the statement also focused on the popes teachings on disputes 
over permission to teach catholic theology and recent on nominations 
to fill bishops positions 
we are witnesses of a theologically very questionable attempt 
to overstep the papal jurisdictional and teaching competence and to 
make it unacceptably prevailing it said 
it was prompted in part by the popes appointment last month of 
cardinal joachim meisner as archbishop of cologne one of the most 
influential church posts in europe some local church officials 
thought meisner too conservative 
hours after the document was released west german bishops issued 
a statement saying the west german bishops conference decisively 
rejects the numerous misrepresentations against pope john paul ii 
cardinal vincentas sladkevicius in rome for talks with the pope 
said he raised the issue of a papal visit to lithuania in a meeting 
this week in moscow with sergei kuznetsov head of the soviet 
department on catholic affairs 
at this time the government of moscow is very much against a 
visit of the pope sladkevicius said 
sladkevicius said that lithuanias communist party chief 
algirdas brazauskas had indicated the local government favored a 
papal visit 
the cardinal said the lithuanian government is still very 
dependent on moscow and could not clear the way for a papal visit 
on its own 
the polishborn pontiff frequently has expressed the desire to 
travel to the soviet union but insisted he would go only if 
permitted to visit his flock nationwide 
he has said that he has been refused permission at least twice to 
visit lithuania 
lithuania an independent country before world war ii was 
occupied by the soviet union in 1940 and has been viewed as a 
stronghold of nationalism sladkevicius said about 80 percent of 
lithuanias 35 million people are roman catholics

panamas opposition news media remain 
shuttered nearly a year after being closed by gen manuel noriega 
and with a presidential campaign about to start there is little 
likelihood they will be allowed to reopen 
the most important opposition newspaper la prensa had a 
circulation of 50000 when noriegas soldiers stopped its presses 
last feb 25 and closed its doors 
even if they allowed us to reopen next month we do not know if 
we could start publishing right away said winston robles 
director of the newspaper when it closed 
there will be many technical problems he said we have not 
been allowed to go inside the newspaper building since it was shut 
down 
also shut were the newspapers el siglo la extra and quiubo the 
radio stations continente and mundial and channel 5 a television 
station owned by ousted president eric arturo delvalle 
all were charged with violating a press law protecting the 
security of the state an investigation is still going on and some 
reporters were called in to testify last month 
we are going to demand that the news media be allowed to 
reopen said guillermo ford candidate for second vice president 
on the united opposition ticket led by guillermo endara of the 
arnulfista party and ricardo arias calderon candidate for the first 
vice presidency 
the presidential elections are scheduled for may 7 the 
government is expected to name a candidate soon 
the interior ministry said the issue of reopening the opposition 
media is in the hands of the legal department other sources 
referred all queries to the district attorneys office which 
declined to discuss the matter 
other media have to be very careful about what is put on the air 
or published including the independent newspaper la estrella owned 
by the duque family whose members have varied political leanings 
a government decree establishes that television and radio 
franchises can be canceled if the stations incite to the 
disruption of public order civil disobedience and the overthrow of 
the state radio and television stations air the decree before and 
after their news programs 
in a speech jan 17 noriega commander of the panama defense 
forces and the countrys de facto ruler equated panamas situation 
to that of nicaragua after the government there closed down an 
opposition newspaper 
he quoted approvingly an observation on censorship by the 
nicaraguan government that ended the nation is at war under 
siege by the united states and by regional oligarchies 
the full text of the speech appeared across the top of page 1 in 
la estrella in the text the quoted observation appeared in capital 
letters 
noriega has survived more than a year of us attempts to oust 
him following an indictment in florida on drugrelated charges 
when delvalle tried to fire him noriega used his clout to have 
panamas congress dump delvalle and install manuel solis palma as 
president 
us sanctions have compounded an economic crisis but noriega 
has broken a general strike crushed public demonstrations and 
presented himself as the defender of panamanian sovereignty 
claiming the united states wants him out so it can renege on the 
panama canal treaties that call for us forces to leave in the year 
2000 
government candidates have the pages of three governmentowned 
newspapers at their disposal as well as time on a stateowned radio 
and television station 
most of the newsprint held by la prensa has been sold to la 
estrella to keep it from wasting in hot and humid panama 
if we are allowed to reopen i am sure they would close us down 
again within days said ruben dario carles president of la 
prensas board of directors he was referring to past occasions when 
the newspaper was closed down by the government 
robles and others including news editor alfredo wilfy jimenez 
and reporters migdalia fuentes and flor quintero were called by the 
district attorneys office in december to testify 
we were questioned about stories in which opposition leaders 
criticized the government the government claims by publishing the 
stories we were agreeing with them jimenez said 
jimenez and others tried to open a small daily late last year 
but approval for the publication is pending 
the government must certify that each reporter is a bona fide 
journalist jimenez said now the permits by the board of health 
and other agencies such as the commerce ministry must also be 
confirmed by the interior ministry 
we do not think the conditions exist for free elections without 
opposition news media robles said

authorities who initially suggested foul 
play caused the simultaneous deaths of three of four quadruplets say 
theyre halting their investigation with few leads and the 
fatalities remain a mystery 
exhaustive medical tests failed to find a reason for the deaths 
two weeks ago of 3monthold kia mia and deanthony walker in this 
atlanta suburb clayton county medical examiner joseph burton said 
thursday 
im not telling you its a matter of black and white its 
not burton said the scales just tip away from the direction of 
foul play at this time 
police maj l dwayne hobbs said the deaths remain suspicious and 
the case will remain open but inactive unless new evidence turns 
up 
burton said the cause would be listed as sudden unexplained death 
in infancy but he probably always will have haunting suspicions 
about the case such an occurrence is unheard of in medical circles 
the medical examiner said 
the two girls and a boy were found dead early jan 13 when their 
mother tonja l walker checked her babies who had been sleeping 
together in a crib the only child alive was deandrea 
doctors initially suspected meningitis as the cause of death but 
autopsies ruled that out burton said 
there were no signs of strangulation or suffocation he said 
we tested for sedatives tranquilizers pesticides arsenic 
strychnine cocaine marijuana the whole shooting match burton 
said we tested blood tissues stomach contents 
two infants had respiratory infections burton said experts 
examining the base of one infants brain found an unusual change in 
a brain cell that part of the brain controls breathing 
the deaths fit the pattern of sudden infant death syndrome an 
unexplained illness that most often affects children less than a 
year old said dr diane rowley an infant mortality epidemiologist 
at the centers for disease control in atlanta infants 3 to 4 months 
old are at the highest risk 
the majority of such deaths occur between late november and 
april ms rowley said theres some question as to whether 
something about the cold weather or infections contribute to the 
deaths but that really has not been solved 
some researchers believe siblings are prone to the syndrome and 
studies have documented cases in which twins or siblings born in 
separate births have died of it ms rowley said 
however she said the walker case is very rare 
were going to write the case up burton said itll be 
submitted to various forensic pathology journals when this occurs 
again and it will somewhere it will let someone know that its 
happened before 
the tragedy was not the first to strike mrs walker in 1985 
prematurely born twins died in a hospital police said 
the walker family is trying to cope with the infants deaths and 
the subsequent investigation said tonja walkers mother mary 
walker 
police said foul play they didnt say who was the 
suspect mary walker said the suspicion was on her tonja 
walker as well 
she defended her daughter as a good mother who couldnt hurt a 
fly 
does he look like hes neglected she said holding deandrea 
in the hallway of the forest park police department 
she said the investigation would be with us forever its 
something well always have to try to live down

snecma have not produced any conclusive cause for the breakup of the 
planes left engine 
snecma builds the cfm56 engines with general electric co the 
engines of the jet are being examined at the headquarters of snecma 
at villaroche near paris 
investigators are relying on two theories that it was damaged 
after being struck by a foreign body possibly ice from the waste 
pipe of the forward lavatory or that the blades suffered metal 
fatigue the report said 
the engineers have found nothing wrong with the jets right 
engine and no evidence to explain why the crew shut it down it 
said 
the crew shut down the right engine of the plane while the left 
engine caught fire news reports have said investigators are 
examining the possibility of faulty electronics 
the report said detailed metallurgical tests are being carried 
out on every piece of recovered wreckage from the left engine but 
that work is being hampered because many of the engines fan blades 
are still missing 
those that have been found are badly damaged presenting a 
major problem for the metallurgists trying to establish which of 
them caused the crash and how it said

medieval physicians believed health was the 
balance of mysterious fluids called humors and a swedish 
physician has some new evidence that humor in its modern sense is 
also a healer 
dr lars ljungdahl of the lyckorna primary healthcare centre in 
motala sweden reports that six women got significant relief from 
painful symptoms of musclebone disorders and depression with a 
course of humor therapy 
laughter corresponded with relief from symptoms and the greatest 
symptomatic relief occurred in people who had greatest degrees of 
amusement ljungdahl said in a letter in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
ljungdahl said one male and two female nurses participated in 13 
meetings of a humor group with the patients ages 26 to 48 
we used funny books records and videofilms and learned to 
give higher priority to humor in our everyday lives he wrote 
the program also involved lectures on humor research and the 
regular use of relaxation programs with suggestions that stimulated 
humor and joy 
he noted that relief was significantly greater during weeks seven 
through 13 than during weeks one through six indicating regular 
laughter had the greatest benefits 
degrees of amusement and relief were graded by the patients on 
separate scales he said 
independent psychological tests before and after humor therapy 
revealed an overall improvement in general psychological wellbeing 
he said 
the study suggests that a humor therapy program can increase 
the quality of life for patients with chronic problems and that 
laughter has an immediate symptomrelieving effect for these 
patients ljungdahl wrote 
their selfconfidence also seemed to increase they coped more 
ably with their symptoms and allowed theselves to be happy and enjoy 
life regardless of their medical problems he said 
ljungdahl acknowledged that his study results were only 
preliminary because of the small number of patients involved the 
lack of a comparison group of healthy patients and the uncertainty 
of measurements 
such studies are now under way both in the united states and in 
great britain said dr william f fry an associate clinical 
professor in psychiatry at stanford university medical school in 
stanford calif 
meanwhile ljungdahls finding is consistent with everything we 
know in terms of physical effects of engagement in mirth the 
emotion laughter smiling chuckling and so on fry said in a 
telephone interview thursday 
these behaviors are involved in and impact on most of the 
physiological systems of the body added fry this we know 
through direct laboratory evidence 
fry maintains that laughter exercises muscles and massages organs 
in a healthy way forces stale air out of the lungs and allows 
oxygen in and increases the level of the painkilling chemicals the 
brain itself produces 
the medical profession is coming around more and more to a 
realization of the values of humor and the positive emotions in 
general ive seen in the last 10 years quite a strong change in 
the attitudes of doctors he said 
norman cousins a former magazine editor whose 1979 book 
anatomy of an illness chronicled his comeback from a 
potentially debilitating disease with the help of humor said he was 
pleased by ljungdahls findings 
just as you know you need food to live you need humor in your 
life to live he said in a telephone interview from the university 
of california at los angeles medical school where he is now a 
professor of medical humanities 
humor must not be an accident cousins said it must be a 
constant force in your life

a jewish group suggested a rise in antisemitic 
incidents last year could be attributed in part to developments in 
the middle east the emergence of neonazi skinheads and the 50th 
anniversary of kristallnacht 
a report released thursday by the antidefamation league of bnai 
brith said 1281 antisemitic incidents were reported in the united 
states and puerto rico in 1988 with vandalism up 19 percent and 
harassment up 41 percent over 1987 the 1987 total was 1018 
last years figure was the highest of any of the past five years 
the number of incidents reached 1422 in 1982 the highest in the 10 
years the group has compiled the audit from reports by its regional 
offices and law enforcement officials 
among the incidents cited in the survey were the spraypainting 
of antisemitic and racist slogans at a jewish high school in 
doraville ga the explosion of a pipe bomb on the grounds of a 
florida synagogue and the arson of a synagogue in the new york city 
also mentioned in the report were desecrations of jewish 
cemeteries and 54 antisemitic incidents on 38 college campuses 
which included vandalism threats harassment and assault 
the report cited a november attack against a jewish university 
student in new york city as being among the most brutal assaults a 
gang of youths allegedly shouted antisemitic epithets as they beat 
robbed and stabbed the 19yearold who survived 
isnt it ironic that in our lifetime weve conquered space and 
even eradicated smallpox yet we have not developed a vaccine against 
the virus of hate said abraham foxman national director of the 
antidefamation league 
there were 117 incidents linked to palestinian unrest in israels 
west bank and gaza region foxman said he believes antisemites used 
the situation to carry out acts of hatred under the guise of a 
political conflict 
another 41 incidents were linked to the rise of socalled 
skinheads 
the skinhead subculture emerged in london as early as the 1960s 
but segments of the movement took on nazi overtones in 1985 and 
since have been supported by and associated with white supremacist 
groups 
the league said more than 60 antisemitic incidents were sparked 
by the observance of the 50th anniversary of kristallnacht the 
night of violence against jews in germany and austria that many 
believe marked the beginning of the holocaust 
new york led the nation with 208 incidents half of those in new 
york city california had 121 florida 89 and new jersey 67 there 
were no incidents reported in 10 states 
according to the survey 124 people were arrested for 
antisemitic acts in 1988 approximately 90 percent of whom were 
under 21 
it was a record year for harassment incidents against jewish 
institutions in the 10 years the survey has been taken the group 
reported 133 such cases up about 10 percent from previous years

you would think that in this barren broadway 
season just about any song and dance celebration sporting music by 
ellington arlen armstrong handy and others would lift the spirits 
but for much of the time thats not the case with black and 
blue the new musical revue that opened thursday at broadways 
minskoff theater its an uneven production that contains flashes of 
sass and expert tap dancing but too often settles for the routine 
responsibility for that predictability lies with claudio segovia 
and hector orezzoli who are credited in the program with conceiving 
and directing this new revue the duo creators of the hit tango 
argentino have staged black and blue with surprisingly little 
style something their earlier show had in abundance 
the musical attempts to recreate the sizzle and snap of the 
cotton club and apollo revues that galvanized harlem audiences in 
1920s 30s and 40s black and blue might work better in a 
nightclub setting in the cavernous minskoff the lack of production 
values are apparent as is the perfunctory quality of henry letangs 
ensemble choreography which seems more las vegas glitz than uptown 
swagger 
excitement is confined mainly to a small group of terrific tap 
dancers mostly in solos duets and trios the tappers include such 
veterans as bunny briggs jimmy slyde ralph brown and lon chaney as 
well as a talented young hoofer named savion glover 
briggs a little man with saucer eyes and an impish smile 
infuses his tap routines with a delicacy that is astonishing he 
embraces ellingtons in a sentimental mood treating the song as 
if it were a partner and creates a joyousness that is hard to 
resist 
slyde gets similar results with stompin at the savoy but 
his style is smoother slicker more like a fred astaire routine 
and how many dancers can skate across the stage in taps 
the best number in the show is another ellington ditty east 
st louis toodleoo with brown and chaney two elder statesman of 
tap showing that age hasnt diminished their love of dance 
most of the singing falls to three formidable ladies ruth 
brown linda hopkins and carrie smith each of these women has her 
moment a showcase to strut her stuff but often their talents are 
not used to best advantage 
miss brown tears up the place in st louis blues and the 
raunchy if i cant sell it ill keep sittin on it but then 
seems uneasy in an overly contrived version of body and soul 
miss smith with the deepest voice this side of vaughan monroe 
shines through two illconceived production numbers one to ive 
got the right to sing the blues it places her on a huge silver 
orb that rolls out on stage and then tilts backwards subjecting the 
audience to a bad case of vertigo the second am i blue has 
her perched on a swing high above the stage while the long train of 
her dress billows to the floor 
miss hopkins may have the most forceful of the three voices but 
she tends to diminish its power by going for the easy laugh and cute 
gesture or phrasing that cuteness mars songs such as cry like a 
baby a raucous big maybelle smith number 
segovia and orezzoli also created the scenery costumes and 
lighting their settings are minimal mostly curtains in various 
shades of red yellow blue and gray but they serve as backdrops 
for the teams striking lighting designs 
the lighting allows for the performers shadows sometimes 
reaching to proscenium to hover over the stage or to be splashed 
on the side walls of the theater these dancing shadows spark im 
confessin that i love you the one ensemble number that really 
utilizes the performers the stage and the production design 
the fine orchestra conducted by leonard oxley is composed of 
expert musicians including sir roland hanna as its principal piano 
soloist 
the best of the recent black musical revues the original 
aint misbehavin and the offbroadway hit one mo time for 
example harnessed an energy that built throughout the entire 
evening black and bllue scatters its resources and could end 
after just about any number in the second act theres no emotional 
payoff instead you have to wait patiently for those marvelous tap 
dancers to come on stage and take over the place 
in other reviews 
howard kissel in the daily news said the show is in a class by 
itself black and blue is closer in spirit to other eras 
he wrote if you listen you hear a dignity an elegance a 
worldliness that stands in great contrast to the aggressiveness and 
desperation that underlie so much of our pop music 
in the new york post clive barnes called the show downright 
terrific it has passion finesse fun and above all style 
but frank rich in the new york times said the show was a weird 
at times diverting crosscultural mishmash 
while bursting with talent worthy of the cotton club or the 
apollo or birdland black and blue looks like the bloated 
nightclub floor shows that used to flourish in decadent latin 
american capitals just before dictatorships collapsed

h claude hudson a national director of the 
naacp and longtime civil rights activist who once was jailed for his 
efforts to end segregation has died at age 102

saturday with pneumonia he died thursday 
since 1953 he served on the national board of directors of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people and had 
devoted his life to ensuring equality for all people friends said 
he was one of our great freedom fighters said jose desosa 
state chairman of the naacp dr h claude hudson has left his 
footprints in the sand throughout the united states in his effort 
and involvement in the naacp 
hudson was born april 19 1886 the son of sharecropper parents 
in marksville la and came to los angeles in 1923 reportedly at 
the urging of louisiana law enforcement who felt he stirred up too 
much trouble while president of the shreveport la chapter of the 
naacp 
at that time being a member of the naacp was tantamount to 
being a member of the suicide club said family spokeswoman gisele 
hudson 
he graduated from wiley college in texas and from howard 
university dental school in washington dc in 1931 he became the 
first black to receive a law degree from loyola university school of 
law mrs hudson said 
it was at howard that he developed a longstanding involvement 
with the naacp which held its first convention at the university 
while head of the los angeles naacp chapter hudson was involved 
in efforts to end segregation on county beaches he and seven other 
naacp leaders briefly were jailed in 1925 after wading into the 
ocean to test the policy at manhattan beach 
they were fined 500 for violating the noswimming ordinance 
applying to blacks but the case later was thrown out by the courts 
and the segregation policy abandoned mrs hudson said 
he is survived by his wife lena four children and five 
grandchildren 
services were scheduled for feb 2 in los angeles

soviet and afghan forces shelled a 
mountain tunnel on the highway connecting kabul to the soviet union 
then wiped out villages to the south killing hundreds of civilians 
western diplomats said 
as tensions escalated during the last phases of the soviet troop 
withdrawal secretary of state james a baker iii on thursday 
ordered the us embassy in kabul closed citing increased turmoil 
in the afghan capital 
japan today also ordered its embassy closed in kabul and its 
diplomatic personnel to leave the country because of deteriorating 
conditions 
western diplomats in islamabad quoted reports from kabul that 
soviet and afghan forces had launched a major shelling attack on 
both ends of the 10mile salang tunnel in an effort to reopen the 
crucial salang highway which is carrying red army troops home from 
afghanistan 
the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity quoted 
witnesses as calling the attack a major atrocity 
a dispatch from kabul received by one western embassy quoted 
reports of witnesses seeing soviet tanks rolling over dead bodies 
of victims along the highway which runs for 250 miles between 
kabul and the soviet border 
the tunnel part of the highway cuts through the hindu kush 
mountains about 60 miles north of the capital 
after shelling the north and south ends of the salang tunnel 
soviet and afghan artillery obliterated all dwellings and villages 
south of the tunnel the diplomats quoted the reports as saying 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman said 
there are eyewitnesses who say no dwellings remain and hundreds of 
civilians were killed 
the dispatch received by the western embassy said the report of 
all houses being destroyed came from three separate sources 
including a diplomat who defends the afghan government 
afghan media and military officers had reported 377 guerrillas 
were killed tuesday along the salang highway where the insurgents 
fighting the kabul government have attacked many food and fuel 
convoys trying to reach the capital 
heavy snows also have blocked parts of the road and kabul has 
suffered severe food and fuel shortages as the end of the soviet 
military withdrawal approaches 
moslem guerrillas backed by the united states and pakistan have 
fought tha kabul government since a communist coup in april 1978 
soviet troops intevened in 1979 to fight the rebels last may the 
red army began withdrawing under a unmediated agreement and all 
soviet military forces are to be gone by feb 15 
the diplomats attributed the brutal soviet and afghan attack 
monday to a desire to intimidate ahmed shah masoud generally 
considered the most effective guerrilla commander in afghanistan 
masoud controls the panjshir valley through which the salang 
highway runs 
in islamabad the pakistani government said today that soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze would arrive next week for 
talks on a settlement in afghanistan 
a foreign ministry spokesman said shevardnadze would meet feb 4 
with president ghulam ishaq khan prime minister benazir bhutto and 
foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan there was no immediate 
confirmation from moscow 
shevardnadze would be the highest ranking soviet leader to visit 
pakistan in more than 20 years 
in another development thursday the army tried to counter 
charges it has dragged young men from their homes to fight afghan 
guerrillas by displaying what it said were volunteers solemn 
teenagers and men in their late 30s 
as the soviet military withdraws afghanistans conscript army 
desperately needs recruits although two years of army service is 
mandatory thousands of afghans have deserted many young men have 
fled the country either to avoid conscription or to join the 
insurgents 
bakers decision to shut down the kabul embassy came on his first 
day at his new job 
the us diplomatic contingent in kabul already had been reduced 
to less than 10 officers and security guards an official source in 
washington speaking on condition of anonymity said the pullout 
would be carried out over several days 
a growing list of countries are debating whether to do the same 
on saturday the west german embassy became the first foreign 
embassy to close 
besides the diplomatic group fewer than 20 private us citizens 
remain in afghanistan most westerners are with the international 
aid mission a charitable organization that has operated in 
afghanistan for many years 
the us embassy said tuesday it sent a warning letter to 
americans that a critical point had come in the kabul area 
increased instablity was likely and they should leave while 
commercial flights remained available 
only the soviet airline aeroflot and ariana the afghan 
government airline still operate from kabul aeroflot uses military 
planes and ariana flights are unpredictable sometimes delayed or 
canceled for lack of fuel

plo chief yasser arafat met today with three 
european foreign ministers in his first official contact with the 
common market whose support he is seeking for an international 
peace conference on the middle east 
the head of the palestine liberation organization arrived in the 
spanish capital late thursday from iraq and went directly to a 
fourhour working dinner with prime minister felipe gonzalez 
neither made a statement following the meeting but a spanish 
government spokesman said both men considered 1989 a very 
important year in the search for peace in the middle east 
on thursday a senior plo official said in baghdad that arafat 
would urge the spanish french and greek foreign ministers to 
recognize the symbolic state of palestine that was proclaimed nov 
15 during a meeting of palestinian leaders in tunisia 
israel balks at the idea of an international peace conference 
that would include countries not directly involved in the conflict 
and refuses to recognize the plo as an valid representative of the 
palestinian people 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir let foreign minister 
francisco fernandez ordonez know during the spanish officials trip 
to jerusalem earlier this month that israel felt the eec had no 
business getting involved in a middle east peace conference 
since an uprising against israeli military presence in the 
occupied territories began 13 months ago 369 palestinians and 15 
israelis have been killed 
fernandez ordonez said the meeting between arafat and the three 
european leaders was being held to comply with a mandate by the 
eec council of foreign ministers which decided we should initiate 
diplomatic action with the parties implicated in the middle east 
problem to promote the peace process 
during spains current sixmonth presidency of the common market 
fernandez ordonez heads the groups foreign ministers 
the other two members of the eec trio are greek foreign minister 
carolos papoulias and french foreign minister roland dumas greece 
chaired the eec for the final half of last year and france will 
take over for six months in july 
the plo leader was to have an audience with king juan carlos 
later today and to hold a news conference before departing

company is responsible for handling its not due to lack of 
monitoring 
us department of energy documents show that at least 9500 
gallons of radioactive nuclear waste leaked from the tanks in 1988 
the documents indicate that at least seven of 149 aging 
singlewalled tanks leaked last year adding to the more than 
500000 gallons that have leaked into soil surrounding the 
milliongallon singleshelled tanks since the late 1970s 
jim thomas of the hanford education action league a 
spokanebased citizens watchdog group called the latest leaks a 
drop in the bucket compared to past leaks 
but environmental contamination is still happening he said 
thursday 
the energy department said the leaked wastes stay near the tanks 
and dont enter the groundwater posing no environmental or health 
risks 
klink said 115000 gallons that leaked from a tank in 1973 have 
stayed within 165 feet of that tank 
singlewalled tanks are no longer used at least 95 of the tanks 
have had pumpable liquids transferred into 28 newer doublewalled 
tanks on the site 
the wastes are byproducts of more than 40 years of plutonium 
production for nuclear weapons at the southcentral washington site 
hanford is generally considered the most contaminated of the doe 
production sites and estimates for cleaning it up run to 57 
billion over the next 50 years 
some of the singleshell tanks date back to the manhattan project 
beginnings of hanford in the early 1940s and over the years at 
least 66 of the singleshell tanks have been classified as assumed 
leakers 
however a large volume of nonpumpable but moist salt cake 
remains at the bottom of the tanks energy department officials 
admit they are unsure how to permanently dispose of those highly 
concentrated wastes

the head of the defense agency today expressed 
regret over us defense secretarydesignate john towers call for 
japan to increase its military spending 
as for mr towers comment that japan can greatly increase its 
defense efforts under the constitution i have the feeling mr tower 
does not understand the japanese peoples feelings and 
perspective agency directorgeneral kichiro tazawa told reporters 
i regret that mr tower went so far as to refer to our 
constitution to push us to expand our defense spending said 
tazawa 
his comments were in response to statements wednesday by tower 
who is undergoing confirmation hearings before the us senate armed 
services committee 
tower a former republican senator from texas said the 
constitution formulated during the postwar us occupation of japan 
severely restrained them from building a substantial military 
force and was a lousy idea 
but i dont believe that constitution is so restraining that 
they couldnt devote a substantially larger percentage of spending 
to their defense tower said 
the japanese constitution adopted in 1946 renounces war and 
forbids the use of force in settling international disputes but 
japan has been steadily building up its armed forces in recent years 
in response to heavy pressure from the united states 
acting us defense secretary william taft on thursday hailed 
japans increased allotment for defense in its budget for the next 
fiscal year 
i commend the government of japan for continuing to do what is 
necessary to meet japans defense goals and to positively support 
us forces in japan he was quoted by kyodo news service as 
saying given the continuing threat posed by soviet forces in the 
pacific growth in japans defense and costsharing efforts is fully 
justified 
japans cabinet this week approved a budget for fiscal 1989 that 
includes 305 billion for defense spending a 59 percent increase 
over the previous year the budget still must be passed by 
parliament 
the proposed defense budget will amount to slightly more than 1 
percent of japans gross national product the total value of goods 
and services as it did in 1988 and 1987 the united states devotes 
about 6 percent of its gross national product to military spending 
washingtons european allies spend about 3 or 4 percent on defense

balmy temperatures and a lack of snow in such typically snowbound 
sections as wisconsin and new england have made this a winter of 
discontent for devotees of pastimes like snow sculpting and 
snowmobiling 
in milwaukee the popular us international snow sculpturing 
competition would have been snowless had organizers not saved 10ton 
blocks of snow from a storm last month ice sculptors were forced 
inside thursday by temperatures in the upper 30s 
now thats not wisconsin in the winter said wendell howard 
of waukesha who was visiting the icebreaker winter funfest there 
we like something around more around zero or 20 below at least 
for a couple of weeks in january 
in snowstarved boston traditional winter white has been 
replaced by dreary browns and grays about an inch of snow fell 
thursday but was quickly melted by a drizzle 
you take what you can get said national weather service 
meteorologist bernie schor 
boston gets 125 inches of snow during a normal january and has 
temperatures in the 30s this year the weather has been dry and 
warm with temperatures above 50 degrees some days 
this is not a record year but its down with a handful of low 
years schor said 
milwaukee has had 125 inches of snow so far this winter only 
about a fourth of the normal seasonal total temperatures this month 
have averaged more than 28 degrees about 10 degrees above normal 
the weather posed a major problem for the winter festival and its 
snow sculpting contest which draws thousands of spectators and 
features highly detailed creations more than 8 feet tall crafted by 
teams from 10 nations 
organizers recommended that sculptors work at night when 
temperatures are lower ordered wood chips to cover muddied grounds 
and moved icesculpting events to an ice house 
snow sculptors looked really dejected really disappointed 
because they had to be indoors karin bach of the canadian womens 
team said thursday but were all back today and well still have 
some excellent works no matter what the weather she said 
gene kempfer director of the snow sculpting competition said 
the forecast for springlike temperatures this weekend forced him to 
move up the time of the judging saturday so judges could see the 
finished products before the sun began melting them 
the weather has also been bad news for snowmobilers in southern 
wisconsin 
were wiped out this year as far snow goes said dick 
killian executive secretary of the wisconsin snowmobiles club 
in upstate wisconsin snow has been plentiful for skiers but ice 
fishermen have been advised to use caution because frozen lakes are 
not as solid as they should be 
in boston the mild weather has lowered heating and municipal 
costs the city has spent about 700000 on winterrelated jobs like 
snow removal compared to the 2 million spent by this time last 
year said city public works commissioner joe casazza 
the dearth of moisture has prompted concern about water supplies 
our quabbin reservoir which is the largest reservoir in the 
northeast is down to 68 percent full and normally it is at about 81 
or 82 percent of capacity so thats a significant shortfall said 
ilyas bhatti director of metropolitan watershed management division 
we are definitely concerned about it i think if we dont get 
enough precipitation this winter were probably going to be facing 
severe water supply problems this summer he said 
skiers in new england have had to ski on machinemade snow until 
the past couple weeks 
some places have gotten snow on thursday a driving snowstorm 
dumped up to 6 inches of snow on much of maine delaying flights 
closing schools and causing numerous traffic accidents 
but merchants had little hope the storm would salvage poor sales 
of such winter gear as shovels and snow tires 
for us its too far into winter for it to do any good 
said robert jackman sales manager of wescott amp sons in standish 
you need a couple good storms a few times a week then people 
will get back into winter products

vietnams foreign minister today said 
cambodian peace talks in indonesia would be held as scheduled 
despite reports that cambodian resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk will not attend 
nguyen co thatch compared the peace talks beginning feb 19 with 
the final 15 minutes of a soccer match where everyone is trying to 
score a point if anyone misses the match it is his 
responsibility 
the match will continue i only hope prince sihanouk will 
change his stand thach told a news conference 
reports from china published in indian newspapers today quoted 
sihanouk as saying he will not take part in the talks sihanouk 
reportedly linked his decision to the rejection of his fivepoint 
cambodian peace plan by hun sen premier of cambodias 
vietnambacked government 
the role of prince sihanouk is very important but he cannot 
decide everything thach said 
thach was in india along with nguyen van linh secretarygeneral 
of vietnams communist party who was the chief guest at indias 
republic day celebrations on thursday 
vietnamese troops invaded camdobia in late 1978 and installed a 
prohanoi government in phnom penh vietnam says it will pull out 
completely from cambodia by the end of 1990 or perhaps sooner if a 
political solution is reached 
hanoi says it now has 50000 troops in cambodia but us 
diplomats in bangkok put the figure at 80000 
the vietnamese are fighting a coalition of three major cambodian 
resistance groups the communist khmer rouge the noncommunist 
khmer peoples national liberation front of former cambodian prime 
minister son sann and followers of sihanouk 
armed strength of the resistance is generally estimated at about 
47000 with the khmer rouge as the strongest faction 
the vietnamese invaded cambodia in 1978 to drive the khmer rouge 
from power from the 1975 takeover of the khmer rouge to its ouster 
it is estimated that about 2 million of cambodias 8 million people 
died from khmer rouge executions famine and civil unrest

how do you examine a 400pound gorilla very 
carefully say veterinarians at miamis metrozoo 
jimmie the zoos star peanutcatching lowland gorilla came due 
for his annual physical exam wednesday and it proved to be more 
trying for the vets than for the patient 
the 22yearold ape has been at metrozoo for five years and 
apparently knew something was up when veterinarian scott citino 
appeared at his enclosure jimmie bobbed and weaved like a boxer as 
citino tried to shoot him with an anesthetic dart 
it took three hours and several blasts of the dart gun before 
jimmie was hit with a dart that put him to sleep only then did he 
get his physical which was a good deal more physical for the 
zookeepers than for jimmie 
it took eight keepers to lift jimmie off the bed of a pickup 
truck into metrozoos ultramodern hospital there he was weighed 
xrayed inoculated for tetanus injected with antibiotics attached 
to an electrocardiograph tested for tuberculosis probed with an 
ultrasound machine and checked for eye ear and throat diseases he 
even had his teeth cleaned and blood samples taken 
cardiologist donald rosenberg who had never examined an ape 
before and was brought in because keepers feared jimmie had a heart 
problem was ecstatic afterward 
jimmies a lot better than a lot of my patients he said 
he doesnt sound off and he doesnt have thoughts of malpractice 
in his head

forget the better mousetrap andrew brown 
has designed the better tennis racket 
thats what brown says and hes won over at least one 
authoritative convert no not mats wilander were talking about 
frank katch chairman of the exercise science department at the 
university of massachesetts 
when katch tried out browns racket which has a sixsided handle 
instead of the traditional eight he hit perfect backhands on the 
first few tries 
i have never done that before the professor said in 
amazement 
by scrutinizing the racket through highspeed cameras and a 
computer that traced reflective markers on players wrists katch 
said he verified browns claim that shifting the handle angle 
slightly and making it hexagonal rather than octagonal does wonders 
for shots 
brown a cincinnati actuary said the inspiration for the handle 
came when he and his wife suffered a humiliating loss to another 
couple they ran us off the court i got so incensed by the whole 
thing i said im going to do something about it 
he spent a month shaving the angles off a wooden handle at home 
building new angles with wood putty and testing his experiment every 
morning before work at a tennis club 
it turns out the guy was within hundredths of a degree 
correct katch said it makes the wrist work like its supposed 
to work

un special envoy jan eliasson arrived in 
the southern iraqi port of basra from tehran today seeking to 
breathe new life into stalled iraniraq peace talks officials 
reported 
eliasson inspected ceasefire lines in the region and was 
scheduled to fly by helicopter to baghdad later for meetings with 
senior iraqi leaders including foreign minister tariq aziz un 
officials reported 
eliasson swedens un ambassador and secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellars special emissary said before leaving tehran 
it is very important to create a new momentum to speed up the 
trend of future peace talks 
the negotiations began aug 25 five days after a unsponsored 
ceasefire in the 8yearold gulf war took effect 
the talks ended in deadlock nov 11 after several sessions with 
both sides accusing the other of obstructing progress 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus quoted eliasson as saying at tehran airport that his four 
days of talks with prime minister hussein musavi foreign minister 
ali akbar velayati and other officials were very useful and 
fruitful he did not elaborate 
irna quoted musavi as blaming iraq for the deadlock by refusing 
to withdraw from territory iran claims the iraqis captured in a 
series of offensives before the ceasefire took effect aug 20 
before leaving iran eliasson inspected the southern front line 
with deputy foreign minister mohammad javad lavasani irna said 
the agency said the envoy was taken to an area where tehran said 
the iraqis captured several hundred iranians after the aug 20 
ceasefire eliasson also saw three burning oil wells which the 
iranians said the iraqis set afire 
after this visit effective steps will be taken by the 
secretarygeneral to secure the release of our prisoners and in 
helping us extinguish these oil wells irna quoted lavasani as 
saying he did not elaborate 
un officials in baghdad said eliassons talks were aimed at 
exploring possibilities for resuming the peace talks no date has 
been set for a new round of negotiations 
the talks have stalled on iraqs insistence that a 1975 treaty 
drawing the southern border between the two countries down the 
middle of the shattalarab waterway is invalid 
before the treaty the border ran down the eastern iranian bank 
which meant the iraqis effectively controlled the waterway their 
main outlet to the persian gulf iran insists the treaty is still in 
force

the federal aviation administration ordered 
steppedup inspections for the bolts holding engines to the wings of 
boeing 737 jets after investigators found that cracked bolts caused 
an engine to fall off a plane in chicago last week 
under the directive issued thursday the faa is requiring us 
airlines to decrease the interval for ultrasonic inspections for 
cracks in cone bolts from 600 to 300 landings the directive applies 
to 432 planes in boeings 737100 and 737200 series 
dick meyer an faa spokesman in seattle said the directive also 
requires more checks to ensure that the cone bolts have been 
properly installed 
the order stemmed from a jan 20 incident in which the right 
engine fell off a piedmont airlines plane immediately after takeoff 
from chicagos ohare international airport 
the control tower immediately told the pilot to return to ohare 
but tapes released this week showed the pilot never fully realized 
the problem until the plane was back on ground a few minutes later 
none of the 27 passengers or six crew members was injured 
the incident was the second of its kind involving a boeing 
737200 series twinengine jet in the last 13 months 
james kolstad acting chairman of the national transportation 
safety board blamed the accident on metal fatigue that caused a 
back bolt to fracture that in turn put the two front bolts under 
stress causing their eventual fracture and leaving the engine free 
to fall off he said 
his conclusion was delivered in a letter thursday to faa 
administrator t allan mcartor 
there are several ways it fatigue could have happened said 
william bruce who is heading the ntsb investigation what caused 
the fatigue is what were looking for 
meyer said the agency soon will issue a notice of proposed rule 
making to reduce the amount of time airlines have to install 
secondary support structures to help hold the engines on the planes 
airlines currently must install the supports within 4000 
landings after the original order was issued 
records show the piedmont jet involved in the ohare incident had 
been inspected properly according to kolstads letter and the 
enginemount bolts fractured after just 330 cycles 
the piedmont jet did not have the secondary support structure 
but had not completed 4000 cycles since the most recent faa order 
in his letter kolstad recommended the faa require installation 
of secondary support structures as early as the availability of 
parts permits 
boeing spokesman jack gamble said the seattle aerospace company 
praised the faas order adding we think its the safe thing to 
do 
at a news conference thursday boeing officials also responded to 
a television report saying more than 20 boeing jetliners were fitted 
last fall with misassembled parts the problem was unrelated to the 
problems involved in the chicago incident 
phil condit a boeing vice president said a pin installed as a 
safety backup to ensure steering cables remained on a pulley was 
misassembled in three 737 jets but safety was never an issue 
the airplane would have been perfectly safe without having it 
the backup safety pin there at all condit said adding that 
the process and the system worked in discovering the problem

the city finally has admitted 
ragtime the tiny stallion is really a horse of a different color 
after a twoyear fight to evict the pintsized steed that patty 
fairchild keeps as a pet the city council voted wednesday night to 
give up 
larry horner mayor of this los angeles suburb said the decision 
came partly because council members were afraid of being saddled 
with an international reputation as animalhaters 
from new york to nova scotia people are telling us to stop 
picking on the horse horner said its time to just bow out of 
it 
ragtime who stands just 27 inches tall is a special breed of 
miniature horse he sleeps in the yard but has the run of the house 
and is even allowed to sit on the sofa and watch television 
im just relieved mrs fairchild said after the vote it 
just feels good that its all over 
some people in mrs fairchilds upper middleclass neighborhood 
say a horse is a horse no matter how small and they spurred the 
city on in its efforts to kick ragtime out in keeping with an 
ordinance barring farm animals from residential neighborhoods 
the issue has been in court twice most recently two weeks ago 
when ventura municipal judge john hunter decided ragtime was a pet 
and so couldnt be corralled out of the neighborhood under the 
antilivestock law 
but neighsayers like the oakbrook village homeowners association 
say they havent given up yet the association will raise its 
antiragtime arguments once again in a lawsuit scheduled for a 
hearing feb 27

members anarchists before sentencing them to up to 15 years in 
prison for killing a state corrections officer in a shootout at the

an aide to defense minister yitzhak rabin held 
secret meetings with a jailed palestinian linked to the plo and 
reports of their talks were passed to top plo officials abroad an 
israeli newspaper said today 
defense ministry spokesman eitan haber declined to comment on the 
report israel officially bans contacts with the palestine 
liberation organization which it views as a terrorist group it 
bitterly protested a us decision last month to open a dialogue 
with the group 
the daily maariv reported that the meetings took place between 
shmuel goren israels policy coordinator for the west bank and 
faisal husseini whom the defense ministry confirmed thursday would 
be freed 
maariv said the two discussed possible peace initiatives 
including rabins plan to hold elections in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip and to grant arabs limited autonomy following a 
threetosixmonth ceasefire in the palestinian uprising 
the talks reportedly took place during the past week in the kfar 
yonah prison in central israel where husseini has been serving a 
sixmonth term without trial 
fuad alaref an associate of husseini said he talked with the 
jailed palestinian leader monday and asked about rumors that he had 
been meeting a defense ministry official he denied it alaref 
said 
husseini is due to be freed from prison sunday and the daily 
hadashot reported he would meet with rabin after his release to 
discuss the defense ministers plans for peace negotiations 
rabins proposal made public early this week has been rejected

jack kemp seeking confirmation as secretary of 
housing and urban development told congress today that homelessness 
is a national tragedy of appalling proportions and pledged to 
improve housing conditions in america 
in remarks prepared for his confirmation hearing before the 
senate banking committee kemp said we can help recapture the 
american dream for our distressed inner cities and those who live in 
poverty and despair 
on the problem of homelessness kemp noted that president bush is 
committed to full funding of the mckinney act which congress passed 
last year to provide emergency shelter 
but he said funding while necessary is not sufficient we 
need to work together to provide a complete and effective safety 
net with both public and private efforts 
it is a national tragedy of appalling proportions that there 
are americans without basic shelter and human services kemp said 
he also pledged to work toward making home ownership possible for 
people in public housing to press for urban enterprise zones to 
encourage inner city development and to seek a national housing 
policy that will make housing more affordable for poor and young 
families 
kemp has shored up support among his former colleagues on capitol 
hill personally meeting or speaking by telephone with each member 
of the panel since bush nominated him most have said they 
unequivocally support his confirmation and a few declined to make 
their decision public before the hearing but none said they oppose 
him 
i think it was one of the best appointments the new president 
made said sen phil gramm rtexas a conservative ally im 
sure hes going to be confirmed 
gramm said he hoped to question kemp about the possibility of 
expanding nationwide a pilot program begun two weeks ago in dallas 
that makes vacant hud houses available to families with incomes as 
low as 15000 a year 
sen jim sasser budget committee chairman and member of the 
subcommittee on housing who supports kemps confirmation wants to 
know what direction kemp plans to take on several rental subsidy 
programs due to expire soon 
in notes prepared for todays session the tennessee democrat 
said that by not addressing this situation head on it seems that 
we are making a policy choice to increase the number of homeless 
he also intended to query the nominee about proposals to impose 
user fees on federal home loans sasser said such fees would 
increase interest rates on home mortgages drive more people from 
the housing market contribute to stress on the rental market and 
further increase homelessness he also said the idea is contrary 
to an explicit provision that the committee put in the 1987 housing 
and community development act 
others said they wanted to know his thoughts about rural housing 
problems and energy efficiency in public housing

a man has asked a court to appoint him the 
guardian of his comatose wife so he can authorize an abortion in an 
attempt to help her recover 
martin klein 34 of upper brookville said in papers filed 
thursday in state supreme court that doctors told him his wife 
nancy 32 would have a better chance of recovery if the pregnancy 
were terminated 
supreme court justice john burke signed an order which requires 
north shore university hospital in manhasset the state attorney 
general and the nassau county district attorney to show why klein 
should not be appointed guardian 
legal experts say the case is unusual 
it is a very complicated sensitive medical and ethical 
question said andrew schepard a family law professor at hofstra 
university law school on the one hand the mother has a shot at 
life and on the other hand this is considered a viable fetus and 
who gets to decide it is going to require complex medical 
testimony 
mrs klein who is 16 weeks pregnant has been in a coma and on a 
respirator since being injured in a car accident dec 12 
dr joseph smith of the albert einstein college of medicine 
backed klein with a letter to the court that said i believe with 
a degree of medical certainty that mrs kleins pregnancy presents a 
serious threat to her life 
klein who said he visits his wife almost every day said his 
wifes mother ann zusselman and other family members support his 
request 
a hospital spokeswoman carol hauptman declined to comment 
saying the hospital had not been served with the court order 
the kleins have a 3yearold daughter

government officials said the united states 
informed them that a proposed fourmile border ditch would be built 
to carry drainage not to deter drug smugglers and illegal 
immigrants 
in a statement thursday foreign ministry officials acknowledged 
they knew about plans for the 5footdeep 14footwide ditch along 
the san diegotijuana border but they said they had been told it 
was to solve rainwater drainage problems on the flat otay mesa 
along the international border 
the mexican government was not told the purpose of this 
construction could be to control migration or anything else of that 
nature the statement said 
several mexican congressmen reacted angrily to the proposal 
calling it unfriendly and saying it would not stop the flow of 
illegal immigrants 
in the united states immigrant rights activists called it 
repressive and illconceived 
the 2 million ditch which associate attorney general francis a 
keating ii likened to a buried berlin wall will traverse an 
area east of san ysidro calif that is a major route for drug 
smuggling and border crossing 
keating said the primary purpose of the ditch would be to 
discourage drug smugglers from driving cars and trucks across the 
border 
although the mexican government expressed no opinion on the 
proposal president carlos salinas de gortari is among those who say 
the us policy of exclusion fails to recognize that emigrants from 
mexico are filling a need by taking jobs that most americans dont 
want 
immigration experts say the isolated otay mesa is the most 
popular crossing point for illegal immigrants along the 1950mile 
usmexico border 
about one third of the 12 million illegal immigrants captured 
along the border last year were apprehended at otay mesa officials 
say up to 400 vehicles are believed to cross the border illegally 
into san diego each month 
the foreign ministry said the ditch had been discussed by the 
international boundary and water commission as a remedy for area 
flooding problems but it said the commission which includes 
members from both countries never talked about the project as a 
barrier to drug traffickers or illegal immigrants 
both governments through their respective commissioners have 
been consulted about ways of resolving the problem of drainage of 
rain waters the statement said 
the construction of this ditch is only one of many proposals 
that have come before the commission and in no moment was it 
approved by the two governments it said 
the excelsior news service on thursday quoted deputy guadalupe 
gomez maganda president of the foreign relations committee as 
saying the proposal was unfriendly gomez maganda reportedly 
said he would bring the matter up at the next interparliamentary 
meeting on usmexico relations 
deputy alberto ling altamirano of the conservative national 
action party said the proposal isnt so much aggressive as it is 
silly 
they arent going to stop anyone while there are hungry people 
in mexico and there is a clandestine labor market in the united 
states he said 
the government news service notimex also criticized the proposal 
in an editorial calling it a violent call to the attention of the 
mexican government and to all political and social groups interested 
in the defense of sovereignty and national dignity 
in washington on thursday a private group lobbying to stem the 
flow of illegal immigrants proposed charging a 2 fee to enter the 
country and using the money to tighten border security 
the nonprofit group the federation for american immigration 
reform said the estimated 500600 million a year in revenue from 
the fees should go toward intensified patrols of the usmexico 
border and replacement of 28 miles of metal fence

libyan leader moammar gadhafi says in a 
television interview that he has never had direct contact with any 
american administration and he would like to open a dialogue during 
the george bush presidency 
he called bush a man who is completely different from reagan 
hes a politician a factual man a practical man 
reagan used to treat the presidency as a theater where he 
performs his acts 
gadhafi spoke through an interpreter during the interview with 
barbara walters which was conducted monday in a tent in gadhafis 
compound in tripoli the interview is being aired tonight on the abc 
program 2020 
gadhafi denied that he or his country support terrorism but he 
likened palestinian terrorist leader abu nidal to george washington 
sun yatsen and garibaldi as a liberator of his country 
he advised a wait and see position with respect to recent 
peace overtures toward israel voiced by yasser arafat leader of the 
palestine liberation organization 
he said if palestinians did get their homeland back israel would 
cease to exist because it is impossible to establish two states 
between the jordan river and the mediterranean sea 
he insisted that the chemical plant under construction in his 
country will produce medicine and not chemical weapons as the 
united states charges and said diplomats and reporters would be 
invited to the opening 
but he said he would not permit the precedent of letting outside 
inspectors to have access to the plant at will 
if this is going to be the case we ought to nominate an 
international observing commission to inspect all factories and 
plants in the world continuously periodically he said

irans president today criticized 
president bush for saying that washington would appreciate help in 
gaining the release of the nine americans held hostage in lebanon 
tehran radio reported 
also today hopes faded that two britons held hostage in lebanon 
would be freed soon a radio station said the expected release was 
mere speculation 
apparently interpreting bushs statements to mean that release of 
the hostages was a precondition for resuming ties with iran 
president ali khamenei said in setting conditions for resumption 
of ties the american president should know that we not they have 
conditions to set 
we have always said that ties with america can only be resumed 
when america revises its arrogant attitude khamenei added 
it was america which expressed interest in resuming ties with 
iran iran does not need america the radio reported him as 
saying the report was monitored in nicosia 
bush said in his inaugural address that the united states would 
cooperate with any country that could help release the american 
hostages in lebanon 
he did not mention iran by name but his remarks were seen as a 
call for iran to help free the hostages with the promise of better 
relations 
ties between the united states and iran were severed soon after 
the 1979 islamic revolution when militant iranian students took 
over the us embassy in tehran and held 52 americans hostage for 
444 days 
fifteen foreigners including the nine americans are believed 
held hostage in west beirut by proiranian factions the hostage 
held longest is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
reports in beirut the last three days spoke of a release by 
saturday of john mccarthy a journalist and brian keenan a teacher 
who holds irish and british citizenship 
a british embassy spokesman had said the purpose of ambassador 
allan ramseys visit thursday to moslem west beirut was to check the 
reports 
however embassy spokesman antoine haddad told the associated 
press today we still have no hard information he would not 
comment further 
the voice of the nation radio station based in moslem west 
beirut said today reports of an imminent hostage release 
appeared to be mere speculation based on rumors 
mccarthy 31 a producer for the londonbased worldwide 
television news agency was kidnapped april 17 1986 as he drove to 
the airport for a flight home keenan 38 was kidnapped six days 
earlier as he walked to the american university of beirut 
no group has claimed the abduction of mccarthy or keenan

czechoslovakia announced today it 
will cut its armed forces by 12000 soldiers and reduce its army 
budget 15 percent in the next two years 
the move followed announcements of troop cuts by east germany and 
hungary and of defense spending reductions in poland 
all four nations acted after the soviet union announced dec 7 it 
will reduce its forces by 500000 men by 1991 this will include 
withdrawing 50000 troops and 5000 tanks from east germany hungary 
and czechoslovakia 
the warsaw pact troop cuts have been billed by the kremlin as a 
boost to new eastwest talks opening in march on reducing 
conventional arms and weapons across europe 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has also made clear that 
slashing military spending will free more funds for sorely needed 
modernization of soviet bloc economies 
czechoslovakias official ctk news agency announced the plans a 
day after soviet army gen alexei lizichev disclosed that prague 
planned to follow east germany and hungary into force reductions 
the general gave no details but ctk said later that it was 
decided to cut the armed forces by 12000 men over the next two 
years and reduce military spending by 15 percent 
according to data from nato czechoslovakia has 145000 soldiers 
the council for the defense of the state also decided that 
czechoslovakia will scrap 85o tanks 165 armored vehicles and 51 
fighter planes ctk reported 
military maneuvers and tactical exercises will be reduced by 5o 
percent and the number of reserve soldiers will be cut by 15000 
over the twoyear period ctk said 
the measures are intended to increasingly emphasize the 
defensive nature of the czechoslovak army and represent gradual 
implementation of the initiative to create a zone of trust 
coooperation and good neighborly relations between nato and warsaw 
treaty states ctk said 
it said czechoslovakia is prepared to continue troop reductions 
if nato adopts similar measures 
in the interview thursday on ctks czechlanguage news service 
lizichev also was quoted as saying the soviets will eliminate 10000 
tanks and 800 planes worldwide as part of its announced reduction of 
the red army 
hungary announced this year it will cut military spending by 17 
percent and poland also has announced plans to reduce its military 
outlay

porters 
the male refugees ages 15 to 40 were hiding in the jungle in

friday and led off males to haul artillery and mortar shells for 
troops fighting ethnic minority rebels along the border thai 
authorities confirmed their report 
the burmese are launching a major offensive against the ethnic 
karen who field the strongest force among a dozen ethnic minority 
rebel groups seeking greater autonomy from the central government in 
rangoon

rights groups including the londonbased amnesty international for 
forcing villagers and rangoon residents to do forced labor under 
allegedly inhuman conditions 
burmese interviewed by the associated press last year said they 
escaped from troops who had forcibly taken them from rangoon to

two war criminals imprisoned 43 
years for the deaths of thousands of dutch jews were freed from 
prison today officials said hours after parliament voted to pardon 
them and expel them to west germany 
theyre not only out of prison theyre on their way to the 
federal republic where they will be handed over to the german 
authorities premier ruud lubbers said of franz fischer 87 and 
ferdinand aus der fuenten 79 
lubbers gave no further details while talking to reporters 
an ambulance left the prison in the southern city of breda where 
the two had been held and a prison wagon followed 10 minutes later 
with police escorts but neither fischer nor aus der fuenten could 
be seen authorities would not confirm the men were in the vehicles 
the decision to pardon them came in the form of a rejection of a 
motion to keep the men in prison 
the 150seat legislature voted 85 to 55 against the opposition 
labor partys motion made earlier this week there were 10 
abstentions 
in west germany where the men have relatives government 
spokesman ulrich strempel said they would be welcome and there was 
no record of charges pending against them our records indicate 
that they will be free men he said 
several demonstrators stood outside parliament during the 
debatedont make the victims suffer further never release the 
henchmen read one placard 
justice minister frits korthals altes indicated he would have 
preferred it if fischer and aus der fuenten had been put to death 
years ago but he said detaining them any longer would violate the 
principle of equality under the law 
during the war fischer headed a local branch of the nazi 
security service and was held responsible for the deportation to 
death camps of 13000 jews aus der fuenten was an ss administrator 
of a body that oversaw mass roundups of jews in the netherlands 
both were sentenced to death in 1950 but a year later their 
sentences were changed to life imprisonment 
of a prewar population of 150000 only 6000 dutch jews survived 
the holocaust 
korthals altes said fischer and aus der fuenten were the only two 
war criminals whose life prison terms had not ended in pardons 
on tuesday the government proposed a pardon that prompted the 
labor partys motion to keep them in prison 
let us rid our society of the miserable remainder of fischer 
and aus der fuentens lives korthals altes told the legislature 
personally i think it would have been better in cases like 
these if the death penalty had ultimately been executed he 
said 
i regret having to use the word pardon korthals altes 
said this is not about showing clemency to the war criminals 
shortly after the war the netherlands shot 40 war criminals 
including anton mussert head of the dutch nazi party the 
government commuted a total of 110 death sentences into life 
imprisonment 
according to the government fischer and aus der fuenten spent 
more time in prison than any other nazi war criminals

engineers have fixed a leak 
discovered in a hydrogen fuel line on space shuttle discovery which 
is being prepared for a late february launch 
nasa said the leak detected thursday was caused by a fuel line 
misalignment that was quickly corrected once the source was known 
it was in a 2inch line in a section that connects the shuttle to 
its external fuel tank 
discoverys target launch date is feb 23 but preparations have 
been running slightly behind schedule and officials said earlier 
this week they expected a delay of at least two days 
the delay could be longer if engineers dont learn why a part 
cracked in a main engine during atlantis liftoff in december they 
believe two tiny cracks found in a turbopump during postflight 
inspection were caused by stress corrosion apparently resulting 
from moisture that somehow penetrated the metal 
until they discover the source of the moisture nasa will not 
clear discovery for flight officials have expressed confidence the 
problem will be resolved in time to meet a february launch date 
if it isnt nasa is considering other options including 
postponing the discovery flight until after an atlantis mission set 
for liftoff in april 
nasa has said that if discovery cant get off the only launch pad 
available by march 14 it would postpone that mission until after 
the atlantis launch because the atlantis crew has only a 25day 
period starting april 28 during which it can deploy the magellan 
payload to probe the planet venus 
magellan has priority over discoverys communications satellite 
because venus will not be in position again to receive a visitor 
from earth until may 1991 
meanwhile in huntsville ala a space shuttle engine firing 
test scheduled at marshall space flight center was delayed after a 
problem was found in the engine control box nasa officials said 
the problem was discovered late wednesday as workers completed 
lastminute checks said len worlund deputy director of the 
centers propulsion laboratory 
nasa spokesman jim sahli said today that the shuttle flight 
schedule would not be affected by the delay since the engine is in 
the developmental stages 
the 45second firing which was scheduled for thursday afternoon 
was to be the last of three preliminary tests before engineers begin 
a program to explore new engine technology the test has been 
postponed until next week 
the engine control box or controller regulates all valves in 
the engine and monitors temperature pressure and other conditions

are searching other facilities for similar cases a newspaper 
reported today 
in an article titled diagnosis syringe the labor daily trud 
said criminal negligence was under investigation at the 
childrens hospital in elista authorities discovered the outbreak 
in november the newspaper said 
the soviet union only recently admitted to an aids problem and 
started diagnosis and treatment programs 
trud said that of 300 people screened at the hospital 27 babies 
and children most under two years old and four mothers were found 
to have the deadly disease 
the newspaper said further tests were planned on 1000 children

syringe changing only the needle which is about the same thing

epidemiology in moscow 
he told trud an investigation and trial would be conducted

barton the serial killer gave directions to investigators trying to 
find the two bodies but denied involvement in any murders in four 
other states the interview was made public by florida gov bob 
martinez office late thursday 
bundy said he didnt know the identity of his utah victim but he 
believed the colorado victim was denise oliverson 24 last seen 
riding her bicycle in april 1975 near her home in grand junction 
sgt greg kuhn of the grand junction colo police department 
said today officials will listen to the bundy tape and talk to the 
investigator who interviewed bundy police probably will decide 
monday whether to search for oliversons body he said 
in utah today about 20 searchers with metal detectors focused on 
an area 10 miles southeast of price in central utah in a search 
for one bundy victim said carbon county chief deputy jerry cowan 
the searchers had metal detectors to pick up any jewelry that 
might have been worn by the victim but cowan said there is heavy 
snow cover and the prospects for success were uncertain 
the snow covers the sagebrush resembling mounds but were at 
least going to make an effort he said 
meanwhile officials in washington state expressed anguish over 
another legacy left by the serial killer a request that his ashes 
be scattered over the washington cascades 
personally im kind of offended by the whole thing said 
dale potter a spokesman for the mount bakersnoqualmie national 
forest i expect the hiking community and many other people who 
use the national forest land would be somewhat offended by the 
thought of it 
however potter said there are no regulations to prohibit bundys 
ashes from being scattered over the mountains where the bodies of 
some of his victims were found 
in bundys fiveminute interview with barton conducted at 615 
am tuesday he used a map to point out the sites where he had left 
the two victims in utah and colorado bundy was executed shortly 
after 7 am 
his memory of the utah victim was especially vivid as he 
pinpointed a dirt road between price and green river 
about 200 yards in on the dirt road and to the left maybe 
50 yards theres the remains of a young woman who disappeared from 
brigham young university in june of 1975 bundy said 
bundy had been suspected in the death of susan curtis 15 who 
was attending a youth conference at brigham young university when 
she disappeared in june 1975 according to the salt lake tribune 
bundy 42 said the colorado victim was dropped in a river 
i believe the date was in april 1975 bundy said the young 
womans body would have been placed in the colorado river five miles 
west of grand junction it was not buried 
thats all the ones that i can help you with bundy said 
the ones that i know about no missing ones outstanding that we 
havent talked about 
in response to further questions bundy specifically denied 
killing anyone in illinois new jersey vermont or texas 
okay thats all weve got barton said okay ted thank 
you

bundy was executed for the february 1978 rapemurder of 
12yearold kimberly leach of lake city fla in the days prior to 
his execution bundy confessed to 23 murders investigators believe 
he may be linked to as many as 100 deaths beginning in 1969 
a washington state investigator who interviewed bundy before the 
execution said thursday that he ran out of time before he could ask 
the killer about two oregon women who disappeared in 1973 
robert keppel chief criminal investigator for the washington 
attorney generals office said he was unable to inquire about the 
disappearances of rita lorraine jolly and vicki lynn hollar

the operator of the energy departments 
crippled nuclear weapons plant in south carolina has advocated 
lowering a safety standard that is complicating efforts to reopen 
the plant the chairman of a safety advisory panel said today 
john ahearne chairman of the departments advisory committee on 
nuclear facility safety said ei du pont de nemours amp co has been 
seeking for about three years to establish a scientific 
justification for lowering the minimum standard for judging the 
safety of nuclear reactors 
he said the du pont effort was not directly related to efforts to 
reopen the savannah river plants nuclear reactors which have been 
closed since last year for safety and technical reasons 
the lower standard if adopted would nonetheless make it easier 
to restart the reactors he said 
ahearne said du pont has been trying to make the case that 
the current definition of the worst possible accident at a reactor 
the complete break of a major cooling water pipe was unnecessarily 
strict du ponts research has focused on basing safety judgments on 
the lesser danger posed by a leak in the pipe which would give 
enough warning time to shut the reactor and avert a pipe break 
no du pont officials at savannah river were immediately available 
to comment on ahearnes remarks 
as recently as last december the committee reviewed du ponts 
scientific work and concluded it was a long way from justifying 
the lower safety standard ahearne said 
ahearne in a telephone interview denied a published report that 
he told a senate committee on thursday that the energy department 
was considering reducing the safety standard so it could speed the 
reopening of the k reactor at the savannah river plant which 
has been closed for safety since last april 
he said department safety officials were very very skeptical 
of the proposal which also has been under study for years in the 
civilian nuclear industry he said he told the panel that du pont 
favored the idea not the energy department 
gary pitchford an energy department spokesman at savannah river 
said today there was no consideration being given to changing 
the reactor safety standard in connection with efforts to restart 
the k reactor there 
savannah river is the nations only producer of tritium a 
perishable gas vital to making nuclear warheads the energy 
department has said it hopes to have the tritiumproducing reactor 
back in operation by the end of this year but recurring safety and 
managerial problems have put that target in doubt

has decided to turn down an invitation to visit afghanistan and 
observe the final phase of the soviet troop withdrawal un 
officials said today 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said there was 
no point in the un chief visiting at this time before what is

government to usbacked afghan rebels 
but they said perez de cueller has not informed afghanistan he 
will not be coming and that the invitation is still officially under 
consideration

an indian woman says hospital workers violated 
her right to religious freedom when they forced her to stop a 
purification ritual in her hospital rooment bush is 
committed to full funding of the mckinney act which congress passed 
last year to provide emergency shelter 
but he said funding while necessary is not sufficient we 
need to work together to provide a complete and effective safety 
net with both public and private efforts 
it is a national tragedy of appalling proportions that there 
are americans without basic shelter and human services kemp said 
he also pledged to work toward making home ownership possible for 
people in public housing to press for urban enterprise zones to 
encourage inner city development and to seek a national housing 
policy that will make housing more affordable for poor and young 
families 
kemps hearing was interrupted by a demonstration of six members 
of the community for creative nonviolence an advocate for the 
homeless 
they shouted accusations that the nominee was partly responsible 
for the reduction in affordable housing available to lowincome 
americans 
the four women and two men were taken from the hearing room by 
capitol police and security personnel 
kemp has shored up support among his former colleagues on capitol 
hill personally meeting or speaking by telephone with each member 
of the panel since bush nominated him most have said they 
unequivocally support his confirmation and a few declined to make 
their decision public before the hearing but none said they oppose 
him 
i think it was one of the best appointments the new president 
made said sen phil gramm rtexas a conservative ally im 
sure hes going to be confirmed 
gramm said he hoped to question kemp about the possibility of 
expanding nationwide a pilot program begun two weeks ago in dallas 
that makes vacant hud houses available to families with incomes as 
low as 15000 a year 
sen jim sasser budget committee chairman and member of the 
subcommittee on housing who supports kemps confirmation wants to 
know what direction kemp plans to take on several rental subsidy 
programs due to expire soon 
in notes prepared for todays session the tennessee democrat 
said that by not addressing this situation head on it seems that 
we are making a policy choice to increase the number of homeless 
he also intended to query the nominee about proposals to impose 
user fees on federal home loans sasser said such fees would 
increase interest rates on home mortgages drive more people from 
the housing market contribute to stress on the rental market and 
further increase homelessness he also said the idea is contrary 
to an explicit provision that the committee put in the 1987 housing 
and community development act 
others said they wanted to know his thoughts about rural housing 
problems and energy efficiency in public housing

lyndon h larouche jr political 
extremist and perennial presidential candidate was sentenced today 
to 15 years in prison for scheming to defraud federal tax collectors 
and deliberately failing to repay more than 30 million in loans 
from his political supporters 
us district judge albert v bryan jr also sentenced chief 
larouche fundraiser william wertz to five years in prison and an 
11000 fine and gave larouche legal coordinator edward spannaus a 
fiveyear term and a 10000 fine 
at the same time governmnent prosecutors in boston dropped 
related charges against larouche and three of his associates 
charges against three other defendants who are fugitives were 
maintained that case ended in a mistrial last may and had been 
scheduled for retrial on feb 22 
in a document filed in us district court in boston today the 
prosecutors said that with the conviction of larouche and his 
associates in alexandria last month the law enforcement interests 
of the united states had been served from the point of view of 
both deterrence and punishment 
in the federal courthouse in alexandria fundraisers michael 
billington and dennis small received threeyear prison terms and 
fines of 8000 each fundraisers paul greenberg and joyce 
rubenstein were given threeyear terms and 6000 in fines each 
larouche attorney odin anderson of boston said all seven 
defendants would appeal he called larouche a prominent political 
figure and said his many powerful enemies have had their day 
us attorney henry hudson called the sentences a very 
satisfying culmination to a very long journey but added 
this will never repay all those victims who have been swindled 
out of millions of dollars over the years i feel sorry for those 
people 
bryan told larouche who stood facing the judge with arms folded 
in front of him that he had been convicted of a serious crime 
and said he rejected larouches belief that the end justifies the 
means as resorted to in this case 
bryan refused to grant bail to the three main defendants pending 
appeals 
the judge also rejected as errant nonsense the defendants 
claims that their prosecution by the government was politically 
motivated he said the idea that larouches organization was of 
sufficient threat to warrant such a prosecution just defies human 
experience 
larouches sentence was considerably less than the maximum 
penalty on 13 counts of tax and mail fraud conspiracy the maximum 
would be 65 years in prison and fines totaling 325 million 
before he was sentenced larouche told the judge that his case 
already has done great damage to the united states and that it 
is time for this evil and reckless prosecution to be brought to a 
halt before further damage is done 
us attorney kent robinson responded that this is not a 
political case this was a case of theft 
bryan said he was concerned that the defendants never conceded 
they had done anything wrong despite their convictions 
but spannaus said 
remorse should be felt by those who perverted our judicial 
system for political purposes and trampled on the constitution 
outside the federal courthouse in this washington suburb about 
60 larouche supporters sang waved american flags and paraded with 
bedsheet banners reading pardon larouche kill satan and stop 
kgb frame upmurder of larouche a demonstrator wearing a large 
mask of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and carrying a soviet 
flag gestured on the sidelines as the pickets paraded on both sides 
of the street in front of the courthouse 
a federal trial jury in alexandria convicted larouche and the six 
associates on dec 16 of mail fraud and conspiracy for raising more 
then 30 million in loans from political supporters without any 
intention of repaying them one elderly woman testified she had lost 
nearly 113000 in life savings 
larouche also was convicted of scheming to defraud the internal 
revenue service by having all his personal expenses paid by various 
corporations he controls and claiming he had no taxable income 
larouche has not filed federal income tax returns for any year 
since 1978 government prosecutors said 
it was the first time in larouches controversial political 
career that he has been convicted of criminal charges larouche 66 
has run for president in the last three elections as a democrat or 
an independent candidate espousing unorthodox conspiracy theories on 
world issues 
immediately after his conviction in alexandria larouche told 
reporters he was the innocent victim of a frameup by soviet 
sympathizers in the state and justice departments he predicted he 
would be killed if sent to prison 
bryan released larouche and the six other defendants on their 
personal recognizance since his conviction aides said larouche 
has visited west germany home of his wife helga and attended a 
human rights tribunal in rome 
larouche spokeswoman dana scanlon said the political mavericks 
supporters planned to hold a roundtheclock vigil in lafayette 
park across pennsylvania avenue from the white house until 
larouche is released from federal prison she said demonstrations 
also were planned outside the federal courthouse in this washington 
suburb 
elsewhere jury selection was under way in loudoun county circuit 
court in leesburg va where larouche headquarters are based in a 
virginia state trial of larouche fundraiser rochelle ascher on 12 
counts of securities fraud 
ms ascher is the first of 16 larouche associates and five 
organizations facing separate trials on state securities fraud

federal prosecutors dropped conspiracy and fraud 
charges against lyndon h larouche jr today as the political 
extremist was sentenced in virginia in connection with 30 million 
in defaulted loans 
all charges were dropped against larouche and three associates 
but the justice department said it will not drop charges against 
defendants in the case who are fugitives 
larouche was sentenced in the virginia case to 15 years in prison 
for scheming to defraud federal tax collectors and deliberately 
failing to repay more than 30 million in loans from his political 
supporters 
the us attorneys office had vowed to pursue the boston case 
regardless of the verdict in us district court in alexandria va 
but the stiff sentence he faced convinced officials that justice has 
been served 
in short the interests of the united states and effective law 
enforcement having thus been served from the point of view of both 
deterrence and punishment it is the governments view that further 
prosecution is not warranted given the resources such prosecution 
would demand and the relatively slight benefits likely to flow 
there from according to a document filed today 
larouche who has run for president four times is known for his 
extreme views including support of an aids quarantine and often 
vitriolic antisoviet rhetoric 
the complex boston case which ended in a mistrial last may 
included allegations of government infiltration of larouche groups 
purportedly involving the fbi cia oliver north and other 
government operatives a retrial was scheduled to begin feb 22 
larouche six aides and five political organizations were charged 
with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into 
allegations that larouches 1984 presidential campaign raised more 
than 2 million through credit card and loan fraud 
larouche was charged with one count of conspiracy for allegedly 
ordering supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with 
investigators all the aides and organizations also were charged 
with conspiracy and four of the groups were charged with fraud 
three more defendants are fugitives

jurors deliberating the child murder case against 
disbarred lawyer joel steinberg have asked for fresh clothing 
hinting that a verdict might not come quickly 
the request came after the jury which began its fifth day of 
deliberations today asked thursday to rehear testimony on the 
physical condition of steinbergs abused companion hedda nussbaum 
defense lawyers accuse her of the november 1987 killing of 
6yearold lisa steinberg 
the manhattan state supreme court jury asked if it could use the 
doctors testimony and a videotape of ms nussbaum to assess her 
condition and capabilities at the time of the childs death justice 
harold rothwax said it could 
they retired thursday at 8 pm without reaching a verdict and 
resumed deliberations at 1020 am today 
but before quitting for the day the sequestered jurors who 
began deliberating monday asked for fresh clothing to be sent to 
them from their homes an indication they were perhaps still a long 
way from a verdict 
steinberg 47 is charged in the fatal beating of lisa whom he 
illegally obtained at birth from an unwed long island teenager the 
child was removed comatose from steinberg and ms nussbaums 
apartment nov 2 1987 and died of a brain injury three days later 
ms nussbaum 46 testified against him in exchange for limited 
immunity from prosecution steinbergs lawyers charge it was ms 
nussbaum who fatally beat the girl prosecutors at first charged 
her along with steinberg but later said she was too physically and 
emotionally disabled to have harmed the child 
the jury thursday asked to rehear testimony of dr neil spiegel 
an emergency room doctor at bellevue hospital who examined ms 
nussbaum after her arrest on nov 3 1987 and found her 
chronically debilitated malnourished wasted and described 
numerous bruises cuts and broken bones 
the judge has told the jury it may not use ms nussbaums 
condition to conclude that because steinberg allegedly beat her he 
therefore beat lisa 
rothwax has told the jury that it must unanimously acquit 
steinberg of murder before considering lesser charges of 
firstdegree manslaughter seconddegree manslaughter and criminally 
negligent homicide

president bush said today he found nothing 
unseemly about former president reagan signing a multimillion 
contract to write his memoirs 
bush was asked at a news conference whether in light of the 
stress the new president has put this week on ethics in government 
he felt reagan was cashing in on his presidency 
reagan reportedly will receive 5 million for his memoirs and a 
book of speeches from simon amp schuster in addition a partner in 
the washington speakers bureau has a handshake agreement to 
represent reagan and his wife nancy as their exclusive lecture 
agents 
one industry source speaking on condition he not be identified 
said it would be reasonable to assume the former president could 
command 40000 for a speech 
asked about the book deal bush said i dont call it cashing 
in i suspect every president has written his memoirs and gotten 
money for it i dont think its ever been challenged 
bush did not address the question of lecture fees for reagan 
bernie swain a partner in the speakers bureau said he was in 
the process of signing reagan up 
i have a handshake agreement that is all i am working on right 
now he said 
swain said the terms of the agreement with the reagans had not 
been settled 
he said most of the former presidents speaking engagements would 
be in the west at least for the present the reagans now live in 
los angeles 
don walker president of the harr walker agency in new york said 
his firm represent several speakers who get fees in the 40000 
range but generally that amount is paid for speeches which require 
travel 
the walker agencys clients include former secretary of defense 
caspar weinberger former president ford and former secretary of 
state henry kissinger among others 
swain said his firm had received requests in the past to arrange 
speeches by reagan while he was in office but had referred all such 
requests to the white house 
he said maureen reagan the presidents daughter and former 
white house chief of staff kenneth duberstein had also been added to 
the bureaus roster of speakers this week

president bush today endorsed a proposed 50 
percent salary increase for members of congress and similar raises 
for other high government officials 
the raise is overdue theres no question about that bush 
said at his first presidential news conference he noted that 
congress is considering abolishing the right of members to earn 
thousands of dollars in speech honoraria in exchange for the 45500 
raise from 89500 to 135000 a year 
asked whether the pay raise was appropriate even though the 
hourly minimum wage has been frozen at 335 since 1981 bush said 
he has never felt that raising the minimum wage is the key to 
prosperity for poor people 
he said however he wants to maintain a certain flexibility on 
that question 
meanwhile capitol hill sources said house negotiators have 
reached a tentative agreement that would require members to give up 
much more than their speaking fees in return for the 50 percent pay 
raise 
senate leaders were not far behind in negotiating a contingency 
plan to restrict outside income should the raise become law as 
expected on feb 8 a senate source said thursday 
both houses are expected to move hastily to restrict nonsalary 
income once the raise kicks in to minimize the political damage and 
avoid the embarrassment of members earning considerable outside 
income in addition to their new salary of 135000 
developments on the negotiations reported by sources who 
insisted on anonymity came thursday as house opponents of the raise 
admitted they have virtually no chance to prevent the dramatic rise 
in salary from the current 89500 rep thomas j tauke riowa a 
leading opponent said hes now focusing on longrange strategy to 
roll back the increase 
under a special procedure not followed for other legislation the 
pay raise for congress judges and top executive branch employees 
becomes law unless both houses vote to reject it 
the senate is expected to reject the raise in a vote promised by 
its leaders but house majority whip tony coelho dcalif has said 
house leaders are not planning to vote on the pay hike 
the tentative house package which still needs further 
negotiation would include 
an end to the honoraria system which has allowed rankandfile 
house members to keep up to 26850 of the money they earn each year 
from speeches articles and other appearances 
abolition of the grandfather loophole in campaign financing 
law the loophole has allowed 190 house members who were in office 
as of jan 8 1980 to stockpile more than 39 million in surplus 
campaign money for their personal use the provision does not apply 
to senators 
restrictions probably time limitations on travel for speaking 
engagements and other appearances this would prevent members from 
getting long vacations at resorts from special interests who 
invited them to speak for free 
restrictions on nonhonoraria outside income 
a senate leadership aide said once the raise becomes law the 
senate will move promptly to ban honoraria but the aide said 
details of the proposal must still be negotiated 
the house package is designed to make financial restrictions 
broad enough so that lawmakers will be able to stand the heat from 
angry constituents thousands of americans have listened to radio 
talk show hosts and sent their representatives tea bags symbolic of 
the boston tea party to protest the raise 
a house leadership source said the package in that chamber is 
designed to bar honoraria in a comprehensive and tough way to get 
at all the issues which revolve around payment of money to members 
by special interest groups 
the purpose is not to write a narrowgauge vehicle that deals 
simply with fees for speeches the source said 
the house negotiators on the issue have been coelho rep vic 
fazio dcalif chairman of the house appropriations legislative 
subcommittee house gop whip dick cheney rwyo and rep jerry 
lewis rcalif chairman of the house republican conference 
tauke said he would try to organize a meeting of opponents next 
week to work out longrange strategy to roll back the raise after it 
takes effect 
we recognize the pay raise is not going to be stopped so we 
have to look at alternative strategies he said 
any longrange strategy would focus on finding a legislative 
mechanism to bring the pay raise issue to the house floor 
tauke said the senate could provide such a vehicle by passing 
legislation introduced last wednesday the bill anticipating the 
raise would become law would rescind the increase entirely for the 
executive and legislative branches it would require recorded votes 
for any future pay raises 
tauke said opponents of a raise could try to attach that bill 
onto any house measure thereby forcing a vote on members pay 
if the legislation is bottled up in committee by the democratic 
leadership tauke said opponents could try for a discharge 
petition which takes 218 signatures to force legislation from 
committee 
tauke has introduced his own legislation which would require a 
recorded vote on pay raises make congressional pay recommendations 
separate from those of the other branches and prevent any 
congressional raise from taking effect until after the next election

president bush said today that a lot of 
uncertainty exists about the civil warfare in afghanistan in the 
wake of the soviet troop withdrawal and that the us embassy there 
was closed to protect american lives 
bush in a wideranging news conference in the white house 
briefing room was asked about secretary of state james a baker 
iiis decision to evacuate the fewer than 10 diplomats and security 
guards left in the us afghan outpost all travel by american 
civilians to the wartorn country had already been banned 
the aim of the us diplomatic pullout is to make sure no 
americans are exposed to the strife that is expected to intensify 
when the last soviet troops depart all 50000 are supposed to leave 
the country by feb 15 
bush said he did not discuss the turmoil in afghanistan in a 
conversation with soviet president mikhail gorbachev last week but 
that he was convinced the soviets would continue their withdrawal 
bush went on to say that he believed there is uncertainty about 
what follows and that he hoped the united states would play a 
catalytic role for helping bring about stability in the future 
i think theres a lot of uncertainty theres enough 
uncertainty that the secretary of state was taking prudent action in 
this regard bush said it is a prudent policy to protect a 
handful of american lives 
afghan guerrillas armed by the united states and pakistan are 
fighting to wrest control of the country from government forces 
backed by the soviets the drive by the mujahedeen rebels for kabul 
and a deteriorating situation in that capital threatened to expose 
the americans to the crossfire 
the us diplomatic contingent was gradually reduced over the 
years and the country has been without a fulltime american 
ambassador since adolph dubs was killed by afghan forces a decade 
ago 
the red armys departure under the geneva accords signed last 
april will remove a stabilizing influence on the kabul government 
the guerrillas meanwhile are likely to redouble their offensive 
against government forces no longer backed by soviet troops 
apart from the small contingent of about 10 diplomats and guards 
there are fewer than 20 us citizens in afghanistan they have been 
encouraged to leave and the state department has urged americans 
not to travel to the country 
on wednesday the mayor of kabul said the capital had a 
threemonth supply of food and fuel in case of a guerrilla siege 
soviet soldiers handed out emergency rations soviet cargo planes 
began flying loads of flour and fuel to kabul on saturday 
the reagan administration in its final days pondered whether to 
abandon the embassy or to leave the decision to its successors a 
us official speaking on condition of anonymity said it finally 
was left up to baker and he decided to close the embassy on his 
first day of the job 
earlier charles e redman the state department spokesman 
quoted reports from kabul that soviet and afghan artillery attacks 
had obliterated a number of villages south of the salang tunnel 
through which soviet troops are departing the country 
there are eyewitnesses who say no dwellings remain and hundreds 
of civilians were killed redman said he said no us embassy 
personnel were in the devastated area

president bushs trip to china next month 
underscores the importance of american relations with the worlds 
largest country and although the two have no overriding problems 
bush has some serious issues to discuss with the chinese 
one is the joint effort the united states and china are making to 
promote reconciliation between south korea and north korea another 
is the growing improvement in relations between china and the soviet 
union 
bushs trip will be the first visit to beijing by a us chief 
executive in nearly five years president reagan visited the chinese 
capital in april 1984 
but while bush looks to the far east stopping lso in japan for 
emperor hirohitos funeral and in south korea two other regions 
where problems are far more pressing have been consigned at least 
for now to the back burner 
bush and his top foreign policy advisers secretary of state 
james a baker iii and brent scowcroft the national security 
adviser are taking their time about the soviet union and the middle 
east 
lets take our time now bush told reporters today lets 
take a look at where we stand 
he said he did not think after a long talk on the telephone with 
soviet preisdent mikhail s gorbachev that the soviets consider his 
reflective stance footdragging 
baker who is inexperienced in both areas told the senate 
foreign relations committee during his confirmation hearing that he 
wanted to review the bidding in ussoviet negotiations to 
reduce longrange nuclear weapons 
baker also said the united states should avoid a headlong 
rush to provide moscow with loans and credits which are 
traditionally a useful tool in improving relations 
scowcroft has more experience in foreign policy matters but he 
too is taking a very cautious approach in dealing with moscow he 
worries that gorbachevs peace offensive may have as one of its main 
goals making trouble within the alliance of western nations he 
is suspicious that gorbachevs motivation is to buy time to reform 
the soviet economy which is a lot different from approaching 
gorbachev primarily as a world leader trying to ease eastwest 
tensions 
i think the cold war is not over scowcroft said in a recent 
assessment of the superpower relationship 
while bush has not insisted on concessions from moscow before 
ascending the summit with gorbachev the white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said thursday they would meet only when the time 
is right 
its a bit early to make sweeping judgments but the indications 
are a slowdown in the reconciliation promoted by president reagan 
and secretary of state george p shultz after gorbachevs rise to 
power in the kremlin in march 1985 
there is a similar goslow attitude developing toward the 
arabisraeli conflict in the middle east which drew serious 
attention from the reagan administration toward the end but hardly 
the concentration trained on moscow 
reagan and shultz in their final days broke a 13year embargo 
and opened us talks with the palestine liberation organization 
shultz made five trips to the middle east in 1988 and while neither 
the arabs nor israelis agreed to negotiations shultz left office 
optimistic about the future 
there is more diplomatic fluidity now and opportunity there 
than theres been in some time he told reporters on his final 
trip to vienna last week 
baker on the other hand emphasized that we ought to all be 
realistic about the prospects for achieving a breakthrough he 
also told the senate committee there is no more intractable 
problem facing us 
baker was cool about the dialogue with the plo suggesting it 
would be continued only if it proved useful and he ruled out a 
palestinian state which the reagan administration also opposed 
that appears to eliminate an option that has ardent arab support and 
could make it more difficult to entice arab nations into any us 
scenario for the middle east

president bush convening his first news 
conference far from prime time said today he intends no 
footdragging in ussoviet affairs and that his trip to china 
next month is not designed to unsettle relations with the kremlin 
bush also gave his endorsement to a proposed 45000 pay raise 
for members of congress and sidestepped questions about a proposal 
to place a fee on savings accounts to help rescue the troubled 
savings and loan industry 
the freewheeling question and answer session lasting more than 
40 minutes marked the end of bushs first week in the oval office 
theres still a wonder of it all the new president said 
were ready to roll he added 
bush said he had assured soviet leader mikhail gorbachev that his 
intention to move slowly isnt a negative signal i dont think 
the soviets see that as footdragging im confident they dont he 
said 
i want to take the offense in moving this relationship 
forward he said 
asked about american citizens being held hostage in the middle 
east he said unless the information i have is wrong iran 
itself the government is not actually holding these people and if 
they were i would reiterate my view that the way to improve 
relations is to let em go give these people their freedom they 
didnt do anything wrong 
bush seemed relaxed if a little hoarse from a cold calling on 
one reporter with the wordsyoure up he paused at one point to 
ask his questioners whether they wanted followup questions a 
tradition from president reagans news conferences bushs first 
formal meeting with reporters came at 11 am far from the 
nighttime gatherings favored by reagan 
bush fielded questions after telling reporters gathered in the 
white house briefing room its been a full week since the 
inauguration and i just wanted to stop by and give you an update 
he cited his firstweek emphasis on ethics in government and 
said he hoped to assemble a government that the people of this 
nation can be proud of 
he also said he believed he had begun a fresh constructive 
dialogue with congress on both sides of the aisle 
but he also said he expects a tougher time ahead when he begins 
grappling with more contentious issues such as the budget he 
stepped away from the most controversial item of his first week in 
office a suggestion to place a premium on savings accounts to help 
rescue the savings and loan industry he said the proposal hadnt 
yet reached his desk 
it doesnt bother me for a lot of ideas to be debated and 
considered the president said 
anything i do on savings and loansi dont expect its all 
going to be sweetness and harmony and light he added 
at the same time bush sought to reassure depositors saying the 
sampls are sound they are good dollargoodnothing is going to 
change in that regard 
asked about superpower relationships the new president said he 
didnt know where his first major foreign policy initiative would 
be whether in the middle east or central america or elsewhere i 
dont want to play defense i dont want to look like were 
footdragging and letting others set the agenda he said 
as for the pay raise which would give a 50 percent salary 
increase to members of congress federal judges and toplevel 
government officials bush said the raise is overdue theres no 
question about that bush noted that congress is considering 
abolishing speaking honoraria in exchange for the controversial 
raise and said he favors that too 
when asked whether the pay raise was inappropriate since the 
minimum wage had been frozen at 335 per hour since 1981 bush said 
hes never felt that raising the minimum wage is the key to 
prosperity for poor people 
but he said he wants to maintain a certain flexibility on that 
question and will discuss proposals for an increase with labor 
secretary elizabeth dole bush said he would want any miminum wage 
increase to be tied to a training wage 
on one key campaign pledge bush said he would push for his 
proposed cut in capital gains taxes 
the president also said he would briefly visit south korea at the 
tail end of an asian trip that includes a stop to japan to attend 
the funeral of emperor hirohito and a subsequent visit to china 
bush spent more than a year as the us envoy to peking in the 
1970s and said he and his wife barbara were looking forward to 
their return 
he said his visit was not designed to go one up on mr 
gorbachev in terms of superpower relationships asked if he was 
trying to send a signal by visiting china before meeting with the 
soviet leader bush said he was not one to play one superpower off 
against another 
im the one wo doesnt believe in playing the soviet card or 
playing the china card he said 
bush said his watchword on ussoviet relations would be lets 
take our time now 
prudence is the order of the day he said but then he added 
i want to take the offense in moving this relationship 
forward 
the new president quickly added he didnt know where his first 
major foreign policy initiative would be whether in the middle east 
or central america or elsewhere i dont want to play defense i 
dont want to look like were footdragging and letting others set 
the agenda he said

the senate finance committee voted 180 today 
to recommend confirmation of attorney carla hills as us trade 
representative a job she said she would use to open global markets 
with a crowbar if necessary 
you have done well and you have answered with more specifics 
than i have normally heard from a person being confirmed 
committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas told mrs hills as the 
panel prepared to vote they usually fudge their answers more 
mrs hills also vowed that she and her attorney husband would 
each take measures to make certain that she would never be faced 
with a conflict of interest in her new role as the nations top 
trade negotiator she said she would divest herself of any business 
ties that could raise such a problem 
mrs hills stressed that she would not hesitate to act when 
necessary and appropriate to fight unfair trade practices of foreign 
governments 
retaliation cannot be the goal of our policy she said in 
fact it signals the failure of our efforts to open foreign markets 
but the credible threat of retaliation provides essential leverage 
in our marketopening efforts thus actual retaliation will be 
used albeit reluctantly to preserve the credibility of of this 
threat 
at another point mrs hills said she would prefer to settle 
trade dispute with a handshake and a deal but she said that when 
negotiations fail to do the job she will not hesitate to retaliate 
and open markets with a crowbar if necessary 
mrs hills a californian served in the ford administration as 
secretary of housing and urban development she has been practicing 
law in washington since then when she was named to the trade 
representatives post bentsen issued a statement saying he had 
hoped for someone with more experience in problems of global markets 
before the committee however mrs hills impressed senators with 
her detailed knowledge of complex issues ranging from plywood trade 
between the united states and canada to american complaints about 
european government subsidies for the jetliner manufacturer airbus 
industrie 
i think you are going to be a terrific trade representative 
sen jay rockefeller dwva told her 
she also made a point of living up to her advance billing by 
supporters as a tough negotiator 
make no mistake declared sen pete wilson rcalif this 
is a gentle lady but this lady has the guts of a lion 
we have to have our agreements enforced mrs hills 
testified and where our partners are violating our agreements we 
must take action 
were i to say one thing to the japanese today it is we must 
have results she said at another point

in the first news conference of his presidency 
george bush today engaged in an upbeat at times jocular 
giveandtake with reporters interjecting his own ideas on the 
format 
although press secretary marlin fitzwater announced the surprise 
news conference would run for 15 or 20 minutes the president stood 
before the white house press corps for about 45 minutes apparently 
comfortable fielding questions on a wide variety of topics 
bushs appearance was not scheduled and produced scrambling by 
camera crews reporters and photographers when it was announced on 
15 minutes notice 
at one point he interupted the questioning to ask about the 
customary practice of allowing for followup questions by each 
reporter after the president answers the initial question 
in an exchange that produced much laughter bush stopped after a 
question on the minimum wage and said wait let me ask you to 
stop the proceedings 
he turned to fitzwater and said nodding to the assembled 
reporters dont take it out of their time 
what would be the fair and noble way to handle followup 
questions as we do these things would it be good to have them or 
not have them he asked 
some reporters replied that followups are needed when the 
president doesnt fully answer a question 
you mean my first answer is less than precise bush said to 
chuckles 
he then noted with a gesture toward the reporters lined up along 
the side of the room that with the seated journalists who tend to 
be called on first getting two questions the standees have 
gotten no time at all

the judge in the irancontra case said today he 
has the authority to compel president bush and former president 
reagan to testify at the trial of fired national security council 
aide oliver north 
us district judge gerhard gesell made the comment at a hearing 
where the government argued that norths subpoenas served last month 
for the testimony of bush and reagan should be quashed 
gesell said that if it becomes necessary to have the testimony of 
either man at norths trial it would be sought only as a last 
resort 
as far as the power of the court to require testimony of 
reagan or bush i do not think there is any question said 
gesell he added that he thought the courts authority in such 
situations is indisputable the court has the power 
gesell said such authority must be exercised with great 
deference to the office of the president and should not be used 
except as a last resort if there is no other way to resolve the 
issue 
gesell didnt rule on the governments motion to quash the 
subpoenas 
washington attorney larry simms who sat in the spectator section 
of the courtroom acknowledged to reporters after the hearing that 
he is representing reagan 
simms said former justice department official theodore olson is 
the lead attorney representing the former president 
meanwhile gesell said he had denied the request of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh for a subpoena to get spiral notebooks in 
which north recorded his daily activities when he was at the nsc 
north invoked his fifth amendment privilege against 
selfincrimination in trying to avoid turning over the notebooks 
gesell did not explain his denial 
walsh and gesell are proceeding as though north will go on trial 
next tuesday although those plans could be thrown off by an 
interagency intelligence group in the bush administration 
the group whose work led to the jan 13 dismissal of conspiracy 
and theft charges against north has been reviewing classified 
documents that norths lawyers and prosecutors plan to present at 
trial in connection with the 12 criminal charges that remain against 
him 
two administration officials said today however that secrecy 
problems would not block the trial 
the interagency task force had identified some documents that 
might pose problems if gesell allowed their disclosure in open court 
by the defense a lot would depend however on gesells rulings 
from the bench during the trial on the relevancy and admissability 
of the documents said the officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
government secrecy specialists who are familiar with the 
documents did not expect the sensitive material to be admitted into 
evidence because it didnt appear relevant to the case the 
officials said 
they said administration officials planned to closely monitor the 
trial in the event there was an attempt by norths lawyers to 
introduce into evidence documents that would compromise national 
security 
gesell ruled in a dec 12 order that to ensure a fair trial for 
north there must be extensive disclosure by the prosecution from 
the 300 classified documents it planned to use at trial including 
the verbatim text of many intelligence reports that order and the 
intelligence groups refusal to declassify many of the documents led 
to walshs decision to seek dropping the conspiracy and theft counts 
against north 
gesell issued a sealed order on jan 19 detailing how much must 
be disclosed from the 300 classified documents north plans to use at 
trial 
north is accused of concealing from congress and former attorney 
general edwin meese iii his efforts on behalf of the nicaraguan 
contras and of covering up the nscs role in diverting money from 
the iran arms sales to the contras 
north also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue 
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the contras

prosecutors investigating alleged 
wrongdoing under former president chun doohwan charged the nations 
former intelligence chief with corruption friday and put him in 
prison 
chang sedong who was director of the agency for national 
security planning was charged after two days of questioning 
his arrest capped months of a government investigation into 
alleged corruption and abuse of power under chuns sevenyear 
authoritarian rule which ended in february 
chang 53 is the highestranking chun official to be arrested 
a legislator from the governing democratic justice party and two 
people who were cabinet ministers under chun were arrested on 
corruption charges early this month 
last year about a dozen members of chuns family including two 
brothers were convicted or charged with taking bribes and 
embezzling millions of dollars 
chang a former army general was one of the most powerful men in 
the nation under chun he played a major role in enforcing chuns 
tough rule and suppressing opposition 
prosecutors said chang denied wrongdong insisting that he just 
followed presidential orders chang was head of chuns presidential 
security before serving as intelligence chief from 1985 to 1987 
prosecutorgeneral kim gichun indicated changs arrest marked an 
end to the investigation 
in the probe we did our best there were no preset limitations 
to our investigation all people found involved were sent to 
prison he told reporters 
the charges against chang are vague and relatively mild they 
include illegal construction of a guest house which critics say was 
to be used as chuns officemansion after retirement and illegal 
use of government office space 
south korean press reports said prosecutors had difficulty

presidential elections in december 1987 and took office in february 
in november chun apologized to the nation for abuses under his

striking iberia airlines jet mechanics blame 
leftist unions as much as managers for the dispute that has caused 
the company to trim about 100 flights a day a mechanics union 
official said friday 
the mechanics union mounted its ninth 24hour strike since dec 
23 on friday 
union official ramses rodriguez said the mechanics are trying to 
pressure iberia to train them to meet international specifications 
they fear they could lose their jobs in 1993 when the european 
economic community is to take steps to unify the labor pool and 
establish common job norms 
rodriguez said however that communist and socialistled unions 
representing most of the companys 21000 ground employees failed to 
include the point in collective bargaining he said the mechanics 
want separate talks to include their retraining in a larger pact 
with the company 
iberia has estimated strike losses at 306 million

jack kemp housing secretarydesignate told a 
senate committee today it will take more than government aid to 
solve problems of the homeless and another panel approved the 
nomination of carla hills as trade representative 
funding while necessary is not sufficient the former new 
york republican congressman told the senate housing and urban 
affairs committee which was holding his confirmation hearing we 
need to work together to provide a complete and effective safety 
net with both public and private efforts 
in written statements kemp pledged to work toward making home 
ownership possible for people in public housing to press for urban 
enterprise zones to encourage inner city development and to seek a 
national housing policy that will make housing more affordable for 
poor and young families 
his hearing was interrupted by six members of the community for 
creative nonviolence an advocate for the homeless who shouted 
accusations that the nominee was partly responsible for the 
reduction in affordable housing available for lowincome americans 
also facing questioning today was mrs hills who quickly won 
approval for the post of us trade representative from the senate 
finance committee on an 180 vote you have done well and you have 
answered with more specifics than i have normally heard from a 
person being confirmed committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
told mrs hills 
former sen john tower rtexas bushs choice for defense 
secretary told the senate armed services committee on thursday that 
it is unrealistic to believe that the star wars missile defense 
system could protect all of america from nuclear attack 
bushs selection to be his chief economic adviser michael 
boskin told the senate banking committee that savings can be found 
in military and health care programs as the administration tries to 
hold next years federal deficit to 100 billion 
and former rep manuel lujan jr rnm testified to the senate 
energy and natural resources committee that if confirmed as bushs 
interior secretary he will try to leave the countrys natural 
resources in a better condition than we found them 
towers comments on star wars represented a break from reagan 
administration descriptions of the program as capable of providing 
an extensive shield against nuclear attack 
i dont believe that we can devise an umbrella that can 
protect the entire american population from nuclear incineration i 
think thats unrealistic tower said 
tower who from 1981 to 1984 chaired the armed services panel 
also told the committee that he would bend over backwards to 
avoid favoring his former military contractor associates from whom 
he earned 763777 over the last three years 
he said he ended his relationship with the weapons industry on 
dec 1 a day after learning he was under serious consideration for 
the pentgon post he said he did not stand to gain from the 
prosperity of any former associate 
but tower was told by chairman sam nunn dga that his 
situation did pose problems because he had been involved with as 
many as seven major military contractors 
discussing the defense departments 300 billion budget tower 
said nothing is sacred when it comes to saving money he said 
bush had yet to decide where any savings from the pentagons coffers 
would come 
boskin told the banking panel that bush will reveal specific 
budget proposals in an address to a joint session of congress on 
feb 9 
boskin a stanford university economics professor is the creator 
of bushs flexible freeze plan under which total federal spending 
would grow no faster than the inflation rate bush has claimed that 
with that constraint the budget can be balanced by 1993 with no tax 
increases an assertion that critics claim would work only if the 
economy performs at unexpectedly good levels 
bush has never stated precisely how he would keep spending in 
check and boskin offered no new specifics to the senators 
if there are no new taxes that means there will have to be 
some massive cuts in the federal budget said sen larry pressler 
rsd who repeatedly asked boskin to specify three or four 
areas where spending reductions should be made 
boskin who emphasized that bush has not made any final decisions 
on the budget said he would personally favor reducing the growth 
rate of military spending and governmentpaid health benefits 
if i were looking for large savings they would have to come 
from areas where there is large spending boskin said 
lujan bushs choice to be interior secretary told the energy 
committee that he considers the job to be a stewardship and 
said he would seek thousands of volunteers as helpers in the 
national park and fish and wildlife systems 
he quoted the late president roosevelt in saying the country 
will not be a good place to live in unless it is a good place for 
all of us to live in 
we want to be known as a team who passed on these national 
treasures in better condition than we found them he said

the head of the world jewish 
congress said friday that more jewish emigres from the soviet union 
should go to israel rather than the united states 
edgar m bronfman also said west german leaders promised they 
would cooperate with international efforts against a libyan plant 
the united states says is intended for making poison gas 
in an interview bronfman said the number of soviet jewish 
emigres has increased vastly in 1986 only 681 were permitted to 
leave more liberal policies allowed that number to jump to 20000 
in 1988 
soviet jews leave with travel documents for israel and travel to 
vienna where many seek permission to resettle in the united states 
they then head to facilities in ladispoli town outside rome and 
often wait weeks for a decision on their applications 
they should go to israel or more of them should go to 
israel said bronfman now its a real strain on the us 
economy 
the american businessman said it costs 7000 to resettle each of 
the soviet jews in the united states 
he noted that soviet jewish emigres have refugee status when they 
leave 
but most of the soviet jews who are leaving now are not 
physically threatened its difficult to call them refugees said 
bronfman 
in september the united states for the first time began 
rejecting soviet jews for refugee status with the current rejection 
rate running at about 21 percent according to karl zukerman of the 
hebrew immigration aid society in new york 
bronfman said he wanted to avoid saying the united states had 
tightened its official policies regarding soviet jews but 
rather that washington had largely ignored various restrictions 
when the numbers were small 
bronfman spoke at length about his talks this week with west 
german chancellor helmut kohl and foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher regarding the plant in rapta libya which the united 
states says is being built to produce chemical weapons with help 
from west german companies 
bronfman said german leaders assured him that legal penalties 
will be increased for cases of illegal arms and armsrelated exports 
he said most importantly the west germans agreed to cooperate 
with their allies to ensure the plant cannot produce poison gas 
the teeth of the tiger will be pulled so that the plant cannot 
produce poison gas bronfman said how thats going to be done 
i didt get into that i will be more satisfied when the world is 
assured that libya cannot produce chemical weapons 
the libyan government denies the charges and maintains the plant 
is a pharmaceutical complex 
bronfman called alleged west german involvement an example of 
greed overcoming common sense

an emergency call from a man who 
reported a shooting a bleeding victim and fear for his own life was 
answered by a 911 dispatcher who hung up after telling the caller to 
have a nice day 
the conversation was being investigated by the los angeles county 
sheriffs department capt robert spierer said thursday he said 
the results of an internal investigation would not be released 
the conversation occurred at 1036 pm on jan 20 after a 
gangrelated shooting 
a man identified as jim finnila made the call to deputy jim green 
on the 911 emergency line to report a shooting miguel jiminez 15 
of newhall had been shot and died a short time later at a hospital 
alphonso tapia 19 a suspected gang member was booked for 
investigation of murder police said 
in a transcript of the call released thursday finnila tells 
green there was a shooting and pleads with him to get the cops 
here quick 
after a short exchange in which finnila says hes in danger 
green asks are you gonna talk to me 
yeah and im scared to death finnila says 
the conversation continues 
green all right has anybody been shot yes or no 
finnila i dont know i dont know

spierer said at a news conference another call about the shooting 
had been received seconds earlier and a squad car was sent to the 
area about four minutes later 
six squad cars eventually arrived and what was believed to be the 
murder weapon was recovered he said 
green hung up when the caller was uncooperative when he didnt 
answer the questions deputy green wanted answered spierer said 
he was also concerned that he was tying up a 911 line when others 
with more and better information might be trying to get through 
spierer said

educators are taking a new look at school 
security in light of the latest student shootings but most say even 
the tightest precautions wont shield pupils from wouldbe killers 
in all cases 
you can set up the procedures you can have detection systems 
you can reinforce the rules for entering a school building but 
still its very difficult to offer the kind of airtight protection 
that students need said gary marx a spokesman for the american 
association of school administrators 
some officials are calling for greater restrictions on sales of 
weapons particularly automatic rifles after last weeks killings 
in a stockton calif elementary school yard a gunman patrick 
purdy murdered five children and wounded 30 people using an ak47 
assault rifle before killing himself police say 
its not fair to say theres nothing you can do said bill 
honig superintendent of the california school system but its 
pretty hard to do something about this kind of guy he was going to 
get into the school somehow even with an armed guard he would have 
just shot past him 
he added the crime is that these weapons are around how many 
more innocent children are going to have to die before you decide to 
do something about the availability of weapons of war 
nevertheless honig said school personnel have been told to 
beef up vigilance and he said he expects gov george deukmeijian 
to sign a bill this year requiring every school to have a safety 
plan he vetoed it last year on cost grounds 
police officers security guards and even metal detectors are 
common sights at some high schools and middle schools besieged by 
drug and gang related violence but concern is now extending to 
elementary schools which are increasingly common targets of 
violence 
in the past year for example a 19yearold man killed two 
8yearolds and wounded seven pupils and two teachers at oakland 
elementary school in greenwood sc laurie dann shot and killed an 
8yearold and wounded five other children at hubbard woods 
elementary school in winnetka ill before wounding an adult and 
killing herself 
on thursday in washington a gunman opened fire into a crowd of 
high school students wounding four in an incident police said 
apparently grew out of an earlier argument 
many educators worry about the expense the effectiveness and the 
psychological impact of turning schools into fortresses 
the only way you could guarantee the safety of elementary 
schools from the criminally insane would be to build them like 
penitentiaries said thomas a shannon executive director of the 
national school boards association and that would be unacceptable 
in terms of school environment in terms of cost in terms of 
everything he said 
but stuart greenbaum a spokesman for the national school safety 
center in malibu calif said most parents want to see precautions 
taken rather than hear officials say sorry we dont want to make 
it an armed camp and he has some suggestions 
greenbaum whose center was begun by the reagan administration 
and is financed by the justice department said all schools should 
have security officers or staff members responsible for security 
equipped with walkietalkies or some way of communicating what they 
see 
asked if that would have helped in stockton he replied they 
might have been able to report seeing somebody on or about the 
campus with a gun maybe prevented the situation from being as 
dramatic as it was or in fact it may have even deterred the 
individual from even coming on the campus 
greenbaum said the stockton gunman entered through a gate at the 
back of the school grounds you have to limit access points he 
said this is not to say make the school a fortress but if you 
are obligated to have a variety of access points they ought to be 
monitored 
the recent outbreaks of school violence are prompting some 
education groups to reconsider their historic reluctance to take 
stands on gun control and other issues not directly related to 
education 
concern is intensifying many schools and national 
organizations at this point will be considering whether they should 
have positions on some of these issues such as gun control said 
marx of the administrators group 
the school board association could approve a guncontrol 
resolution at its delegate meeting in april shannon said school 
board members didnt think gun control was terribly relevant he 
said but now theyre rethinking their positions 
the national education association the countrys largest teacher 
union has long supported gun control

president bush said friday he sees nothing 
wrong with ronald reagan receiving large sums of money for his 
memoirs noting that other former presidents have done it i dont 
think its ever been challenged as inappropriate bush said 
bernie swain a partner in the washington speakers bureau says 
he has a handshake agreement to represent reagan and his wife 
nancy as their exclusive lecture agents he said terms had not been 
settled but other industry sources said the former president could 
command fees of 40000 or more per speech 
earlier it was reported that reagan will receive 5 million from 
simon amp schuster for his memoirs and a book of speeches 
bush was asked at his news conference if he thought it was 
appropriate to cash in on the presidency 
i dont know whether id call it cashing in i expect every 
president has written his memoirs and received money for it he 
said 
he said he had read that president grant received 500000 at a 
time when half a million really meant something for his memoirs 
so i think theres plenty of tradition that goes with 
presidents writing memoirs and being paid for it he said 
asked whether it might not create a wrong perception the 
president replied no because i think theres been a long history 
of that and i dont think its ever been challenged as 
inappropriate 
bush did not address the question of lecture fees 
the president was also asked whether the emphasis he has placed 
on government ethics during his first week in office implied any 
criticism of the reagan administrations ethical record he said 
no 
bush said he has spoken out as he has on the issue because i 
feel strongly about it 
swain said he was in the process of signing reagan up for his 
speakers bureau and that most of the former presidents speaking 
engagements would be in the west at least for now the reagans now 
live in los angeles 
don walker president of the harry walker agency in new york 
said his firm represent several speakers who get fees in the 40000 
range but generally that amount is paid for speeches which require 
travel 
the walker agencys clients include former secretary of defense 
caspar weinberger former president ford and former secretary of 
state henry kissinger among others 
swain said his firm had received requests in the past to arrange 
speeches by reagan while he was in office but had referred all such 
requests to the white house 
he said maureen reagan the presidents daughter and former 
white house chief of staff kenneth duberstein had also been added to 
the bureaus roster of speakers this week

a couple inspired by a mayoral candidates 
offer to buy assault rifles went out and bought 13 of them then 
turned them in to be resold to the politician at a loss officials 
said 
in nearby compton the city council voted to ban the powerful 
semiautomatic weapons outright 
were happy to have them off the streets said sgt mike 
miskowiec at the los angeles police departments southwest 
division where a man and woman brought in 13 ak47 assault rifles 
thursday evening 
they went out and purchased 13 of these guns and brought them 
down to us he said 
los angeles councilman nate holden who is running for mayor 
announced tuesday that he would buy semiautomatic assault rifles for 
up to 300 using 50000 from a political action committee fund 
counting the 13 brought in by the unidentified couple and seven 
more bought and brought in by a real estate agency the number of 
weapons turned in stood at 36 thursday 
the compton vote and holdens offer in los angeles came in the 
wake of the jan 17 massacre at a stockton schoolyard in which 
drifter patrick edward purdy opened fire on students with an ak47 
he killed five children and wounded 29 others and one teacher before 
taking his own life 
in compton the ban on the sale or possession of ak47s and other 
semiautomatic weapons was passed by the city council on tuesday it 
is scheduled to take effect feb 19 
it was time for somebody to take the first step said 
councilman maxcy filer who wrote the ordinance what were trying 
to do is get guns off the streets and out of the hands of 
criminals 
some compton officials have expressed concern the ordinance wont 
survive a constitutional challenge however and the national rifle 
associations office in washington dc has vowed to fight it 
compton a city of 96000 located 12 miles south of downtown los 
angeles has one of the highest murder rates in the area it 
recorded 80 killings in 1987 one for every 1200 residents 
according to fbi statistics 
holden rejected criticism that his effort is a publicity stunt 
for his campaign to unseat fourterm mayor tom bradley in the april 
election 
miskowiec refused to name the couple who brought in the 13 guns 
and said he didnt know why they made the purchase new ak47s 
generally range in price from about 300 to 1500 for a customized 
version according to gun dealers 
among the ak47s turned in thursday were seven bought by a san 
fernando valley real estate office for more than 2500 
we just decided to go ahead and get these things off the 
street said jeffrey fox an office employee he called it a 
symbolic action 
one woman had an ak47 stolen out of her car thursday when she 
stopped at a gas station on the way to turn it in miskowiec said

services 
i think its been a wonderfully harmonious week and these are 
just little ripples on the surface of an otherwise calm pond bush 
said 
the presidents news conference concluded a week rich in 
symbolism but relatively lean of substance 
that bush said was the point of the first week calling it a 
time for setting a certain tone and outreach 
therell be plenty of time for controversy plenty of time for 
lively debate on substance he told reporters 
in his first week bush called world leaders including soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev held a concilatory meeting with a 
bipartisan delegation from congress set up a commission to recomend 
an ethics code for government officials and hammered the ethics 
theme home in talks before various governmental groups 
the white house also announced bush would travel to canada 
japan china and south korea and said japans prime minister noburo 
takeshita would visit here next week 
was bush concerned that he would be criticzied for not having 
much meat behind the words 
there is a danger of that but people realize weve been here 
five days bush said referring to working days 
he defended anew his decision to undertake a thorough review of 
ussoviet relations 
people understand that in things like the foreign policy 
area its prudent to have a review they understand that weve got 
to get our people in place 
well just go forward he added if we just sat around and 
did nothing but be pleasant to people on the hill or something 
i suspect that would grow a little old 
and he said he was sticking by his hhs secretarydesignate 
disputing statements that sullivan had disagreed with bushs 
conviction that the supreme court decision legalizing abortion 
should be overturned we are in sync bush declared 
and he quickly distanced himself from the muchcriticized 
proposal of treasury secretary nicholas brady to charge depositors a 
fee to shore up the nations ailing savings and loan industry bush 
said that the proposal hadnt even made it to his desk yet and its 
a little absurd to be commmenting on it at this stage 
overall bush said its been a good easy week and i expect 
it will change dramatically in the weeks ahead 
while claiming the week had been marred by a head cold he said 
he still planned to smile and enjoy it while you can 
because i can already sense you know looking forward a 
little more confrontation out there

president bush said friday that federal reserve 
board chairman alan greenspan worries more than he does about 
inflation right now but that otherwise their views are similar 
basically and generally speaking i think were fairly close 
together bush said at his first presidential news conference 
bush was asked about what appeared to be a disagreement between 
himself and the fed over its policy on interest rates 
greenspan earlier this week told congress that the risk of higher 
inflation was great enough that the fed should err more on the 
side of restrictiveness than of stimulus in setting interest rate 
and credit policy 
the fed has been gradually tightening credit pushing up 
shortterm interest rates in recent months to keep the economy from 
overheating 
bush however said this week that he didnt want the fed to 
move so strongly against fear of inflation that we impede growth 
greenspan is more concerned about inflationary pressures than i 
am right now seems to me theres an area of difference bush 
said friday 
bush said one cause of greenspans concern appeared to be recent 
statistics showing that the nations factories were operating at 
824 percent of capacity last month the highest level in nine 
years 
many economists have suggested that the high level of factory 
utilization combined with an unemployment rate at a 14year low of 
53 percent could soon combine to force up the price of 
manufactured goods

the us court of appeals today cleared the way 
for the partial merger of detroits two daily newspapers the free 
press and the news 
in a 21 decision the court said a ruling last year by 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii approving the joint operating 
agreement of the two newspapers was based on a permissible 
construction of the newspaper preservation act 
the act creates an exemption to the antitrust laws that permits a 
joint arrangement between two newspapers if the attorney general 
determines that one of the two papers is a failing newspaper and 
in probable danger of financial failure 
the appeals court said meeses application of the legal standard 
to the facts in the case was not arbitrary capricious or an abuse 
of discretion 
congress delegated to the attorney general not to us the 
delicate and troubling responsibility of putting content into the 
ambiguous phrase probable danger of financial failure the 
appeals court ruling said we cannot say that his interpretation 
of that phrase was unreasonable 
the ruling affirmed a decision in september by us district 
judge george revercomb he rejected contentions by a group of 
detroit advertisers and readers that the morning free press owned 
by knightridder inc was not a failing newspaper entitled to 
antitrust exemptions under the 1970 newspaper preservation act 
knightridder has threatened to close the free press if the joint 
operating agreement is not approved the news is owned by gannett 
co inc 
consolidating the two newspapers business advertising 
circulation and production departments would result in layoffs of 
between 600 and 800 employees compared with the loss of 2200 jobs 
if the free press were shut down

nurses using tainted syringes infected 27 children 
at a hospital with the aids virus the largest single outbreak of 
the deadly disease in the soviet union a newspaper reported friday 
in an expose headlined diagnosis syringe the labor daily 
trud said criminal negligence was suspected at the republican 
childrens hospital in elista in southern russia 
authorities discovered the outbreak in november when a child and 
a woman blood donor from the hospital were found to have aids 
the soviet union only recently has admitted to an aids problem 
and started diagnosis treatment and prevention programs 
authorities discovered that a son of the woman blood donor had 
died after treatment in the same hospital as the aidsinfected 
child and began testing other children and mothers there trud 
said of 300 people screened 27 children most under 2 and four 
mothers were found to have aids 
the women apparently contracted the virus from their children 
through breastfeeding trud said it said the mothers nipples must 
have cracked and the infants passed the virus on to them such a 
method of transmission has not been identified previously according 
to the newspaper 
anne sims a spokeswoman at the us centers for disease control 
in atlanta said aids specialists there consider it highly unlikely 
that infants could give aids to their mothers through breastfeeding 
the cdc knows of only one case of an infant giving aids to its 
mother sims said but that transmission occurred through blood 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring 
more tests are planned on 1000 children at the hospital as well 
as on patients at other facilities where the children also had been 
treated trud said 
vadim v pokrovsky head of the aids laboratory of the central 
scientific research institute of epidemiology in moscow said the 
number of aids cases traced to the elista hospital could double or 
triple as tests continue 
if measures arent taken to control infection by instruments 
the disease could spread pokrovsky said on the tv news program 
vremya 
the infected patients were carrying the disease but had not shown 
symptoms and none had died he said 
an unprecedented situation has been created in the republic in 
which during two months more than 30 carriers of the virus have been 
revealed pokrovsky said 
he told trud an investigation will determine who was responsible 
the council of ministers warned in 1987 that infecting someone 
with aids would be punished as a crime and said anyone in the 
country could be forced to take an aids test under a new regulation 
that take effect next month foreigners who want to stay more than 
three months will have to prove they are aidsfree 
the newspaper said hospital staff had violated all sanitary 
rules log books that were supposed to contain records of payments 
for syringes were either missing or blank some 14 percent of 
instruments used last year were not sterilized as required trud 
reported 
disposable syringes are in short supply in the soviet union 
glass syringes are used most frequently after sterilization in 
boiling water trud said the two agencies responsible for producing 
syringes had made only excuses for the shortage and admitted they 
were turning to foreign companies for supplies 
trud said the incident eroded confidence in the soviet medical 
system 
probably no doctor is better than a bad doctor the newspaper 
said 
it also lashed out at the soviet union for not taking more active 
measures against aids 
we are still not prepared for a serious battle against it 
trud said 
instead of combatting the virus soviet doctors engage in an 
ideological battle to blame the spread of aids on the west it 
said it quoted one official as writing that the roots of 
distribution are the american and western ways of life 
irrepressible and prospering homosexuality 
last year the first soviet aids deaths were reported a 
4monthold baby from odessa apparently infected by its mother and 
a 29yearold leningrad prostitute tests identified 112 soviets and 
334 foreign residents carrying the human immunodeficiency virus of 
them five foreigners and three soviets have contracted the disease

together friday after a nurse on maternity leave was arrested on 
suspicion of kidnapping the boy on the pretext of returning him to 
the hospital for a blood test 
sixdayold henry garcia was taken from his parents home 
wednesday by a woman in a white uniform wearing a stethoscope and 
claiming to be a valley medical center nurse 
he was found safe 15 hours later after detectives traced 
catherine anne garrigan through a trail of telephone numbers left 
with the babys family police said 
authorities said garrigan a registered nurse on leave from the 
center since middecember apparently obtained numbers for garcias 
family through the hospital and called the relatives after the 
mother and child were released sunday 
police were investigating the possibility that garrigan had 
recently suffered a miscarriage said lt sam pearson 
the babys mother 27yearold margarita regalado who has lived 
in united states for eight years and speaks little english said a 
friend received a call from a woman claiming to be a nurse regalado 
doesnt have a telephone 
the nurse said she had to see the baby because they forgot to 
do a blood test and she wanted to talk to me or see me said the 
new mother adding that she and her husband thought the hospital may 
have forgotten to perform the test 
she said the nurse arrived at their home checked the babys 
heartbeat and asked if he had a cough 
she said she would take him for three hours and then would 
return said regalado 
as soon as the nurse had gone regalado said she suspected the 
baby had been stolen the family called the hospital which said it 
had not sent a nurse 
pearson said detectives traced the baby to garrigan and a friend 
ismael perez 31 through phone numbers left with the newborns 
relatives ringing a santa clara number police heard a baby crying 
in the background police said 
they kept the woman on the phone while officers were dispatched 
there they arrested perez and garrigan and found the baby 
garrigan and perez were booked thursday for investigation of 
conspiracy and kidnapping bail was set at 50000 each perez

john tower the us defense 
secretarydesignate arrived friday for a strategy session with nato 
allies in which he will warn of a possible kremlin ploy to weaken 
the western alliance 
tower took a break from senate confirmation hearings to address 
the 26th annual conference of policymakers from the 16 nato members 
he is expected to be confirmed 
i find this to be a very interesting and productive conference 
because of the frankness of the exchange of views tower told the 
associated press upon arrival he has attended all but one of the 
previous 25 meetings 
tower apparently was referring to the sometimes volatile 
exchanges that take place at the sessions delving into defense 
strategy arms control and fair distribution of security costs and 
burdens 
tower refused further comment on his expectations for the session 
on grounds he is embargoed from giving interviews until 
confirmation 
but copies of a speech tower is to deliver sunday were released 
friday in it tower restates his support for modernizing or 
extending europeanbased shortrange missiles now capable of 
striking as far away as 300 miles 
continued wrangling and delays only provide the soviet union 
with an opportunity to try to undermine nato unity he says 
referring to debates among europeans about the need for and wisdom 
of modifying the missiles to effectively replace mediumrange 
rockets being withdrawn from europe under the superpower treaty 
signed in 1987 
tower makes several references in the address to what he 
perceives as a possible kremlin ploy to enhance differences among 
the western allies and thus weaken nato 
we cannot afford to be lulled into a false sense of security 
the address reads the jury is still out on how long or how far 
the soviet leadership will tolerate change 
he also presses the western alliance to take advantage of its 
technological superiority by developing more sophisticated weapons 
systems than the economically strapped east bloc could afford to 
match 
the weekend session alliances in a changing world will give 
washingtons allies their first good reading of the defense plans of 
president bush 
it also is expected to spotlight differences among the allies 
over how eastwest disarmament should proceed 
as soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has pushed for deep cuts in 
nuclear stockpiles and announced some unilateral reductions in 
troops tanks and shortrange missiles in eastern europe west 
europeans have been increasingly critical of nato doctrine 
for example west german public opinion polls show declining 
fears of the east bloc and waning support for more defense spending 
and the presence of allied troops tanks and lowflying aircraft

a man who helped develop new mexicos 
only heart transplant program died friday after his own heart was 
stricken suddenly by a viral infection and a donor organ could not 
be found officials said 
robert shafer 46 assistant administrator for medical staff 
affairs at presbyterian hospital suffered the attack last week and 
his condition rapidly deteriorated 
the feeling of helplessness has gripped us all said hospital 
spokeswoman lynn villella the donor program has done everything 
humanly possible 
shafer left work jan 19 with flulike symptoms and was admitted 
to the hospital monday he was put on a list of transplant 
candidates tuesday and placed on a heartlung machine wednesday 
after his heart failed 
on friday morning his family requested he be taken off the 
machine after all his organs began to deteriorate she said 
shafer an administrator at the hospital for 20 years oversaw 
its heart program when it began in 1969 and helped direct its 
development since then ms villella said 
the program began transplants in 1986 and since then has done 32 
plus one heartlung transplant 
gov garrey carruthers had issued an appeal for a donor as did 
shafers wife joyce who pledged to work to increase public 
awareness of the need for donor organs this should never happen 
to anyone else she said in a statement 
many viruses can either attack the heart directly or cause the 
bodys immune system to damage the heart said dr ronnie garner a 
presbyterian pathologist 
shafers case was particularly unusual because of the quick 
progression to complete heart failure he said

president bush offering a dim assessment of 
the situation in afghanistan as soviets troops withdraw said friday 
that us embassy officials have been ordered out of the wartorn 
country to save their lives 
it is a prudent policy to protect a handful of american 
lives bush told an impromptu white house news conference 
bush queried about the reason behind secretary of state james a 
baker iiis decision to close the kabul embassy said 
i think theres a lot of uncertainty theres enough 
uncertainty that the secretary of state was taking prudent action in 
this regard 
fewer than 10 diplomats and security guards are left in the us 
outpost all travel by american civilians to the country had already 
been banned 
the safety of the us contingent came into question in recent 
weeks as fighting has intensified between ussupported rebels and 
the sovietbacked regime of najibullah 
the rebels are expected to launch an allout drive against the 
government forces once the last of 50000 soviet soldiers leave the 
capital which moscow has said will come by feb 15 
bush said he did not mention afghanistan last week when he spoke 
at length with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev but said he 
was convinced the withdrawal will continue 
bush went on to say that he believed there is uncertainty about 
what follows the pullout and that he hoped the united states 
would play a catalytic role for helping bring about stability in 
the future 
state department spokesman charles redman echoed bushs comments 
saying the decision to remove the employees was made solely on 
security grounds in a deteriorating situation and growing 
uncertainty that the regime can provide any kind of security in the 
coming days 
redman added that the move which affects fewer than 10 diplomats 
and security guards does not mean that the diplomatic post has been 
shut down for good we hope to have our people back there as soon 
as the security situation would permit that he said 
fewer than 20 us citizens are in afghanistan they have been 
encouraged to leave by us officials 
a group of afghan employees will remain at the embassy 
essentially as housekeepers the spokesman said 
redman pointed out that closing the embassy does not create a 
major diplomatic problem because the united states does not 
recognize the legitimacy of the najibullah regime and the embassy 
had acted primarily as a listening post 
we dont have any interests to represent because we dont 
recognize the legitimacy of that regime in any case redman said 
afghan guerrillas armed by the united states and pakistan are 
fighting to wrest control of the country from government forces 
backed by the soviets the drive by the mujahedeen rebels for kabul 
and a deteriorating situation in the capital threatened to expose 
the americans to the crossfire 
the us diplomatic contingent was gradually reduced over the 
years and the country has been without a fulltime american 
ambassador since adolph dubs was killed by afghan forces a decade 
ago

czechoslovakia and bulgaria 
announced friday they will follow their warsaw pact allies and cut 
troops and defense spending 
only romania increasingly isolated in the soviet bloc has not 
made a similar announcement 
czechoslovakia said friday it will cut defense spending by 15 
percent and trim its armed forces by 12000 men 850 tanks 165 
armored vehicles and 51 fighter planes in the next two years 
hours later the bulgarian state news agency announced the state 
council and government approved a motion from communist leader todor 
zhivkov to reduce the countrys 1989 defense budget by 12 percent 
and its armed forces by 10000 men 
by 1991 bulgaria also will scrap 200 tanks 200 artillery 
systems 20 aircraft and five naval units bta said without 
elaborating 
according to nato bulgaria has 135000 men under arms and 
czechoslovakia 145000 
east germany hungary and poland all have announced cuts in 
military manpower and spending following the lead of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev who said dec 7 he would reduce the 
red army by half a million men by 1991 
the cuts seem designed to boost new natowarsaw pact talks on 
reducing conventional troops and weapons across europe to open in 
vienna in march 
they also benefit the communist governments by freeing funds for 
sorely needed economic reforms and by creating pressure for nato to 
follow suit with cuts of its own 
a spokesman at the western military alliances brussels 
headquarters said thursday the recently announced soviet bloc 
reductions still leave a great imbalance in europe with western 
ground troops outnumbered almost 21 
ctk the official czechoslovak news agency billed the measures 
as a unilateral contribution to boost confidence and security in 
europe prague would contemplate more cuts if the west follows the 
easts lead in cutting men and armaments it said 
the czechoslovak armys reserve force would lose 15000 men and 
the number of divisions involved in military maneuvers and tactical 
exercises would be halved according to ctk 
it said 20000 soldiers now on active duty would be transferred 
to army construction brigades while the equipment for three more 
divisions would be put into storage and most men from those 
divisions diverted to other duties 
the cuts in czechoslovakia east germany and hungary are in 
addition to those announced by gorbachev who told the united 
nations on dec 7 that 50000 soviet troops and 5000 soviet tanks 
would be withdrawn from those nations 
soviet defense officials have said partial withdrawal could begin 
as soon as april 
east germany has said it would cut its armed forces by 10000 
soldiers and reduce defense spending by 10 percent it also will 
scrap 600 tanks and 50 warplanes 
hungary already has cut its military budget by 17 percent in real 
terms from 1988 and in december announced plans to retire more than 
50 top officers who are over 60 years old including 10 generals 
poland said it has reduced its army by 15000 men during the past 
two years and would dissolve two divisions in 1989 and reduce two 
more by 85 percent 
it also said its military budget for 1989 is 19 billion 
representing 36 percent of this years national income compared to 
the 1988 budgets 38 percent of the years national income

the london premiere of david mamets 
speedtheplow received mixed reviews for the play itself and 
for the actress in the role created by madonna 
the acerbic comedy which ended its hit broadway run new years 
eve opened in london on wednesday at the national theater where 
mamets glengarry glen ross had its world premiere in 1983 
that play won the london equivalent of the tony award as the 
years best but on the basis of its critical reception 
speedtheplow seems unlikely to follow suit 
jack tinker of the daily mail praised the strong and sinewy 
dialogue of mamets short threeact play a morality tale set in 
the wheelerdealer environment of modern hollywood 
tinker thanked the national for repairing the damage caused 
by casting madonna in new york but he nonetheless felt the play has 
a hole where its heart should be 
milton shulman similarly faulted the plays basically hollow 
center while admiring the breathless pace of the staging by 
its original broadway director gregory mosher 
speedtheplow stars colin stinton and alfred molina as 
fellow movie producers and longtime friends and rebecca pidgeon as 
the temporary secretary karen who momentarily throws their 
friendship into question 
maureen paton in the daily express wrote that ms pidgeon puts 
madonna to shame not difficult the critic found the play 
biliously funny 
michael billington in the guardian praised the actress 
emotional directness and said moshers direction whips along 
zippily 
but michael coveney in the financial times thought the play 
thinly textured and denounced ms pidgeon as another woefully 
inexperienced national theater recruit 
speedtheplow is expected to move to the commercial west end 
in the summer and the opening saw a full turnout of london 
producers 
mamets play is the second american play to open in london this 
week on monday the young vic theater opened twoway mirror 
two arthur miller oneacts which were poorly received in their 
american debut in new haven conn in 1982 
the london reception was marginally better with critics 
reserving most praise for david thackers production and the 
performances of the stars helen mirren and bob peck 
millers writing itself drew mixed marks with charles spencer in 
the daily telegraph commenting i was uneasily aware that if the 
plays had been by a less venerable author and performed by less 
persuasive actors they would have commanded a great deal less 
attention

president bush said friday that members of 
congress are overdue for the 50 percent raise recommended by 
ronald reagan and joined congressional leaders in proposing that the 
raise be linked to strict limits on fees members may accept from 
special interests 
bush told a news conference i do support the recommendations 
of reagan and a presidential commission for the raises for congress 
federal judges and top executive branch officials 
bush said some elements of the proposed increase bothered 
him but pointed out that congress procedure on pay raises leaves 
us with either the commission recommendation or nothing 
the ball is clearly in their court bush said of the 
lawmakers and so seeing the problems as i do i still feel that i 
should not go about undoing the reagan decision 
bushs views were similar to those of house leaders from both 
parties who plan to let the raise become law on feb 8 and then 
enact broad restrictions on outside income congressional salaries 
for rankandfile lawmakers would rise from 89500 to 135000 
under the commission proposal 
house leadership negotiators have tentatively worked out the 
broad elements of the plan which would include a ban on honoraria 
such as speaking fees close a loophole in federal law that has 
allowed 190 house members to stash away more than 39 million in 
surplus campaign money for their personal use limit travel paid for 
by special interests and restrict nonhonoraria income 
the senate is expected to vote overwhelmingly to reject the 
raise which will take effect unless both houses turn it down once 
it becomes law senators are expected to approve a package to 
restrict outside income 
bush was asked how he viewed the raise given that polls show a 
majority of americans oppose the increase for lawmakers 
a raise is overdue theres no question about that bush 
responded there are some good things in this the reform of the 
honorarium payments for these speeches i think is very very good 
i think its good government 
the president said reagan did consider all this carefully he 
went forward with the commissions recommendation 
asked if he was concerned with the perception that he was 
supporting the raise for a highincome group while forgetting 
lowincome americans bush replied no im not concerned about 
that perception 
he said the real issues for americans are how do we continue 
to create jobs keep it going and how do we increase economic 
opportunity 
and maybe there is a way to do it but i dont think it would 
be fair to say when you take a pay raise that affects a tiny 
fraction judges and congressmen that that has a broad economic 
impact on the country

a senate committee recommended friday that 
attorney carla hills be confirmed as us trade representative after 
she assured lawmakers she would fight to open global markets with 
a crowbar if necessary 
we have to have our agreements enforced said mrs hills 
before the senate finance committee voted 180 to recommend 
confirmation and where our partners are violating our agreements 
we must take action she added 
president bushs nomination of the washington attorney and former 
housing and urban development secretary now goes to the full senate 
for a vote on confirmation no date has been set 
mrs hills would succeed clayton k yeutter who has been tapped 
by bush for secretary of agriculture in the job of top us trade 
negotiator 
before the committee mrs hills sought to dampen concern that 
she could become vulnerable to conflictofinterest charges because 
she and her attorney husband roderick hills have represented 
foreign law clients 
let me address the question of potential conflicts of interest 
right away she said there are none 
she promised that she and her husband would divest themselves of 
any business interests that could present such a conflict and that 
she would keep hands off any cases involving her former clients 
senators seemed satisfied 
i think youre going to make a terrific trade representative 
sen john d rockefeller iv dwva said 
a witness who appeared briefly before the panel however anthony 
harrigan president of the us business and industrial council 
argued that her involvement with foreign clients made it impossible 
for mrs hills to avoid a conflict several lawmakers took issue 
with him 
mrs hills told the committee that she would prefer to open 
foreign markets with negotiations and a handshake but she added 
that she would seek to do so with a crowbar if necessary 
retaliation cannot be the goal of our policy she said in 
fact it signals the failure to open foreign markets but the 
credible threat of retaliation provides essential leverage in our 
marketopening efforts thus actual retaliation will be used 
albeit reluctantly to preserve the credibility of this threat 
bushs choice of mrs hills initially brought a statement from 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas that he had hoped 
for someone with experience in international markets for the post 
bentsen had a more enthusiastic response when she appeared friday 
before his committee 
you have done well and you have answered with more specifics 
than i have normally heard from a person being confirmed bentsen 
said they usually fudge their answers more 
she discussed complex trade issues ranging from plywood exports 
to european government subsidies for the airbus industrie jetliner 
manufacturer 
supporters of mrs hills have been assuring lawmakers that she 
has the toughness to represent america in difficult trade battles 
make no mistake said sen pete wilson rcalif this is a 
gentle lady but this lady has the guts of a lion 
her toughminded style found encouragement among panel members 
with sen max baucus dmont saying he found a touch of 
naivete in bushs vow to work for a kinder and gentler america 
the world is not necessarily kinder and more gentle when it 
comes to international trade baucus said theres a state of 
near economic war

vietnam has promised the bush administration it 
will continue to cooperate with us attempts to obtain an 
accounting of us servicemen still missing from the vietnam war 
the state department said friday 
vietnams ambassador to the united nations trinh xuan lang 
spent an hour thursday discussing that issue with officials from the 
state department national security council and the pentagon 
it was the first visit by a hanoi official for diplomatic 
discussions since the northern half of vietnam became independent 
from france in 1954 the southern half of vietnam came under hanois 
rule after 1975 
state department spokesman charles redman said the session with 
lang dealt exclusively with the powmia issue

which limit his travels to the new york city area 
he had asked for permission to visit washington to attend a 
reception thursday evening sponsored by sight savers international 
a nonprofit group which trains foreign doctors in eye surgery 
techniques 
the administration used langs visit to reaffirm its concerns 
about obtaining an accounting for the more than 1700 us 
servicemen still missing in vietnam 
we explained the need for our investigations to be as thorough 
as possible for which the ambassador pledged his governments 
continuing cooperation redman said 
redman and other officials have said langs visit should not be 
construed as a softening of us terms for normalizing relations 
with vietnam 
the principal condition is the withdrawal of vietnamese troops 
from cambodia 
lang was to meet friday afternoon with sen frank murkowski 
ralas who has proposed the establishment of us offices in

the miami company franchising the fred astaire 
dance studios has agreed to pay a fine of 105000 for violating a 
1964 federal trade commission order requiring certain refund and 
cancellation rights for its students the commission said friday 
the company ronby corp signed a consent decree agreeing not to 
violate the order in the future the ftc said 
the decree settling the commissions complaint was filed with the 
us district court in miami under the decree the company neither 
admits nor denies guilt but if the court adopts the decree the 
company may be punished for future violations 
over the objections of one of its members the commission agreed 
to accept the fine in installments 
the commission said ronby violated the 1964 order by requiring 
customers to listen to sales pitches for future lessons before 
completing their first course by selling additional lessons during 
instruction time by failing to give refunds and attempting to 
conceal the true price of lessons and by using relays of sales 
representatives in attempts to sell lessons 
the commission issued for 30 days of public comment draft 
modifications of the 1964 decree it said the changes would 
strengthen protection for the students among other things the 
modifications call for pro rata refunds for unused lessons when a 
customer cancels and would require ronby to cancel the franchise of 
any studio violating terms of the modified order 
the commission acted on a 31 vote with andrew j strenio 
dissenting he said he objected to installment payment of the fine 
and would have at least insisted on provision of collateral until 
all the payments were made

a firefighting system was clogged and 
virtually useless on an oil rig where 167 men died in an 
explosion and fire last year a company engineer told an official 
inquiry friday 
however an energy department report last year said the system 
which sprays water to put out a fire was turned off at the time 
anyway because divers were repairing water intakes 
conrad wottge occidental oil corps facilities engineering 
manager said friday he had warned of problems with what is called 
the waterdeluge system on the piper alpha rig in march 1988 
four months before the disaster 
an interim inquiry concluded in september that an explosion in a 
gas compressor of the north sea rig ruptured gas pipelines setting 
off a series of explosions and fires it was the worlds worst oil 
rig disaster 
wottge said the existing firefighting system was virtually 
useless because it could not be counted on to put out a fire he 
said its pipes were clogged with mineral deposits and needed to be 
replaced 
he said design of a new system was underway at the time of the 
disaster on july 6 
he also said the rig had no structural fireproofing 
the engineer recommended in march that most of the gas stored on 
the rig be removed

darkie toothpaste is being renamed and redesigned 
to remove its logo of a grinning black minstrel after several groups 
complained to colgatepalmolive co that the product was offensive 
the company said friday 
the toothpaste is manufactured and sold in asia by the hong 
kongbased hawley amp hazel group colgatepalmolive which sells 
household and hygiene products worldwide became a joint partner 
with hawley amp hazel in 1985 
since then a group of congressmen and the interfaith center on 
corporate responsibility a coalition of church investors have been 
putting pressure on the companies to change what they said is 
racially offensive packaging 
the popular product which has remained unchanged for 62 years 
will be renamed darlie in all of its markets hong kong malaysia 
singapore taiwan and thailand within a year colgatepalmolive 
said 
the company said the logo will be changed to a to a 
nonracially offensive silhouette a racially ambiguous man in a 
top hat 
the management of hawley amp hazel and colgatepalmolive have 
agreed that the old name and package presentation represents 
offensive racial stereotyping that should be changed 
colgatepalmolive said in a statement 
we think its acceptable said dara demmings a spokesman for 
the interfaith coalition which seeks to influence social and 
financial issues within corporations through stock ownership 
in addition to pressure from the coalition three interfaith 
members who each owned at least 1000 worth of colgate stock 
registered objections at a shareholders meeting in may 
the shareholders included the illinoisbased school sisters of 
st francis southern province of the missionary oblates of mary 
immaculate in san antonio texas and a nun who owns shares for the 
sisters of loretta based in kentucky 
similar pressure from outside groups led quaker oats co to 
modify its aunt jemima figure in the 1960s to make her look less 
like a plantation cook and forced the sambos restaurant chain to 
rename itself no place like sams in the 1970s 
ms demmings said she believed colgatepalmolive officials were 
hampered by objections from hawley amp hazel who told a group of 
congressmen as late as last month that it had no plans to change the 
products name 
its unfortunate that it took so long said new york rep 
edolpus towns a member of the congressional government operations 
committee who voiced objections to the product during a visit to 
taiwan in december 
towns also praised colgatepalmolive for making a diligent 
effort since day one of their relationship with hawley to correct 
this insensitive name and logotype 
rep john conyers jr of michigan another committee member 
praised the company for its understanding albeit late and 
urged other companies to act accordingly

after a week in the white house the signs are 
unmistakable that george bush has shifted into a lower gear ronald 
reagans pursuit of reconciliation with the soviet union 
the new president is also flashing the yellow light of caution on 
the middle east as he gropes for foreign policy positions that bear 
his imprint 
while one week is hardly enough time to form judgments about a 
presidents performance his comments at fridays news conference 
clearly left a deep impression of prudence a word he used often 
in the session 
ticking off some of the major areas of the policy he is slowly 
formulating the soviet union the middle east and central america 
bush told reporters weve got to have a little time 
where will he move first to leave his mark bush did not say 
he told the news conference 
i cant tell you where you will see the first major 
initiative whether its going to be the middle east whether its 
going to be central america 
clearly the soviet union has been the early foreign policy focus 
of bush james a baker iii the new secretary of state and brent 
scowcroft the presidents national security adviser 
we still have problems bush said in reference to moscow 
are there still uncertainties are we still unsure of our 
predictions on soviet intentions id have to say yes we should be 
cautious 
as he took the foreign policy reins from reagan bush ordered a 
broad prudent reassessment of us relations with the soviet 
union 
he said he didnt know how long the process would take after 
talking on the phone this week with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev bush said he does not think the soviets consider his 
reflective stance footdragging 
in fact bush sought to give the impression at fridays news 
conference that he would have a very active policy toward the soviet 
union once the review is completed 
i dont want to play defense he said and i dont want to 
look like were footdragging just waiting around to let others set 
the agenda 
but he stressed prudence is the order of the day 
baker who lacks experience both on the soviet union and the 
middle east told the senate foreign relations committee during his 
confirmation hearings this week that he wanted to review the 
bidding in ussoviet negotiations to reduce longrange nuclear 
weapons 
baker who was treasury secretary before becoming bushs 
presidential campaign chairman also said the united states should 
avoid a headlong rush to provide moscow with loans and credits 
traditionally useful tools in improving relations 
scowcroft who has the experience is registering concern that 
gorbachevs peace offensive has as one of its main goals making 
trouble within the alliance of western nations he is suspicious 
that gorbachevs motivation is to buy time to reform the soviet 
economy which is a lot different from approaching gorbachev 
primarily as a world leader trying to ease eastwest tensions 
i think the cold war is not over scowcroft said in a recent 
assessment of the superpower relationship 
on the mideast it seems clear that there too a goslow 
approach is developing 
in their final days in power reagan and his secretary of state 
george shultz broke a 13year embargo and opened us talks with 
the palestine liberation organization shultz made five trips to the 
middle east in 1988 and while neither the arabs nor israelis agreed 
to negotiations shultz left office optimistic about the future 
there is more diplomatic fluidity now and opportunity there 
than theres been in some time he told reporters on his final 
trip to vienna last week 
baker on the other hand emphasized that we ought to all be 
realistic about the prospects for achieving a breakthrough he 
also told the senate committee there is no more intractable 
problem facing us 
baker was cool about the dialogue with the plo suggesting it 
would be continued only if it proved useful 
and he ruled out a palestinian state which the reagan 
administration had also opposed that appears to eliminate an option 
that has ardent arab support and could make it more difficult to 
entice arab nations into any us scenario for the middle east 
for his part bush said he would send baker or another top us 
official to see plo chairman yasser arafat only if was necessary to 
finalize dramatic decisions 
bush told his news conference he hadnt given any thought at 
all to what and when a meeting between arafat and an american 
official would be appropriate 
he added 
i would wait to see how we go forward if theres some 
logical step that requires highlevel signoff by various 
participants over there then and then only would it be proper to 
elevate the meetings to that level 
were just starting you crawl before you walk

president bush said friday he left william 
bennett the head of his antidrug effort out of the cabinet to 
free bennett for antidrug activities and not to lessen the 
importance of bennetts post 
bennett and some of his supporters were surprised that bennett 
was not made a member of the cabinet 
bush could have permitted bennett to meet with the cabinet as he 
has done with carla hills the administrations trade 
representative and richard darman director of the office of 
management and budget 
the reason he bennett isnt in the cabinet is that i tried to 
reduce down the numbers of full cabinet members bush told a news 
conference he was referring to the fact that he removed two 
cabinetlevel posts from advisory group including cia director and 
united nations ambassador 
and i think bill bennetts time is best spent not worrying 
about agricultural subsidies when we have a meeting on agriculture 
but concentrating on drugs 
bush said he doesnt want his action misinterpreted as a 
statement that he believes fighting drugs is of lesser importance 
than other issues that might come before the cabinet 
you will see me side by side with bill bennett on putting the 
proper emphasis from the oval office on my determination to do 
everything in the governments powerto eliminate this scourge 
bush said he wants to find a way to step up the total funding 
on antinarcotics but he offered no specifics 
the position of drug czar formally known as director of national 
drug control policy was set up last fall when congress passed a 
package of antidrug legislation the bill specified that the drug 
czar should be a cabinetlevel job but that is not the same as 
actually being in the cabinet 
a bush transition team official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said bennett was surprised when he was not invited to the 
new administrations first cabinet meeting monday 
members of congress also were surprised bush left bennett out of 
the cabinet rep bob dornan rcalif said bush should change the 
decision 
if the administration is going to keep the high profile it says 
drugs is going to be then i think there has to be room at the table 
so that at every cabinet meeting there is a presence at the table 
of this problem dornan said 
dornan said congress had anticipated the drug czar would have 
cabinet rank in creating the job even though the cabinets 
membership is up to the president 
sen joseph biden jr ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee said he was dismayed by the decision not to make the 
position a cabinet post

other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices in order to meet foreign competition the exporters then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as 
bonuses or subsidies

iran for talks with iraqi officials in an effort to get deadlocked 
persian gulf peace talks moving again un officials said 
jan eliasson arrived by helicopter from the southern port of 
basra after inspecting gulf ceasefire lines in the region the 
officials said iraqi television said he flew the full length of the 
disputed shatt alarab waterway 
asked whether he was bringing a new peace proposal eliasson 
said i just arrived and i really am not prepared to go into 
questions of that nature 
eliasson swedens un ambassador and secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellars special emissary planned to meet with iraqi 
foreign minister tariq aziz on saturday the officials said 
there were no immediate signs that either gulf war rival was 
prepared to soften its stand and enable the talks to resume 
unsponsored peace talks between iran and iraq began in geneva 
on aug 25 five days after a ceasefire took effect in the 
8yearold gulf war 
but the talks broke down immediately over the issue of troop 
withdrawals to prewar borders two further round of negotiations 
failed to make progress and no date has been set for them to resume 
eliasson began his mission in iran on jan 23 holding four days 
of talks with prime minister hussein musavi foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati and other officials 
he said before leaving tehran it is very important to create a 
new momentum to speed up the trend of future peace talks 
irans islamic republic news agency quoted eliasson as saying 
friday that his talks were useful and fruitful it had no 
details 
the news agency monitored in nicosia quoted musavi as blaming 
iraq for the deadlock by refusing to withdraw from territory that 
iran claims was captured by the iraqis in lastminute attacks before 
the ceasefire took effect 
velayati said that before the peace talks begin again 
arrangements should be made so that these talks result in the 
full and speedy execution of the security council resolution 
including its first clause that is the return of troops to the 
international boundary 
un security council resolution 598 which both nations have 
agreed to calls on iran and iraq to halt all military activities 
and honor the truce withdraw troops to prewar borders exchange 
about 100000 prisoners of war and start peace talks 
iran insists troop withdrawals must be the next stage in the 
peace process but iraq says it will not pull out its troops from 
the 259 square miles of occupied territory until iran gives up the 
right to search ships in the gulf for iraqbound war cargo 
the iranian news agency said eliasson earlier inspected the 
southern war front with deputy foreign minister mohammad javad 
lavasani 
it said the un envoy was taken to an area where iran said the 
iraqis captured several hundred iranians after the aug 20 
ceasefire and also was shown three burning oil wells that iran 
claimed were set ablaze by iraq

cabinet nominee jack kemp told congress on 
friday that easing the appalling problem of homelessness would 
be his highest priority as secretary of housing and urban 
development 
kemps senate confirmation hearing was filled with bipartisan 
praise for the secretarydesignate but was interrupted by a brief 
protest demonstration by housing activists 
kemp a former congressman from new york and a 1988 republican 
presidential candidate pledged to be an advocate for increased 
federal efforts on housing for the poor 
he avoided committing himself on most specific spending 
questions but said the bush administration would revise former 
president reagans proposal for the housing and urban development 
departments spending in fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 
he promised to seek full funding of legislation passed by 
congress to provide emergency shelter for the homeless called the 
mckinney act and said he favored expanding it in some areas 
i acknowledge that it is a very severe problem it is an 
appalling problem kemp said of homelessness 
it is an emergency problem and im willing to treat it as the 
highest priority immediately of my new leadership at hud kemp 
said 
kemp said he visited privately with leaders of miamis riottorn 
overtown and liberty city areas last weekend when in that city for 
the super bowl he said if confirmed he planned to visit blighted 
inner cities and to visit homeless people in new york city and 
elsewhere 
the senate banking committee took no vote on kemps nomination 
but no opposition was voiced on the panel and he is expected to win 
confirmation easily a committee vote may come next week after kemp 
answers additional written questions 
his appearance was interrupted briefly by six demonstrators from 
the community for creative nonviolence a washington advocate for 
the homeless two stood up holding a large sign saying housing 
now while they and others shouted and turned on a noisemaking 
machine 
there are people sleeping on the streets right now and you are 
directly responsible for it one woman shouted 
the four women and two men were taken from the hearing room by 
capitol police and security personnel they were arrested and 
charged with disrupting a committee of the congress and 
demonstrating within a capitol building charges that carry a 
maximum 500 fine and sixmonth jail term 
i wish theyd stayed and heard my remarks kemp said of the 
protesters 
kemp is a conservative republican who has allied himself with 
liberal democrats on some urban issues but also voted against major 
housing legislation as a member of congress he said he said he 
would transcend all ideological differences to look for ways to 
help deal with urban problems 
asked by sen donald w riegle jr the committee chairman how 
he could improve housing and other problems within the constraints 
of the federal budget deficit kemp said theres going to be some 
give and take i am willing where necessary to fight for the full 
funding or to fight for increased funding or to fight for 
reordering priorities 
kemp said he would pursue programs aimed at allowing 
publichousing residents to buy their homes and would push for 
enactment of tax incentives for urban enterprise zones to encourage 
jobcreating businesses in distressed areas 
we need to unleash the power of free enterprise in our inner 
cities he said 
he repeated his support for expanded use of federal vouchers 
which provide rental subsidies directly to lowincome families but 
he acknowledged the nation faces a problem with a shortage in 
available affordable housing for low and moderate income people and 
said his goal would be to encourage tenant ownership without 
depleting the affordable subsidized housing stock 
housing programs have been among the hardesthit federal programs 
by budget cuts of the reagan administration years with spending for 
housing subsidies cut by more than 80 percent over eight years 
sen alan cranston dcalif called rising homelessness the 
most troublesome legacy of the reagan administration riegle said 
the lack of housing and other urban problems contribute to a lack 
of hope and the beginnings of a kind of civil anarchy in cities 
reflecting the bipartisan support for kemp cranston praised 
kemps appointment and said you have the energy and abilities that 
are sorely needed to bring new life to a department that has been 
severely weakened in recent years

stephanie trutt who is accused of planting the device in the 
parking lot of us surgical corp in norwalk conn on nov 11 
authorities said the bomb was not detonated 
the remotecontrolled nailpacked explosive device was delivered 
to trutt in november for 450 authorities said 
police and fbi agents arrested darrell benvenuto 20 and marc

president bush sought friday to reassure 
nervous savings and loan customers about the safety of their 
deposits as the debate heats up over how to pump more money into the 
governments sampl insurance fund 
the savings and loan deposits are backed by the full faith and 
credit of the government and they are sound they are good bush 
told reporters at the white house i want to assure the american 
people of that and thats not going to change 
bushs statement followed scattered reports that some sampl 
depositors had withdrawn their money after hearing news accounts 
that the bush administration is considering imposing a 25cent fee 
on every 100 in federally insured accounts in federally insured 
thrifts banks and credit unions 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee said in a statement in checking with regulators 
my staff was told that savings and loans are receiving a heavy run 
of calls from depositors who are confused and concerned about the 
reports of a new tax on their deposits in some areas there have 
been higher than expected withdrawals of funds 
at the news conference bush sidestepped questions about whether 
he will propose the deposit insurance fee an idea floated by the 
treasury department 
bush stressed that a deposit fee is only one option being 
examined not a formal proposal and has not yet reached his desk 
but he declined to rule it out 
there seems to be some controversy around it but that doesnt 
mean that any thinking along those lines should cease the 
president said 
asked whether the fee would violate his no new taxes pledge 
bush said ive been around for a long time i dont remember 
hearing people talk about the fee that went into the fdic or fslic 
deposit insurance funds as a tax 
meanwhile the agency regulating sampls the federal home loan bank 
board surveyed thrift institutions thursday night and found 
according to spokesman karl hoyle no outflows of any significance 
that we can attribute to anything thats been said 
m danny wall bank board chairman said in an interview thursday 
that although no institutions are in trouble as a result of nervous 
depositors there have been cases where they say i dont like 
what i heard on tv im taking my money out 
rep charles schumer dny a member of the house banking 
committee and frequent critic of the bank board said there is no 
doubt that congress and the administration will insure every 
depositor up to 100000 no matter what else happens i dont know 
of a single congressman or senator or regulator who has even 
entertained the notion of not backing the insured deposits 100 
percent 
the bank board reported earlier this month that a record 7 
billion in net withdrawals were made from savings and loan accounts 
in november the seventh consecutive month of deposit drains 
however it said this is a normal development during a period of 
rising interest rates and not necessarily attributable to customers 
concerns over the safety of their money when interest rates rise 
money flows out of sampl and bank accounts because yields on uninsured 
investments such as money market mutual funds typically rise 
faster 
the treasury department is due to present a proposal to bush on 
sampls next week and department officials have been briefing members 
of congress on some of the options under consideration in addition 
to a deposit fee 
rep stan parris rva a senior member of the banking 
committee said treasury is talking about borrowing about 45 
billion roughly the amount needed over and above the 38 billion 
committed last year and is examining the full range of options for 
how to pay it off 
the laundry list includes using interest on federal reserve funds 
that is now paid into the general fund or tapping the retained 
earnings of the industryowned regional federal home loan banks 
options in the reform package that will accompany any new money 
include an administrative merger of the fund that insures commercial 
banks with the sampl fund as well as additional control by federal 
regulators over risky activities undertaken by statechartered sampls 
parris said

hundreds of established writers painters 
and other czechoslovaks in the arts publicly sided with human rights 
dissidents and urged the release of banned playwright vaclav havel 
emigre sources said 
they also urged authorities to open a dialogue immediately with 
burgeoning independent groups and with young people 
it was believed to be the first time so many establishment 
figures in czechoslovakia took sides publicly with dissidents of the 
charter 77 human rights movement that 1000member group monday 
urged communist authorities to open a dialogue with independent 
groups on political and social reform 
the appeal by 692 writers painters filmmakers actors and 
others came in a letter dated thursday to czechoslovak premier 
ladislav adamec two emigre sources said on condition of anonymity 
the signatories include oscarwinning film director jiri menzel 
actress jana brejchva and painter jan bauch the sources said 
the letter also said the signatories were disturbed and 
offended by how the official media reported on demonstrations last 
week in prague the sources said 
the emigre sources said the letter called for release of havel 
the countrys bestknown dissident and other activists detained 
with him on jan 16 
fifteen activists were arrested but only havel 58 and two 
others remain in custody all have been told they will face charges 
of hooliganism or disturbing public order government spokesman

crushed government reforms 
governments trade unions and artists in the west expressed 
outrage in 1979 when havel and five other dissidents were jailed 
after a twoday subversion trial

a 36 billion backlog of losses piled up by the 
farmers home administration is not adding to the federal budget 
deficit according to a report friday by the congressional research 
service 
although fmha loan losses are large the budget impact of these 
losses have already been recognized in scaleddown projections for 
future loan repayments the report said the writeoff of these 
delinquent loans per se does not require a budget outlay hence the 
deficit is not affected 
the report said a recent audit by the general accounting office 
another agency of congress showed that fmha over a 40year period 
through 1987 had as much as 36 billion in accumulated deficits that 
will require large sums of congressional funding 
this led some observers to conclude that fmha will likely fuel 
the federal budget deficit by requiring an infusion of cash similar 
to the plight of the savings and loan crisis the report said 
the fmha funds its accumulated losses by borrowing directly from 
the treasury each year the report said the agency asks congress 
for reimbursement of losses that were incurred two years earlier 
for example the budget requests for the 1990 fiscal year that will 
begin oct 1 will be for fiscal 1988 losses 
to date fmha has been reimbursed by annual congressional 
appropriations for virtually all of the 39 billion in loan 
writeoffs that it has recognized through fiscal 1989 the report 
said fmha estimates that nearly 20 billion in loan loss 
reimbursement requests will be submitted over the next several 
years 
the report said that while it may be inaccurate to compare fmha 
losses to the savings and loan situation the magnitude of fmhas 
loan repayment problems should not be diminished 
but it added most budget projections already take into account 
that the most seriously delinquent fmha loans will not be repaid 
therefore unless there were another downturn in the farm economy or 
other economic shock that caused a further deterioration in the 
repayment capacity of fmha borrowers future outlays and the federal 
deficit should not be further affected by loan repayment problems 
the report which was dated jan 18 was written by agricultural 
policy analyst ralph chite of the congressional research services 
food and agriculture section 
as an agency of the agriculture department the fmha is often 
called the governments lender of last resort for farmers who cannot 
qualify for credit elsewhere as of last sept 30 the agency had 
total loans outstanding of about 62 billion 
less than half of the total about 255 billion was owned under 
farm lending programs the balance was for fmha loans for rural 
housing and rural development 
of the total 62 billion in loans about 92 billion were 
delinquent as of last sept 30 the farm delinquencies represented 
83 billion of that amount the fmha has sent collection notices to 
thousands of delinquent borrowers telling them to make arrangements 
with the agency for repayments or face the possibility of forced 
sales or foreclosures

the man who gave the university of notre 
dame a sweater worn by football legend george gipp says he is 
stunned the university gave it away even to ronald reagan 
belatedly i now regret not stipulating that the gipp monogram 
would be on loan said john n cackley in an opinion column in 
fridays south bend tribune 
i never dreamed that someone at notre dame would go to the 
extreme of satisfying egos in the white house and at the university 
just to create an atmosphere of good oldfashioned show biz 
said cackley a 1937 graduate and executive director emeritus of the 
alumni association 
university president edward malloy presented the blue and gold 
notre dame sweater to reagan when the national champion notre dame 
football team visited the white house on jan 18 two days before 
reagan left office 
reagan played the dying gipp in the 1940 movie knute rockne 
allamerican his first big break in the movies he has used as a 
political slogan rocknes instruction to his players to win one 
for the gipper 
cackley of south bend said the 70yearold sweater was an 
authentic irreplaceable oneofakind item that had been 
displayed only six months near the athletic department offices 
tradition so often cherished at this institution was shunted 
aside with the gipp article being handed over to the old actor for 
his notre dame collection he said 
charles lennon director of the notre dame alumni association 
said at least 15 alumni called to praise the idea 
most of our alumni would certainly understand the gift has 
strong meanings for the president as well as to the university 
he said 
cackley said the dying gipp gave the sweater to roommate percy 
wilcox who later passed it to another classmate tom lee lee gave 
the sweater to cackley who kept the sweater about five years before 
giving it to notre dame 
the sweater was not intended to be a giveaway regardless of 
who might like to have it whether that be ronald reagan jimmy 
carter john paul ii or anyone else he said 
university spokesman richard conklin referred questions to james 
e murphy associate vice president for university relations who 
was out of town friday

president bush said friday he would keep us 
talks going with the palestine liberation organization but was 
skeptical about direct overtures to chairman yasser arafat 
in contrast to the warm reception the barnstorming palestinian 
leader is receiving on a supportseeking tour of western europe the 
president was reserved 
i havent given any thought at all to a meeting of the 
chairman mr arafat with an american official bush said at a 
news conference 
us talks with the plo were opened last month by thenpresident 
reagan the us ambassador to tunisia robert pelletreau was 
designated as the only official channel to the organization some of 
whose factions the state department has charged with terrorism 
bush said he would wait to see how we go forward before 
considering a highlevel meeting 
he acknowledged us policy in the middle east had changed with 
the overture to the plo he said as long as the organization stayed 
committed to arafats renunication of terrorism and acceptance of 
israels right to exist we will have when appropriate meetings 
with the plo 
but asked if he would direct secretary of state james a baker 
iii to meet with arafat or another highlevel official bush took a 
cautious stance 
i would wait to see how we go forward bush said the point 
of talking to them is to try to facilitate peace in the middle east 
if there are some logical steps that require highlevel signoffs 
by various participants over there then and then only would it be 
proper to elevate the meetings to that level 
bush added we are just starting you crawl before you 
walk 
the president did not say what specific steps he required the plo 
to take before he would consider such a highlevel meeting

the head of the us commission on civil rights 
said friday he hopes the panel will receive more attention from 
president bush than it did during the reagan administration 
chairman william b allen said he hadnt heard directly from bush 
about any plans to elevate the stature of the commission or to boost 
spending 
however allen said i would certainly urge it upon the 
president to give greater attention to the commission on civil 
rights 
asked how he would describe bushs position on civil rights 
issues allen said i would not purport to speak on behalf of the 
president i think that hes capable of doing that himself 
i will say to you however that it seems to me mr bush has 
made it clear that he wishes to chart his own course he wishes to 
form his own reputation and i believe we owe him the opportunity to 
do just that he said 
allen spoke at a forum sponsored by the cato institute a 
conservative think tank 
in statements and meetings with black leaders bush has tried to 
separate himself from the poor relationship that minority groups had 
with the reagan administration in which he served as vice president 
for eight years 
during his news conference friday the president was asked about 
the supreme courts affirmative action decision earlier this week 
that drew criticism from many civil rights leaders 
bush told reporters the decision didnt kill all setasides and 
it didnt kill off affirmative action i have been committed to 
affirmative action 
he also said he wants to see reinvigorated programs by the office 
of minority business and the small business administration 
allen in an interview sought to distance himself from the 
criticism of the affirmative action ruling voiced by other civil 
rights leaders 
this ruling has a good deal more than has met the eyes of the 
first people who looked at it he said it is not in the first 
place an overturning of affirmative action quite the opposite it 
is a fairly emphatic reaffirmation of affirmative action as a remedy 
available to congress 
in the second place it is a statement that states and 
municipalities may indeed also use racial preferences but they are 
required to do so only subject to strict scrutiny they must be able 
to prove either that they themselves were involved in 
discrimination or that others subject to their jurisdiction were 
practicing discrimination allen said

newspapers and politicians friday said a 
proposed ditch along the mexicous border near san diego is 
designed to deter immigrants and is an unacceptable offensive and 
hostile action by the united states 
the foreign ministry said it was told the 5footdeep 
14footwide ditch was to solve drainage problems on otay mesa 
along the border not to control migration 
us associate attorney general francis a keating ii said the 
main purpose of the ditch is to discourage drug smugglers from 
driving across the border the area also is one of the most popular 
crossing points for illegal immigrants entering the united states 
the projects engineering and drainage aspects are not what 
bothers mexico the government newspaper el nacional said friday 
what causes uneasiness in mexico is what it symbolizes the 
aftertaste of a certain spirit of lack of understanding and 
intolerance as a material obstacle to make the entrance more 
difficult for men and women who in the end are only searching 
for work in a foreign land and frequently suffer bad treatment and 
even aggression as a result of the atmosphere of hostility it 
said 
the newspaper excelsior said the idea of digging a ditch in a 
certain part of the border between mexico and the united states can 
only be described as unacceptable and worrisome since it signals a 
new wave of unilateral measures to deal with the problem of 
undocumented mexicans going to the united states 
el universal another major independent newspaper noted that 
president bush just a few days ago talked of the importance of 
improving relations with us neighbors 
these affirmations contrast with negative and unfriendly 
attitudes such as that hostile project which certainly has nothing 
to contribute to resolving problems and in contrast will increase 
the differences el universal said 
in tijuana roberto l martinez president of the local prolaw 
and justice coalition said the ditch was a waste of money 
what is needed is to pay attention to the social problems that 
provoke the migratory movement and create wellpaid jobs that allow 
those people to stay in their places of origin he said 
no physical obstacle will be able to stop the migratory flow to 
the united states said ofelia woo of the colegio de la frontera 
norte a tijuana think tank the social problem that migration 
represents needs a bilateral solution from mexico and the united 
states 
guadalupe gomez maganda president of the foreign relations 
commission of the chamber of deputies and a member of the governing 
institutional revolutionary party also attacked the plan 
the us government project constitutes an unfriendly and to a 
certain degree hostile attitude that restricts the possibilities for 
resolving together the problems of neighboring communities the 
congresswoman said 
from the point of view of international relations you can 
consider it offensive said sen porfirio munoz ledo leader of 
the leftist national democratic front

egypt and israel failed to reach an agreement on 
a disputed beach resort in a second round of talks ending friday 
representatives of both sides said 
egyptian officials announced this week they planned to declare 
sovereignty over the red sea resort on sunday 
but israeli foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said friday that 
egypt apparently would tone down its original declaration and simply 
announce sunday that egypts tourism ministry is authorized to 
handle talks on purchase of tabas israeliowned luxury hotel 
israel says it wants more talks on ownership of the hotel and an 
israeliowned resort village on the 250acre strip it says it also 
wants more talks on ensuring access for israeli tourists 
liel said the two sides discussed the issues but scheduled no new 
talks 
nabil arabi head of the egyptian delegation said after the end 
of talks friday we did not reach any agreement and were going 
to report that back to our government 
egyptian negotiators have argued that egypt won sovereignty when 
a panel of international arbitrators determined the location of a 
series of border markers sept 29 
but the israelis argue that the arbitrators did not say how the 
border should run from the last marker to the sea about 200 yards 
away if the border is extended in a straight line taba falls in 
egyptian territory if it cuts back at a sharp angle the resort 
would be on israeli land 
taba has been disputed since israel refused to hand it back to 
egypt in 1982 israel withdrew from the rest of the sinai peninsula 
at that time under terms of the israeliegyptian peace treaty 
israel captured the sinai in the 1967 middle east war

president bush asserted friday that iran could 
influence the release of us hostages in lebanon and such a step 
could help revive usiranian ties 
i dont want to think that the status quo has to go on 
forever bush said of the defunct relationship between the two 
countries 
speaking at a white house news conference bush said there 
was a period of time when we had excellent relations with iran 
at one pont bush said he wanted to make a broad appeal 
transcending iran to anybody that can be helpful to get the 
hostages out 
bush was queried about comments from irans president ali 
khamenei who criticized him for saying in his inaugural address 
that bush would appreciate help in gaining the release of the nine 
americans held hostage in lebanon 
it was america which expressed interest in resuming ties with 
iran iran does not need america tehran radio quoted khamenei as 
saying 
bush said he was unaware of the remarks 
but stopping short of listing specific conditions for a renewal 
of the diplomatic relations that were severed in early 1980 bush 
said iran could make progress with the united states through the 
renunciation of terror in any form and facilitating to the degree 
they can the release of the hostages 
bush when queried said iran was not holding the hostages 
adding that different groups were involved in their fate 
but to the question of whether iran exercised control over them 
bush said the united states has varying degrees of intelligence on 
that various assessments as to how much control they have over 
hezbollah or these families or whoever it is 
hezbollah is a proiranian moslem fundamentalist group that 
operates in lebanon where the hostages are believed to be held 
i would just reiterate my view that the way to improve 
relations is to let them go give these people their freedom they 
didnt do anything wrong bush said 
asked if iran could affect the hostages release he responded 
i think they can have influence 
ties between the united states and iran were severed soon after 
the 1979 islamic revolution when militant iranian students took 
over the us embassy in tehran and held 52 americans hostage for 
444 days 
fifteen foreigners including the nine americans are believed 
held hostage in west beirut by proiranian factions 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16

federal prosecutors dropped conspiracy and fraud 
charges against lyndon h larouche jr on friday moments before a 
virginia judge sentenced the political extremist to 15 years in 
prison for related offenses 
all charges against larouche and six associates were dropped the 
justice department refused to drop charges against three 
codefendants who are fugitives 
the boston case in which larouche was accused of conspiring to 
obstruct an investigation of an alleged 2 million credit card and 
loan fraud ended in a mistrial in may after five months of 
testimony a new trial was to begin feb 22 
larouche was sentenced in alexandria va to 15 years in prison 
for scheming to defraud federal tax collectors and deliberately 
failing to repay more than 30 million in loans from political 
supporters 
assistant us attorney john markham said the justice department 
felt dismissal was warranted because the major participants in the 
boston crimes have now received substantial sentences either in 
boston or in alexandria 
it was the boston prosecuting effort which led to the evidence 
which allowed the indictment and convictions in alexandria and i 
think justice was served by the substantial sentences received 
said markham who handled both cases 
additional effort would be a waste of the courts time and 
resources weve got nothing more to gain 
larouche who has run for president four times is known for is 
extreme views including support for a quarantine of aids victims 
and allegations that queen elizabeth is involved in drug trafficking 
larouche six aides and five political organizations were charged 
with conspiring to obstruct a grand jury investigation into 
allegations that his 1984 presidential campaign raised more than 2 
million by credit card and loan fraud 
larouche was accused of ordering supporters to destroy records 
and refuse to cooperate with investigators all the aides and 
organizations also are charged with conspiracy and four of the 
groups are charged with fraud 
us district judge robert e keeton declared a mistrial after 
four jurors complained about the length and conduct of the case 
which was repeatedly delayed by defense motions

a federal appeals court cleared the way friday 
for the partial merger of detroits two daily newspapers under an 
exemption to antitrust laws granted by thenattorney general edwin 
meese iii 
a split panel of the us circuit court of appeals here upheld 
meeses decision to allow the detroit free press and the detroit 
news to form a joint operating agreement under the newspaper 
preservation act 
circuit judge laurence silberman writing for the 21 majority 
rejected arguments that meese had arbitrarily overruled an 
administrative law judges findings that the two newspapers did not 
qualify for the antitrust exemption 
silberman said meeses decision was based on a permissible 
construction of the 1970 law empowering the attorney general to 
let two newspapers form joint operating agreements after determining 
that one of the dailies was in probable danger of financial 
failure 
congress delegated to the attorney general not to us the 
delicate and troubling responsibility of putting content into the 
ambiguous phrase probable danger of financial failure the 
appeals court ruling said 
we cannot say that his interpretation of that phrase was 
unreasonable silberman wrote in an opinion joined by circuit 
judge spottswood w robinso the same period were unprofitably solely 
because the two dailies had cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to 
force each other out of business 
knightridder has threatened to close the free press if the joint 
operating agreement is not approved 
this is clearly good news for the future of the free press 
good news for our readers and the people of michigan free press 
publisher and chairman david lawrence said in a statement my hope 
is that this decision will allow us to go forward soon lawrence 
said 
there was no immediate comment from gannett co inc which owns 
the news 
in a separate order issued after the opinion the circuit court 
vacated a stay that prevented the merger from taking place while the 
issue was under review the ruling upheld a decision in september by 
us district judge george revercomb who refused to enjoin the 
merger 
meese approved the merger even though an administrative law judge 
and the head of the justice departments antitrust division 
separately concluded that the free press did not qualify for the joa 
status 
the administrative law judge held that once a joa were denied 
the news would raise its prices allowing the free press to follow 
suit and return to financial solvency 
opponents seized on this conflict within the justice department 
but silberman rejected their argument saying meese did not want 
to play the highstakes regulatory game that the law judge had 
proposed 
he obviously was concerned that if he gambled on the law 
judges prediction that both newspapers were bluffing detroit 
would lose a newspaper wrote silberman 
both men relied upon the very same facts to make different 
evaluations of the competitive strength of the free press 
silberman acknowledged but it is only the attorney generals 
conclusions that have legal significance and we cannot say that his 
determination is unreasonable

education secretary lauro cavazos told congress 
on friday that president bush is reworking next years proposed 
budget to incorporate education programs he espoused during the 
campaign but was mum on whether bush would seek more money 
cavazos testifying at a senate labor committee hearing said a 
high bush education priority would be targeting federal education 
money to disadvantaged kids and he said bush is eager to prove his 
campaign promise to be known as the education president 
but under questioning from sen edward m kennedy dmass who 
called the hearing to discuss the role of the nations schools in 
training future workers cavazos was not specific about whether bush 
would recommend spending more on education in the next fiscal year 
than the nearly 22 billion proposed by former president reagan in 
his farewell budget 
cavazos said he is working with the white house to shape that 
budget many of the things that the president talked about 
during the campaign hopefully will be reflected in that budget 
bush is expected to submit budget amendments to congress next month 
among the bush education priorities is encouraging school 
districts to allow parents to choose the school their children 
attend a move cavazos said would result in competition that would 
expose poor schools 
if it is not of high quality it should not remain open the 
secretary said in his first appearance before the 101st congress in 
an unusual move applauded by kennedy cavazos the first witness 
stayed to listen to other witnesses 
kennedy opened the hearing by saying that when adjusted to 
account for inflation federal education spending was below its 1980 
level he borrowed bush campaign rhetoric in suggesting bush could 
prove his commitment by proposing an increase in education spending 
with a new administration perhaps we can fund education as if 
our future depends on it because it does said kennedy dmass 
chairman of the committee the road to a kinder gentler nation 
begins at the schoolhouse

in an apparent change of heart president bush 
said friday he would not use the term cold war to describe 
relations between washington and moscow he used exactly those words 
seven months ago 
i want to try to avoid words like cold war if i can because 
that has an implication bush said at a white house news 
conference if someone says cold war to me that doesnt 
properly give credit to the advances that have taken place in this 
relationship 
so i wouldnt use that term but if its used in the context of 
do we still have problems are there still uncertainties are we 
still unsure of in our predictions on soviet intentions id have 
to say yes we should be cautious 
in a speech june 29 in san francisco before the world affairs 
council a foreign policy group bush said 
weve got to remember the cold war is not over we must be bold 
enough to seize the opportunity of change but at the same time as 
one pundit titled his column be prepared for the protracted 
conflict

barely a week into his new job president bush 
proved himself deft at his first fullblown white house news 
conference making his points while keeping things light with an 
easygoing style 
laughter was frequent as bush occasionally bantering with 
reporters showed the relaxed and upbeat demeanor he has maintained 
since his election 
although press secretary marlin fitzwater had said the conference 
would run 15 or 20 minutes noting that bush had a cold and a raspy 
voice the president stood before the white house press corps for 43 
minutes 
i sound worse than i feel bush said as he stepped to the 
podium 
the session seemed to mark a departure from the pattern of bushs 
predecessor president reagan whose news conferences were few and 
far between in his first week bush held an eightminute 
questionandanswer session with reporters in the oval office the 
day after his inauguration was interviewed for 12 minutes by two 
reporters on behalf of the entire press corps and then conducted the 
lengthy news conference 
at one point bush looked down at a digital watch on the podium 
and laughingly counted down the seconds saying this thing is 
buzzing away up here and suggesting he had to wrap things up 
he then proceeded to take several more questions 
at another juncture following an answer he gave on third world 
debt bush admitted im not sure i got to the substance of your 
question there and offered the reporter a chance to ask it again 
the news conference at 11 am est friday came as a surprise 
true to bushs admitted efforts to keep the press corps off guard 
it was announced by the white house press office on 15 minutes 
notice causing a scramble by camera crews reporters and 
photographers to set up in the room where fitzwater conducts his 
daily briefings 
at one point bush interrupted the flow to ask about the customary 
practice of allowing followup questions by reporters after the 
president answers their first one 
he brought it up as a reporter sought a follow up a minimumwage 
question 
wait let me ask you to stop the proceedings bush said 
what would be the fair and noble way to handle followup 
questions as we do these things would it be good to have them or 
not have them bush asked 
reporters said followups are needed when the president doesnt 
fully answer a question 
you mean my first answer is less than precise bush said to 
chuckles 
gesturing to reporters lined up along the side of the room he 
noted that with the seated reporters getting two questions the 
standees have gotten no time at all 
likewise he said referring to people sitting toward the back 
near dallas morning news bureau chief carl leubsdorf he said those 
in the leubsdorf area there are untested on the question 
the followups became something of a running joke when a 
reporter shouted out a request to follow up on another persons 
question on usiran relations bush exclaimed in mock indignation 
no you dont get to follow his question 
a question about whether the president should limit pay raises 
for his own staff if congress approves a federal pay raise also 
produced a light moment 
bush looked meaningfully over at senior staff members standing to 
the side of the podium 
fitzwater turning red said laughingly its a trick question 
sir 
bush did not flinch when asked a question that might have seemed 
strange to many tv viewers 
did you find the note in your underwear drawer a reporter 
asked as part of a question on how his first week in the white house 
had gone a week earlier bush had indicated president reagan who 
left him a written message in his oval office desk might also have 
left a note in the bedroom bureau 
no note in the underwear and its been a good easy week 
bush replied

in quantico va of law enforcement agents from around the country 
in hopes of clearing up unsolved murders believed to have been 
committed by ted bundy 
terry green an fbi major case specialist declined to say how 
many would be invited to the meeting designed to answer a lot of 
questions that have come up about whether bundy may have been 
involved in their particular cases 
the meeting will take place within three weeks if the schedules 
of various investigators allow it green said 
its easier to answer if everybody is in one place so we can 
discuss the peculiarities in each case he said 
in the days before his execution bundy 42 confessed to 23 
murders including three in washington to which he had not been 
linked investigators believe he may have committed as many as 100 
slayings beginning in 1969 
bundy has been linked to murders solved and unsolved in oregon 
idaho utah colorado florida vermont new jersey and pennsylvania 
green works in the fbis violent criminal apprehension office in 
quantico va a clearinghouse for unsolved homicides we collect 
reports and put investigators in touch with each other so they can 
have joint investigations he said 
he confirmed that robert keppel an investigator for the 
washington state attorney generals office who tracked bundy for 
more than a decade was invited 
bundy was executed tuesday at florida state prison for the 1978 
rapemurder of 12yearold kimberly leach of lake city fla he was 
also sentenced to die for the 1978 murders of two sorority sisters 
at florida state university 
bundy pursued young women and girls many of whom had dark hair 
parted in the middle prosecutors said he preyed on their sympathy 
often gaining their confidence by using crutches or an arm sling and 
asking them to carry things for him

a federal appeals court on friday revived a 
lawsuit by mayor marion barry jr in which he alleged that joseph e 
digenova at the time the us attorney for the district of 
columbia leaked to the media testimony from grand jury probes into 
possible corruption in barrys administration 
barrys original suit in which he sought to bar digenova from 
any further leaks to reporters was dismissed by us district court 
judge aubrey robinson in 1987 after robinson ruled that barry had 
failed to provide his contentions 
federal law stipulates that an attorney for the government 
shall not disclose matters occurring before the grand jury 
on friday however judge harry t edwards of the court of 
appeals for the district of columbia cited news stories quoting 
lawenforcement officials familiar with mayor barrys 
testimony and ruled that barry had compiled enough evidence to 
warrant granting him a hearing on the matter 
edwards said digenova and his associates must now respond 
because they are in the best position to know whether they are 
responsible for a violation of the rule barring grand jury leaks 
the former us attorney now in private practice said he would 
not comment without reading the opinion 
if during the course of the hearing digenova or other federal 
officials are found to have leaked grand jury testimony to the 
media they could face contempt of court charges edwards said 
however that it was uncertain whether the officials could face 
criminal or civil charges in connection with the matter

searchers used metal detectors friday to 
scour snowcovered sagebrush for the remains of a 15yearold girl 
whose grave ted bundy pinpointed 45 minutes before he died in the 
electric chair 
the search for sue curtis who vanished in 1975 from the brigham 
young university campus in provo was focused on three dirt roads 
about 10 miles southeast of the city of price said sheriffs chief 
deputy jerry cowan 
searchers used metal detectors because the victim wore braces and 
in case she was wearing jewelry 
the detectors picked up faint signals said joe ward a member of 
the search team but the frozen ground covered with 10 inches of 
snow was too hard to dig 
the search will continue until the remains are found but until 
the snow melts it is doubtful we will have any success said 
sheriff barry bryner 
ward also said he had remembered hunting in the area years ago 
possibly around the time of curtis disappearance and finding a 
bloody pair of womens underwear he said he didnt think much of it 
at the time but recalled it friday and led searchers to a spot 
about a quartermile from a dirt road 
in the days before his execution tuesday for the murder of a 
12yearold florida girl bundy confessed to at least 23 murders in 
utah idaho washington and colorado 
the fbi said friday that lawenforcement agents are being invited 
to a meeting in quantico va in of clearing up murders bundy is 
believe to have committed 
its easier to answer if everybody is in one place so we can 
discuss the peculiarities in each case said terry green an fbi 
major case specialist 
using a page torn from an atlas bundy directed investigators to 
look for curtis grave between price and green river about 200 
yards in on the dirt road and to the left maybe 50 yards 
d eleventhhour confession bundy also said 
he dumped another body into the colorado river identifying the 
victim as denise oliverson 24 who was last seen riding her bicycle 
in april 1975 near her home in grand junction colo 
sgt greg kuhn of the grand junction police department said that 
officials will listen to the tape and talk to the investigator who 
interviewed bundy police probably will decide monday whether to 
search for the body he said 
in idaho authorities said they do not have enough information to 
search for bodies in two killings bundy said he committed 
russ reneau the idaho investigator who interviewed bundy over 
the weekend in florida said bundy confessed to killing lynette 
culver 12 and throwing her body into a river but could not provide 
an exact location 
reneau said bundy also confessed that in 1974 he picked up a 
young woman at a freeway exit near boise killed her and threw the 
body into a river the victims identity is unknown 
meanwhile authorities in wayne county utah planned to scout a 
site 10 miles east of capital reef national park where bundy 
claimed to have buried the body of nancy wilcox 17 of holladay 
who disappeared oct 2 1974 
a rancher told authorities that in 1974 he saw a man in a suit 
standing along the road near the area bundy detailed and when he 
drove by the man turned his back 
the sheriff the rancher and a few deputies were to check the 
site and decide whether to mount a fullscale search said chief 
deputy leeon brinkerhoff 
bundy also said he buried the body of debi kent who vanished in 
1974 from a bountiful utah high school parking lot between 
fairview and mayfield bountiful police chief larry higgins said his 
officers would visit the area saturday 
during an interview with a utah detective last weekend bundy 
mentioned eight killings in utah but authorities have been able to 
link him to only five in the mid1970s when he was a university of 
utah law student 
the curtis girl had left a mormon youth conference at the 
churchowned school to walk to her dormitory room june 28 1975 and 
never was seen again 
there were absolutely no leads as to where she was at 
university police chief robert kelshaw said friday 
in the hour before his death bundy apparently requested a tape 
recorder and a map from the florida state prison warden as he waited 
in the ready cell 30 feet from the electric chair and described 
the curtis slaying 
thats a typical pattern of bundy unpredictable said salt 
lake county sheriff pete hayward something struck a note in him 
i guess 
cowan said the girls parents live in wellington four miles from 
the search area and were just as upset as when it first 
happened

solidarity leaders and top government 
officials on friday agreed to meet feb 6 for talks to address 
political and economic freedom and the future of the banned 
independent union 
i am satisfied and very tired i made hours of overtime 
solidarity leader lech walesa told reporters waiting outside the 
roman catholic episcopate where walesa is staying 
a joint communique announcing the date of the talks was carried 
by the staterun news agency pap 
the meeting discussed the problems of trade union pluralism 
including solidarity and other problems which will be the subject 
of the roundtable talks the communique said 
it said a preliminary decision to set up three working teams for 
economic and social policy political reforms and union pluralism 
had been taken 
participants also agreed to set up committees to deal with 
agriculture mining reform of law and the courts associations 
selfgovernment mass media and youth the communique said 
walesa and a group of other solidarity leaders and senior 
advisers returned to the episcopate by bus after holding nearly 12 
hours of talks with government officials 
they conferred in a secluded house in the woods of magdalenka a 
warsaw suburb to lay the groundwork for the more elaborate 
negotiations on such topics as political and economic freedom and 
union pluralism 
the last category will address the future of solidarity which 
walesa founded at the lenin shipyard in gdansk during the labor 
turmoil of august 1980 
at first the communist authorities accepted solidarity as the 
first free trade union in the soviet bloc but then suppressed and 
outlawed it after martial law was imposed in 1981 walesa who won 
the 1983 nobel peace prize still works as an electrician at the 
shipyard 
among those attending with walesa were bishop tadeusz goclowski 
of gdansk zbigniew bujak leader of the former solidarity 
underground mieczyslaw gil solidarity chairman at the nowa huta 
steel mill in krakow and wladyslaw frasyniuk a solidarity leader 
from wroclaw in the southwest 
also in the group were three of walesas closest advisers 
catholic journalist tadeusz mazowiecki historian bronislaw geremek 
and lawyer andrzej stelmachowski 
the government did not identify its delegates but national 
solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said they included interior 
minister gen czeslaw kiszczak politburo member stanislaw ciosek 
and the deputy chief of official trade unions romuald sosnowski 
foreign ministry spokesman stefan staniszewski said thursday the 
main negotiations with opposition groups should begin in the next 
few days in response to a question he called feb 5 very 
probable but then said that was a sunday and feb 6 was more 
likely 
jacek moskwa a spokesman for the opposition said its 
headquarters would be in space the warsaw university administration 
offered to a committee of activists walesa formed in january 
walesa traveled to warsaw by train thursday and met with senior 
advisers but no details were released solidarity said he would 
hold a news conference saturday 
gen wojciech jaruzelskis government made the offer of talks 
with the opposition during strikes in august that were the worst in 
poland since martial law crushed solidarity 
walesa has traveled to warsaw four times for talks with senior 
government officials after the last meeting nov 19 he said he 
would not agree to the larger negotiations until a political 
decision was made to legalize the union 
the communist party central committee made a dramatic policy 
reversal on the matter last week approving a proposal that more 
than one legal trade union be permitted and opposition groups be 
allowed to participate in government organizations 
at a meeting sunday in gdansk the solidarity leadership agreed 
to negotiate with the government on legalizing the union

president bush said friday secretary of state 
james a baker iii would advance bold new initiatives in 
foreign policy 
at a ceremonial swearingin in the east room of the white house 
bush praised his longtime friend and fellow texan saying hes 
savvy hes sensitive hes tough 
before an audience of about 200 persons including congressional 
leaders and family members baker took the oath of office 
administered by chief justice william rehnquist 
actually the ceremony was just for show baker actually was 
sworn in wednesday night in a short ceremony at the state department 
following his senate confirmation 
presiding at that ceremony was deputy executive white house clerk 
daniel j marks 
bush called fridays ceremony a very special occasion for me 
citing a friendship with baker that began in houston in the 1960s 
i have great confidence in him and judging from the way he 
sailed through the confirmation process the united states senate 
shares that confidence he said 
he said baker would be my principal foreign policy adviser 
in brief remarks bush recalled his pledge in his inaugural for a 
new engagement 
nowhere is the need for new engagement greater than in foreign 
policy he said the world demands new strategies and new 
solutions 
saying that totalitarian forces still threaten to undermine the 
will of the people bush said we must keep democracy on the 
march 
this is the time for america to reach out and take the lead 
not merely react he said describing bakers role as leading 
coming up with bold new initiatives 
baker noting he and bush had come a long distance together 
said the more he learns about the job the more humble i become 
were entering a new era of international relations one thats 
filled with more than its share of promise and perhaps more than its 
share of perils as well baker said 
baker who served as chief of staff and treasury secretary in the 
reagan administration joked that from experience he knows that 
after the swearingin comes the swearing at 
he also said he hoped he and bush would do better as a 
foreignpolicy team than we did on the tennis courts in texas

the state department said friday a fourmile 
ditch being planned along the usmexican border near san diego 
could keep out about 80 percent of vehicles crossing illegally into 
the united states in that area 
spokesman charles redman said illegal crossings in that area 
east of san ysidro calif have led to hot pursuits accidents 
one accidental death and serious injuries to undocumented aliens 
he said the border patrol has observed as many as 369 entries a 
month in the area and that the ditch could prevent about 300 such 
crossings 
redman added that the ditch would also resolve problems caused by 
drainage from new developments on the us side 
he drew laughter from reporters when he said the name of the plan 
is dual purpose border security enhancement project and drainage 
ditch 
the plan is currently undergoing environmental impact 
assessment he added 
in mexico the foreign ministry said thursday it had been told 
the ditch was designed to carry drainage not to deter unauthorized 
vehicles 
the mexican government was not told the purpose of this 
construction could be to control migration or anything else of that 
nature a government statement said 
redman said the mexican government had been kept apprised of the 
dual purpose of the project through the us immigration and 
naturalization service asked about objections by the mexican 
government he said we have kept the mexican government 
informed

calling it unfriendly and saying it would not stop the flow of 
illegal immigrants

employers are discriminating against 
foreignlooking job seekers at an alarmingly high level and 
many businesses dont understand the 1986 immigration changes 10 
congressmen said friday 
the lawmakers based their complaints on a study by the general 
accounting office that found 16 percent of employers surveyed 
admitted to engaging in discriminatory hiring practices such as 
asking only foreignlooking people for work authorization 
documents and hiring only us citizens 
the gao an investigating arm of congress estimated this means 
as many as 528000 employers nationwide are engaging in unfair 
employment practices the congressmen said in a letter to attorney 
general dick thornburgh 
the study also found that 22 percent of 42 million employers in 
the gao survey population were not aware of the sanctions against 
knowingly hiring undocumented workers and of those who were aware 
of the law 20 percent did not understand its major provisions 
there seems to be a strong relationship between lack of 
information on employer sanctions and discriminatory behavior the 
congressmen said 
while the 1986 immigration reform law bars employers from hiring 
undocumented workers it makes it against the law for employers to 
discriminate against eligible job seekers 
we are especially concerned about the gaos claim that its 
findings do not show a pattern of discrimination the 
congressmen told thornburgh this interpretation in our view is 
less important than the reports clear evidence that discrimination 
is occurring at an alarmingly high level this is an unacceptable 
situation 
signing the letter were democratic reps albert bustamante of 
texas esteban torres ronald dellums edward roybal mervyn 
dymally robert matsui norman mineta and matthew martinez of 
california and edolphus towns and robert garcia of new york 
also signing were democrats jaime fuster puerto ricos 
congressional resident commissioner and ron de lugo congressional 
delegate from the virgin islands

arthur marshall whose benign humor endeared him to 
an audience of millions in half a lifetime of radio and tv 
broadcasts died friday at the age of 78 the british broadcasting 
corp said 
marshalls very english style with its joy in the humor of words 
and the eccentricities of people made him a household name 
he died in his sleep after a long fight against cancer at his 
home in the south devon village of christow near exeter south of 
london the bbc said 
marshall was also a journalist contributing to the new statesman 
magazine for 46 years until what he called the discontinuance of 
his whimsical jottings in 1981 
in 1978 he joined the popular bbctv word game call my bluff 
where he and other panelists tried to fool each other with fake 
definitions of obscure words 
his round bespectacled face smiled mischievously from millions 
of television sets around the country each week 
his wit and gentility had enormous appeal bbc official james 
moir said friday 
program host robert robinson called him rotund and cherubic 
one of the most likeable men i have ever met 
fellow panelist frank muir said he was an extraordinary man 
extremely intelligent with that old english tradition of polite 
sentimental humor his was the true alternative comedy in an era 
of television humor which has become aggressive impertinent and 
fairly offensive 
marshall reared in southwest london attended the respected 
oundle school and returned there as a teacher of french and german 
from 193154 except for the war years when he worked in 
intelligence 
his classroom experiences formed the basis of much of his humor 
and he found early success with sketches impersonating elderly 
schoolmistresses 
after his first broadcast in 1934 he made records and later 
introduced new characters called nurse dugdale and miss pringle 
his wrote humorous essays reviews and an autobiography called 
lifes rich pageant 
he never married 
robinson spoke of marshalls stoicism about his illness 
he had his hip replaced that was followed by two heart 
attacks then the cancer from which he died but the only thing he 
said which was anything remotely selfpitying was it is not to be 
recommended

a federal appeals court says the army 
corps of engineers may install a controversial type of turbine at a 
hydroelectric dam but cant use the equipment until an environmental 
lawsuit is settled 
in a decision issued in richmond va on tuesday the court gave 
the corps the goahead to proceed with construction on the 572 
million project on the richard russell dam 
but the court left intact a lowercourt injunction against 
testing or using the turbines once they are installed 
the dam is on the savannah river on the georgiasouth carolina 
border roughly 75 northwest of augusta ga 
the ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the south carolina 
wildlife department the national wildlife federation and the 
federations south carolina and georgia affiliates 
they had sought to keep the pumpstorage turbines out of the 
dam altogether arguing that the devices which send water that 
flows through them back over a dam to generate additional 
electricity can cause widespread fish kills 
in may us district judge falcon hawkins issued an injunction 
blocking both installation and use of the turbines until a 
supplemental environmental impact statement is completed the corps 
appealed the injunction 
but the threemember appeals panel said installation alone will 
cause no environmental damage 
jim parker spokesman for the army corps savannah district said 
the agency is pleased to be able to move forward with the 
installation he said the corps believes it will be able to 
operate the turbines without hurting the environment 
ellison smith attorney for the environmentalists said the order 
means the court still has review power over the project 
the corps can do everything but turn them on and test them 
he said 
parker said corps officials will meet next week to get a better 
idea of when the project originally scheduled for completion next 
year might be finished and how much the delay has cost

savings and loans are on alert for withdrawals by 
jittery customers fearing a tax on deposits to help bail out the 
thrift industry and a top regulator said thursday the proposal is 
scaring depositors away 
a spot check of dallas savings and loans depositors on friday 
suggested that most customers would wait and see if the proposed fee 
was adopted before taking any action but many people had questions 
about the idea 
judy rollerson a metropolitan savings teller said several 
customers mentioned the proposal but none said they would close 
their accounts 
they dont think it will really happen she said theyre 
just talking about how preposterous it really is 
sampl officials have been watching for reaction since the bush 
administration hinted that one way to finance a bailout of troubled 
thrifts would be to charge sampl bank and credit union customers 25 
cents on every 100 they had deposited 
the measure would require congressional approval 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board said 
thursday that the proposal was making savings and loan depositors 
nervous and had led some to withdraw their money 
since wednesday wall said there have been cases where they 
say i dont like what i heard on tv im taking my money out 
depositors reaction to the proposal had not put any savings and 
loans in jeopardy he said 
financial industry officials in dallas and their customers said 
there have been few account closings as a result of the deposit tax 
trial balloon 
weve had a few questions to it said ruth lack spokeswoman 
for first gibraltar fsb in houston we have not had any action on 
it most of our depositors realize that this is nothing more than a 
trial at this point 
george barclay president of the federal home loan bank of 
dallas said publicity about the proposal caused no measurable 
increase in withdrawals because consumers are confident the 
government will uphold the safety of their deposits 
some customers said they probably would withdraw their money if 
the deposit fee was implemented but several customers said they had 
not heard about the proposal 
one dallas man promptly withdrew his money from sunbelt savings 
after hearing of the fee proposal said account representative tim 
palla 
he came in with a smile on his face and said i cant handle 
this any more it isnt you people its the government palla 
said 
palla said that was the only withdrawal he knew of other 
customers have called with questions about the proposed fee he said

police have raided 50 homes as 
they hunt for a prominent leftist extremist who led an assault on an 
infantry base that left 38 people dead officials said friday 
the government said it believes mondays attack was led by 
enrique gorriaran merlo who claimed he took part in the sept 17 
1980 assassination of deposed nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza 
his participation is presumed taking into account his former 
guerrilla activity his training and the connection he had in recent 
times with leftist groups said attorney general andres 
dalessio 
gorriaran merlo 47 is a former leader of the peoples 
revolutionary army leftist group that battled argentinas army in 
open combat in the 1970s the guerrilla army was decimated 
gorriaran merlo has been wanted by argentine police for years 
president raul alfonsin ordered his prosecution shortly after taking 
office five years ago but the guerrilla was thought to have fled 
the country 
on monday about 60 heavily armed civilian commandos burst onto 
and briefly controlled the 3rd infantry regiment at la tablada on 
the outskirts of buenos aires hundreds of soldiers routed the band 
after a 27hour battle in which 28 guerrillas were killed and 18 
captured ten police and soldiers also died 
we know that in this attack more people participated than were 
killed or arrested dalessio said acknowledging public concerns 
that the group might strike again he added 
we know that an armed group that suffers a public defeat of 
this size in general sees it as necessary to do something to 
demonstrate its still in condition to keep operating 
alfonsin blamed the attack on leftist subversives basing the 
charge in part on the identification of bodies of those arrested as 
former members of the peoples revolutionary army 
two of the 17 men and three women who were captured monday and 
tuesday have been released dalessio said and two others have been 
jailed as a result of the raids 
police said they raided 50 homes since the attack and intend to 
seek information and evidence in at least 100 other homes 
weapons were seized at some of the homes dalessio said at 
least a dozen people picked up for questioning have been released 
arrest warrants have been issued for five people including 
gorriaran merlo dalessio said he would not identify the other 
four

state officials have fired the only 
paid chaplain at a juvenile detention center in westfield saying 
the state can no longer afford to pay him 4920 pay for a onehour 
weekly counseling session 
its not the 4920 but the shabby treatment of the chaplaincy 
that bothers me the rev benjamin lockhart a 71yearold retired 
minister who served the lockup for 27 years said friday 
we are engaged in a serious piece of business and it kind of 
makes you wonder what people think is important when they will pay a 
painter but not a clergyman he said 
george ashwell a division of youth services administrator in 
springfield who oversees the westfield center said lockhart who 
puts in about an hour a week was the only contract employee let go 
at the detention center because of cuts in consultant budget 
accounts ordered by gov michael s dukakis 
the cuts are part of a package of measures proposed by dukakis to 
help the state meet a 600 million shortfall in the current fiscal 
years 112 billion budget 
i do not feel that the general public wants the budget to be 
balanced on the backs of the chaplains lockhart said in a letter 
to center officials the governor and state legislators westfield 
detention center which deals with troubled youth needs more not 
less chaplaincy service 
ashwell said that one other protestant clergyman has served as a 
volunteer at the westfield center and lay members of other church 
groups have also visited the youths 
the detention center houses 24 juveniles facing criminal charges 
elizabeth dowd a spokeswoman for youth services commissioner 
edward j loughran said friday that because of the states fiscal 
crisis the department had to eliminate a number of managerial and 
other employees 
we felt that since lockhart only spent an hour a week at the 
facility and the services were covered by other volunteers we could 
eliminate that contract dowd said 
she said that she did not know how many employees had been fired 
but she believed chaplains for at least two other institutions were 
also let go 
lockhart agreed that the session he spends with troubled youths 
lasts only about an hour but said he was angry that they sent me 
a letter on saturday telling me not to show up on sunday 
he charged that when he went to the youth home last sunday as a 
volunteer he was barred from entering which ashwell denied 
after formal protestant and catholic services were discontinued 
at the youth center some time ago lockhart said he instead met 
weekly with from four to eight youths 
we would talk about various things out of the bible he said 
you try to bring hope to them turn them around these people have 
fouled up their lives and they need someone to help them get back 
but if you are on the outside you cant do that 
lockhart served as minister of a baptist church in agawam for 
many years and prior to his retirement he was protestant chaplain 
at the hampden county jail for 30 years

the energy department denied friday it is 
considering lowering a safety standard to make it easier to restart 
a south carolina nuclear reactor that produces a scarce gas needed 
to make nuclear warheads 
gary pitchford a department spokesman at the savannah river 
plant near aiken sc said some in the department have 
supported the idea of changing the safety standard but not as a 
means of speeding the reactor restart 
pitchford stressed that other persons in the department opposed 
the change in safety standards and the idea is not being considered 
in connection with a savannah river restart he and other officials 
said the idea has been studied for several years both at savannah 
river and in the commercial nuclear industry 
there is no consideration being given to changing the safety 
standard for the restart of the k reactor pitchford said in a 
telephone interview the k reactor was shut down last spring to 
make repairs and to retrain operators 
the new york times in its friday editions reported that the 
chairman of a nuclear safety advisory panel had told a senate 
committee the energy department was considering relaxing the safety 
standard in order to speed the reopening of reactors at savannah 
river which is the nations only source of tritium 
tritium is a perishable gas that is critical to the production of 
nuclear warheads savannah river has been unable to produce tritium 
since last spring and the energy department has said the plant may 
not be reopened before years end 
the plant is operated under energy department contract by ei du 
pont de nemours amp co 
the times quoted john ahearne as saying the departments office 
at savannah river was trying very hard to make the case that the 
current definition of the worst possible reactor accident a 
complete break in a cooling pipe was unrealistic ahearne was 
reported to have said department officials proposed that the minimum 
safety standard be based on the danger posed by a leak in the pipe 
rather than a full break 
the leakbeforebreak standard if applied at savannah river 
would make it easier for du pont and westinghouse electric corp 
which takes over as operator april 1 to get energy department 
approval for a reactor restart plan 
in a telephone interview on friday however ahearne said he had 
told the senate panel that du pont officials not the energy 
department were pushing for adoption of the leakbeforebreak 
safety standard he also said he had not asserted that the du pont 
plan was aimed at speeding up the reactor restart 
ahearne said department safety officials were very very 
skeptical of the idea 
clif webb a du pont spokesman at savannah river said friday 
that the company had been studying the leakbeforebreak 
question for a few years but had not yet reached an official 
corporate position on whether it should be applied at savannah river 
webb also denied that the study was aimed at speeding up the 
reactor reopening 
ahearne chairman of the energy departments advisory committee 
on nuclear facility safety said his panel last december had 
reviewed du ponts scientific work and concluded it was a long 
way from justifying the lower safety standard

japan on friday criticized us defense 
secretarydesignate john towers call for more pressure on tokyo to 
increase its military spending and said the country is doing its 
share to bolster its defense 
towers remarks during senate confirmation hearings virtually 
guaranteed that the issue of japans share of the burden for its 
defense will come up during prime minister noboru takeshitas 
washington visit next week 
usjapan defense arrangements have been a pillar of japans 
security and we have been making efforts toward our defense under 
this framework and such a policy has been widely trusted by the 
people defense agency director general kichiro tazawa told 
reporters 
tazawa said towers comment that japan could greatly increase its 
defense spending despite its constitution which restricts its 
military to defensive capabilities reflected a lack of 
understanding of the japanese perspective 
i regret that mr tower went so far as to refer to our 
constitution to push us to expand our defense spending tazawa 
said 
a senior foreign ministry official said there was no need for 
takeshita to apologize for japans defense spending given its 
recent efforts to increase its military and overseas development 
assistance budgets 
the governments proposal for the new budget has a remarkable 
59 percent increase in the defense budget and 78 percent for 
foreign aid we are doing very fine in our own view said yukio 
okamoto director of the foreign ministrys first north american 
division 
washington has urged japan to do more for its own defense 
especially to improve its ability to defend crucial sealanes but 
military spending is controversial here the japanese constitution 
adopted in 1946 during the us occupation renounces war and 
forbids the use of force in settling international disputes 
in confirmation hearings in the senate armed services committee 
on wednesday tower said the decision to inflict a constitution that 
severely restrained japan from building a substantial military force 
during the us occupation was a lousy idea 
but i dont believe that constitution is so restraining that 
they couldnt devote a substantially larger percentage of spending 
to their defense tower said 
japan has been steadily building up its armed forces in recent 
years the government this week approved a budget for fiscal 1989 
that includes 305 billion for defense spending the budget must be 
passed by parliament 
the new budget raises tokyos share of the cost of keeping 55000 
us troops in japan to 111 billion about 75 percent of the total 
cost 
its economic assistance to developing countries is likely to 
exceed 11 billion making it the worlds largest donor of foreign 
aid 
by 1990 japans defense spending which is increasing more than 
5 percent annually will exceed that of most of the european allies 
a pentagon official said recently 
the proposed 1989 defense budget amounts to slightly more than 1 
percent of japans gross national product the united states devotes 
about 6 percent to military spending and the european allies 3 
percent to 4 percent 
he said the usjapan summit next week was intended mainly to 
allow bush and takeshita to develop closer relations and discuss 
global issues he said takeshita did not expect to discuss specific 
issues with bush 
we think there is a full understanding of our policy by the 
us government okamoto said we will continue to point to our 
record of success in this field

trans world airlines is liable for civil damages 
to 3000 former flight attendants who were replaced when they went 
on strike in 1986 a federal judge has ruled 
were ecstatic plaintiffs attorney robert balfour said 
friday 
us district judge ilana rovner set the stage for a hearing on 
damages with her ruling thursday no date for the hearing was set 
but balfour said attorneys for both sides would meet with ms rovner 
on wednesday 
the telephone went unanswered at the airlines corporate offices 
in mount cisco ny after business hours and no spokesmen were 
available at twas st louis office 
the flight attendants 1986 classaction lawsuit seeks 80 
million from the airline contending twa hindered their efforts to 
find work with other carriers during and after a 1986 strike 
the lawsuit sought both compensatory and punitive damages but 
the judge denied the request to seek a punitive award balfour said 
however he called 80 million still a realistic figure 
more than 5700 members of new yorkbased independent federation 
of flight attendants struck twa on feb 13 1986 and were told 
their jobs would be filled by others 
under the airline deregulation act of 1978 furloughed or fired 
workers with at least four years experience must be given 
preference over newcomers by other carriers the law required twa to 
give the striking attendants letters certifying they had such 
experience and were eligible for first consideration by other 
airlines 
the flight attendants lawsuit contends twa refused to issue such 
letters to strikers on grounds the move would jeopardize their jobs 
at twa it says the airline also refused to advise the attendants 
they were eligible for preferential hiring 
twa maintained that stance when the strike was over the lawsuit 
says 
when no contract agreement had been reached with twa by may 17 
1986 the union made an unconditional offer to return to work but 
just 197 of the strikers got their jobs back 
nearly 1300 attendants crossed picket lines according to court 
records others found jobs at other airlines or left the industry 
while the flight attendants union was not involved in the court 
action officials were pleased with ms rovners ruling union 
spokeswoman joan wages said friday from new york

the army on friday ordered its fleet of ch47d 
chinook helicopters temporarily grounded for the onetime 
installation of safety equipment that service officials say will 
help protect flight control tubes against fire 
the grounding is the third in the last two months for the chinook 
the army said the safety of flight message ordering the 
grounding stemmed from a continuing review of accidents involving 
the twinrotor chopper over the past year 
in two of those accidents that resulted in loss of life a fire 
was able to spread from the rear of the aircraft to the front along 
a hollow tunnel that runs the length of the fuselage carrying 
aluminum control tubes 
the control tubes provide the linkage between the flight controls 
in the cockpit and the helicopters two rotor blades 
the service is now ordering its mechanics with the assistance of 
teams from prime contractor boeing co to install a fiberglass 
fire protection sleeve around the control tubes 
the goal according to an army spokesman is to make sure the 
control tubes remain intact long enough in case of fire for a pilot 
to land the chopper 
this doesnt eliminate the possibility of fire but we think 
this can improve crew survivability said lt col john reitz the 
spokesman 
reitz in discussing fridays action disclosed the service had 
issued an earlier grounding order jan 10 that instructed mechanics 
to make sure a special fireretardant paint had been applied to the 
control tubes 
all but 21 of the armys 240 ch47ds remain grounded for 
inspections under that earlier order the spokesman said 
were being cautious at this point and weve decided to add 
this extra margin of safety he continued and we decided to do 
it now since the helicopters are already down 
reitz said the army expected the work to take 30 days or less 
for the entire fleet 
the army initially grounded its chinook fleet dec 23 after 
receiving a special advisory from boeing in that case the army 
ordered an inspection to determine whether all of the transmissions 
had been properly assembled during production 
that grounding ended jan 3 with the army reporting it had not 
found any faulty transmissions 
ten ch47ds have been involved in accidents since 1985 and 16 
soldiers were killed in incidents involving the helicopter in 1988 
last feb 25 11 soldiers were killed in a chinook crash near 
chico texas and in the most recent accident five servicemen were 
killed in a crash in honduras on dec 8 
in both the chico and honduras accidents the helicopters crew 
had to deal with an onboard fire apparently caused by different 
problems in both cases however the fire spread from the rear of 
the aircraft to the front along the control tube tunnel reitz said 
while the evidence is not conclusive it appears both pilots may 
have lost control of their helicopters before hitting the ground he 
continued 
it was that finding that prompted the jan 10 grounding to ensure 
the control tubes had been painted with fire retardant paint and 
which is now prompting the order to install the nylon sleeves the 
spokesman said 
the chinook is a twinengine twinrotor helicopter that the army 
classifies as its medium lift aircraft it can carry a payload 
of 16000 pounds or ferry 33 soldiers into combat 
the first ch47d entered army service in 1979 replacing older 
ch47 models the army is gradually replacing another 146 older 
chinooks with the d model which has more powerful engines and 
transmissions fiberglass rotor blades and advanced flight control 
systems

a congressman after touring the scene of miamis 
three nights of riots promised friday to turn around the legacy 
of broken promises to the area and help secure federal funds 
the injustice here is so profound that everyone in america 
knows theres something very wrong here said us rep john 
conyers dmichigan 
conyers chairman of the government operations committee and a 
member of the judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional 
rights said he was on a quest for justice 
there are too many triggerhappy policemen abusing the rights 
of black people in this area said conyers who was invited to 
miami by raymond fauntroy head of the local southern christian 
leadership conference chapter 
conyers said he would help coordinate relief for predominantly 
black overtown where the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by 
a hispanic police officer a week ago triggered three days of 
burning looting and violence 
the unrest spilled over into the liberty city area and left one 
dead 11 wounded by gunfire and about 1 million damage to buildings 
overtown has been shorted conyers said the question is 
how did it happen and what we can do 
earlier the congressman met with miami mayor xavier suarez who 
called conyers a foremost expert on the issue of race relations 
conyers also met with about 125 residents at a meeting held on 
the same block where the riots broke out 
he said at the meeting that federal aid promised by the carter 
administration after the 1980 riots which were sparked by the 
beating death of a black motorcyclist by police officers was cut by 
the reagan administration 
for example he said of 40 million in loans promised for small 
business owners 16 million was sent he said of 10 million for 
lowincome housing 2 million was sent 
at the meeting patricia lloyd sister of the slain motorcyclist 
said said the officer who shot her brother clement should face a 
charge more serious than manslaughter id like to see him charged 
with murder she said 
patrolman william lozano is free on 10000 bond charged with 
two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of lloyd 23 and allan 
blanchard 24 his passenger who died of injuries in an ensuing 
crash 
clement was shot in cold blood she said but prosecutors 
have said the shooting did not meet legal thresholds for first or 
seconddegree murder charges 
a police union leader said at the meeting more black officers 
should be patrolling the citys predominantly black neighborhoods 
black people in the community are demanding it said officer 
sam harlan president of the miami community police benevolent 
association 
eighteen percent of the officers in the miami police department 
are black anglos account for 39 percent and hispanics 43 percent 
city officials say the composition of the force meets federal 
affirmative action guidelines and reflects miamis population

the us government is talking about formally 
improving communications with angola and may establish and may 
establish a small mission in luanda state department spokesman 
charles redman said friday 
redman stressed the office would lack diplomatic status and would 
be limited to attempts to bring peace to southwestern africa 
redman was responding to reports that the two nations had started 
talks about creating lowlevel missions in washington and luanda 
we have discussed with them how such an improvement in 
communication might be achieved and we would expect these 
discussions to continue redman said 
however theres been no change in our policy of 
nonrecognition and no diplomatic relations with the angolan 
government and there is no plan to change that policy he noted 
he was asked whether that would rule out interest sections a 
level of diplomatic relations below embassies 
it would rule out anything at the socalled diplomatic 
level said redman the kind of thing that you are referring to 
is a possible idea which has been that you might have a couple of 
americans on the ground to help monitor the implementation of the 
peace accords 
redman said american and angolan authorities had for many 
years had bilateral contacts in the context of the southwestern 
african peace process those contacts will continue especially 
within the framework of the joint commission whose first session 
took place in new york this week 
he was referring to the commission established in connection with 
south african agreement to grant independence to namibia or 
southwest africa in exchange for a cuban troop withdrawal from 
neighboring angola 
us participation in the joint commission and our overall 
interest in monitoring compliance by all parties with the new york 
accords point to the need for improved communication between the 
us and the angolan regime redman said 
he said the united states is standing by its two conditions for 
establishing diplomatic relations with leftistcontrolled angola 
cuban troop withdrawal and national reconciliation the latter 
phrase is diplomatic shorthand for the us position seeking a 
settlement between the angolan government and usbacked unita 
guerrillas 
the authorities in luanda obviously have it in their power to 
address both these issues in ways that could lead to positive 
evolution of relations with the united states redman said 
those are the essential factors that would affect the future 
evolution of contacts between the us and luanda

fatigued metal in a bolt cracked causing an 
engine to fall off a piedmont airlines jet minutes after takeoff 
last week federal investigators concluded thursday 
the fracture of a back bolt put the front two bolts under stress 
and caused their eventual fracture said james kolstad acting 
chairman of the national transportation safety board 
his conclusion came in a letter to t allan mcartor 
administrator of the federal aviation administration 
there are several ways it fatigue could have happened said 
william bruce who is heading the ntsb investigation what caused 
the fatigue is what were looking for 
bruce said the investigation which typically takes nine months 
is continuing 
the right engine tore away from the boeing 737 jet as piedmont 
airlines flight 1480 left ohare international airport on friday 
the engine fell in a field at the airport 
the control tower told the pilot to return to ohare but tapes 
released this week showed the pilot never fully realized the problem 
until the plane was back on the ground minutes later none of the 27 
passengers or six crew members were injured 
the incident was the second of its kind involving a boeing 
737200 series jet in the last 13 months 
last january the government ordered airlines to inspect 
enginemount bolts on boeing 737200 series aircraft after an engine 
fell off a usair flight shortly after takeoff from philadelphia 
no one was hurt in that incident and the engine landed in an open 
field 
the boeing 737200 series jet has two engines one mounted under 
each wing and secured to the wing at the front by two bolts and at 
the back by a single bolt

yasser arafat said friday the plo has 
contacted president bush and asked him and his administration to 
change us policy in the middle east 
the chairman of the palestine liberation organization at his 
first meeting with representatives of the european economic 
community earlier met with three european foreign ministers and 
discussed ways to promote an international peace conference on the 
middle east 
arafat has traveled to stockholm vienna athens and helsinki on 
a campaign to portray the plo as a moderate organization working 
through diplomatic channels for the establishment of an independent 
palestinian state 
he told a news conference the plo made contact with bush after 
his jan 20 inauguration and that it asked his administration to 
turn over a new leaf on middle east policy 
the united states agreed in december to meet with the plo after 
arafat recognized israel and renounced terrorism 
arafat speaking in a mixture of arabic and english with spanish 
translation said the us ambassador to tunisia robert pelletreau 
and a plo representative in tunis have had permanent contacts 
since their first meeting dec 16 he would not say how many 
contacts they had or when the next meeting would take place 
arafat blamed former president reagans ational council the plos 
parliamentinexile declared an independent palestinian state in 
the israelioccupied lands 
arafat reportedly put out feelers on eec recognition for the 
state during the meeting with fernandez ordonez french foreign 
minister roland dumas and greek foreign minister carolos papoulias 
but did not make a formal request 
ordonez sidestepped the question of eec recognition by saying it 
was a matter for member states to decide individually 
the israeli foreign ministry said friday it was gravely 
disappointed by the meeting israel has a policy of refusing to 
negotiate with the plo 
arafat was asked friday what he thought about municipal elections 
in the occupied territories he replied isnt one experience 
enough have you forgotten what happened the last time when some 
were assassinated and some had their legs blown off 
he said the plo would back internationally supervised elections 
when israel ends its occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
since an uprising by palestinians in the occupied territories 
began 13 months ago more than 360 palestinians and 15 israelis have 
been killed

defiantly declaring his innocence 
political cult leader lyndon h larouche jr was sentenced to 15 
years in prison friday for scheming to defraud the internal revenue 
service and deliberately defaulting on more than 30 million in 
loans from his supporters 
chief us district judge albert v bryan also imposed lesser 
prison terms and fines on six larouche aides who were convicted last 
month on 35 counts of mail fraud and conspiracy for their roles in 
the fundraising effort 
while bryan was handing down the sentences in alexandria 
government prosecutors dropped all charges in a related case against 
larouche six associates and five political organizations in us 
district court in boston 
that case involving charges that larouches 1984 presidential 
campaign had raised more than 2 million through credit card and 
loan fraud ended in a mistrial last may a new trial had been 
slated to begin feb 23 
in a petition filed in the boston court friday the us 
attorneys office said the criminal convictions against larouche and 
others on dec 16 had served the governments interests from the 
point of view of both deterrence and punishment and that further 
prosecution was not warranted 
while about 60 followers sang chanted and picketed outside the 
alexandria courthouse larouche told bryan in a presentencing appeal 
that he was the victim of a government campaign to eliminate me 
from the political scene 
but the judge scoffed at such claims by larouche a threetime 
fringe candidate for president and the other defendants i reject 
that as arrant nonsense bryan said 
undaunted larouche said the vital interests of the united 
states have been put in jeopardy by his trial and conviction and 
that it is time for this evil and reckless prosecution to be 
brought to a halt before further damage is done 
this is not a political case retorted us attorney kent 
robinson this was a case of theft 
robinson urged bryan to impose a harsh sentence or they just 
might do it again 
larouches 15year term and no fine was substantially less than 
the maximum possible penalty of 65 years in prison and fines 
totaling 325 million for his conviction on 13 counts of tax and 
mail fraud and conspiracy 
larouche and the six others were convicted of fraudulently 
soliciting more than 30 million in loans from supporters that they 
had no intention of repaying 
in addition larouche was found guilty of conspiring to defraud 
the irs by having all his personal expenses paid by various 
corporations he controlled and claiming he had no taxable income 
the government says larouche has not filed federal income tax 
returns for any year since 1978 
assistant us attorney john markham said larouche will serve at 
least five years before he is eligible for parole 
all seven defendants sentenced friday will appeal said larouche 
attorney odin anderson of boston he said larouches many powerful 
enemeies have had their day 
larouche is 66 and his lawyers said he suffers a degenerative 
eye condition larouche himself has predicted that he will be killed 
by other inmates if he goes to prison 
bryan also sentenced william wertz fundraising chief for 
larouche to five years imprisonment and an 11000 fine legal 
coordinator edward spannaus who complained of a 20year effort by 
the fbi and the department of justice to crush our philosophical 
association received a fiveyear term and a 10000 fine 
four larouche fundraisers sentenced friday were michael 
billington and dennis small who each were given threeyear terms 
and 8000 fines and joyce rubenstein and paul greenberg each 
sentenced to three years in prison and fined 6000 
us attorney henry hudson called it a very satisfying 
culmination to a very long journey but he added this will 
never repay all those victims who have been swindled out of millions 
of dollars over the years i feel sorry for those people 
larouche had no visible reaction when bryan imposed his sentence 
shortly after noon he and the other defendants all wearing 
handcuffs were led from the rear of the courthouse to a van which 
took them to the alexandria city jail for processing and assignment 
to a federal prison 
larouche did not speak to reporters but smiled and waved to a 
small knot of supporters from a grilled window of the van as it sped 
away 
larouche spokeswoman dana scanlon said demonstrators were 
mounting a roundtheclock vigil in lafayette park with a large 
lighted sign reading pardon larouche visible at the white house 
across the street 
in mexico city on friday about a dozen larouche supporters held 
a protest march in front of the monument of independence also known 
as the angel they carried signs that read larouche is innocent

look to your pawns and pieces human the 
30thranked chess player in the united states is a machine 
deep thought a computer put together by graduate students as a 
hobby kind of thing came out of nowhere to beat hitech the 
worlds toprated chessplaying program at a computer chess 
tournament in november 
certainly a year ago no one thought this was possible vince 
mccambridge an international master and spokesman for the us 
chess federation said friday 
it brings the specter of a computer world chess champion by the 
end of the century closer to reality said mccambridge who has 
played deep thought to a draw 
hitech the erstwhile champion was one of many formidable 
opponents deep thought beat at the association of computing 
machinery tournament in orlando fla winning its ranking as the 
30th best chess player human or mechanical in the united states 
until that november tournament hitech built by carnegie mellon 
university professor hans berliner had been the games best 
electronic player 
deep thought built by five carnegie mellon graduate students 
lacks the chess knowledge that berliner programmed into hitech but 
more than compensates by being almost six times faster at sorting 
through the myriad possibilities for moving pieces on the board 
its speed allows it to look more moves ahead in the game 
berliner was out of town and could not be reached for comment a 
university spokeswoman said 
by achieving a rating of 2551 under the us chess federation 
system deep thought also won the fredkin intermediate prize for 
becoming the first machine to surpass the 2500 barrier hitech ranks 
just above 2400 world champion gary kasparov of the soviet union 
by comparison ranks above 2800 
the 10000 prize money to be awarded in detroit in august will 
be shared among deep thoughts five creators led by computer 
science student fenghsiung hsu 
hsu who designed the silicon guts of the computer said he 
intends to replace the two microprocessors that power it with eight 
microprocessors to make deep thought even faster the machine can 
now analyze 700000 board positions per second compared to 120000 
for hitech hsu said 
now that the students have won the second of three prizes to be 
offered by by massachusetts institute of technology professor edward 
fredkin hsu has not ruled out a shot at the one remaining 
100000 to the first machine to beat the reigning international 
champion 
the first fredkin prize 5000 went to two bell labs scientists 
in 1981 for creating the first computer to achieve the status of 
chess master 
deep thought is all the more impressive because the five students 
lacked the financial backing of other artificial intelligence 
research programs mccambridge said 
there are a number of other programs at bell labs los alamos 
labs and the hitech project which are backed by enormous research 
money he said the deep thought project was really done as a 
hobby kind of thing by a few guys 
deep thought received 5000 from the defense department said 
team member thomas anatharaman the five students who also include 
michael browne murray campbell and andreas nowatzyk scraped 
together donated funds to travel to chess tournaments he said 
hitech in contrast got at least 20000 for components said 
cmu spokeswoman anne watzman 
of the five deep thought creators campbell is the best chess 
player holding expert status which is not strong at all said 
browne 
and the person who programmed it has difficulty keeping his 
moves on the board so deep thought was purely an engineering 
approach browne said 
at the software toolworks open in long beach calif in 
november the machine beat international masters jeremy silman and 
alex fishbein and played mccambridge to a draw 
its only defeat came against walter browne who holds the world 
chess federations highest rank grandmaster and is a sixtime us 
chess federation champion 
it was the most impressive achievement ever for a computer 
said mccambridge who for a time had an advantage in his game with 
deep thought 
i relaxed when i was winning he said it never gets tired 
and it never gives up

the fifth game of the world chess championship 
candidates quarterfinal between artur yusupov of the soviet union 
and canadian grandmaster kevin spraggett ended in a 32move draw 
friday 
the score stands tied at 2525 with only one game remaining 
yusupov playing white against a queens indian defense gained a 
small spatial advantage from the opening but failed to penetrate 
spraggetts rocksolid defenses 
canadian experts bouyed by their mans return to form after a 
loss and a lackluster draw in the third and fourth games said 
spraggett has chances to defeat the 28yearold prematch favorite 
and become the first north american since bobby fischer to reach the 
semifinal stage 
it may be in the sixth game it may be in the playoff but 
either way i think spraggett is going to win said brian 
nickoloff a canadian international master 
the winner of the candidates a series of knockout matches will 
challenge world champion garri kasparov for his world title in 1990 
if the sixth game scheduled for sunday with spraggett playing 
with the advantage of white is drawn two further games on tuesday 
and thursday will be played followed by sudden death tiebreakers at 
increasingly high speeds 
spraggett a 34yearold from montreal who is ranked only 35th in 
the world rose to prominence in the previous stage when he knocked 
out soviet grandmaster andrei sokolov in a hairraising time 
scramble in which each player was allowed only 15 minutes thinking 
time for the whole game 
british grandmaster jonathan speelman is the only player so far 
through to the semifinals 
if the spraggettyusupov match goes into extra time all three 
undecided contests will be in progress around the globe 
simultaneously 
the first game in the quarterfinal duel between former world 
champion anatoly karpov of the soviet union who is strongly 
favored and icelandic grandmaster johann hjartarson is scheduled 
for saturday in seattle 
in the fourth quarterfinal dutch grandmaster jan timman will 
face off against lajos portisch of hungary beginning wednesday

the director of what was billed in advance as 
chinas first sex movie says the censors knife has taken out 
all the sex scenes and viewers said friday they are not pleased 
it was boring one viewer said after watching widows 
village a 90minute tale of love constricted by unusual marriage 
taboos in a fishing village in the 1940s 
following what they believe to be their ancestors commands the 
villagers bar married couples from making love for three years and 
then only three times a year until they have a child 
the official china news service said last month on the movies 
opening day in the southern city of canton that widows village 
contained special scenes showing couples lovemaking and that it 
was being called chinas first sex movie it quoted the 
director wang jin as saying he hoped theaters would bar children 
when the movie reached beijing a week ago the advance publicity 
drew sellout audiences ticket scalpers outside the capital theater 
helped hype it its got naked people one leered 
not true the most daring scene shows a married couple from the 
head up panting as they lie in bed after having made love 
we can see more than that in videos a welldressed young 
woman said after viewing the movie the acting and storyline got 
just soso ratings from other viewers 
wang said in a telephone interview from the pearl river movie 
studio in canton that some scenes showing sex were cut before the 
movie was released for mainland use he said the scenes would be 
left in when it opens in nearby hong kong 
the ministry of radio film and television which censors all 
movies denied knowledge of any cuts and suggested wang may have 
hyped his movie to attract crowds 
the 47yearold director who won one of chinas top awards for a 
movie in 1986 said it wasnt hype 
i still think the film is improper for children he said 
china is preparing to set up a system of classifying movies 
and i want my movie to be the first to be declared unsuitable for 
children

the soviet union has broken mikhail gorbachevs 
pledge not to increase the number of nuclear weapons in the pacific 
and there are more spy ships in the hawaii area says the commander 
of the us pacific fleet 
adm david jeremiah said the soviets in recent months have added 
a new attack submarine to their pacific fleet in contradiction to a 
speech gorbachev made last september 
he quoted the soviet leader as saying the soviet union would not 
increase the number of any type of nuclear weapons in the pacific 
region 
aware of the asian and pacific countries concern the soviet 
union will not increase the amount of any nuclear weapons in the 
region it has already been practicing this for some time and is 
calling on the united states and other nuclear powers not to deploy 
them additionally in the region gorbachev said in the speech at 
krasnoyarsk according to the tass summary 
the new submarine raised the total of soviet deltaclass 
strategic subs in the pacific to 17 jeremiah said in a speech 
thursday during a changeofcommand ceremony at pearl harbor 
while those of us in senior military positions welcome this new 
era of openness with the kremlin we remain concerned about the 
disparity between what we hear from the soviets and what we actually 
see in the fleet he said 
he did not say how he knew of the new subs presence 
the number of farranging deployments by soviet warships has 
decreased since 1985 he said but the soviets have increased the

a lobbyist for bingo and racing interests 
has pleaded guilty to bribing a state legislator and related 
charges the first convictions in a 3yearold investigation of 
gamblingrelated industries 
wd donnie walker formerly the states chief bingo 
regulator pleaded guilty thursday in state court to bribing state 
sen randy mcnally to pass a bingorelated bill and attempting to 
bribe him to vote for another bill legalizing betting on horse races 
walker also pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy extortion and 
tax charges 
under a plea bargain in return for his cooperation with the 
investigation and his guilty pleas walker would face a maximum 
sentence of 10 years in prison and an unspecified fine he faced up 
to 28 years and a 600000 fine 
walker was the first person to be found guilty in the 
federalstate investigation dubbed rocky top after a popular 
tennessee song it began in 1986 with reports that bingo operators 
were paying state officials to ignore violations of laws regulating 
the industry 
it is a largescale investigation said us attorney john 
gill of chattanooga we do expect a significant number of 
indictments and its certainly possible that the investigation may 
go into 1990 
prosecutors said they are are looking into allegations that other 
legislators besides the one state senator were bribed but wouldnt 
give details 
in his state pleas walker admitted twice offering bribes to 
state sen mcnally who reported the offers to the tennessee bureau 
of investigation and was not charged 
in the attempted bribery case walker admitted offering mcnally 
10000 to vote for a bill to legalize parimutuel betting on horse 
racing when it moved to the senate floor in april 1987 the bill 
eventually passed by one vote mcnally voted against it and was not 
paid 
mcnally said walker occasionally boasted of payoffs he had made 
to other legislators but mcnally declined to identify those named 
by walker and said he had no other evidence other payoffs were made 
walker faces up to 10 years on the state bribery charges 
he also pleaded guilty thursday in chattanooga to filing a false 
1985 federal income tax return that omitted payoffs from bingo 
operators and to a conspiracy count that charged he knew of 
widespread illegal gambling operations 
also thursday walker pleaded guilty to an extortion charge in 
another federal court in nashville he was accused of accepting 
15000 from bingo operators in 1985 when he was chief bingo 
regulator in the secretary of states office 
bingo is exempt from state gambling law when operated for 
charity but the tennessean newspaper which has investigated the 
industry reported that only 26 million of the 1247 million 
raised by bingo operators in 198587 could be traced as having gone 
to charity 
no specific sentencing date was set in the chattanooga court but 
in nashville us district court judge john nixon set sentencing on 
that count for april 4 he said the hearing would probably be 
postponed to allow walker to testify before grand juries 
the probe includes the tennessee bureau of investigation the 
internal revenue service and the fbi

an organization founded by 
millionaires donald trump and george petty has announced it will sue 
the county in 30 days unless it acts to lessen the noise from palm 
beach international airport 
jets from the airport pass over posh palm beach and many west 
palm beach neighborhoods at low altitudes causing a deafening roar 
that residents say makes it impossible to carry on a conversation 
in an openair news conference interrupted periodically by jets 
screaming toward the east members of the good neighbor council for 
aircraft noise control said thursday that they had taken their first 
legal steps to try to force palm beach county and the airport to 
quiet down 
they also advocate banning stage 2 aircraft noisy older planes 
such as dc9s and boeing 727s 
trumps own private plane a boeing 727 might be banned from the 
airport should the guidelines proposed by the antinoise groups be 
enacted 
if that means mr trump has to get a new airplane hell bloody 
well have to get a new airplane said petty a canadianborn pulp 
and paper executive who lives a few houses away from trumps 
maralago estate in palm beach 
airport spokesman jerry allen said about 65 percent of the 
aircraft using the airport are of the quieter stage 3 type such 
as boeing 757s up from 25 percent in 1982 
at the antinoise news conference however such arguments would 
have fallen on deaf ears of the residents many of whom wore 
tshirts emblazoned with the command shhhhhh

more than 40 semiautomatic assault rifles 
including 13 from one woman have been turned over to police in a 
cashforrifles campaign in the aftermath of the stockton school 
massacre officials said friday 
the woman who bought the 13 ak47 rifles did it to get them off 
the shelves said city councilman nate holden whose idea started 
the campaign 
the woman who was not identified was reimbursed the 519180 
she spent holden said adding that he would honor her at a city 
council meeting she just wanted to recover her costs holden 
said can you believe it 
the departments official gun count stood at 42 but holden 
estimated upwards of 50 and a radio station that took up the 
cause put the number at 59 
its just rolling right along holden said describing a 
steady flow of people coming to his office with police receipts to 
claim money from a 50000 political committee fund the mayoral 
candidate set aside tuesday 
five people who collected we do not want to profiteer or benefit from 
their tragedy 
said jeffrey fox spokesman for five van nuys real estate office 
workers 
almost all the guns turned in have been ak47s said lt fred 
nixon a police department spokesman the first gun turned in 
tuesday was an uzi 
holden who will pay the value of the weapon up to 300 said 
most people will get the maximum but does not believe profit will 
become a motive 
they have a bad feeling about what happened at stockton 
holden said 
patrick purdy a young drifter used an ak47 on jan 17 to kill 
five students and wound 29 others and one teacher at cleveland 
elementary school in stockton a san joaquin valley community 
before he shot himself to death 
it was possible to make a profit from the campaigns people also 
could pick up 300 by taking a copy of the police receipt to radio 
station kiisfm in hollywood from thursday morning through friday 
morning 
the radio station reimbursed the woman who bought the 13 rifles 
300 per rifle holden then paid her the remainder or 129180 
the station would verify all the receipts before issuing checks 
but was concerned only with getting the weapons off the street and 
not whether anyone made any money said lynn andersonpowell 
president and general manager 
our purpose was to decrease the number of guns on the street 
we feel thats that many fewer lives that may be needlessly 
taken in violence she said 
the station offered 1000 to the first person to take advantage 
of the offer and the result was a threeway tie and because one 
person gave up two guns kiis awarded 4000 ms andersonpowell 
said 
compton gun shop owner mike virgilio said he sells the ak47 for 
30995 but has seen custom versions worth up to 1500 last year 
the regular model sold for 250 and a used one could cost just 200 
he said 
a semiautomatic uzi retails for 649 virgilio said 
the los angeles police department has supported the campaign 
against the militarystyle semiautomatic rifles favored by street 
gangs and helped publicize procedures for safely bringing the 
weapons to its stations 
police are examining all the guns to determine whether any have 
been involved in crimes all guns not retained as evidence will be 
destroyed

twentyeight federal prosecutors in massachusetts 
urged the resignation or removal of their boss the embattled us 
attorney frank l mcnamara jr in a letter friday to us attorney 
general richard thornburgh 
the letters signers are among the 39 assistant us attorneys in 
the boston and springfield offices under mcnamaras command 
mcnamara 41 a republican appointed by president reagan in 1987 
has been under fire since november when the justice department 
reported that his allegations that he saw his predecessor william 
f weld smoke marijuana at a party could not be substantiated 
mr mcnamaras conduct and performance while united states 
attorney is resulting in a loss of confidence in the administration 
of justice on the part of the courts the bar law enforcement 
agencies and the public the letter said 
mcnamamara did not return telephone calls to his office 
because mr mcnamara will neither resign nor step aside 
temporarily the credibility and operations of this office will 
continue to be damaged perhaps irretrievably unless he is 
removed the letter said 
mcnamara reportedly has been the subject of several federal 
probes 
citing anonymous sources the boston globe reported friday that 
the justice department is interested in whether any relationship 
between mcnamara and senate president william bulger may have 
affected a probe into real estate development in boston 
the boston herald also citing an unidentified source said 
mcnamaras staff did not tell him about the case because they were 
afraid he would use it to embarrass gov michael s dukakis during 
his democratic presidential campaign 
on thursday the globe reported that assessments by two federal 
agencies of mcnamaras performance have led thornburgh to conclude 
mcnamara should resign 
dukakis said friday the situation has been an embarrassment 
for months and months and months i dont think this appointment 
should ever have been made a day earlier dukakis said flatly i 
think he should be fired 
dukakis himself has been a target of mcnamara 
according to published reports mcnamara pressed an investigation 
into potential conflict of interest in the states purchase of land 
in new braintree for a state prison 
mcnamara allegedly continued pushing the investigation even after 
his staff told him there was no evidence to support allegations of 
conflict of interest 
us rep barney frank said if no action is forthcoming from the 
justice department then i think congressional hearings will be 
necessary

a powerful earthquake rated at 63 on the 
richter scale shook the remote komandorsky islands west of alaska 
on friday the national earthquake information center reported 
the quake which struck at 1235 am pst was centered in the 
the islands at the end of the aleutian chain which extends more 
than 900 miles from the tip of the alaskan peninsula separating the 
bering sea from the pacific ocean 
the center said there were no reports of damage because so few 
people live in the area 
the richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake as 
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph for every 
increase of one number from 55 to 65 for example the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
readings of 89 the highest on record were computed from 
seismographic records of a quake off the coast of ecuador in 1906 
and from a quake off the coast of japan in 1933 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which happened before the 
richter scale was in use was computed at 83 the quake and 
subsequent fire were blamed for 700 deaths

dutch legislators friday pardoned 
two nazi war criminals one of whom may have sent anne frank to the 
death camp and let them go home to their families in west germany 
franz fischer and ferdinand aus der fuenten were released after 
43 years in prison for their parts in the holocaust deaths of more 
than 10000 dutch jews 
the parliament vote to free fischer 87 and aus der fuenten 79 
ended two days of emotional debate opponents of the pardon said 
they should have stayed in jail for the rest of their lives 
fischer headed a local branch of the nazi security service and 
was held responsible for the deporting 13000 jews to death camps 
aus der fuenten was an ss administrator who oversaw mass roundups of 
jews in the netherlands 
we saw this coming but still it hit us very hard said 
prominent rabbi avraham soetendorp 
he said aus der fuenten may have been indirectly responsible 
for sending anne frank to a concentration camp the girl and her 
family lived in an amsterdam attic for two years before they were 
discovered and sent to concentration camps 
her poignant work the diary of anne frank perhaps the most 
famous personal document to come out of the holocaust was published 
in 1947 and was turned into a play and movie she died of pneumonia 
in 1945 at age 15 in germanys bergenbelsen concentration camp 
fischer and aus der fuenten were expelled from the netherlands 
and handed over to west german authorities hours after parliament 
approved the pardon according to the justice ministry 
witnesses outside the prison in southern breda city where they 
were held saw an ambulance and unmarked prison wagon drive away 
under police escort 
west germanys ard television network said the two arrived in the 
country late friday the tv showed two fraillooking grayhaired 
men step from an ambulance 
dutch newspapers have reported that relatives of the two men said 
they were planning to spend their old age quietly with their 
families 
west german president richard von weizsaecker praised the 
decision to pardon the men calling it a humanitarian act a 
government spokesman said they would be allowed to settle in west 
germany 
they are german and they have the right as germans to enter the 
country said government spokesman ulrich strempel 
aus der fuentens wife maria lives in an apartment in a gray 
building in a workingclass neighborhood in duisburg about 36 miles 
from the dutch border ute dehnen who lives across the street told 
the associated press ive never spoken to her as a matter of 
principle i would have divorced that man and i cant understand why 
any woman wouldnt 
her husband werner said i cant help but think of the 
victims families and the pain this man caused 
the dutch parliament approved the government decision by voting 
against a labor opposition motion to keep the two jailed the vote 
was 8555 
inneke haas berger a centerleft member of parliament and 
leading opponent of the release said time hasnt made things 
easier its just made the pain greater 
but justice minister frits korthals altes told lawmakers lets 
rid our society of the miserable remainder of the two war criminals 
lives 
they had become symbols of nazi evil and an unending source 
of sorrow and strife to victims of the war he said 
outside parliament several demonstrators waved placards one 
demanding dont make the victims suffer further never release 
the henchmen 
only 6000 of the 150000 jews who lived in holland before the 
war survived the nazi death camps 
fischer headed a local branch of the nazi security service and 
was held responsible for the deportating 13000 jews to death camps 
aus der fuenten was an ss administrator who oversaw mass roundups of 
jews in the netherlands 
fischer and aus der fuenten were sentenced to death in 1950 
their sentences later were commuted to life imprisonment 
it would have been better in cases like these if the death 
penalty had ultimately been executed said korhals altes 
premier ruud lubbers told reporters that the decision followed 
months of secret talks with former resistance figures and holocaust 
survivors 
most argued for their release lubbers said 
rabbi marvin hier head of the los angelesbased simon wiesenthal 
center wrote in a letter to lubbers it is unconscionable to 
release such notorious individuals who perpetrated heinous crimes 
and caused suffering to so many thousands 
the center is devoted to the search for nazi war criminals it is 
named after the famed nazi hunter

senate leaders were not far behind in negotiating a contingency 
plan to restrict outside income should the raise become law as 
expected on feb 8 a senate source said thursday 
both houses are expected to move hastily to restrict nonsalary

many buildings in earthquakeprone areas 
should be constructed atop rubber shock absorbers to protect office 
contents such as computers as well as human lives experts are 
telling major us corporations 
its not adequate anymore to just think about stopping building 
collapse says robert j kuntz president of the california 
engineering foundation a nonprofit education group that sponsored a 
twoday conference to make engineers aware of the shock absorbers 
youve got to protect the hundreds of millions of dollars of 
equipment inside these buildings and allow the enterprise to remain 
functional he said this goes beyond protecting life and limb 
kuntz and others urged companies in quakeprone areas nationwide 
to consider building new low and mediumrise buildings and even 
refurbishing old ones using seismic base isolation which 
involves placing large flexible shock absorbers between a building 
and its foundation

the latest brutal wave of school shootings is 
reviving concern about schoolyard security and debate over whether 
its possible to protect students from disturbed adults or fellow 
youngsters with easy access to weapons 
you would have to build a 10foot brick wall around all the 
elementary schools in the united states and theyd have to have 
barbed wire to prevent people from going up the brick wall and over 
the brick wall youd have to have roving guards and armed police at 
all times said thomas a shannon executive director of the 
national school boards association 
the real problem is not school security the real problem is 
the availability of weaponry 
the nation was jolted last week by the killing of five stockton 
calif elementary school students by a man wielding a 
semiautomatic assault rifle the latest incident of schoolyard 
violence occurred thursday at wilson high school in washington 
dc where four students were shot by a young man near the school

six political revues recently played in athens according to 
boxoffice figures they grossed up to 37500 a week twice as much 
as the most successful straight play in athens 
the socialists banned censorship when they came to power in 1981 
and the satirists say theyre not afraid of libel prosecution even 
for the bawdiest jokes about papandreou and liani 
i feel really free if i couldnt say the things i say i would 
suffocate said lazopoulos 31 who was acquitted in 1987 on 
charges of slandering greeces head of state president christos 
sartzetakis in one of his shows 
greeks have no other way to let steam off if they couldnt 
laugh at their problems they would explode 
according to theater critic eleni varopoulou the greek revues 
mix of satirical sketches monologues songs and dance is styled 
after french revue and german cabaret 
but the acidity of the satire is what characterizes the greek 
revue she said 
other favorite targets are ordinary peoples problems from 
family relations to the inadequate public health system introduced 
by the socialists 
lazopoulos also mocks the premiers sickbed television address 
to the greek people from london in which he appealed for sympathy 
saying i am fighting my own battle 
lazopoulos replies in his show what are you saying you fool 
battles are fought in greek hospitals 
at the kalouta theater where the the last pasokrats is 
playing actress anna vayena explains how the system really works 
in greece we only diagnose for therapy we have to go abroad 
she says 
then she addsandreas went to london because he didnt want to 
kick a dozen greek patients out of one hospital bed 
varopoulou said the harsh greek satire isnt aimed at making 
people think but at soothing and relieving them so that by 
understanding their problem they exorcise it 
the satirical revues used to be staged like ancient comedy or 
modern musicals with a glamorous chorusline expensive costumes 
and an allstar cast but the current trend is toward less glitz and 
more realism varopoulou said 
lazopoulos says he prefers the strippeddown staging but notes 
that the aristophanic tradition is still going strong 
i find we have the same attitude against authority as 
aristophanes we can never match his writing but we can try to match 
him in not being afraid to criticize he said

an international expedition plans to walk 483 miles 
across the ice to the north pole in an effort to dramatize the 
hazards they believe are threatening the arctic 
the team which includes members from canada the united states 
the soviet union britain japan australia and west germany hopes 
to set out on the 65day trip around march 1015 from cape columbia 
canadas northernmost point of land on the arctic ocean 
the american in the group is darryl roberts of the bronx ny 
everyone has to understand that this is no walk in the park 
said peter baird the canadian liaison for the icewalk expedition 
this is a lifethreatening project 
the expedition is led by robert swan the british explorer who 
walked to the south pole with two other men in 1986 a successful 
completion of the northern trip would make him the first on record 
to walk to both poles 
baird is an administrator and will not be among the eightmember 
team that walks to the north pole his ottawa company the conexus 
research group served as the managers for the canadiansoviet ski 
expedition that crossed the arctic ice cap last year to widespread 
acclaim 
baird had no easy explanation for why adventurers seem to keep 
trying to come up with new projects and goals in the arctic 
who knows what motivates them he said its an athletic 
thing clearly in some ways its the right to say youre first 
and some sort of declaration that the human spirit is still alive 
and kicking 
at around the time the icewalk begins another expedition will 
have already started if all goes on schedule on a dogsled trek 
across the frozen bering strait separating alaska and soviet 
siberia the purpose of the trek by a ussoviet team of 10 men and 
two women is to call attention to the common cultural heritage of 
the indigenous people living on both sides of the strait the 
twomonth expedition is scheduled to depart from anadyr siberia on 
march 1 
the 4 million icewalk to the north pole has lined up amway the 
michiganbased marketing company as its major corporate sponsor 
the icewalk is different from other similar ventures in that it 
will use only human power supplies will be brought along in sledges 
that require tremendous energy to haul their 250300 pound cargoes 
the group will use skis but there will be no dogsleds or 
skimobiles the team will be flown back after reaching its goal 
it also hopes to attract attention by bringing an international 
group of about 30 teenage students to a base camp at eureka on 
ellesmere island to help with radio monitoring and to promote the 
antipollution message 
team members will gather snow and atmospheric samples to record 
pollution levels in the region they will be testing for mercury 
said to be the first such tests in the region as well as tracking 
sulphates nitrates chlorides and graphite particles they also 
will collect pollen samples to help find the origin of pollutants 
canadian research over the past four years has turned up dozens 
of toxic substances in the regions fragile ecosystem many of them 
entering the food chain attention also has focused on the thinning 
of the worlds ozone layer most notably at the worlds poles and 
on acid rain 
baird said the team will spend about a month training at a base 
camp before venturing out on the ice from cape columbia on the 
65day trip 
theres only a certain window when you can do this he added 
waiting warmer weather means too much open sea and drifting ice 
taking off too soon means too much harsh weather and temperatures 
that are too cold 
they can count on rough rough ice sea ice for the first 
100 kilometers 62 miles baird said its a maze its like a 
giant jigsaw puzzle 
the temperatures could be as low as 70 degrees below zero 
fahrenheit at the outset while winds could be as strong as about 
55 miles an hour the plans call for daily consumption of more than 
6000 calories by each member of the team to keep up energy 
the canadian on the team is angus clarence kaanerk cockney 
who is an inuit as eskimos are called in canada he was born and 
reared in canadas northwest territories

sally sussman after more than a year of 
plotting planning and writing is about to launch the new nbc 
daytime serial generations 
the story of three generations of two chicago families one 
white one black generations will make its debut on monday 
march 27 it will be the first soap with a black family at its core 
from the beginning sussman says 
sussman was hired away from cbs the young and the restless 
to mold the serial which is her first creation its also the first 
new soap since cbs brought out the bold and the beautiful nearly 
two years ago and its nbcs first new serial since santa 
barbara in 1982 
when they asked me to create the show they asked me if i had 
any ideas said sussman who is coexecutive producer as well as 
head writer 
i did i submitted a 20page outline describing the two 
families i didnt have a story at that time then i wrote the 
bible which ran to 525 pages it has eight or nine different 
stories and i figure it will take us through the first two years 
last october after working alone for a year she hired three 
writers thom racina elizabeth harrower and judi ann mason racina 
and harrower are experienced soap opera writers and mason is a new 
black writer 
the writers now have 20 scripts completed and 30 outlined the 
taping will begin with 25 completed scripts and 10 in the works 
sussman wants to stay five to six weeks ahead of taping and two 
months ahead of the air date 
the cast of generations includes taurean blacque joan 
pringle patricia crowley lynn hamilton barbara rhoades kristoff 
st john gail ramsey andrew masset and jonelle allen 
were going to keep the writers away from the production office 
and studio said sussman the production offices are too small 
and too hectic we need to be where its quieter more sane and the 
writers arent pressured we also have to work in secret because 
were so far ahead with the story we dont want anyone to know what 
were doing until were ready to reveal it 
each actor auditioning for the roles was given a complete 
biographical sketch of the character and read from special material 
written for the audition 
we want every actor to be thoroughly familiar with his 
character said sussman we want them to know who they are and 
who all their relatives are before we start taping were going to 
meet individually with each actor and go over their character its 
very important each has a strong knowledge of who they are 
blacque the head of the black family will run a chain of ice 
cream stores called marshalls chicago ice cream his lawyer will be 
patricia crowley who heads the white family the stories covering 
all the generations will touch on both their business and personal 
relationships 
these are going to be stories of character and emotions said 
sussman its not what i call the false reality of soap operas 
where everyones a private detective its more reality oriented 
well get into some black issues and social trends 
dr troy duster a black professor of sociology at the university 
of california at berkeley is a consultant to the show 
nbcs affiliate stations will be offered alternative time slots 
for the new halfhour show it will be fed twice for possible 
airing at 11 or 1130 am and again for 12 or 1230 pm this would 
allow the stations to schedule the show around their noon newscasts 
generations will then lead into days of our lives nbcs 
highestrated daytime drama 
sussman a native of toronto attended the university of southern 
california and was a management intern at nbc later she became a 
secretary and began writing comedy scripts on speculation she sold 
a script to facts of life and later joined the staff she also 
wrote for knots landing and too close for comfort 
i was looking for the security of a steady job she said i 
met some people at cbs and wrote a sixmonth story projection for 
the young and the restless she was hired on the basis of that

with stock prices jumping around again and 
memories of 1987s vast overestimation of values still raw and 
painful the question arises again are stocks now sensibly priced 
sensible pricing isnt what some financial people say it is it 
isnt for example a hunch a feeling or an expectation it isnt 
something from a gurus imagination it isnt always what your 
broker says it is 
instead the market itself is probably the best measure of 
sensible prices it has a long record and when prices depart from 
the longterm trends the market is usually saying something you 
should listen to 
it did that in late 1987 when it indicated tremendous 
overpricing those who heeded the warning escaped the crash those 
who believed in everhigher prices took their licks when the market 
corrected to sensible levels 
here are some of the measures as calculated by wright investors 
service an international research and portfolio management company 
based in bridgeport conn 
priceearnings ratios 
on the basis of reported earnings the standard amp poors 500 
stock average is now priced about 115 times estimated 1989 
earnings that compares with an average pe of 13 for the past five 
years and 115 for the past 20 years it is slightly below the 
markets average of 127 since world war ii 
pricecash flow 
the sampp industrials are now priced about 68 times estimated 1989 
corporate cash flow the average of the past five years is 65 the 
average for the past 20 years is 64 
priceequity 
the sampp 500s current 20 priceequity multiple is a good deal 
higher than the 18 average of the past five years the 15 average 
of the past 20 years and the 17 multiple of the past 40 years 
however says wright adjusting reported equity values for 
retained earnings to account for the stock buybacks and buyouts 
which have diluted equity since 1983 brings the priceequity ratio 
to 177 
pricesales 
the sampp industrials today are priced at about 63 percent of 
estimated 1989 sales the average pricesales ratio of the past five 
years is 58 percent for the past 20years the average is 57 percent 
priceoperating profits 
aftertax profits from current production rose sharply for us 
corporations from 1982 through 1986 from midyear 1982 to midyear 
1986 they jumped 125 percent providing the basis for a 129 percent 
rise in the sampp 500 
after the 1986 peak operating profits retreated and have been 
fairly flat recently currently they are 10 percent below their 
1986 peak while the sampp 500 is up more than 14 percent over the 
same period 
the sampp 500 is now about 206 percent of its 19691988 average 
price operating profits are 172 percent of the 19691988 average 
leading wright to comment that in relation to operating profits 
stock prices have gotten somewhat ahead of themselves 
this is wrights overall conclusion if the valuations of the 
past 20 years are any guide the stock market is currently a little 
on the high side 
wright researchers acknowledge one current activity that 
conceivably could change measurements if corporate takeovers are 
here to stay a new norm and higher valuations may be appropriate 
they say but they add a caveat 
wis is skeptical that a new era of stock valuation has begun 
the heightened takeover activity of the past five years has no doubt 
inflated the asking price of many stocks but it has also raised the 
overall risk 
wrights forecast the stock market may be expected to move into 
better line with earnings over the course of 1989 at best this may 
mean more of the same essentially sidewards price trend of the past 
six months 
a new bull market in equities may have to wait until 1990 bond 
returns are likely to exceed equity returns during 1989

william bennett has marching orders from 
president bush to get rid of the drug scourge but it will be up 
to the nations first drug czar to determine how he will wield his 
newly created powers 
some law enforcement agencies that opposed creation of a drug 
czar question whether bennett will be able to do anything more than 
try to reduce demand and they say their drugcontrol efforts wont 
change just because congress created a new job formally called 
director of national drug control policy 
my sense is that bill bennett and his mission will be to 
concentrate on reduction of demand attorney general dick 
thornburgh said recently we in law enforcement have our job to 
do no matter whos up top and were going to do it 
a transition official who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified said that bennett would keep close tabs on law 
enforcement efforts including those by the fbi and the drug 
enforcement agency but he said he also expects bennett to use the 
job as a bully pulput to encourage people to stop using drugs 
just as he did during his 3 years as education secretary under 
ronald reagan 
bennett declined to discuss his plans for the job until his 
confirmation hearings aide john walters said 
an official involved in coordinating drug control efforts in the 
past said congress didnt give the drug czar much power he gets 
to advise on a lot of things and recommend a lot of things but 
thats about it 
that is disputed by sen joseph biden ddel who fought for 
eight years to create a cabinetrank drug czar the legislation 
creating the job was passed by congress and signed into law by 
reagan late last year 
the legislations fine print requires each agency to write down 
in detail why it doesnt want to go along with any plan or 
budgetary decision of the drug czar biden said 
faced with the possibility that the agencies could be singled out 
for lack of cooperation theyll sign on biden said 
im confident bennett can be a strong director biden said 
noting that during his tenure as education secretary bennett was 
strongwilled and not afraid to butt heads with the bureaucracy 
hes not a guy worried about being criticized thats a 
necessary ingredient for this job 
he added however that bennett has no demonstrable experience 
on either the law enforcement side of the drug problem nor to the 
best of my knowledge any detailed views on the educationprevention 
side i think the key will be who he picks as his top aides 
bush raised the drug issue to the fore when in his inaugural 
adress he said this scourge will stop 
but he also said the overriding problem of the deficit would 
make it difficult to increase spending on lawenforcement efforts 
so the main thrust of the drug war would be education 
and he decided not to include bennett in his cabinet where 
symbolically at least he would have been on equal footing with 
heads of departments involved in the drug war efforts 
at his first presidential news conference bush defended his 
decision to exclude bennett from the cabinet 
the reason he isnt in the cabinet is that ive tried to reduce 
down the numbers of full cabinet members bush told reporters 
friday and i think that bill bennetts time is best spent not 
worrying about agricultural subsidies but concentrating on drugs 
bush said he would make clear to the cabinet secretaries that he 
was insisting on their cooperation with bennett 
fbi director william sessions when asked how bennett and the fbi 
would work together did not even address the role bennett would 
play 
our drug strategy has been defined since 1986 he told usa 
today it is to attack major drug traffickers and moneylaundering 
organizations dealing in heroin and cocaine with longterm 
investigations using courtauthorized electronic surveillance and 
other methods that will allow us to solve those particular crimes 
and present a case that will deal with a major organization 
fbi spokesman tom mcpoyle said we think its premature at this 
point to discuss the fbis relation to the drug czar or his 
policies its foolhardy to fashion some kind of response to 
something that doesnt exist yet 
but the fbi isnt just involved in law enforcement sessions has 
said one agent in each field office has been assigned to handle 
efforts to reduce the demand for drugs even though such programs 
already are being conducted by other agencies 
to biden thats a perfect example of the kind of decisions 
bennett will have to make 
why do we have demandreduction people in the fbi and 4000 
people in demand reduction at the department of education and 
demand reduction in treasury biden asked thats what he is 
there to solve 
lt cmdr jim simpson of the coast guard says that some of the 
turf battles among agencies already have been resolved but that the 
agencies are waiting to see what bennett will do 
whats going to happen under the drug czar i dont think 
anybody knows that except mr bennett simpson said 
part of the unknown he said is exactly how much power the 
drug czar is going to have i think thatll be defined by the first 
guy in the office 
i dont think anybody considers mr bennett a shy individual 
simpson said but on the other hand what direction is he going to 
take 
working on the assumption that bennett wont throw out everything 
thats been done before simpson said were going ahead with the 
things we were planning on doing all along until the new people 
come in and indicate a change of directions 
when he was education secretary bennett called for involvement 
of the military in the drug war reportedly advising in one memo 
the military should do to the drug barons what our forces in the 
persian gulf did to irans navy 
maj david super a pentagon spokesman said defense department 
officials are holding to their determination not to step over the 
line to police functions we want that responsibility to remain 
with civilian authorities

one of the busiest supermarkets in the 
world is posting a going out of business sign on its doors and 
telling thousands of happy loyal customers to go elsewhere 
the armys cameron station a sprawling supply facility and 
cutrate grocery store for the military in this washington suburb 
is one of 34 bases slated to be closed under a defense department 
costcutting plan announced in december 
a pentagon commission said 120yearold cameron station was old 
and inefficient and should be shut down to save taxpayers 133 
million a year 
unless congress takes the unlikely step of overruling the 
pentagon the cameron station commissary will be closed in the next 
few years despite nearly 31 million in annual sales last year 
receipts like that make cameron station the envy of the 
supermarket giants and its only open during the day five days a 
week 
when the station is closed its grocery business probably will 
shift not far away to the mammoth commissary at fort belvoir va 
the king of the armys 178 worldwide commissaries with 643 million 
in sales last year 
the supermarket chains keep their sales figures a closely guarded 
secret but food world a reliable industry journal estimates that 
the average giant food store in the washington metropolitan area by 
comparison posted 185 million in annual sales as of last may the 
figure for the other major chain safeway stores was 114 million 
as many as 40000 customers most of them military retirees push 
their loaded shopping carts past 18 checkout counters at cameron 
station every month 
the store boasts everything its civilian competitors offer 
except for alcoholic beverages automotive accessories a jewelry 
and cosmetics counter or a pharmacy 
cheaper prices thats our big draw says len langford the 
civilian assistant manager at cameron station and his customers 
agree 
they say the commissarys low prices save them 25 percent to 30 
percent of the checkout counter tab at giant or safeway the two 
biggest supermarkets on the outside 
with a current operating subsidy of 743 million from congress 
the commissaries sell everything at cost plus a 5 percent surcharge 
to cover overhead expenses 
altogether the 431 military commissaries racked up 52 billion 
in worldwide sales last year making them the seventh largest 
grocery chain in the country the estimated 18 billion difference 
between commissary and supermarkets prices is regarded as a pay 
supplement for military families 
langford said his shoppers drive here from throughout washington 
and its maryland and virginia suburbs to load up on bargains one 
guy and his wife drive all the way from upstate new york near the 
canadian border to shop here every six months he said 
ive been going to the commissary all my life said betty 
tychsen wife of a retired air force colonel who loaded a dozen 
grocery bags of bargains into the trunk of her car at the cameron 
station parking lot 
its close to my home the produce is good and i seem to get 
through the checkout lines quickly she said we get everything 
we need here and my husband says we save 20 percent by shopping 
here 
im going to miss it said cosy schneberger wife of a navy 
commander at the pentagon who hits cameron station every three weeks 
to stock up you can find most everything you want i hope they do 
something to take care of everyone when they close 
in the parking lot at fort belvoir lance cpl james pearson of 
billings mont a 24yearold with a wife and baby drives 30 miles 
both ways from their home on the marine base at quantico va to 
shop for commissary bargains 
pearson says the commissary is a lifesaver on his paycheck of 
382 every two weeks he figures the 120 worth of groceries they 
buy at fort belvoir every payday would cost an additional 75 if 
they shopped elsewhere 
if we didnt have this wed go pretty hungry he said 
wed have pretty empty grocery bags when we got home 
capt earl hemminger who lives in nearby springfield va with 
his wife and 2yearold daughter buys most of his groceries at the 
belvoir commissary but says his enlisted men need the 50amonth 
savings more than he does 
to a private living in a highcost area like washington 50 a 
month is a lot of money he said as it is a lot of soldiers 
have to work a second job till midnight to make ends meet 
the big food chains complain that the commissaries enjoy an 
unfair competitive advantage because of their government operating 
subsidy and ability to sell groceries virtually at cost 
barry scher a giant food spokesman said commissaries are needed 
for military bases in remote rural areas but are a waste of the 
governments money in large urban areas adequately served by 
private supermarkets 
in 1983 the grace commission a presidential advisory group 
seeking ways to eliminate government waste urged the military to 
get out of the grocery business it said military commissaries 
should be closed or turned over to private industry for a savings of 
up to 25 billion 
that proposal got nowhere in congress where commissary 
privileges were defended as a sacred fringe benefit regarded by 
lowpaid enlistees as second only to free medical care 
at a 1984 hearing members of the house armed services committee 
listened sympathetically as military wives lambasted the suggestion 
that equally cheap groceries could be found beyond the base gates 
we dont want food warehouses we dont want generic brands and 
we dont want to be secondclass citizens said sandra newton who 
lived at langley air force base in virginia 
said ella galluccio an army wife from fort bragg nc small 
children do not feel okay when they have to eat corn flakes out of 
plain white boxes without any prizes when other children are eating 
pacman cereal and cheerios

coworkers probably tumbled in laughter when 
someone not too long ago adjusted his tie stood up in the boardroom 
and said with a straight face i predict people will actually pay 
real money to watch fake wrestling on television 
but the idea was so crazy it was brilliant in todays expanding 
universe of payperview television no programming concoction is 
too outrageous for those addicted viewers cruising for a new video 
fix 
with payperview cable television subscribers can wolf down a 
buffet of television events including movies concerts boxing 
and more than enough wrestling without winching themselves off the 
sofa seats are frontrow and best of all there are usually no 
stupid commercials 
carrace fanatics with 13 to spare can see the miller high life 
500 on june 17 with no breaks in the action 
stircrazy businessmen taking shelter in some holiday inn can 
fork over 7 for a private television broadcast of a softcore porno 
movie 
thousands of viewers are expected to shell out 15 bucks in april 
to watch evel knievels son go motorcycle jumping 
and in 1992 nbc will offer up to 200 hours of selected summer 
olympic events on a payperview basis the network announced dec 
22 
with so many options theres a heap of money coming through the 
door payperview will become a billiondollar industry within 10 
years up from less than 100 million in 1988 according to industry 
estimates 
its completely convenient said jerry hartman vice 
president of marketing and sales for universal pay tv at eight 
oclock if youre bored you can watch something you dont have to 
get up you dont have to go to the video store or anywhere else 
in theory the payperview process is simple enough you order 
good morning vietnam at 7 pm it arrives descrambled on your 
television set an hour later and the movies charged on your next 
bill in practice however it can be a more frustrating experience 
while most of todays payperview transactions from 5 to 40 
are conducted over the phone future technologies may streamline the 
process to a single remote control opticalfiber 
videoondemand cable systems now being tested in southern 
california by gte corp will supply hundreds more titles at any 
time in the day 
for payperview companies the easier the transaction the 
brighter the future parents beware 
payperview caters to the same impulsive buyers who grab cheap 
pens and eyeglass nose cushions at supermarket checkouts never 
realizing they could probably do without until its too late with 
payperview though theres the added chance that just once the 
purchase could be electrifying 
about 600000 fans optimistically coughed up 35 per home to 
watch last junes fight between mike tyson and michael spinks 
which ended abruptly after 91 seconds the nov 7 title match 
between sugar ray leonard and donny lalonde brought in close to 20 
million in payperview grosses just behind the tysonspinks 
receipts 
i think people love the excitement of a big championship 
fight said jeffrey reiss chairman of payperview giant request 
television you can have a group of people over to the house for 
the price of one ticket and have a beer and popcorn party 
nielsen ratings that would make network programmers scribble out 
suicide notes can be solid gold on payperview due to higher 
profit margins we can make money on one rating point said 
scott kurnit president of showtime event television 
although payperview has been workable throughout the 1980s 
only 21 percent of the countrys 45 million cable households now 
have equipment permitting phone orders that figure may double by 
1990 and 40 million homes may have access to payperview by 1994 
according to estimates by paul kagan associates a media research 
firm 
yet the longtouted promise of payperview has been slow in 
arriving stalled by poor marketing filmstudio fears and 
technological obstacles 
cable televisions reputation for poor customer service hasnt 
encouraged subscribers to experiment with a more complicated 
product theres still a long way to go in consumer marketing 
said tim clott executive vice president of the video division at 
paramount pictures and we want to find a technology that 
prohibits home taping 
the studios dont want payperview broadcasts to undermine the 
2 billion home video market worried that payperview customers 
will videotape their purchases the studios typically offer movies 
to payperview systems more than a month after their homevideo 
debut thereby dulling the excitement 
meanwhile payperview program options continue expanding 
robbie knievel evels son will try to hurdle the caesars 
palace fountains on april 14 abc cbs and nbc wont have it but 
you can see the leap or crash on showtime event television on

leaders in the payperview business are predicting that broadway

after 27 years of fighting the sovietbacked 
ethiopian government and separatist rebels in eritrea province say 
theyre ready to negotiate a settlement of africas longest war 
but many obstacles remain in the way namely finding a suitable 
mediator and overcoming the deep divisions among the rebel groups 
themselves 
the conflict has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives driven 
nearly a eritrean million refugees westward into neighboring sudan 
and compounded the suffering from the regions devastating famine 
the rebels who scored major battlefield victories last spring 
and reported new gains in late december say they are tightening 
their siege around a key governmentheld city while bracing for a 
new ethiopian offensive 
the guerrillas led by the dominant eritrean peoples liberation 
front eplf which along with other rebel factions has offices in 
rome control about threefourths of the territory the government 
holds most of the major cities 
eritrea is situated on the strategic horn of africa which 
overlooks the red sea approach to the suez canal as well a key water 
route to the oil fields of saudi arabia slightly larger than 
pennsylvania eritrea has a 1000mile coastline along the red sea 
across from southern saudi arabia 
a former italian colony eritrea was federated with ethiopia in 
1952 under a ussponsored resolution in the united nations the 
eritreans battle for independence began in 1961 emperor haile 
selassie annexed the territory in 1962 
selassie was overthrown in 1974 by the military that established 
todays marxist government he died in detention in 1975 
as the conflict has worn one the eritreans have built a 
selfreliant society the rebels who receive no significant outside 
military or financial support have built an array of schools 
hospitals and workshops some of them underground or in hillside 
caverns to avoid detection from the air that contribute both to 
the war effort and the needs of the general population 
in march 1987 the main secessionist groups adopted a 
constitution and a national program 
in interviews in rome the eritreans acknowledged that 
differences in ideology and strategy have led to fighting among 
themselves but they all declared a willingness to negotiate with 
ethiopia they contended however that president mengistu haile 
maniam of ethiopia was not sincere in his expressed desire for a 
settlement 
in particular the eritreans condemned mengistus meeting in his 
capital addis ababa in late december with what ethiopia described 
as a delegation of the eritrean liberation front the elf the 
oldest of the rebel groups has split into several rival factions 
over the years 
the delegation reportedly agreed to have the province of 35 
million people divided into two autonomous regions one for moslems 
and the other for christians according to addis ababa radio the 
ethiopian politburo accepted that idea and sent a proposal to 
parliament or shengo for final approval in june 
the eritreans interviewed in rome maintained that those who met 
with mengistu were former rebels who now live in arab countries of 
the persian gulf and do not represent any of the legitimate 
organizations 
they are traitors said asefau bariamikael vice president of 
the elfnational council 
this is just an attempt by ethiopia to create divisions and 
shows their lack of seriousness in confronting the problem said 
solomon kinfe an eplf fighter and representative here 
ethiopia has always tried to divide eritrea on basis of 
religion but religion has always been an element of unification 
said taha nur of the elfunited organization 
still all three groups said they are willing to talk through a 
mediator and that the united nations should reopen the eritrean 
issue 
we are ready to participate actively in solving the problem 
politically and ready to negotiate with the ethiopian government 
without preconditions nur said 
previously some of the groups had said they would negotiate only 
on condition that independence would be discussed 
once we sit down then we will make our proposal for complete 
independence bariamikael of the elfnational council said if 
they ethiopians dont want to hear it beforehand well just say 
it later but we wont change our mind about complete independence 
kinfe said the eplf continues to demand that the conflict be 
settled by a referendum offering eritreans three choices 
independence regional autonomy or a return to federation

although ideology is one factor dividing the rebel groups the 
political outlook of each of them remains vague and none has set 
forth any ideological platform on which they would govern eritrea 
the dominant eplf is considered the most leftleaning and is 
widely considered marxistoriented the group itself rejects any 
political identification tag saying it is neither marxist nor 
imperialist and has no superpower backing 
margherita boniver a socialist member of the italian parliament 
who has been to eritrea said some of the groups consider the 
eplf fanatics but the eplf people are very well informed about the 
international scene and after 27 years of fighting i doubt they 
would opt for a marxist society 
bariamikael of the elfnational council said we all want 
eritrea as a democratic nation represented by parliament and 
different parties 
the ethiopian government has not recently stated its position on 
negotiations with the rebels telephone calls by the associated 
press to officials at the ethiopian embassy in rome were not 
returned however in a document issued in july the government said 
it was ready to negotiate on the basis of the new constitution for 
regional autonomy in eritrea but ruled out independence 
sudans ambassador in rome ibrahim ayoub confirmed that 
ethiopia approached his government last year and asked for its 
mediation sudan agreed as part of an effort to settle all conflicts 
in the horn of africa and is seeking to clarify the position of 
both parties ayoub said sudan shares the west shore of the red 
sea with eritrea and egypt 
while the elfunited organization has backed mediation by sudan 
the eplf has rejected the sudanese because of their moslemdominated 
governments war against christian guerrillas in southern sudan 
the eplf prefers that mediation efforts are better undertaken 
by third parties that are not in any way involved in the conflicts 
in the region the eplf said in a statement on jan 17 
italy has also been mentioned as a possible mediator an issue 
that came up during a visit to ethiopia last fall by an italian 
parliament delegation 
mengistu said that italy could have a role in settling the 
eritrean question said mrs boniver the italian parliament 
member and president of parliaments foreign affairs committee 
italy should take up this very serious offer and try to start 
negotiations either trilaterally or involving other countries 
said mrs boniver who visited eritrea briefly last year and plans 
to return with other parliament members this year 
on the military front the eritreans say they want to consolidate 
their victories of last spring in march eplf guerrillas broke 
through a 10yearold front south of their headquarters in nacfa and 
overran the governmentheld town of afabet capturing three soviet 
military advisers in the process 
since then rebels have carried out hitandrun raids on the 
naval bases at massawa and masab in a communique in midjanuary 
the eplf claimed to have killed more than 2000 ethiopian soldiers 
along the state road connecting asmara the provincial capital and 
massawa 
kinfe said the eplf has been entrenched for months around the 
ethiopianheld city of keren in northcentral eritrea and the group 
is expecting the government to launch an offensive soon to try to 
break the siege 
according to the military balance a survey published by the 
londonbased international institute for strategic studies the eplf 
has about 30000 fighters ethiopia has a 315000member military 
not including cuban soviet and east german advisers and technicians 
while the ethiopians have been armed by the soviets the rebels 
rely mostly with captured government equipment including t54 and 
t55 tanks and heavy artillery ethiopia controls the skies with 
sovietsupplied mig warplanes and helicopters

history for most of its 3000year history eritrea has been 
coveted by foreign powers because of its strategic geographic 
position the region fought off invaders for centuries before the 
ottoman empire established a foothold on the coast in 1557 three 
hundred years later egypt occupied the eastern and western 
lowlands european domination came in 1891 when italy colonized the 
entire region and gave it the name eritrea derived from the ancient 
greek name for the red sea during world war ii italian forces of 
dictator benito mussolini used eritrea as a staging area for the 
invasion of ethiopia allied armies took eritrea in 1941 and for the 
next 11 years it was under british military administration eritrean 
leaders pushed for independence but ethiopia yearning for an 
access to the red sea received the strong backing of the united 
states and in 1952 eritrea was federated as an autonomous state with 
ethiopia on sept 1 1961 the eritrean liberation front was formed 
and civil war began on nov 14 1962 ethiopia abolished the 
federation and its armies occupied eritrea

if congress goes through with its plan to 
eliminate the double taxation of corporate dividends the result 
could be a boost in prices on wall street and a reduction in the 
massive borrowing that has bankrolled the wave of corporate buyouts 
but it is questionable whether the lawmakers will have the nerve 
to go through with any plan that could reduce federal revenue at the 
same time they are grappling with the huge federal deficit 
congress is considering two proposals on corporate taxation as 
part of its examination of the leveraged buyout phenomenon one 
proposal would restrict the tax deduction that corporations now 
enjoy on interest payments stemming from borrowing the other would 
ease the levy on dividends which are taxed both at the corporate 
level and as income to individual investors 
lawmakers returned to work in january eager to muffle the 
explosion of corporate debt that accompanied the multibilliondollar 
buyouts of major companies at the end of last year after a weeks 
worth of hearings on the subject the combination of curtailed 
benefits for debt and a new tax break for dividends seemed to be 
gaining favor 
its also the approach preferred by key bush administration 
officials such as treasury secretary nicholas brady who are 
anxious to guard against another calamity on wall street like the 
crash of 1987 which was precipitated in part by talk of changing 
the tax rules on takeovers 
proponents of the twopronged plan say tightening the corporate 
interestdeduction provision could balance revenue lost from 
eliminating the double taxation of dividends but both remain 
contentious issues 
while federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan told the 
senate finance committee he was concerned about the level of 
corporate borrowing stemming from takeovers he said he was opposed 
to any restrictions on the deductibility of corporate interest from 
loans and bonds 
he said such limits could have unintended consequences that could 
actually reduce tax revenue and that companies and financiers would 
find a way around any restrictions 
earlier in the week david s ruder chairman of the securities 
and exchange commission also said he was opposed to any change in 
the interest deductibility he warned that any tinkering with the 
tax laws to curb takeovers could cause panic in a stock market he 
called skittish and nervous 
that caution was echoed friday by president bush who said at a 
news conference that he didnt think it was the governments place 
to restrict the level of corporate borrowing 
as for the other proposal eliminating the double taxation on 
dividends most likely would lead to price rises in stocks that pay 
dividends because the dividends would be more valuable that in 
turn could have another beneficial effect making it more 
attractive for corporations to raise funds for buyouts and 
restructurings through sales of stock instead of through borrowing 
greenspan brady and ruder all welcomed the plan to ease the tax 
burden on dividends but none offered any magic formula to do so 
without worsening the federal deficit 
in other major business and economic news this past week 
the us economy shook off the effects of the stock market crash 
and the drought to grow at a robust 38 percent in 1988 the best 
performance in four years the government reported the increase in 
the gross national product was powered by a big improvement in the 
us trade deficit and a sharp increase in business capital 
investment meanwhile greenspan told a congressional panel that the 
fed believes inflation is too high and that it will act to curb it 
the treasury department suggested a fee of about 25 cents on 
every 100 deposited in savings and loan accounts to raise money for 
the government insurance fund backing sampls the proposal encountered 
immediate criticism and was given little chance of moving ahead 
meanwhile m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board said the bank board was suing three of the socalled big 
eight accounting firms as well as others for failing to uncover 
losses and abuses in sampls that later failed 
the threat of prison reportedly encouraged at least 30 suspects 
in the commodities scandal to cooperate in the massive federal 
investigation of alleged fraud at two futures exchanges subpoenas 
to appear before a grand jury have been served on more than 200 
brokers traders and trading firms associated with the chicago board 
of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange meanwhile the merc 
appointed a panel to review its rules and recommend revisions and 
improvements 
court documents revealed that drexel burnham lambert inc agreed 
to dismiss michael milken its senior junkbond trader as part of 
its record 650 million pleabargain deal with prosecutors on fraud 
charges sources said prosecutors offered a pleabargain deal to 
milken two weeks ago but his lawyers rejected it

increases in some discounted maxsaver fares that 
take effect today and next week have analysts wondering whether 
passengers could be in for another round of fare hikes 
american airlines raised its socalled maxsaver fares on flights 
from its dallasfort worth hub to 40 us cities american 
spokeswoman mary oneill said thursday several other big carriers 
followed suit 
the 40 roundtrip hike will apply to 20 west coast cities and a 
number of east coast destinations while maxsaver fares to several 
cities in the central united states will be raised by 20 round 
trip the higher fares take effect today for the west coast cities 
and feb 1 for the other destinations 
for example american raised its roundtrip maxsaver fare between 
dallasfort worth and los angeles from 258 offpeak to 298 and 
from 298 peak to 338 maxsavers between the dallas hub and 
cincinnati will go from 238 offpeak to 258 and from 278 peak to 
298 
spokesmen for other major carriers including united airlines 
and delta air lines said they were matching americans move in the 
same markets 
continental airlines often a farecutting leader said it 
matched the west coast increases but was still studying the others 
pan am corp was reviewing the situation 
fares normally are not lifted at this time of year which usually 
is a slack period for travel but passenger traffic has been fairly 
strong in recent weeks analysts say 
they the airlines evidently feel very confident that the 
traffic is very strong and can sustain another fare increase said 
kevin murphy an industry analyst for morgan stanley amp co 
the move is setting the tone for more fare increases this 
summer he said 
all of the fares now being raised by american had been cut in 
midnovember when the entire industry revamped its maxsaver fares 
ms oneill said at that time the major carriers led by 
continental lowered some of the popular discount fares but boosted 
most of them 
we couldnt justify that fare in those markets ms oneill 
said 
maxsaver tickets which are used mainly by vacation travelers 
must be purchased seven to 14 days in advance and require a saturday 
night stay in the november revamp the fares were based on the 
length of a flight competition on individual routes not mileage 
had determined maxsaver rates in the past 
the maxsaver change came just days after continental initiated an 
industry move to drop discounts aimed at business travelers 
as a result of the latest fare hikes 27 of the 40 affected 
maxsaver fares will still be lower than they were before the 
november restructuring ms oneill said 
american serves a total network of about 5000 markets 
its coming at an unusual time of year for there to be fare 
hikes said thomas longman who follows the industry for bear 
stearns amp co theyve seen stronger traffic in those markets than 
they thought 
andrew geller an airline analyst for provident national bank in 
philadelphia estimates that passenger traffic currently is up 5 
percent to 8 percent from its level a year ago 
robust passenger demand last year spurred the airlines to raise 
fares an average 10 percent from 1987 he said

an unusually warm and dry winter is worrying farmers from 
illinois to michigan who fear a repeat of the 1988 drought 
theres a pervading omen a feeling of ominous concern i sense 
it with other farmers i sense it with the salesmen of agricultural 
products said joe summer a mclean county corn and soybean farmer 
in central illinois 
for the first time in 45 years of farming summer is taking out 
multiperil insurance on next seasons crop 
were all beginning to get a little paranoid about it the 
62yearold farmer said there is no frost in the ground this 
unusually warm weather is strange it is a harbinger of some sort i 
think 
forecasters for the national weather service say severe to 
extreme drought conditions continue in much of the northern great 
plains northern rockies and parts of the midwest 
but the most recent 30day forecast calls for abovenormal 
precipitation said meteorologist edward olenic with the services 
climate analysis offices in washington dc 
the agency will not release its spring forecast until after the 
commodities markets close monday but olenic said there is no 
reason to expect more of the drought that hit much of the nation 
last summer 
even so farmers and their farm bureaus are worried 
if we dont get some snowfall we could go into the spring 
lacking the snowmelt said michigan farm bureau spokesman al almy 
potentially we could be on the short side 
farm bureau officials in minnesota indiana wisconsin illinois 
and iowa say the same 
at this stage were hoping for a terribly wet spring said 
gerald hagaman administrator of the minnesota farm bureau 
theres apprehension 
spring rains will quench the top soil but farmers have lost deep 
soil moisture their one insurance against drought said dennis 
vercler with the illinois farm bureau 
theyre edgy about it were going into the season needing just 
the right rain at just the right time vercler said 
lack of precipitation is not the only worry 
if we stay relatively mild the real problem is that it doesnt 
kill a lot of the pests said don henderson vice president of the 
indiana farm bureau where january temperatures have averaged 341 
degrees 
sheets of ice have coated snowless fields in wisconsin and 
southern michigan off and on for the past three weeks causing a 
different danger for winter crops of wheat and alfalfa icing 
if part of an alfalfa field is coated with ice it can smother 
the plants to death said wisconsin farm bureau president don 
haldeman 
cycles of freezing and thawing also have set up a heaving and 
uprooting problem for winter wheat almy said in michigan and if 
it should suddenly turn cold the lack of snow cover could expose 
the plants he said 
the one bright spot is that mild weather is making the winter 
easier on livestock farming officials said 
the national weather services most recent precipitation map 
shows extreme drought in montana the dakotas central minnesota 
eastern iowa northwestern illinois and much of wyoming eastern 
idaho central washington and eastern oregon said meteorologist 
dave miskus from the climate analysis center 
it sure does cause concern said enid schlipf another mclean 
county farmer in illinois we dont understand whats happening

sundstrand corp whian additional 623 
million to the pentagon officials say 
were looking forward to returning to a normal relationship 
with the government company spokesman claude vernam said 
thursday moments after the defense department lifted its ban on 
sundstrands participation in the military procurement process 
that move followed an announcement that the rockfordbased 
aerospace manufacturing giant would make costsaving concessions on 
future contracts and pay 623 million to resolve differences 
stemming from a lengthy investigation that resulted in criminal 
charges against the company 
last october a federal judge approved a plea agreement in which 
sundstrand admitted defrauding the government and paid 115 million 
in fines as part of the largest contract fraud settlement in defense 
department history 
spokesman larry wilson of the defense logistics agency which 
administers contracts said the new agreement would provide the 
pentagon in effect with some price guarantees on future contracts 
by forcing the company to modify the way it allocates charges 
between its commercial and military work 
the agreement also called for sundstrand to make an immediate 
cash payment of 40 million followed by a separate payment of 99 
million on or before sept 1 and payments totaling 124 
million to be made in equal annual installments of 248 million 
over the next five years 
wilson said savings from the accounting changes could eventually 
total another 34 million 
the agreement and sundstrands return to the bidding process was 
greeted with optimism thursday on wall street in trading on the new 
york stock exchange sundstrand rose 162 a share to 5425 
but in a statement sundstrand put the cost of the agreement at 
713 million over the next five years considerably more than the 
20 million reserved by the company for resolution of all of its 
government contract disputes 
the defense department accounts for 42 percent of sundstrands 
14 billion in annual sales asked how much the suspension may have 
cost the company vernam said i cant put a price on it but 
were glad to be out from under this thing 
the pentagon suspended sundstrand from doing any new business 
with the federal government on oct 19 saying it wasnt satisfied 
with the companys response to being caught up in a fraud 
investigation overseen by the us attorney in chicago 
while the suspension did not affect existing contracts it 
prevented the corporation and six subsidiaries sundstrand data 
control inc falk corp sundstrand heat transfer inc sundstrand 
service corp sullair corp and signatron inc from bidding on 
or receiving any new contracts 
at the same time sundstrand corp pleaded guilty to four counts 
of defrauding the defense department by overbilling on aircraft 
parts its sundstrand data control subsidiary settled a separate

babysitting expenses country clubs and servants for its executives

submitted expense reports identifying the defense department workers 
they entertained only as a customer or government employee 
the complaint said

thursday was based on the results of various audits dealing with how 
sundstrand had allocated production costs to military contracts in 
the past

under pressure from several groups 
colgatepalmolive co plans to rename darkie a toothpaste that it 
sells in asia and redesign its logotype that had shown a minstrel 
in blackface it was reported friday 
the new york times said the company planned to change the name of 
the toothpaste to darlie and make the logotype a portrait of a man 
of ambiguous race wearing a silk top hat tuxedo and bow tie 
colgatepalmolive has faced increasing criticism from 
shareholders religious groups and blacks for promoting racial 
stereotypes through its marketing of the toothpaste the story said 
colgatepalmolive had paid 50 million in 1985 for halfownership 
of the hong kong company that manufactures the toothpaste which is a 
bestselling brand in several asian countries the newspaper said 
its just plain wrong the newspaper quoted reuben mark the 
chairman and chief executive of colgatepalmolive referring to the 
toothpastes name and logotype 
its just offensive the morally right thing dictated that we 
must change what we have to do is find a way to change that is the 
least damaging to the economic interests of our partners he told 
the newspaper 
the story said the name would be changed in stages over the next 
year and the logotype will be replaced the following year the 
gradual switch is designed to reduce confusion and avoid lost sales 
the newspaper said 
it said that colgatepalmolive agreed to pay for the redesign 
repackaging and advertising costs and would reimburse hawley amp 
hazel the manufacturer that started the toothpaste in the 1920s 
for any lost profits resulting from the change 
the toothpaste is sold in hong kong malaysia singapore taiwan 
and thailand but is not available in the united states the story

federal transportation officials have decided 
the 1990 fueleconomy standards should remain at the previous years 
265 miles per gallon says a private autosafety advocacy group 
that wants a higher ceiling 
the transportation department and national highway traffic safety 
administration would neither confirm nor deny thursdays assertion 
by the washingtonbased center for auto safety 
the two agencies administer the corporate average fuel economy 
or cafe standards 
meanwhile transportation secretarydesignate samuel skinner said 
he has yet to form a judgment on fuel economy 
center director clarence ditlow said he learned of the decison 
from sources in the transportation departments rulemaking office 
the energy department general motors corp and chrysler corp 
he disclosed the 265 mpg figure in a letter asking president 
bush to intervene in favor of a tighter fueleconomy sandard 
the standard would not be formally set until the agency published 
a notice in the federal register the governments record of 
official actions 
neither the transportation department nor its subsidiary agency 
the national highway traffic safety administration would comment on 
the assertion 
the fueleconomy law was adopted in 1975 to reduce gasoline 
consumption at a time of rapidly rising oil prices and requires 
automakers to design the mix of vehicles in their fleets so that the 
average meets or betters the fuelconsumption standard 
the law set a goal of 275 mpg beginning in 1985 however the 
law also allowed the government to reduce that if the higher level 
would harm automakers or if it was technologically difficult to 
attain 
if transportation officials failed to act the standard would 
revert to 275 mpg a level gm and ford motor co have said is 
impossible for them to meet without layoffs at bigcar plants 
skinner said at a hearing thursday before the senate environment 
and public works committee that the administration was committed to 
an aggressive environmental program and that the fueleconomy 
standards would be a key ingredient in that program 
i dont consider myself in a position to have prejudged that 
issue at all he said 
the standard was set at 18 mpg for 1978 cars rose gradually to 
275 mpg in 1985 and then was lowered to 26 mpg in 1986 at the 
request of some of the automakers it remained at 26 mpg through the 
1988 model year 
the 265 mpg level for 1990 is within the range of 26 mpg to 267 
mpg gm said it could live with 
ford said a 265 mpg level would be appropriate but called for 
changes that would bring the fueleconomy law more in line with 
todays market and economic conditions 
chrysler did not return calls thursday but has said previously it 
could meet the 275 mpg goal set by the law

malaysia plans to send a special 
delegation to the united states in march to try to ease concerns 
raised by health advocates and competitors against palm oil one of 
its key exports 
we will go and expose all the lies being spread by the american 
soybean association and others who are doing it because they are 
scared that our product is very competitive with their oil and want 
to deny the market to us primary industries minister lim keng 
yaik said tuesday at a news conference 
the delegation of government officials palm oil producers 
exporters and scientists will present evidence supporting their case 
to the national institute of oil processors meeting in tucson 
ariz im said 
malaysian exports account for 65 percent of total world palm oil 
exports the industry generates about 2 billion in revenue and 
more than 2 million of malaysias 175 million people depend 
directly or indirectly on it 
evidence that highly saturated tropical oils such as palm oil and 
coconut oil increase blood cholesterol that causes heart disease has 
prompted major campaigns in the united states against using such 
fats in processed foods 
major food processors such as general mills inc kellogg co and 
pillsbury co have responded with announcements that they no longer 
use tropical oils in their cookies crackers and other products 
producers of soybean oil which accounts for about 72 percent of 
the us oil market also have campaigned against tropical oils 
malaysia has been doing its own research since the american 
soybean association the private national heart savers association 
and other groups launched the antitropical oils campaign in 1987 
said li 
he said he wanted to keep the findings under wraps until march so 
that they would have a greater impact on the consumers and others 
attending the meeting 
other government officials said the findings indicate that palm 
oil has many health benefits contains vitamins and is no more 
harmful than other vegetable oils 
lim said the palm oil producers here set up a 369 million fund 
two months ago for a counterattack which will include 
advertisements in national newspapers refuting allegations by the 
antipalm oil forces 
since they are using scare tactics to drive away food consumers 
we have decided to explain the truth directly to the consumers and 
tell them palm oil is safe lim said 
lim tried to downplay the importance of the us palm oil market 
to malaysia noting that the us imported 147000 tons of malaysian 
palm oil in januaryoctober 1988 down from 157000 tons in the same 
period of 1987 malaysias annual production last year reached a 
record 503 million tons 
however malaysia fears that not challenging the antipalm oil 
campaign in the united states could affect larger markets such as 
india he said

state bankers are resorting to a lottery to 
convince poles to save their money rather than emptying stores of 
what little there is to buy 
savers are responding enthusiastically jamming bank counters to 
pledge they will keep 50000 zlotys about a months salary on 
deposit for six to nine months in order to be eligible for winning 
cash prizes 
few seem to care much about the lotterys antiinflation goal of 
freezing hot money as one banking director put it or whether 
their accounts will bolster the zloty in a beleaguered economy where 
almost every meaningful transaction is carried out in another 
nations currency the us dollar 
pensions are so low i could help myself with the money said 
one retired office clerk 10th in line at the state pko bank in 
warsaw 
they dont seem concerned the zlotys they put into the bank will 
have lost value when withdrawn due to inflation instead they 
dream of pocketing the prizes and putting the money toward cars 
apartments or educations abroad 
the top prize of 50 million zlotys is worth 98000 at the 
official exchange rate or 15000 at the more relevant black market 
price 
it is a good thing for the economy let them have it and a 
good thing for me i might win said another retired clerk 
waiting at the bank 
other than the lottery gimmick widely promoted on tv and in 
newspapers there are few ways to encourage savings especially 
since the interest paid at banks has lagged behind inflation which 
hit 70 percent to 80 percent last year 
although oneyear accounts can earn up to 45 percent interest 
this year or up to 22 percent in the accounts covered by the 
contest there is little inclination to deposit when the inflation 
rate will devalue money at a conservatively projected 50 percent 
this year 
the government unleashed a flood of zlotys last year when the 
printing presses were turned on and salaries raised following two 
serious waves of labor unrest the average monthly salary about 
doubled to 60000 zlotys 117 at the official rate or 18 on the 
black market 
poles took their money to the stores not the banks 
ask anybody when he last saw a color tv set deep freezer or a 
vacuum cleaner on store shelves wrote a respected financial 
journalist piotr aleksandrowicz in an article called bulging pay 
envelopes 
in another story inflation and savings a headache he noted 
that poles are not spendthrifts and in fact save more on average 
than americans 
they invest their savings in gold hard currency cars and 
household utensils he said the only unprofitable form of 
savings are bank deposits 
the start of the zloty lottery was delayed because supplies of 
the entrance forms did not arrive but once savers began 
registering long lines were reported at the participating banks 
nationwide and the post offices where pledges also are accepted 
by midjanuary about 100 billion zlotys had been pledged 
representing 10 percent of the funds deposited in the checking and 
shortterm savings accounts included in the contest said marian 
bartkowiak head of the pko savings department 
the rules provide for one prize of 50 million zloty and 10 prizes 
of 500000 zlotys for savers who pledge to keep a minimum of 50000 
zlotys on deposit for nine months those who agree to keep the 
50000 zlotys in their accounts for six months are eligible for one 
prize of 20 million zlotys and 20 awards of 100000 zlotys each 
participants get a chance at the prizes for each 50000 zlotys 
pledged one newspaper reported a customer entering 669 times 
investing 33 million zlotys 
at the pko branch a mechanical engineer on a pension was topping 
off his account at 50000 zlotys which represented his life 
savings should he win he said he would move from the single room 
he shares with his wife and a third person 
once in a life time i will try he said if i win i will 
try to rent a proper apartment otherwise i cant afford a 
dogs house 
a young mother was doing exactly what state economists hoped by 
investing money her montherinlaw had saved at home 
dont we have enough hospitals to give to said another woman 
asked what she would do should her account be drawn when the winners 
are picked in august and november if it comes for free one 
should give it for free 
there is a lot of hope she said and the more so because 
poland is poor should it borrow money from elsewhere 
by depositing zlotys in banks poles can help the economy by 
providing banks with capital to be lent to state enterprises 
private businesses or home builders officials would also like to 
cool consumer demand which exceeds the economys capacity to supply 
goods 
the contest wont return enough money to banks or keep it there 
long enough to give the zloty firm backing 
i very much doubt whether a zloty 50000 lottery can ever 
become a substitute for sound government policy approach to 
savings wrote aleksandrowicz 
until then the black market rate by which zlotys are transferred 
to dollars at the rate of 3300 zlotys to the dollar rather than 
the governmentimposed rate of 510 zlotys to the dollar will 
remain so much a part of polish life that the unofficial rate is 
published in legal newspapers

the worlds biggest library hasnt escaped the 
growing epidemic of computer viruses according to a computer 
specialist for the library of congress 
glenn mcloughlin a staff member with the science policy research 
division of the librarys congressional research service disclosed 
thursday that a virus was spotted and killed out of the main catalog 
computer system last fall before it could inflict any damage to data 
files 
it was identified before it could spread or permanently erase 
any data he told a delegation of japanese computer specialists 
touring this country to assess the virus problem 
the library of congress with a staff of about 5000 people 
annually receives more than 1 million books magazines newspapers 
and other items from around the globe it has a variety of computer 
systems to help handle the massive information base 
mcloughlin said the virus was found after personnel logging onto 
computers at the library noticed they had substantially less 
computer memory space to work with than they had expected 
the virus apparently entered the system through a piece of 
software obtained from the university of maryland mcloughlin said 
we dont know whether it was a student at maryland or whether 
maryland had gotten it from somebody else he said that was 
simply the latest point of departure for the software 
viruses are generally small strings of computer code that can be 
stealthily inserted into programs causing various problems 
including destruction of data and sudden clogging of a computers 
memory with thousands of copies of the virus 
another computer security specialist addressing thursdays 
briefing said the world may be heading toward a catastrophic 
computer failure unless more effective measures are taken to combat 
viruses 
professor lance j hoffman of george washington university 
likened the virus which struck the pentagons computer network last 
november to a frightening nuclear accident and said it could have 
had very disastrous consequences for our society 
it wasnt chernobyl yet it was the three mile island it woke 
a lot of people up hoffman said

aviation pioneer sir thomas sopwith the 
adventureloving creator of the famed world war i sopwith camel and 
pup airplanes died today his son said he was 101 
sopwith who taught himself to fly in 1910 and began designing 
airplanes at age 26 died before dawn at his 19th century manor home 
near winchester in southern england his son thomas said 
really he died of old age but hed had a marvelous life 
said thomas sopwith 56 from his office in brighton 
the elder sopwith an accomplished race car driver and yachtsman 
before he discovered his passion for airplanes set several early 
flying records 
we had a lot of crashes in those days but bless you it was 
fun he recalled on his 100th birthday last year this new 
experience of flying was one of the most exhilarating things that 
had ever happened to me 
sir john lidbury a former director of sopwiths hawker siddeley 
aircraft company said he was a wonderful engineer with great 
technical ability and flair everything he put his hand to he did 
thoroughly and well 
more than 16000 sopwith airplanes were built for action in world 
war i including 6000 camels which shot down more enemy aircraft 
than any other allied plane a camel flown by roy brown shot down 
the german baron von richthofen the infamous red baron 
thomas octave murdoch sopwith born in 1888 into a wealthy 
engineering family was 16 when the wright brothers flew under power 
for the first time in the united states 
sopwith loved all racing and became involved with motorcycles 
motorboats ballooning and sailing before taking up flying in 1910 
he bought his first airplane for 630 pounds then worth 3000 
and after two flights as a passenger he taught himself to fly his 
first solo flight ended in a crash but he wasnt injured 
sopwith founded sopwith aviation co in 1912 and gave up piloting 
for design two years later his company created the snipe the pup 
and the camel 
jack bruce an aviation historian said some pilots grew to love 
the camel which he called a neurotically responsive machine 
but only after they had spent time with it 
it was difficult to learn how to handle but once pilots had 
got the hang of it it was quite exceptionally maneuverable he 
told the daily telegraph last year but a lot of pilots were 
petrified at the thought of it 
sopwiths second company founded between the wars took the name 
of his test pilot harry hawker who died in 1921 
in 1936 sopwith gambled by building 1000 of his hurricane 
airplanes without an advance order from the government but the 
plane later became the backbone of the royal air force when world 
war ii broke out 
he retired as chairman of the hawker siddeley group in 1963 
sopwith was married twice and both his wives are deceased 
he is survived by his son

the us economy grew at a robust 38 percent in 1988 the best 
performance in four years as it shook off the effects of the stock 
market crash and the summer drought the government reported today 
the increase in the gross national product the broadest measure 
of economic health was powered by a big improvement in the us 
trade deficit and a sharp increase in business capital investment 
the advance occurred even though growth slowed sharply in the 
fourth quarter of the year from october through december the gnp 
grew at a lackluster annual rate of 2 percent the slowest quarterly 
performance in two years weakness in consumer spending and business 
investment held back growth 
the fourthquarter gnp increase followed a 25 percent rise in 
the julyseptember quarter the 38 percent gnp increase for 1988 
followed a 34 percent rise in 1987 and was the best showing since a 
68 percent rise in 1984 
todays positive economic data came a day after the government 
reported that factory orders for big ticket durable goods surged 
in december 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average surged toward 
the 2300 mark for the first time since the october 1987 market 
crash the widelyfollowed market index rose 2518 to close at 
229107 on thursday 
oil prices tumbled meanwhile because of pessimism over opecs 
ability to control worldwide production 
orders for durable goods jumped 64 percent in december the 
biggest increase since an 87 percent rise last june the commerce 
department said demand for durable goods items expected to last 
three or more years were a seasonally adjusted 13085 billion in 
december 
demand over the 12 months totaled 143 trillion a 108 percent 
increase from 1987 when orders had been up 76 percent over the 
previous year 
analysts said the report showed there are no signs of a slowdown 
in the economy so far in 1989 
economist john hagens of the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa said 
the health of the us manufacturing industry in 1988 showed that 
at a good price us goods can hold their own in the world 
market 
but the prices americans pay for imported goods resumed an upward 
trend in the final three months of 1988 to post a 41 percent 
increase for the year the labor department said in another report 
the labor department said separately that nearly 18 million 
workers covered by major collectivebargaining contracts signed in 
1988 will receive average annual pay raises of 24 percent 
for the first year of those 415 contracts covering bargaining 
units with 1000 or more members the average pay gain is 26 
percent 
in london thursday ministers from six opec nations and seven 
independent oil producers agreed to recommend further steps for 
bolstering world oil prices but stopped short of making specific 
plans for cooperation 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries has been trying 
to enlist the support of nonopec producers since the cartel agreed 
in november to curtail its own production in order to boost prices

a heretical idea is making the rounds of wall 
street these days that credittightening by the federal reserve 
and rising interest rates might actually be good for the stock 
market 
to experienced investors thats a bit like declaring that the 
law of gravity has been repealed 
the suggestion is not only hard to swallow if it is true it 
throws a lot of other basic financial calculations out of whack 
there is an abiding logic to the idea that rising interest rates 
serve as a brake on future economic activity and that they 
simultaneously tend to attract money out of stocks into less risky 
interestbearing investments like treasury bills 
but the experience of the past few months in the financial 
markets hasnt followed the standard script at all 
as shortterm rates in particular have climbed steadily stocks 
have staged a spirited rally climbing back above where they stood 
on the eve of black monday oct 19 1987 when the dow jones 
industrial average fell 508 points 
among the many explanations that have been offered for this 
paradoxical performance the most commonly advanced one says old 
relationships have been distorted by the increasing 
internationalization of the markets 
that has introduced a new variable of increasing importance 
fluctuations in the dollar against other leading currencies 
there is a silver lining to high shortterm interest rates 
said john connolly at dean witter reynolds inc they kept the 
dollar firm even bullish in the face of a surprisingly poor trade 
report issued by the commerce department on jan 18 
that enabled both stocks and bonds to rally 
adds the merrill lynch market letter in its current issue its 
interesting to note that the dollar and the dow jones industrial 
average have been following virtually parallel paths since 
midnovember 
interesting might not be the first word chosen by 
practitioners of the art known as tactical asset allocation the 
dominant approach to decisionmaking in the late 1980s among 
institutional money managers and the brokerage firms that cater to 
them 
asset allocation is a system of shifting money under management 
among stocks bonds and shortterm interestbearing securities 
often based on a computer model that automatically weighs a 
variety of influences 
the typical asset allocation model puts a heavy emphasis on 
interest rates 
as short rates go higher and higher the models allocate less 
and less to equities observed michael sherman at shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
this has worked more often than not but we submit that the 
decade of the 1980s is at variance with postwar experience 
many investors have wondered why bond yields dont rise when 
the fed raises short rates 
the reason is that longterm investors are encouraged by a 
tough fed monetary policy because it assures them that inflation 
wont erode their historically high rate of return 
in the same way holders of us currency are encouraged by the 
prospect of high shortterm interest rates 
all this raises a corollary question if stockmarket investors 
have learned a way to become comfortable with high and rising 
interest rates how might stocks react when the fed loosens credit 
and shortterm rates decline 
many analysts argue that such a setting would be ideal for a 
powerful rally in the stock market others say the optimists cant 
have it both ways benefiting from both rising and falling rates 
as this debate persists some suggest the answer may well be 
provided by currency traders and how they treat the dollar if and 
when interest rates do start to fall

experts from six opec members and seven independent 
oilproducing nations have taken a step toward joint action to 
support oil prices but the move failed to inspire the oil markets 
after a daylong meeting thursday in london the participants 
said they agreed to share responsiblity for ensuring market 
stability and that the nonopec countries supported opecs target 
price of 18 a barrel 
but no specific actions such as production cuts were announced 
oil prices fell immediately on the news but then recovered 
somewhat on friday 
the spot price of north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil stood at 1627 a barrel friday afternoon 
up 2 cents from late thursday 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude was up 9 
cents in early trading today after falling 40 cents on thursday to 
settle at 1772 a barrel 
it was a satisfactory first step but we must keep the momentum 
going organization of petroleum exporting countries 
secretarygeneral subroto said in an interview the atmosphere at 
the meeting was very very encouraging 
the nonopec producers told the opec members that they had agreed 
on a set of actions but that they wished to advise their own 
ministers before revealing them to opec said subroto who chaired 
the meeting of experts 
highlevel opec sources said the nonopec group mentioned the 
idea of a ceiling on their combined output 
the nonopec producers didnt ask for anything from opec in 
return said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
cutting production by 5 percent is an option subroto said 
without elaborating 
nonopec sources had said this week that independent producers 
might offer to cut their production unilaterally by that amount 
this was the second joint meeting of the two sides the closed 
gathering also was attended by observers from an additional six 
independent oil producers 
when they met for the first time in april nonopec producers 
suggested the two sides jointly cut production by 5 percent opec 
refused however 
opec members have expressed resentment that they curb their own 
production to boost oil prices from which the independent 
countries producing what they like benefit unfairly 
at the moment it looks like its nothing concrete so its not 
the most bullish outcome one could have expected said philip 
morgan an oil analyst with the london investment firm citicorp 
scrimgeour vickers even so i think its a positive step and if 
cuts are going to be forthcoming in the second quarter then this 
should protect prices from sliding 
but paul mcdonald a londonbased independent oil analyst said 
yea but what have they done theyve just said theyre in favor 
of higher oil prices 
he described the outcome as opec and nonopec hot air which 
he said was designed to manipulate the oil market into taking prices 
higher 
the two sides issued a joint communique which said the 
independent oil producers supported the opec objective of reaching a 
price of 18 a barrel as soon as possible and both sides agreed 
on the joint responsibility to ensure market stability 
they agreed on the need to take further steps to enhance 
improvements already achieved and to further strengthen the oil 
market especially in the second quarter of 1989 
the communique added that the independent producers agreed to 
recommend to their appropriate authorities the necessary cooperative 
measures to contribute to market stability in the coming months 
the statement didnt specify any measures 
oil ministers from both sides are expected to hold a meeting 
together at a yettobe decided date subroto said 
the particpating opec members were algeria saudi arabia kuwait 
indonesia venezuela and nigeria 
the 13member cartels other members are ecuador gabon libya 
qatar iran iraq and the united arab emirates 
the nonopec group consisted of representatives of angola china 
colombia egypt malaysia mexico and oman and observers from the 
soviet union norway the yemen arab republic and the canadian 
province of alberta and the us states of alaska and texas 
opec members agreed in november to limit their production to 185 
million barrels a day in an effort to boost prices to a targeted 18 
a barrel the agreement was effective jan 1 
opec members are producing an estimated 195 million barrels a 
day down as much as 35 million barrels a day from the fourth 
quarter that has helped oil prices recover from around 12 a barrel 
in december

federal prosecutors offered a 
pleabargain deal to drexel burnham lamberts senior junkbond 
trader michael milken two weeks ago but his lawyers rejected it 
immediately and vowed to fight them in court sources familiar with 
the discussions said today 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said 
milkens defense team did not initiate the meeting with manhattan 
us attorney rudolph giulianis office 
but the contact marked the first time both sides have discussed a 
possible bargain since drexel and milken were embroiled in the wall 
street corruption scandal in late 1986 by nowimprisoned speculator 
ivan f boesky 
milken head of drexels highyield junk bond trading desk in 
beverly hills calif is one of the most dynamic and wealthy 
financiers in the country he is largely credited with vaulting 
drexel into a securities superpower 
drexel capitulated to prosecutors last month and agreed to plead 
guilty to six felonies pay 650 million in fines fire milken and 
cooperate in the governments case against him 
the 42yearold financier is facing asyet unfiled fraud and 
racketeering charges that carry enormous prison terms and financial 
penalties 
the us attorneys office requested a meeting one of the 
sources familiar with the recent contact said milkens attorneys 
went to the meeting the us attorney made a proposal and it was 
rejected 
aides to giuliani said they could not comment on whether such a 
meeting took place but it is not uncommon for targets of 
racketeering indictments to discuss possible settlement discussions 
before the charges are filed 
milken spokesman kenneth lerer also declined to comment on the 
meeting but said in a statement there are no discussions going on 
between the us attorneys office and mike milkens attorneys no 
discussions whatsoever 
for the past 27 months mikes position has remained unchanged 
he will vigorously fight any charges brought against him and his 
lawyers are preparing his defense 
it was unclear what giuliani offered milken to induce him to 
settle he has maintained he did nothing wrong and a turnaround at 
this point would mark a stunning reversal by a major target in what 
has become the biggest securities fraud case in history 
the wall street journal quoting unidentified sources reported 
today that prosecutors said milken would have to plead guilty to two 
felonies with a maximum fiveyear penalty for each count 
but the paper said the deal didnt include immunity for milkens 
brother lowell another senior drexel aide who also is facing 
probable indictment milkens associates said thursday it was 
unlikely he would strike a plea bargain despite the enormous 
pressure he is facing to change his mind 
court papers revealed wednesday that terms of the settlement 
require drexel to dismiss milken and withhold the 1988 compensation 
due him estimated at 200 million his lawyers said the terms 
amount to an outrageous disgraceful and illegal punishment which 
they indicated would be challenged in court 
for milken the crisis hes facing represents far more than loss 
of a job with a personal wealth estimated by forbes magazine at 
800 million and an undisputed knack for making money he can 
survive the loss financially 
but the accusations against him have cast a cloud over a 
remarkable career that revolves around his virtually singlehanded 
creation of the market in highyield highrisk junk bonds 
they also have brought attention and sympathy from the many who 
know milken as a devoted family man attentive friend and donor of 
millions of dollars to charity 
their portrayal stands in sharp contrast to the portrayal of 
milken by government investigators as a scheming manipulative 
arrogant and greedy trader who colluded with boesky to violate a 
range of securities laws 
my sense of things is this is a man who thinks he has done 
nothing to blacken his familys name and thats important to him 
hes very resolute said jesse kornbluth a vanity fair writer who 
spent many hours with milken last summer while preparing an article 
and still chats with him frequently by telephone 
i expect him to fight it said clark johnson president and 
chief executive officer of pier 1 imports which has financed 
expansion with the help of milken and drexel 
drexel is expected to survive the loss of milken who with his 
junk bond traders transformed the firm from an insignificant 
brokerage house to a powerful force on wall street milken once the 
prime mover in the junk bond market is no longer indispensable 
analysts said

the threat of prison and other penalties 
encouraged at least 30 suspects to cooperate with federal agents in 
their massive investigation of alleged fraud at two major futures 
exchanges a newspaper reported today 
traders and brokers who agreed to cooperate are expected to name 
alleged coconspirators and broaden the potential targets of the 
twoyear investigation the chicago tribune reported 
no one wants to be left holding the bag the newspaper quoted 
an unidentified source as saying 
subpoenas to appear before a grand jury have been served on more 
than 200 prominent brokers traders and trading firms associated 
with the chicago board of trade and at the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
one defense attorney told the tribune that his client offered to 
provide the fbi with evidence that 20 associates cheated customers 
on their trades at the exchanges 
prosecutors and the fbi repeatedly have refused to comment on the 
investigation 
the suspects who are cooperating believed to number at least 30 
could escape racketeering charges in exchange for guilty pleas to 
lesser offenses the newspaper reported a racketeering conviction 
could result in the federal government confiscating a traders seat 
on the exchange and other assets exchange seats can be worth 
hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in addition to the brokers and traders the futures industry 
itself is under scrutiny although federal regulators caution 
against any hasty reforms 
the best way to make mistakes is to try to fix something before 
you know whats wrong kate hathaway spokeswoman for the 
commodity futures trading commission said thursday 
the cftc the independent federal agency established to regulate 
the commodities markets has come under criticism by traders and 
others following disclosure last week of the investigation in which 
undercover fbi agents posed as traders secretly recording floor 
conversations 
some knowledgable observers say the investigation is likely to 
result in restrictions on some kinds of trading closer monitoring 
of traders and a more precise audit trail they also suggest the 
cftc has been lax in preventing abuses and catching violators from 
the outset 
i dont think it the investigation calls the system into 
question as much as it does the controls on the system said fred 
white who once worked for the cftc and is now an attorney 
representing trading firms 
it should not have been the us attorneys office white 
said it clearly should have been the cftc 
in response ms hathaway said we have been involved from the 
beginning of this investigation and im really nonplussed 
i dont see that theres any reason that this should be 
translated into criticism of the cftc she added 
the chicago mercantile exchange on wednesday appointed a panel of 
industry and nonindustry representatives to review all transaction 
rules there and recommend revisions and improvements officials of 
the chicago board of trade have announced no plans for a review 
the mercs review echoes similar selfexaminations that the 
futures exchanges undertook following the october 1987 stock market 
collapse when critics blamed stockindex futures trading for market 
volatility that may have worsened the crash 
then the merc and chicago board of trade produced reports and 
figures aimed at showing their markets were blameless they 
contended that futures selling actually provided an outlet that 
prevented the crash from getting worse 
at the time the selfreviews by the futures exchanges and 
similar examinations by the stock markets were widely seen as 
attempts to clean their own houses and forestall more government 
regulation 
the chicago suntimes reported today that fbi agents caught 
traders and brokers shouting and signaling wildly as they faked 
hundreds of floor trades that had been secretly rigged ahead of 
time the newspaper said federal sources whom it did not name said 
the prearranged trades at rigged prices were used to cheat investors 
out of millions of dollars 
theres a lot of shouting and screaming that goes on out on the 
exchange floors but that shouting and screaming is a coverup for a 
lot of cheating said one trader who asked not to be identified 
the merc got a boost thursday however when members of the new 
york mercantile exchange voted to join globex the mercs 
computerized trading system 
obviously its got to be a shot in the arm said a spokesman 
for the merc 
globex is a project of the merc and reuters of america inc it is 
scheduled for a trial run this summer

toyota motor corp japans largest automaker is 
studying the possibility of building a factory in britain to produce 
passenger cars by 1992 toyota president shoichiro toyoda said 
friday 
toyota has been considering european car production for some 
time toyoda said at a news conference we are starting indepth 
feasibility studies with britain as a strong candidate for a site 
for our car production in europe it does not mean we have made a 
final decision 
the study will examine plans for production of 1800cubic 
centimeter cars at the rate of 200000 per year toyoda said the 
factory would employ about 3000 workers and represent an investment 
of 140 billion yen or about 11 billion he said 
toyota executive vice president tsutomu ohshima said the company 
will consider the option in britain first before others we 
have he described the feasibility study as an assessment to 
make it production in europe possible not just to see our chance 
with the project 
toyota ranked third in worldwide auto production after general 
motors corp and ford motor co would be the second japanese 
automaker to produce cars on its own in britain after nissan motor 
co which started production in 1986 honda motor co sells hondas 
in britain manufactured by the austin rover group 
toyota reportedly also has been examining the possibility of 
setting up operations in belgium portugal or spain asked why the 
firm was focusing on britain toyoda said britain is a leading 
member of the european economic community and the government has 
shown us that we would be welcome 
in london british secretary of state for trade and industry lord 
young said in a statement i have made it clear to toyota that 
they would receive a warm welcome from the government if they were 
to decide to locate the project in the uk and i have invited them 
to work closely with my department in pursuing their feasibility 
studies 
the automaker has not discussed tax breaks or other incentives 
with the british government managing director juji numata told 
reporters 
toyotas announcment is not unexpected and is consistent with 
the existing trend of all japanese automakers said an auto 
industry analyst at a major securities firm 
toyota is notable by its absence from the eec said the 
analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity toyota has been the 
most laggard but it certainly has the capability with 2 trillion 
yen or 155 billion in cash assets at its disposal 
toyotas announcement comes amid concern in japan over the 
creation of the 12nation european economic communitys single 
market in 1992 
the single market aims through harmonization of tax laws and 
other measures to establish a free flow of goods among eec nations 
many imports from noneec countries including japan are expected 
to be subject to new eec restrictions from 1992

the us economy shook off the effects of the 
stock market crash and the drought to grow at a robust 38 percent 
in 1988 the best performance in four years the government reported 
today 
the increase in the gross national product the broadest measure 
of economic health was powered by a big improvement in the us 
trade deficit and a sharp increase in business capital investment 
the advance occurred even though growth slowed sharply in the 
final three months of the year from october through december the 
gnp grew at a lackluster annual rate of 2 percent the slowest 
quarterly performance in two years weakness in consumer spending 
and business investment held back growth 
the fourthquarter gnp increase followed a 25 percent rise in 
the julyseptember quarter 
many economists predict these trends will intensify this year and 
will result in sharply lower growth for 1989 that would give 
president bush a major headache because his hopes of lowering the 
budget deficit without an increase in taxes rests on expectations of 
continued strong economic growth 
but commerce undersecretary robert ortner briefing reporters 
about the gnp report said he believed the growth forecasts used in 
the reagan administration budget were realistic he said some of the 
sluggishness in the fourth quarter was based on temporary factors 
that would not last into the new year 
ortner said there were several positive economic developments 
during 1988 
we made significant progress in reducing the trade defict the 
unemployment rate dropped to a 14year low and the stock market 
began a sustained recovery from its plunge in late 1987 he said 
the 38 percent gnp increase for 1988 followed a 34 percent rise 
in 1987 and was the best showing since a 68 percent rise in 1984 
higher inflation accompanied the increase in growth an inflation 
index tied to the gnp rose by 42 percent in 1988 the fastest rise 
in prices since 1982 
the jump in inflation up from a 1987 price increase of 36 
percent has set off alarm bells at the federal reserve board which 
has been driving interest rates higher in an effort to dampen demand 
and keep inflationary pressures in check 
bush complained this week that the fed should not grow so 
concerned about fighting inflation that it risks slowing economic 
growth but many analysts believe the boards inflationfighting 
efforts will continue and push interest rates even higher 
the 38 percent gnp increase in 1988 was a far cry from what many 
analysts had forecast when the year began the most pessimistic of 
them had predicted the economy would be in a recession before years 
end brought on by a cutback in consumer spending as a result of 
fears triggered by the october 1987 stock market crash 
instead consumers kept right on spending with personal 
consumption purchases rising by 28 percent during the whole year 
almost half of all growth in 1988 came from two related factors 
a big improvement in the countrys trading performance and the 
biggest rise in business investment spending since 1984 
for the year us exports sales rose a sharp 177 percent 
offsetting an 83 percent increase in imports as the weaker dollar 
made americanmade goods competitive on overseas markets 
responding to this increased demand american businesses boosted 
spending on new plants and equipment by 95 percent a sharp 
acceleration from a 28 percent rise the previous year 
however in the fourth quarter the trade deficit began rising 
again and business investment actually fell while analysts are 
looking for small improvements in both areas this year they say 
growth there will not come anywhere near matching the 1988 
performance 
for that reason many economists are predicting that 1989 gnp 
growth will be much slower than the 38 percent increase in 1988 
the reagan administration based its fiscal 1990 budget forecast 
on an estimate that the gnp would grow 32 percent in the current 
year bushs budget director richard darman has said the new 
administration will accept that economic forecast when bush submits 
his own budget on feb 9 
however private economists believe that growth in 1989 will rise 
by only 27 percent more than a percentage point lower than the 
1988 level 
this slowdown will occur despite the fact that the drought will 
no longer be depressing growth as it did in 1988 when it shaved 04 
percentage point from overall growth without the drought the gnp 
would have risen by 42 percent in 1988 
the various changes left the gnp at 3995 trillion for all of 
1988 after removing the effcts of inflation

the drive by the farmers home administration to 
collect more than 8 billion in longoverdue accounts is running 
into administrative snarls that some critics say will be impossible 
to untangle soon 
delinquent farm borrowers were given 45 days to respond to 
collection notices sent in late november farmers had to fill out 
long forms and return them to fmha to qualify for loan servicing 
if the forms were not returned on time borrowers were told they 
could face foreclosure or forced sale to take care of the debts 
neal sox johnson acting administrator of the agriculture 
department agency told the senate agriculture committees 
subcommittee on agricultural credit last week that the agencys 
latest tabulation showed that 70747 notices were sent out by 
certified mail by fmha county offices nov 1525 
a total of 34719 or less than half were returned with requests 
for loan servicing under the agricultural credit act of 1987 which 
provides a number of options including a writedown of debt 
johnson told the panel headed by sen david boren dokla that 
it had not determined why the others were not returned but he said 
the 36028 who did not reply would be notified again by regular mail 
and given a 45day period in which to respond 
we are at the point where our field staff must analyze those 
applications that have been received so that those borrowers can 
receive a decision within 60 days as set forth in the statute 
johnson said i am sure you understand the complex nature of many 
of these individual cases especially those that have been in a 
questionable status for a considerable period of time 
johnson said fmha was aware that farmers need those decisions 
promptly in order to make plans for the coming crop year he also 
noted that fmha has 183000 other borrowers who are not delinquent 
and that those will require attention for spring planting 
leland h swenson president of the national farmers union told 
borens subcommittee he doubted that fmha would be able to process 
the workload within 60 days as required by law and still work out 
the best deal for the borrower lender and the taxpayer 
it is inconceivable to us how with all the restructuring 
applications coming in at roughly the same time agency employees 
can be expected to meet their deadlines and still provide the kind 
of interactive negotiated process that congress envisioned and seek 
out the leastcost alternative for resolving a debt problem he 
said 
swenson added it reminds me of trying to put 10 gallons of 
manure in a fivegallon pail 
fmhas johnson said he would send loan specialists from the 
agencys national headquarters to state offices to hold 
onthespot reviews and consultation on carrying out the laws 
provisions for restructuring 
all of us at farmers home are committed to working closely with 
our borrowers in carrying out the mandates of the law in an 
efficient and compassionate manner johnson said our efforts 
are and will be directed toward keeping our borrowers on the farm 
to the fullest extent possible 
boren the subcommittee chairman said the fmha had not followed 
the intent of the senate in administering the 1987 law and chided 
johnson for the number of forms the agency required farmers to fill 
out 
the law says you farmers have to sign a letter within a 
45day period not fill out several forms boren said he said he 
would ask clayton yeutter agriculture secretarydesignate to give 
higher priority to solving fmhas problems

president bush sought today to reassure nervous 
savings and loan customers about the safety of their deposits but 
he said the idea of a deposit insurance fee to help solve the crisis 
remains under consideration 
the savings and loans deposits are backed by the full faith and 
credit of the government and they are sound they are good bush 
told reporters at his first white house news conference i want to 
assure the american people of that and thats not going to change 
bush said he has made no decision concerning the treasury 
departments suggestion that one way to raise money for the 
government insurance fund backing sampl deposits would be a fee of 
about 25 cents on every 100 in federally insured sampl bank and 
credit union accounts 
there seems to be some controversy around it the deposit fee 
option but that doesnt mean that any thinking along those lines 
should cease the president said 
bush brushed off the question of whether the fee would violate 
his no new taxes pledge saying ive been around for a long 
time i dont remember hearing people talk about the fee that went 
into the fdic or fslic insurance funds as a tax 
meanwhile the top federal sampl regulator said some nervous 
customers are withdrawing money from savings and loans because of 
the deposit fee trial balloon 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board said 
in an interview thursday with the associated press that there is 
nervousness based on a misunderstanding of what has been discussed 
weve had problems since yesterday wednesday wall said 
there have been cases where they say i dont like what i heard 
on tv im taking my money out 
no sampls are in trouble as a result of depositors reaction he 
said but im concerned that people dont cause themselves losses 
by cashing in a cd certificate of deposit early and thus 
incurring penalties 
wall stressed that the administration is only examining the 
deposit fee option at this stage not proposing one and the fee 
would apply to all federally insured institutions including banks 
and credit unions 
karl hoyle a bank board spokesman said the agency surveyed sampls 
thursday night and found no outflows of any significance that we 
can attribute to anything thats been said 
he said the bank boards chief worry is not concern about 
whats been happening its concern about what might happen 
hoyle said the bank board is trying to emphasize to worried 
depositors that the debate within congress and the administration is 
not about whether additional money should be spent to protect 
deposits but about how it should be raised 
earlier in testimony before the house budget committee wall 
said only that there are clearly better ideas for raising money 
than a deposit fee he said if one were imposed it should be broadly 
based applying also to money market mutual funds offered by 
brokerage firms 
on a related topic wall said today that some accountants have 
admitted involving themselves improperly with management of savings 
and loan institutions they were auditing to declare them financially 
healthy 
wall speaking on nbcs today show said in some cases 
auditors simply did not do a good enough job in seeking to determine 
if a particular institution was financially healthy 
however he said in some cases it is clearly individuals who 
happen to be employees of some of the accounting firms who 
were involved in these undertakings with the management of the 
institution all of them setting out to do wrong 
we have had some settlements in terms of the allegations 
where people have admitted to involvement he said 
in his congressional testimony thursday wall said the bank board 
was suing accounting firms including three of the socalled big 
eight firms for failing to uncover losses and abuses in sampls that 
later failed 
he did not identify the three firms but bank board spokesman 
william fulwider said the fslic has sued two deloitte haskins and 
sells and touche ross and co the insurance fund got jurisdiction 
over a third suit against coopers amp lybrand after taking over the 
insolvent sampl that filed it 
thomas kelley of the american institute of certified public 
accountants insisted in a today interview the accounting 
profession is not responsible for the savings and loan crisis 
auditors dont give clean bills of health secondly what they do is 
report on the fairness of the financial statements 
on a related topic wall is taking issue with the general 
accounting office which told the budget committee that savings and 
loan regulators are heading for a cash crunch 
the gao an auditing and investigative agency for congress said 
the government insurance fund for sampls has made financial 
commitments that on a preliminary basis appear to exceed by about 
26 billion its expected cash flows over the next 10 years 
wall said in the interview with the ap we have not exceeded 
our cash flow but acknowledged that the insurance fund could very 
soon be overcommitted if regulators continued their current pace of 
closing and merging insolvent sampls 
he said the bank board spent or promised to spend 38 billion 
last year to resolve the cases of 205 sampls and temporarily 
stabilize 18 others about 350 other insolvent institutions 
remain open it will cost about 35 billion to close them the gao 
estimates 
wall while maintaining his agency was not overcommitted said 
that unless congress acts quickly to earmark more money toward the 
crisis his agency may have to leave hundreds of insolvent 
institutions open

president bush today said he could suppport an 
increased minimum wage but only if congress also established a 
subminimum training wage he said would prevent a loss of jobs 
ive always said that my position on minimum wage is that i 
would want it linked to a training wage to a differential of sorts 
so that you dont throw people out of work by raising the minimum 
wage bush said at a white house news conference 
bush said he had a certain flexibility on the question and 
would await the recommendations of labor secretary elizabeth dole 
at no point did he say outright that he supported raising the 
minumum wage which has been 335 an hour since 1981 
the presidents comments came a day after mrs dole told the 
senate labor committee that bushs support of legislation to raise 
the minimum wage would hinge on whether lawmakers included a 
training wage in the legislation 
bushs stand puts him in opposition to the head of the labor 
committee edward m kennedy who said thursday he remained opposed 
to a training wage and was confident his bill to raise the minimum 
hourly wage from 335 an hour to 455 would pass this year 
bush during the presidential campaign said in one interview that 
he supported some increase in the minimum wage provided it was 
coupled with the training wage although at other times his campaign 
said bush was against an increase 
mrs dole sworn in to her cabinet post four hours before the 
hearing was not specific as to how high bush favors raising the 
minimum wage or what kind of time limit to set on the training wage 
employers would be limited as to the length of time they could pay 
the training wage to a new worker 
we have really not at this point had an opportunity to work 
through the legislative agenda so i do want an opportunity to go 
through this before i get into any great detail of what he is 
willing to support mrs dole said 
were going to get it raised this year for sure kennedy 
dmass said at the hearing which he called to assess the impact 
of projected labor shortages and the prospect of averting them by 
training welfare recipients and lowerincome workers for highskills 
jobs 
mrs dole said she could help erase the socalled skills gap 
in the american labor force by working to better coordinate the 
numerous jobtraining programs of government agencies and placing an 
emphasis on training the poor and unemployed 
minorities the disadvantaged persons with disabilities and 
other groups traditionally left behind will be in demand by 
employers as never before but only if they are qualified mrs 
dole said 
in a brief interview after the hearing kennedy who introduced 
his minimum wage bill wednesday said my views havent changed 
and that he would try to get the bill through the senate without a 
provision for a training wage 
organized labor supports the increased minimum wage but opposes 
the training wage in part because it believes some employers would 
use the lower wage to cut their costs by hiring people at the 
training wage and laying off higherpaid workers mrs dole said she 
would support adding language to the legislation to prevent that 
kennedys bill would raise the minimum wage from 335 an hour 
its level since 1981 to 455 in three annual increases of 40 cents 
an hour the wage then would be indexed to 50 percent of the hourly 
average income for us workers a similar bill has been introduced 
in the house

britains merchandise deficit narrowed more sharply 
than expected to 166 billion pounds or 294 billion in december 
the government said friday providing further evidence that the 
countrys overheated economy is slowing down 
the news eased fears that british interest rates would be pushed 
higher the pound surprisingly rallied to 17688 following the 
1130 am report but finished the day lower at 17655 down from 
17730 late thursday 
stock prices surged and the financial timesstock exchange 
100share index rose 461 points or 24 percent to close at 
20059 
despite the december improvement britains trade deficit for the 
year more than doubled to 2034 billion pounds or 36 billion and 
the countrys trade picture was much worse than the conservative 
governments chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson has forecast 
the 1988 deficit was attacked by opposition labor member of 
parliament bryan gould who serves as his partys trade spokesman 
these figures complete the worst year in our trading history they 
also show that any prospect of improvement in 1989 looks very 
remote 
john smith who serves as the labor partys spokesman on treasury 
matters called the deficit the awful legacy of last years 
taxcutting budget he said it was being made worse by lawsons 
reliance on interest rates to head off inflationary pressure 
the december narrowing came as exports rose 3 percent and imports 
held steady the department of trade and industry said 
the financial markets had been expecting a deficit of 149 
billion pounds 264 billion 
the narrowing indicates a slowdown in economic growth and should 
help to reduce the pressure on the government to signal the 
commercial banks to raise their base lending rates from their 
current 13 percent level said ian harwood a british economist at 
the london investment firm warburg securities 
the news should prove more bearish for the pound in the longer 
run harwood said 
this pound rally is just a kneejerk reaction he said 
people are going to be increasingly saying that 13 percent is 
the peak for base rates he said 
the seasonally adjusted deficit for december compared with a 
revised deficit of 187 billion pounds in november and a deficit of 
124 billion pounds in december 1987 the department said 
with decembers invisible trade which covers services overseas 
investment earnings and official transfer payments estimated to be 
in surplus by 400 million pounds britains current account showed a 
deficit of 126 billion pounds in december compared with a revised 
deficit of 147 billion pounds in november and a deficit of 802 
million pounds in december 1987 
the markets had expected the current account deficit to come to 
between 11 billion pounds and 18 billion pounds 
exports totaled 712 billion pounds in december up from 691 
billion pounds in november 
imports totaled 878 billion pounds in december little changed 
from 877 billion pounds in november 
britains 1988 merchandise trade deficit of 2034 billion pounds 
compared with a deficit of 1016 billion pounds in 1987 
the 1988 current account was 1427 billion pounds compared with 
a deficit of 269 billion pounds a year earlier 
the 1988 current account deficit was well above lawsons forecast 
of 13 billion pounds

the governments 85 billion program to clean 
up hundreds of the nations worst toxic waste dumps is coming under 
renewed criticism in congress for missing deadlines and being too 
lenient with polluters 
two separate reports released by members of congress took the 
environmental protection agency to task thursday for its management 
of the superfund program which earmarks hundreds of millions of 
dollars a year for waste cleanup 
epa officials blamed budget cuts imposed by congress for part of 
the agencys problems in meeting some of the deadlines cited 
thursday reacting to a number of critical reports on superfund 
congress last year cut its budget by 175 million it is also 
threatening to cut funding this year 
superfund is simply not working as congress intended said 
rep bob traxler dmich chairman of the appropriations 
subcommittee that oversees the epas budget 
instead of a strong enforcement program forcing responsible 
parties to undertake their own cleanups superfund has taken on a 
public works flavor with epa relying primarily on national 
contractors paid with trust fund dollars he continued 
the epa is supposed to have started an actual cleanup of 175 
sites by next october but likely will begin no more than 160 partly 
because of the budget reduction said winston porter the epa 
assistant administrator in charge of the superfund program 
according to the general accounting office the investigative arm 
of congress 41 of the 87 congressionally imposed deadlines that 
relate to superfund have not been met or are not likley to be met 
forty of those deadlines apply to the epa while the others apply to 
other federal or state agencies 
a gao report released thursday by sen frank lautenberg dnj 
suggested that in some cases the delays may be placing human 
health in jeopardy through needlessly prolonged exposure to 
hazardous substances 
porter acknowledged that many of the deadlines have been missed 
but insisted that the agency is meeting essentially all the major 
ones including most of those that deal directly with site cleanup 
work 
he called suggestions that the delays are posing health risks as 
total nonsense 
a study by traxlers subcommittee questioned whether the 
superfund program can succeed without fundamental changes in 
management philosophy and approach 
the appropriations subcommittee found that epa has 
failed to press private companies to clean up waste dumps 
turning instead to private contractors who are paid directly from 
the federal trust fund which is financed largely by a tax on the 
chemical industry 
not aggressively sought to recover cleanup costs from private 
companies 
tended to study sites endlessly leading to a paralysis by 
analysis and delaying cleanup programs 
failed to develop new costeffective cleanup technologies that 
would permanently treat wastes 
instead of just pushing waste from one site to another we need 
to develop technologies for permanent treatment said rep bill 
green of new york the subcommittees ranking republican 
the superfund established in the early 1980s initially 
authorized 16 billion over four years and was later reauthorized 
with an additional 85 billion over five years although 175 
million was cut last year 
the epa has earmarked about 1200 sites that the agency says will 
require cleaning up under the program a number that could grow to 
2000 or more according to congressional staffers 
the reagan administration budget proposes spending 175 billion 
in fiscal l990 for superfund cleanup an increase of 325 million 
over this year but traxler suggested that without major changes in 
the program the epa may not get the funds it wants

its a time of grumbling for many in the broad 
japanese middle class who have been excluded from the boom of the 
late 1980s 
squeezed by high prices and unlucky in not owning land these 
people are voicing a dissatisfaction that the government worries 
may fuel a sense of injustice and upset the social unity of postwar 
japan 
about 90 percent of all japanese are considered part of the 
middle class janitors factory workers and office clerks alike 
dress the part as they travel to and from work 
middleclass conformity was reinforced for decades by small gaps 
in income and by social values that discouraged flaunting wealth 
but skyrocketing land prices due to financial speculation and 
strong demand for office and residential space have made those who 
own real estate enormously wealthy while others have abandoned 
hopes of homeownership 
residential land prices in tokyo home to onetenth of japans 
122 million people rose 688 percent in 1987 after climbing 405 
percent in 1986 the average price of an 874 squarefoot condominium 
now is nearly 500000 or seven times the disposable annual income 
of an average family of four according to an economic planning 
agency report 
in most european or american cities the cost is only four times 
annual earnings and the living space at least twice as large 
californians last summer complained that the median cost of a home 
had risen to 160000 less than onethird the cost of the average 
apartment in tokyo 
firsttime home purchases are almost impossible in large cities 
like tokyo while the national home ownership rate is 62 percent in 
tokyo it is 44 percent 
about 70 percent of japanese in surveys say they want to own 
their homes even if its inconveniently far from work but more 
than half of the 20 to 40yearold men say theyve given up 
the proportion of tokyo households expecting to eventually buy a 
home fell from 33 percent in 1977 to 15 percent in 1987 
rents average 500 a month for about 500 square feet those who 
bought suburban homes before the recent surge in land prices pay 
about 600 a month on mortgages some run for as long as 75 years 
and spend three to five hours commuting each day 
some snapshots of the harried middle class 
emiko shiroishi 30 her small daughter and husband pay 600 a 
month for a 450squarefoot threeroom apartment in northern tokyo 
hoping to eventually buy an apartment outside the city 
company worker hiroto furukawa 38 lives with his wife and 
three children in a slightly larger apartment about an hour outside 
tokyo he bought before the recent surge in prices and is paying a 
35year mortgage 
toshihide tabe a company employee complains in a letter to the 
asahi shumbun newspaper that in his family we are still hounded 
by housing car and education loans salary earners are all in 
the same boat 
tokyo homeowners held real estate averaging nearly 700000 in 
value in 1987 said a government study concluding that the gap 
between haves and havenots is inciting a growing sense of injustice 
of japans 100 top incomeearners last year 77 were involved in 
real estate deals tax officials say timber firm president hajime 
kitami 53 topped the list with 536 million in income much of it 
from land sales 
rising educational costs and the need to save for retirement 
squeeze most japanese harder families paid an average 106 a month 
on educational costs in 1987 a figure that escalates as children 
approach college age 
once average people like us pay our rent and taxes theres 
hardly enough left to eat lots of people really have to watch their 
pennies and scrimp to get by says 60yearold fumiteru shimizu 
only in japan can people work hard for 30 years and not be able 
to afford to buy even a small house shimizu says 
the mainichi shimbun newspaper commented one factor which has 
made japan relatively stable socially and economically has been the 
sense of equality among the people income assets and the standard 
of living are no longer perceived as level is this not 
signaling that our social stability is beginning to shake those who 
are responsible for tax agricultural and administrative reforms 
should take the signal seriously 
the trends alarm the government which despite its strengths has 
failed to manage well one of japans scarcest resources land the 
gap in net worth between those who own land and those who do not is 
widening creating a feeling of social inadequacy said a recent 
government land report 
labor unions and business circles are pressing for improvements 
in living standards 
while japans per capita national income is about 16000 the 
worlds highest the japanese people can scarcely be said to enjoy 
a quality of life that compares with the living standards of other 
industrial nations said toshikuni yahiro vice chairman of the 
japan federation of economic organizations in a policy proposal to 
the government last fall 
yahiro partly blamed regulations that protect such special 
interest groups as farmers and retailers 
japanese consumers pay five to six times what americans pay for 
rice and nine times what they pay for beef according to a survey by 
the japan federation of employers associations 
the fact that prices in japan are fairly stable is no excuse 
for overlooking their grossly high level the asahi shimbun said 
in an editorial entitled get angry japanese consumers

swiss authorities on friday ordered bank 
records linked to the unfolding insider trading scandal in france to 
be turned over to us investigators who uncovered the affair 
the us securities and exchange commission last tuesday had 
asked the swiss federal office of police affairs to help in the 
pechineytriangle probe by ordering a suspension of strict banking 
secrecy rules 
approval of the us request also means that any assets frozen in 
bank accounts in switzerland could be turned over to the united 
states once the investigators submit more detailed allegations on 
the size and location of funds 
swiss justice ministry sources said the order applies to 
documents on blocked accounts at five swiss banks and two financial 
services companies the accounts were frozen after a preliminary 
us intervention with bern last month 
all parties concerned have 10 days to appeal the order 
fridays action was the first on a judicial help request 
concerning insider trading since strengthened swiss legislation took 
effect last july 1 part of the legislations aim was to avoid past 
tension with us authorities in international probes 
under a swissus treaty judicial assistance can only be 
granted when alleged offenses are criminal in both countries 
fridays justice ministry statement noted that france to date has 
not asked for swiss judicial aid 
the affair involves allegations that people with confidential 
advance information made huge illegal stock market profits when the 
french stateowned aluminum company pechiney bought out usbased 
triangle industries last november 
close associates of french president francois mitterrand have 
been implicated in the affair which has preoccupied the socialist 
government 
finance minister pierre beregovoy called thursday for a complete 
criminal probe into the allegations 
the sec alerted french authorities after noticing abnormally 
heavy purchases of triangle shares in the week before pechiney 
publicly launched its successful takeover bid nov 21 
pechiney ultimately bought triangle the former parent of 
american national can corp for 56 a share nearly six times their 
value a week before

futures prices of grains and soybeans were mostly 
lower in lackluster trading friday at the chicago board of trade 
a flurry of selling on technical market factors by big brokerage 
houses kept the lid on wheat and soybean futures and further 
pressure came from a bearish weather forecast said victor 
lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
a weekend forecast for cropenhancing rain in the nations 
winterwheat growing regions sparked some selling in wheat futures 
he said 
losses in corn futures were tempered by optimism that the 
russians will be coming in to buy more corn lespinasse said 
at the close of trading wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in march at 441 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 1 cent lower with the march contract at 271 a

as americas automobile dealers gather for 
their annual convention many of them are wondering whether 
washington will take action that could cause prices of popular 
sportutility vehicles and vans will soar 
more than 20000 dealers and others connected with the industry 
get together this weekend through tuesday for the 72nd national 
automobile dealers association convention 
the group will install its new president for 1989 ron tonkin of 
ron tonkin dealerships in portland ore tonkin not known to mince 
words will take office at the close of the convention tuesday and 
is expected to issue a strong call for increased unity among the 
dealers to stand up against the automakers 
united the dealers have more net worth than general motors by 
far he said in a preconvention interview our job is to 
harness that horsepower 
but on the minds of many dealers is a proposal for the treasury 
department to boost the tariff on imported sportutility vehicles 
and some vans to 25 percent of their cost 
us manufacturers support and overseas companies oppose the 
move which could limit the influx of foreignmade versions of the 
hotselling vehicles 
earlier this month the chairmen of general motors corp ford 
motor co and chrysler corp asked treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady in an unusual joint letter to uphold a customs service 
recommendation that would classify sportutility vehicles and some 
other vehicles as trucks that would make the vehicles subject to a 
25 percent tariff instead of the 25 percent fee charged on imported 
cars 
the executives gms roger b smith fords donald petersen and 
chryslers lee iacocca said if the increased fee is not charged it 
would cause substantial harm to the us motor vehicle industry 
deprive the us treasury of several hundred million dollars in 
anticipated tariff revenues and unleash a long battle in the courts 
and in congress to restore a clear and consistent rule 
the dealers feel differently 
auto dealers increasingly are diversifying their product lines 
ford chevrolet and dodge dealers for instance more frequently 
offer imported cars and trucks as a hedge against a downturn in the 
us industry and to lure more customers to their showrooms 
many of the foreign automakers produce sportutility vehicles 
similar to the american jeeps prices of the imported versions range 
from less than 8495 for a suzuki samurai to more than 35800 for 
the range rover from england 
the american international automobile dealers association said 
imposing the 25percent tariff would harm its 9000 members and the 
public the organization claims the tariff will add an average 
2500 to the cost of each imported van or sportutility vehicle 
which make up about 18 percent of total import sales and about 30 
percent of the profits of dealers who sell them 
the group and some dealers also have speculated that if the 
tariff is approved the big three us automakers wont be able to 
resist the opportunity to raise their prices somewhat less than 25 
percent to increase profits

the pace is frenzied the stakes high the players 
often young and the opportunity for clandestine cheating ripe at the 
nations largest futures exchanges where the sometimessleazy 
workings have been bared in a federal investigation of alleged fraud 
even discreet dealings are under scrutiny by investigators 
examining mountains of documents subpoenaed in the probe of the 
chicago mercantile exchange and chicago board of trade where 
fortunes are made and lost betting on the future prices of 
everything from pig bellies to treasury bonds 
more than 200 traders brokers and financial firms also have been 
subpoenaed and fear has pervaded trading pits where millions of 
dollars in commodities futures are bought and sold daily 
federal officials are refusing to comment but the investigation 
reportedly centers on allegations that as many as 100 brokers and 
traders systematically cheated customers and profited themselves in 
illegal trades 
the probe hasnt produced indictments yet but insiders predict 
it will wipe out fortunes and could lead to sweeping changes in one 
of chicagos most vital and oldest industries 
those caught in the fbi trap could face charges ranging from 
fraud to racketeering said harvey silets an attorney for 
subpoenaed traders at both exchanges 
its going to be bad said a former mercantile exchange 
trader who now works for a top brokerage theres going to be a 
lot of punishment meted out theres going to be a lot of guilty 
pleading and guilty finding 
bot and merc officials along with traders and others who earn 
their living at the exchanges complain that the highly publicized 
investigation wrongly implies the industry is full of crooks 
the vast majority of the people down there are honestjust 
trying to make a buck said a trader in the board of trades 
treasury bond pit which was infiltrated by an fbi agent wearing a 
hidden microphone and posing as a trader 
but other industry insiders say in a field that attracts young 
hotshots eager for a fast fortune odds for fraud are high 
i would say that people in this business are going to be 
subjected to much more temptation said the former mercantile 
exchange trader who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity 
surrounding the probe 
you have relatively young relatively inexperienced people in a 
field where very very very large sums of money are moving around 
very quickly 
in a typical transaction an investor phones a brokerage and 
orders a commodity at the market price the order goes a phone clerk 
at the firms tradingfloor booth 
the clerk writes the order on a floororder ticket and gives it 
to a firm runner who literally runs to a floor broker by the 
trading pit the floor broker asks other pit traders for the current 
price 
once he finds someone selling at the best price for his client 
it usually takes less than a minute the floor broker exchanges 
hand or eye signals with the trader to seal the deal 
the trader documents it on a trading card while the broker 
records the transaction on the order card the deal is punched into 
a computer 
insiders say the system invites opportunities for illicit 
practices 
if were talking about fraud against the customer order the 
easiest way and the hardest way to catch occurs when a customer 
places a limit order saying hell pay no more than a certain 
price said the former merc trader 
instead of buying for the customer at the market price say 7 
the floor broker gambles the price will rise with pit prices 
fluctuating the floor broker winks to a trader friend as the price 
hits 7 and the trader buys from an innocent thirdparty at that 
price 
if the market goes up to 8 i buy from the traderfriend at 
8 he made 1 and the customer paid 8 when he could have paid 
only 7 the extrader said 
what youre doing is holding the order off the market for a 
brief period of time seconds with hopes the price will rise 
and allow for illegal profiteering called bucketing or cuffing he 
said 
absent a sting operation or a pattern it is very very 
hard to detect said stephen selig a futures law professor at new 
york university 
such deals arent common but theyre said to be a target of the 
fbi probe 
its bad its malicious and its thievery and people who get 
caught doing it should be hung said the extrader they have 
maliciously removed money from the game and they should get 
hammered 
but he and other insiders fear the government also will prosecute 
others who violate exchange rules but dont necessarily hurt anyone 
one such practice is called trading at the curb or after the 
session ends to reconcile discrepancies that arise in the confusion 
of a hectic market 
people are concerned that the bot has done a very good job of 
policing its own members and that people who dont understand 
our business are going to wind up having authority over it 
said the treasury bond trader 
the merc and bot quickly punish rule violators said richard 
troelstrup an attorney who represents at least one supboena target 
the hard part is catching violators and the industry largely 
depends on members to police themselves 
the probe began two years ago after archerdanielsmidland co a 
decatur illbased agricultural conglomerate complained it was 
cheated by soybean traders 
one of the people that perceived themselves being wronged was 
more connected in washington than god the exmerc trader said 
referring to adms chairman dwayne andreas 
his people complained to the bot we think were getting 
ripped off in the soybean pit the bot investigated and didnt find 
anything but andreas wasnt satisified and sought government 
help he said 
my guess is adm was just losing moneyhaving a rough time 
in the market and wanted a scapegoat the extrader said 
adm spokesman richard burket and bot aides have declined to 
comment 
officials at both exchanges say they did not learn of the 
investigation until the tribune published its story 
traders were taken totally by surprise to learn that some pit 
colleagues were fbi agents said the treasury bond trader 
legitimate traders may not have suspected an fbi sting but in 
some cases the undercover agents behaved oddly one for example 
lost heavily one day and mysteriously bounced back 
he attracted attention because there was no known source of 
funds to account for the recovery troelstrup said as it 
turned out he had a rather deep source of funds the government 
the commodity futures trading commission the federal regulatory 
agency of the commodities markets says it has adequately policed 
the industry 
nonetheless the mercantile exchange has appointed a panel of 
industry and outside representatives to review transaction rules and 
recommend revisions 
we have to prove to the world that we can be an honest place 
where a public order will not be subject to dishonest hands said 
leo melamed chief counsel at the merc

an official at the new york cotton exchange 
gleefully displays a handful of buttons the chicago board of trade 
once distributed to promote its range of interestrate futures 
products 
the buttons read cbot trading opportunities from 30 years to 
30 days an inscription rendered ironic by the sweeping federal 
undercover investigation of alleged fraud at the chicago board of 
trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
i understand these are going to become very valuable the 
official says as he stashes the buttons in a desk drawer 
similar wry humor can be found among traders of gold and silver 
futures as they leave the floor of new yorks commodity exchange 
whaddaya wearin a wire one trader asks a reporter who is 
gathering reactions to the chicago scandal 
please speak into the microphone says another eliciting 
chuckles from his fellow traders as the elevator door slides shut 
pit traders as a rule are a cocky bunch their thick skins and 
swaggers an essential defense in a profession that rewards steely 
nerves and can ruin the nervous 
but their wisecracks about the chicago probe mask a fear on the 
new york futures exchanges that whatever comes out of the 
investigation will be bad news for the entire futures industry 
i dont see anything funny about it said a midlevel 
employee of one of the five exchanges that operate on the 8th floor 
of 4 world trade center its frightening 
the east coast exchanges the coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange 
the commodity exchange the new york cotton exchange the new york 
futures exchange and the new york mercantile exchange cannot 
escape the shadow of chicagos futures markets which are the 
worlds largest and account for about threequarters of all the 
futures contracts traded in the united states 
the new york exchanges trade some products like crude oil 
platinum frozen orange juice coffee and cotton that arent traded 
in chicago but they operate in same way with traders facing off in 
pits and using a 140yearold system of shouts and hand signals to 
trade contracts for future delivery of commodities 
one trader said that in the wake of the first reports of the 
chicago investigation which surfaced a little more than a week ago 
traders in new york have grown more wary of their associates 
although no similar probe has been revealed in their own markets 
he said they also feared the prices of seats on the new york 
exchanges would tumble as they did in chicago sharply reducing the 
cash value of membership but panic selling of seats did not spread 
east 
exchange seats are traded as commodities and held as investments 
more importantly they give their holders the right to enter the 
trading pits where they can observe price movements firsthand and 
are in the best position to profit from those changes 
the chicago probe has turned a spotlight on the longstanding 
tradition of dual trading which allows pit traders to trade on 
behalf of customers and for their own accounts provided they 
execute the customer orders first 
critics say dual trading is easily abused in certain market 
conditions an unscrupulous trader can switch to his own account a 
profitable trade he originally made on a customers behalf then 
execute the customers order again at a smaller profit than the 
customer should have received 
but exchange officials say the right to trade for ones own 
account while also executing orders for brokerage firms is what 
draws independent speculators to the pits increasing the number of 
pit traders and creating liquid markets 
the potential outcome of the chicago investigation that new york 
exchange officials fear most is new legislation that would restrict 
the traditional openoutcry trading method and outlaw dual trading 
the worst thing that could happen would be for there to turn 
out to be a massive widespread tradingimpropriety problem in 
chicago said alan j brody president of the commodity exchange 
if that be the case and i cross my fingers and hope thats 
not the case the worst result would be that it would cast a shadow 
over the entire industry which includes us in new york and we wind 
up facing regulatory proposals 
brody said dual trading has made the us futures markets the 
most liquid markets in the world 
i would hate to see us throw out all that in the face of what i 
hope not to be a real widespread problem he said

the stock market ran up another strong gain in 
heavy trading today capping off the best week so far in a rally 
that began more than two months ago 
before the market opened the commerce department estimated that 
the gross national product grew at a annual rate of 2 percent after 
adjustment for inflation in the fourth quarter of last year 
the figure came in below most advance estimates on wall street 
and provided a fresh bit of evidence for the case that the economy 
was slowing to a sustainable notveryinflationary pace 
bond traders welcomed the news by bidding up prices of longterm 
government bonds about 5 for each 1000 in face value 
that in turn provided fresh momentum for an advance in stock 
prices that has already been gathering steam of late 
brokers said a strong dollar in foreign exchange also helped stir 
up investors enthusiasm for stocks

the chicago mercantile exchange said friday that 
its plans for a computerized worldwide trading system havent been 
stalled by the spreading scandal of a federal probe of suspected 
fraudulent futures trading 
implementation of the system known as globex is a key element 
in the exchanges attempts to conduct afterhours global futures 
trading at the same time some observers believe electronic trading 
systems in general cut the opportunities for fraud 
globex is on track and weve had as much interest as weve ever 
had said merc spokesman andrew yemma 
the merc and the chicago board of trade the nations largest 
commodities exchanges are targets of a twoyear federal probe in 
which fbi agents posed as traders and secretly taperecorded 
conversation on the trading floor 
some commodities market analysts have pointed to increased 
computerization as a means to curb fraud and profit skimming by 
floor traders under the open outcry system now used in the pits 
traders shout and use hand signals to arrange trades making it 
difficult to detect improper activity 
the globex system will have an almostperfect audit trail 
yemma said 
globex a project of the merc and reuters america inc is 
scheduled to come on line this fall with limited trading between new 
york and chicago full worldwide trading is to begin in 1990 yemma 
said 
the system would be activated at 6 pm the merc closes at 315 
pm cst and trade electronically with futures markets on other 
continents until 6 am with the merc reopening at 720 am cst 
with globex merc trading will be conducted nearly 20 hours a day 
the network would link investors in north america europe and 
asia for trading of futures and options contracts on currency 
futures including the british pound the west german mark the 
swiss and french francs australian and canadian dollars and the 
japanese yen 
the new york mercantile exchange voted thursday to join globex a 
move yemma called a big boost for the chicago exchange 
yemma labeled as completely erroneous reporters that several 
european financial institutions backed away from involvement in the 
network because of the ongoing federal investigation of the merc and 
the board of trade revealed last week 
the commodity futures trading commission the independent federal 
agency that regulates the industry must approve the system before 
it can begin operations 
under federal trading rules brokers are required to record 
transactions to the nearest minute timing is critical because of 
rapid price changes 
the new system will automatically record trade times to the 
nearest second even though globex only operates when the floor pits 
are closed 
critics including the rival board of trade say the system and 
computerized trading in general may make the markets vulnerable to 
computer hackers 
were not saying its completely foolproof said yemma 
were trying to thwart any kind of illegal activity we can think 
of 
last september the board of trade issued a 51page statement 
condemning globex 
were not against computerized trading per se bot spokesman 
mark prout said friday but we dont think it covers all the 
routes of possible manipulation 
in addition to the hacker threat prout said the system still 
would allow prearranged fraudulent trades 
we think the system should be perfectedand debugged before 
it could be considered said prout 
he said he doesnt foresee using globex even if it proves 
successful at the merc noting the bot already has a session from 5 
pm to 830 pm to provide access to overseas markets

investors are gobbling up the biggest junk bond 
offering in history indicating the appetite for highrisk 
highyield securities has not been blunted by the unsavory situation 
facing a key issuer drexel burnham lambert inc 
the 3 billion of bonds being used to help finance the leveraged 
buyout of rjr nabisco inc by lbo specialists kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co is oversubscribed an industry source said drexel a 
pioneer in junk bond financing and still the leader in the business 
is handling the offer 
plenty of the sophisticated institutional investors who have 
been asked by drexel if they want to buy the bonds apparently have 
expressed an interest in them the source said 
placing the bonds with customers is one of the last things that 
must be done before the record 25 billion buyout can be completed 
after this the only thing needed is approval from government 
antitrust investigators 
neither drexel nor kkr would confirm that the offer is sold out 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said we are very pleased with 
the response i think it reflects the fact that it was structured to 
appeal to buyers around the world 
a kohlberg kravis roberts spokeswoman said the issue has been 
well received 
although customers havent made any binding purchase commitments 
and could still turn drexel down analysts expect the sales to go 
off without a hitch 
anreder said the bonds will be priced next week after which they 
can be formally distributed to the institutional investors such as 
pension funds and insurance companies who agree to buy them 
the successful conclusion of the offering would be a significant 
milestone for the junk bond market and provide fresh evidence that 
it has staying power even though drexel the engine of its 
development has been entangled in the nations biggest securities 
fraud scandal 
this past week details came out of the bargain drexel made with 
the government to settle criminal charges against the firm 
besides promising to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay an 
unprecedented 650 million in fines and restitution drexel agreed 
to fire its junk bond wizard michael r milken and not to pay him 
his 1988 bonus which could be as high as 200 million 
as head of drexels highyield bond department based in beverly 
hills calif milken was considered king of the business and the 
one who carried drexel to the top of the junk bond hill 
when the depth of drexels and milkens difficulties became known 
last year there was speculation that the entire 180 billion market 
in junk bonds would suffer and drexel would be toppled permanently 
from its lofty perch 
instead the market appears to be doing fine and drexel is 
maintaining its dominance of the business 
proponents of highyield highrisk securities say the market 
deserves more respect than it gets and many such analysts were 
unsurprised that the huge rjr bond offering appears easily 
digestible by investors hungry for the appealing returns that the 
bonds will provide 
it doesnt surprise me at all the market has grown so much in 
the last few years and its really performing a social and economic 
function said robert waill a managing director of lf 
rothschild holdings inc 
the whole thing has gotten broader and broader and it has 
happened for fairly sensible reasons he said noting that many 
institutional investors with huge well diversified portfolios have 
come to rely on socalled junk bonds to complement their more 
conservative loweryielding holdings 
smaller investors searching for big returns who shouldnt take 
the risk of buying the bonds individually can put money in mutual 
funds devoted to the bonds he said 
says waill the market has been converted from a crap shoot to 
a dull statistical business

mcdonnell douglas corps fourthquarter profit 
jumped 60 percent chiefly due to lower costs and an improved 
performance in its combat aircraft division the company reported 
friday 
the aerospace firm said aftertax earnings in the three months 
ended dec 31 were 145 million or 379 per share on revenue of 
43 billion compared with earnings of 93 million or 232 per 
share and revenue of 36 billion in the same period in 1987 
in a reversal of 1987s experience earnings expanded robustly in 
the combat aircraft segment largely because production costs were 
lower 
the division had difficulties in 1987 bringing out new models of 
the f15 and fa18 
most of these difficulties had been resolved by the fourth 
quarter of 1988 with a strongly positive effect on earnings the 
company stated 
for all of 1988 the company had a profit of 350 million or 
913 per share on revenue of 15 billion up 11 percent from 
1987s earnings of 313 million or 775 per share revenue in 1987 
was 137 billion 
earnings for the year increased in all segments except 
information systems the company said combat aircraft and space 
systems and missiles recorded the largest gains 
the manufacturer said earnings for both 1987 and 1988 were 
adversely affected by production disruptions related to increased 
transport aircraft production rates and introduction of new combat 
aircraft high research and development expenditures and increase 
interest expense 
firm backlog at the end of 1988 was 263 billion up from 189 
billion in 1987 total backlog was 405 billion compared with 33 
billion a year earlier 
firm backlog excludes government orders not yet funded orders 
being negotiated as continuations of authorized programs and 
commercial orders subject to contingencies

aviation pioneer sir thomas sopwith who gave 
britain its finest fighter planes in three wars and designed the 
aircraft that brought down germanys legendary red baron in 
world war i died friday he was 101 
the genius of flight is dead said a headline in the evening 
standard newspaper of london 
tommy sopwith died in his sleep in his mansion near 
winchester in southern england really he died of old age but 
hes had a marvelous innings life said his son thomas 
thomas octave murdoch sopwith was born jan 18 1888 into a 
wealthy engineering family he was the first son after seven 
daughters 
he was an accomplished race car driver yachtsman and balloonist 
when he taught himself to fly in 1910 the wright brothers had made 
the first powered flight in 1903 in the united states 
after walking away from several crashes sopwith was given the 
31st aviators license issued in britain 
we had a lot of crashes in those days but bless you it was 
fun he recalled on his 100th birthday 
he was soon breaking flying records in britain and the united 
states and was the first pilot to drop mail onto a ships deck when 
he delivered a parcel to the liner olympic as it steamed out of new 
york harbor 
sopwith used money from american flying prizes to set up the 
sopwith aviation co in 1912 producing the sopwith pup snipe and 
camel planes 
the sopwith camel singleseat fighter shot down 1294 enemy 
planes in world war i the most kills for any aircraft in that war 
germanys legendary red baron manfred von richthofen was shot 
down by british pilot roy brown in a camel 
after the war sopwith founded the hawker siddeley company along 
with his australian mechanic and test pilot harry hawker and friend 
fred sigrist the company made him a millionaire by the 1930s 
he built and sailed the racing yachts endeavour and endeavour ii 
in unsuccessful bids for the americas cup in 1934 and 1937 
when the air ministry couldnt make up its mind in 1936 about a 
new breed of fighters sopwith ordered his factories to build 1000 
of the rugged monoplane eightgun hurricanes designed by sydney camm 
the air ministry bought them and the hurricane formed the air 
force backbone in the 1940 battle of britain in that battle it 
destroyed more enemy planes than all the rest of the air and ground 
defenses combined including the faster spitfire 
sopwith was knighted in 1953 
in the 1960s sopwiths team developed the harrier vertical 
takeoff fighter which britain used against the argentine air force 
in the 1982 falklands war the harrier is one of the us marine 
corps favored aircraft 
sopwith said the harriers high technology made it the favorite

savings and loan customers were grumbling friday 
about a proposal to slap them with a new fee in order to bail out 
failing thrifts but sampl officials say theyve seen few withdrawals 
as a result of the proposal 
but depositors asked in a spot check of dallas savings and loans 
on friday indicated they would wait and see if the fee actually was 
adopted before taking any action 
judy rollerson a teller at metropolitan savings said several 
customers mentioned the proposal but none indicated they would close 
their accounts 
they dont think it will really happen she said theyre 
just talking about how preposterous it really is 
savings and loan officials have been watching customer reaction 
since the bush administration indicated that one option for 
financing a federal bailout of troubled thrifts would be to charge 
sampl bank and credit union customers 25 cents per every 100 they 
had deposited 
the measure would require congressional approval 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board said 
thursday that the proposal was making savings and loan depositors 
nervous and had led some to withdraw their money 
since wednesday wall said there have been cases where they 
say i dont like what i heard on tv im taking my money out 
depositor reaction to the proposal had not placed any savings and 
loans in jeopardy he said 
financial industry officials in dallas as well as their 
customers indicated there have been few account closings as a 
result of the deposit tax trial balloon 
weve had a few questions to it said ruth lack director of 
corporate communications for first gibraltar fsb in houston we 
have not had any action on it most of our depositors realize that 
this is nothing more than a trial at this point 
george barclay president of the federal home loan bank of 
dallas stated there has been no measurable increase in deposit 
withdrawals due to publicity about the proposed fee and credited 
consumer confidence that the government would uphold the safety of 
their deposits 
an official with southwest savings association who refused to 
identify herself said she has sensed quite a bit of concern 
among customers 
people dont want to have to pay to save their money she 
said if i had a savings account and had to pay id close it im 
sorry 
some customers said they probably would withdraw their money if 
the deposit fee was implemented 
i have a lot of money in savings and loans and i hate that 
proposal said one customer at the southwest savings downtown 
branch 
right now im reading george bushs lips i hope they drop it 
if they dont its going to hurt savings and loans a lot said 
the customer who declined to give his name 
nevertheless the customer said he would wait and see if the fee 
was imposed before moving his money 
several customers said they had not heard about the fee 
only one of eight dallas savings and loans branches contacted 
friday reported a withdrawal although the majority declined to 
comment 
one dallas man promptly withdrew his money from sunbelt savings 
after hearing of the fee proposal said account representative tim 
palla 
he came in with a smile on his face and said i cant handle 
this any more it isnt you people its the government palla 
said 
palla said that was the only withdrawal he knew of other 
customers have called with questions about the proposed fee he said

nations feed lots those to be fattened for slaughter increased 
only 5 percent in december 1988 over the same month in 1987 
the market had factored in about a 10 percent increase and 
the lower figure reported by the usda encouraged buying of cattle 
futures analysts said 
further support came from the approach of february declared by 
the industry as national meat month 
retailers have a tendency to promote beef a little more 
aggressively during the month which tightens supplies and helps 
account for the rise in futures prices analysts said 
pork prices were mixed under pressure from weak spot prices and

the us economy grew a healthy 38 percent in 
1988 the best showing in four years as the country benefited from 
a narrowing of the trade deficit and a big increase in business 
investment the government reported friday 
the increase in the gross national product the broadest measure 
of economic health occurred despite the fact that growth slowed 
sharply in the final three months of the year with the gnp rising 
at an annual rate of just 20 percent from october through december 
the octoberdecember increase was the slowest quarterly 
performance in two years and followed increases of 34 percent 3 
percent and 25 percent respectively in the first three quarters 
of 1988 
while the fourth quarter performance came in below most advance 
estimates the figure was generally seen by economists and wall 
street as a good sign that the economy was slowing to a more 
sustainable pace 
the stock market surged on the news pushing the early1989 rally 
to new highs the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 3179 
to 232286 capping off the best week so far in a rally that began 
more than two months ago 
commenting on the gnp report the bush administration said that 
the fourthquarter slowdown was not a warning that the sixyear 
record peacetime recovery was in danger of coming to an end and 
should not overshadow the stellar performance the economy turned in 
for all of 1988 immediately following the october 1987 stock market 
crash there were widespread fears that a cutback in spending by 
worried consumers could topple the country into a recession 
during 1988 we had a numer of positive developments said 
commerce undersecretary robert ortner we made significant 
progress in reducing the trade deficit the unemployment rate 
dropped to a 14year low and the stock market began a sustained 
recovery from its plunge in late 1987 
ortner predicted that economic growth would be slower in 1989 
but he said the economy should be able to reach the 32 percent gnp 
projection contained in president reagans final budget 
the bush administration has said it will use that same estimate 
when it submits its budget revisions to congress next month despite 
criticism from private economists that this growth forecast is 
overly optimistic 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc said he was 
looking for the economy to expand by just 27 percent in 1989 as a 
slowdown in the trade improvement and slower business investment 
holds back overall growth 
trade and business capital spending accounted for onehalf of 
overall growth in 1988 as exports shot up by 177 percent 
reflecting increased demand as the weaker dollar made us products 
competitive again 
the surge in exports triggered a boom in spending on new plants 
and equipment as us industry rushed to expand production 
facilities business investment shot up by 95 percent the best 
showing since 1984 and a big improvement over a 28 percent rise in 
1987 
however in both the third quarter and fourth quarter the trade 
deficit as measured in inflationadjusted terms in the gnp 
widened analysts said the trade improvement is in danger of 
stalling out in 1989 an occurrence which would raise the danger the 
country could topple into a recession 
the trade numbers are very worrisome wyss said when we 
are still averaging a trade deficit of about 11 billion a month we 
cant afford to see the improvement stall out 
the 38 percent gnp increase for the year followed a 34 percent 
rise in 1987 the faster growth helped push unemployment down to a 
14year low of 53 percent in december while pushing the factory 
operating rate to 842 percent of capacity at the end of the year 
the highest level in nine years 
however the gnp report showed that inflation picked up as well 
with a price index tied to the gnp rising by 42 percent last year 
the fastest increase since a 62 percent rise in 1982 
for the fourth quarter the gnp fixedweighted price index rose 
just 4 percent down from a 53 percent increase in the third 
quarter but analysts said the fed will likely consider the 
inflation level still too high and keep up the pressure on interest 
rates into the new year this will boost the governments cost of 
borrowing to finance the 27 trillion national debt and make it 
even harder for bush to fulfill his campaign pledge of lowering the 
budget deficit without increasing taxes 
but bush on friday played down any differences between the 
administration and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
he is more concerned about inflation pressures than i am right 
now bush said at a news conference it seems to me there is an 
area of difference but generally speaking i think we are fairly 
close together 
the effects of last summers drought lowered gnp growth by 04 
percent for all of 1988 the commerce department said 
the various changes left the gnp at 3995 trillion for all of 
1988 after removing the effects of inflation 
the 38 percent gnp increase reflects the yearoveryear change 
in the economy a different measurement just comparing economic 
activity in the fourth quarter of 1988 with the same quarter in 1987 
showed an increase of 27 percent

the dollar shot up friday in foreign exchange 
despite the intervention of central banks and the release of gross 
national product figures that indicated a slowing us economy 
currency traders said 
gold futures tumbled in reaction to the gnp figure which reduced 
inflationary fears and to the dollars strength 
traders said central banks intervened in the currency market at 
least three times but the dollarselling did little to curb the 
currencys upward price rise 
after massive intervention there still was just too much 
demand for the dollar said scott horwitz a currency trader for 
bank of boston 
traders said the dollar dipped only briefly after the release of 
the gnp figures which showed the us economy grew at an annual 
rate of just 20 percent from october through december the slowest 
quarterly gnp performance in two years 
horwitz said the lowerthanexpected gnp figures and the 
centralbank intervention ordinarily would dampen a rise in the 
dollar but they had little impact except to give those who buy 
dollars the opportunity to buy dollars cheaper for a brief time 
the foreign exchange market does not fully understand whats 
going on said stephan leach a currency analyst with chemical 
bank i suspect that part of it may simply be that they the 
central banks expected a different reaction to the gnp numbers 
he said many traders appeared to be waiting for the bank of japan 
to enter the dollarselling before they believed the central banks 
were serious about their effort to halt the dollars rise

prosecutors offered a plea bargain to senior 
drexel burnham lambert inc aide michael milken two weeks ago but he 
spurned them sources said friday in disclosing the first sign of 
government willingness to negotiate a deal with the junkbond 
financier 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said milkens 
lawyers immediately rejected the proposal from manhattan us 
attorney rudolph w giuliani and vowed to battle it out in court if 
milken is indicted on charges of securities fraud and racketeering 
which have been expected for months 
milkens defense team comprised of some the nations bestknown 
attorneys met with giuliani aides at the prosecutors request in 
the us attorneys office building the sources said 
both sides declined to comment on the meeting but some of the 
sources suggested it is unusual for the government to initiate a 
plea offer if prosecutors believe they have a strong winnable case 
it wasnt clear what kind of deal giuliani offered but there 
were unconfirmed reports milken would have to plead guilty to at 
least two felony counts that carry a maximum punishment of five 
years imprisonment each pay an unspecified fine and be barred for 
life from the securities business 
the sources speculated that in any plea deal milken would have 
served at least some prison time and cooperated in the governments 
investigation of others those would include former close associates 
and possibly his brother lowell another senior drexel aide also 
facing a possible indictment 
kenneth lerer a spokesman for milken issued a statement that 
read there are no discussions going on between the us 
attorneys office and mike milkens attorneys no discussions 
whatsoever for the past 27 months mikes position has remained 
unchanged he will vigorously fight any charges brought against him 
and his lawyers are preparing his defense 
milken 42 is known as the prime purveyor of subinvestment 
grade debt securities known as junk bonds a key factor in drexels 
spectacular growth into an investment powerhouse this decade 
he is considered one of the biggest targets in the massive wall 
street fraud probe that stems largely from disclosures by 
nowimprisoned speculator ivan f boesky a notorious inside trader 
and former drexel client boesky claims milken and the firm colluded 
with him to violate a range of securities laws 
the pressures on milken to cooperate with the government in 
return for lenient treatment have intensified since last month when 
drexel buckled under giulianis threats of bringing a massive 
racketeering case against the firm and left its top financier to 
face the looming charges by himself 
drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felonies pay a record 650 
million in fines and restitution settle related litigation with the 
securities and exchange commission and strengthen its compliance 
with trading rules 
moreover papers unsealed in manhattan federal court earlier this 
week revealed drexel will fire milken if hes indicted and keep most 
of his anticipated 1988 earnings reportedly in the area of 200 
million 
lawyers who have been following the drexel saga differed on the 
significance of giulianis offer to negotiate a plea deal with 
milken 
some said it reflected the politically ambitious prosecutors 
unwillingness to proceed with a complicated case that has an 
uncertain future others said such contacts are common in 
preindictment legal maneuvering 
i wouldnt read much significance into this said michael 
feldberg a former giuliani aide whos now in private practice 
its not like a game of chicken where it matters who started it 
of more concern to lawyers was drexels agreement to deny milken 
most of his pay from last year even though he has yet to be charged 
with a crime 
i think thats outrageous feldberg said they have an 
obligation to pay him the money i dont know whether the guy did 
anything wrong or not but if he wants a day in court give it to 
him 
john stoppelman a former sec attorney who now practices 
securities law in washington said he was happy to see milken 
intends to fight the charges 
you might as well take your shot at trial thes cases have a 
way of turning around stoppelman said the guy is not jack the 
ripper you know theyre not crimes against humanity theyre 
regulatory in nature

west pointpepperell inc said friday it 
is talking with third parties interested in buying the textile 
company the target of a 14 billion hostile takeover attempt by 
farley inc of chicago 
in an amendment of its response to the farley offer filed with 
the securities and exchange commission pepperell said it continues 
to maintain that the company is not for sale but is continuing to 
review various financial alternatives to the offer 
the company has entered into preliminary negotiations with 
various third parties who have expressed an interest in a 
transaction involving the company it said 
west pointbased pepperell the nations largest publicly held 
textile company is fighting farleys takeover attempt in court 
todays announcement appears to be more than a simple search for 
a white knight or a buyer other than farley said deborah 
bronston a textile industry analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york 
they have said this before but not in such a concrete way 
she said it leaves open the option that if they win in the 
courts they may not do anything i think they have to come to the 
special shareholders meeting feb 25 with a financial alternative 
to the farley attempt and so far they dont have one 
farley has succeeded in forcing a shareholders meeting feb 25 at 
which it will seek to replace pepperells directors with a new board 
that would approve the farley takeover 
ms bronston said it is unclear who the other potential buyers 
might be but she said sam walton the owner of walmart stores and 
one of the richest people in the united states has been mentioned 
i heard he was in georgia having a grilled cheese with 
someone recently but it could have been just a store opening she 
said 
farley announced this week that in addition to the 98 percent 
of pepperell stock it owns it has been tendered about 52 percent of 
the outstanding shares by pepperell shareholders 
farley has filed a federal lawsuit contending that georgias 
antitakeover law unfairly hinders corporate takeovers by making 
them virtually impossible the hostile takeover of pepperell depends 
on revocation of the law among other things

million a year earlier

the prospect group launched a 440 million tender 
offer friday for illinois central transportation co less than a 
month after the railroad was spun off by whitman corp 
ics immediate reaction to the 20ashare offer was cautious 
theres so much going on right now that we cant say anything 
beyond were looking at it and well decide in the next couple of 
days how to proceed said ic spokesman joe fidanza 
ic jumped to 2237 a share on the new york stock exchange up 
from 1450 at thursdays close 
new yorkbased prospect which operates in the railroad 
insurance and consumer products and services businesses through 
subsidiaries already owns 47 percent of ics 217 million 
outstanding shares 
also friday grain giant archerdanielsmidland co announced it 
intended to increase its ic holdings for investment purposes only 
from about 10 percent to at least 15 percent and perhaps as high 
as 25 percent 
the railroad provides a good connection between chicago and new 
orleans and it carries a lot of chemicals and grain said linda 
dunn an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
ic transportation co known formerly as the illinois central 
gulf railroad runs freight operations and leases track for some 
passenger services over 2850 miles in seven states illinois 
indiana kentucky tennessee mississippi alabama and louisiana 
the railroad was spun off jan 1 after an infusion of 180 
million in equity by parent whitman corp a chicagobased 
conglomerate previously known as ic industries 
ic last year had net income of 477 million on revenue of 5564 
million any acquirer would also inherit about 260 million in 
longterm debt 
prospect bought 400 miles of track from the illinois central gulf 
co in may 1986 and renamed it midsouth after expanding to about 
1200 miles through other acquisitions the line became one of the 
nations most profitable railroads 
midsouth was one of those successes that dazzles and thats 
what encouraged us to go ahead on this one said prospect 
spokesman donald dwight midsouth already has done a lot of 
business with the ic many of the customers are the same and 
prospect just feels it would like to take that experience and step 
into a larger arena 
one of the customers in common is decatur illbased adm 
adm is one of ics 10 largest customers the company also owns a 
fleet of more than 1400 barges and 19 towboats and its heightened 
interest in the railroad may stem from the low water levels on the 
mississippi river caused by last summers drought and the 
possibility of continued problems on the commercial waterway
