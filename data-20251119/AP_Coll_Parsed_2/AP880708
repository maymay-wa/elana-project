democrat michael dukakis campaigned 
friday with texas sen lloyd bentsen saying im pondering him 
as a potential vice presidential candidate as aides sought a new 
meeting with jesse jackson on the same subject 
dukakis said as he began a western trip into gop territory that 
he aimed to show this son of massachusetts will not concede 
one single state to the republicans in this presidential election 
a senior aide traveling with dukakis kirk odonnell 
acknowledged however that dukakis message on economic 
opportunity was being obscured by attention focused on the question 
of whom he would choose as his running mate the texas appearance 
with bentsen was similar to dukakis campaign appearances recently 
with other prospective running mates including sen john glenn in 
ohio and rep lee hamilton in indiana 
dukakis then flew to los angeles where he went to dodger stadium 
for friday nights dodgerpirates baseball game visited the locker 
room and joined sen alan cranston dcalif in box seats along 
the firstbase side near home plate 
while in texas dukakis indicated at a news conference that he 
favors some form of payments to the families of victims of the 
iranian airliner shot down by a us warship in the persian gulf 
last sunday 
i think some form of humanitarian assistance would probably be 
appropriate he said 
he also responded to fridays report that the national 
unemployment rate had fallen to a 14year low good economic news 
for bush and the republican administration by saying those 
figures masked economic suffering 
national unemployment rates dont tell you a great deal about 
what is happening in communities and neighborhoods and regions 
across this country he said for one thing a great many of 
these jobs are lowwage jobs many of them paying no more than 
7000 7500 a year they dont have health insurance 
the same report also showed massachusetts unemployment rate 
rose from 28 percent to 35 percent in june dropping the state 
to second place after more than four years of having the lowest 
rate among the nations most populous states dukakis did not 
mention that change if he knew of it and cited the lower figure 
in his remarks in texarkana 
both dukakis and bentsen the senate finance committee chairman 
gave little detail in response to questions about vice presidential 
discussions but dukakis acknowledged the two have talked from 
time to time on that 
at the same time dukakis senior adviser paul brountas who is 
leading the massachusetts governors search for a running mate was 
trying to arrange a meeting with jackson who this week has renewed 
his contention that he is the most qualified prospect dukakis 
repeated that jackson remains under consideration 
with less than two weeks to go before claiming the presidential 
nomination at the democratic national convention when he must 
settle on a running mate dukakis faced more questions about that 
choice as he began a campaign swing aimed at challenging george 
bush in republican areas of the southwest the west and rocky 
mountain regions 
bentsen who is among eight democrats interviewed previously by 
dukakis for the job appeared with him at a rally in front of the 
texarkana post office straddling the texasarkansas border along 
with arkansas sen dale bumpers and gov bill clinton who will 
nominate dukakis at the atlanta convention 
dukakis praised bentsen as finance committee chairman and when 
asked if bentsen would be more valuable remaining in the senate 
replied im pondering he could make a great contribution in 
this county in many many ways he already has 
bentsen declined to answer most questions but replied when 
asked if he wanted the job i dont think we have to worry about 
that 
dukakis renewed his criticism of bush for opposing legislation 
requiring 60 days notice to workers before plants are closed 
saying it is probably the single most dramatic example of the 
difference between our parties 
back in boston the legislature sent to dukakis desk an 1175 
billion budget for fiscal 1989 lawmakers finished a 13hour 
debate on the budget early friday sending the spending plan to 
dukakis seven days after the new budget year technically began july 
1 
gop legislators had a heydey debating the compromise budget 
which was hastily revised amid falling revenue predictions this 
could be the greatest gift that george bush could receive between 
now and november it is so absurdly out of balance said 
republican sen david locke a bush campaign official

rescuers used cherrypickers crowbars 
and their bare hands friday to burrow through tons of rubble from a 
collapsed department store pulling out six miracle survivors 
in a race with rain 90degree heat and dehydration 
the death toll in the thursday afternoon collapse of the amigo 
store rose to 15 late friday night when three more bodies were 
spotted in the debris and more were feared dead eleven bodies 
were removed 10 of those identified and four other bodies 
remained under the rubble said police sgt dean poos 
at least 47 were injured and officials feared anyone still 
buried alive would not survive 
right now hope is all that is driving the rescue effort that 
is fading as time goes by said police lt victor rodriguez 
because of the 90degree heat at this point the greatest 
danger to the people in that building is if we dont get to them 
the people if they are in a trapped area dont have any access to 
fluids said dr richard plantes 
work crews limited to 30miute shifts to prevent dehydration 
were using frontend loaders and other heavy equipment a yellow 
and white canopy shaded what once had been a threestory 
30000squarefoot store 
a new worry arose in the afternoon as clouds rolled in from the 
east threatening a repeat of torrential rains that caused the roof 
to cave in 
we dont want to go in there and find somebody drowned said 
poos 
the rescue crews also worried that the one remaining wall along 
an alley would collapse if they worked too fast 
rescuers planned to work through the night friday under portable 
lights poos said 
the crews could be heard cheering occasionally when they thought 
they heard heard noise within the debris but poos said the sounds 
did not lead to finding any more survivors 
weve had many situations when they thought they heard things 
and it turns out to be nothing he said weve got a lot of 
people out there who have been working real hard for a long time 
and the slightest thing that will give them hope can set cheers 
off 
its frustrating because you want to go in there and tear 
everything out but you need to take into consideration that if you 
tear things out you endanger the people in there said mayor 
ygnacio garza 
six survivors one a screaming toddler were freed friday 
morning from the debris where they had been buried nearly a day 
the six were two adults a boy and a girl both 8 the toddler a 
girl about 2 and a 14yearold girl 
cries from the children feedback from microphones and seismic 
tools and dogs trained to search for humans led the rescue crews 
to the survivors 
cheers and wild applause erupted from 300 onlookers as each 
survivor was lifted from the sweltering tangle of concrete 
the children had been terrified said richard schwand a red 
cross nurse from corpus christi as soon as one starts screaming 
its kind of contagious they all start going for it 
the scene grew quiet when electronic equipment was used 
authorities cleared traffic for two square blocks and asked people 
to shut down generators and engines so the microphones could pick 
up even the slightest sound 
the seismic equipment could detect a gentle tapping sound at 
1000 feet said jeff kravitz chief of mine safety operations with 
the department of labors mine safety and health administration 
survivors if any were asked to tap 10 times by searchers 
with loudspeakers speaking in english and spanish but no taps 
sounded and other noise that would be expected from alert 
survivors was absent kravitz said 
heavy equipment moved in but schwand said he feared only bodies 
would be found now its just the smell said schwand 
theres dead people under there and not just one im sure 
the victims were presumed to have been in the store when its 
roof caved in taking the walls with it after 2 inches of rain 
fell in less than 30 minutes thursday the national weather service 
said the collapse could have been caused by the weight of rain 
the 2yearold survivor appeared to have been protected by 
some other people around her who are believed dead said 
rodriguez 
the 14yearold was wedged between two concrete slabs every 
time theres movement the slabs hit her in the head said pamela 
downing of the citys public utilities board she called the girl a 
miracle child for having survived 
a brownsville maintenance worker freddie gonzalez 34 took 
advantage of his 4foot8 frame to snake his way through the heaps 
of concrete widening a path for two workers who followed 
it was a little bit hot gonzalez said the people were 
running out of oxygen that was their major complaint we ran a 
little tube through a small hole then we made a bigger hole and 
put in a bigger pipe to get air to the victims 
other rescuers dug a makeshift 17foot tunnel to reach some of 
those trapped doctors reached in to check vital signs of the 
victims said johnny economedes head of one rescue team 
among those injured slightly was store owner bernard levin 67 
who was working a cash register at the time 
it was a wellbuilt building and we still dont know what 
caused it to collapse levin said 
the 40yearold concrete structure housed the store on the first 
floor with the other two floors vacant economedes said

a city councilman stood up for senior 
citizens who want to sit down and the result was a law requiring 
comfortable seating in the lobbies of most apartment buildings for 
the elderly 
the city ordinance guarantees that the elderly who want to see 
something beyond their four walls have a place to go officials 
said thursday the law requires lounge chairs sofas or benches 
with backs to be padded 
complaints by senior citizens prompted the city council to pass 
the ordinance for all subsidized buildings with at least 30 
residents said maynard banks the deputy director of the jersey 
city housing authority 
glenn cunningham the president of the city council said he 
sponsored the law because one building replaced comfortable seats 
with hard benches in an effort to discourage senior citizens from 
congregating 
they claimed theyd have to clean the area but i felt it was 
very insensitive cunningham said many seniors have back 
ailments and if youre waiting for a bus it can be painful to sit 
down for a halfhour it was cruel and unfair 
we were in full agreement with the law said maria maio 
director of development in the citys housing and economic 
development department seniors like to sit in the lobby or 
outside thats where the action is 
you bet said josephine rice president of the senior citizens 
club at the plaza apartments 
they enjoy the lounge ms rice said leaving her card game 
in the lobby thats where they watch tv we also play bingo 
there 
apartment manager mary johnson likes the law but suspects 
comfortable seating also means she has to watch her step in the 
lobby of her building 
theyre parked there all day ms johnson said with a laugh 
they like to see whos coming in and going out its the best 
place to be to watch what everybody is doing

a hispanic bisexual judge who promised 
to fast 100 days to protest discrimination announced through a 
priest he was ending his fast on its 58th day thursday 
ramsey county judge alberto miera jrs decision came two days 
after the minnesota supreme court publicly censured and suspended 
him for one year withou pay for forcibly kissing his male court 
reporter and other alleged misconduct 
earlier a civil court jury found the judge had committed 
battery in his alleged advances on the reporter neil k johnson 
the 37yearold miera declared thursday he had accomplished the 
goals he had announced in may when he said he was beginning a 
100day fast to protest discrimination of socially vulnerable 
people by society and the local judiciary 
i am committed to working hard on these issues and steadfast 
in contributing my efforts to make our system fairer and more 
accessible to all citizens said mieras statement it was read 
by the rev jerry hackenmueller to reporters and about 50 people 
mostly parishioners in a church meeting room 
miera was not present for the announcement at our lady of 
guadalupe church where he has attended masses 
mieras father alberto miera sr said his son would be unable 
to address the media for at least several days because he is 
getting medical attention 
it is now a time of healing for our family the elder miera 
said 
in the statement the suspended judge said in part because 
of the accomplishment of a primary goal of my fast that is the 
serious raising of public awareness to the differential treatment 
of socially vulnerable people within our system and the 
specific recognition and rebuke of the unprecedented and improper 
actions of some of my colleagues by the supreme court i am ending 
my fast 
the latter part of that portion of his statement referred to 
comments the supreme court made in its ruling tuesday about other 
ramsey county judges the supreme court said they should have taken 
their concerns about miera to the state board on judicial 
standards rather than using the unorthodox method of 
petitioning the states high court and making statements to the 
news media 
the supreme court also rejected a recommendation from the state 
board on judicial standards that miera be removed from office 
the fasts end was applauded by the priest and parishioners 
some of whom said they had fasted in hopes of persuading the judge 
to eat again 
im joyful hes finally gotten off that fast said mona 
capiz i was supporting his issues but i dont think they are 
accomplished by a fast thats for him to finish up now that hes 
off it 
capiz and hackenmueller said the fast has strengthened mieras 
credibility in the hispanic community and brought its members 
closer together 
i think it certainly has created a new awareness that we have 
to be constantly on guard against injustices the priest said

older children are most likely to be hit by cars 
when crossing the street but children under 5 are especially at 
risk of being hit and killed in parking lots or in their own 
driveways researchers report 
the typical pattern of injury involved a situation in which 
a 1to2year old child was backed over in his home driveway by a 
light truck or van driven by a family member the researchers 
write 
the researchers studied 71 cases in washington state in which 
children under five were hit and killed by motor vehicles said the 
studys principal author dr robert j brison of queens 
university in kingston ontario canada 
thirty of the 71 deaths occurred in driveways and 11 in parking 
lots the remaining 30 occurred in traffic brison said 
in cases in which the kind of vehicle had been reported 76 
percent involved a light truck or van 
older children are injured and die from darting out into 
traffic said brison younger children seem not to have that 
pattern of injury they seem to be injured most commonly in a home 
driveway or in a store parking lot 
brison who practices emergency medicine at kingston general 
hospital said in a telephone interview thursday that parents of 
young children need to be aware of this pattern of injury so 
that they can put the children in a safe area such as a playpen 
or pick them up before backing out of the driveway 
the study by brison kristine wicklund of the washington state 
health department and beth mueller of the university of washington 
appears in the current issue of the american journal of public 
health 
its a very good article said richard waxweiler chief of 
injury epidemiology at the us centers for disease control in 
atlanta and what it brings up to me as one important point is 
that we mainly think of motor vehicle safety as being under the 
purview of the department of transportation and yet they only deal 
with traffic injuries and so theyre missing these 
and yet they have the jurisdiction over automobile design for 
instance and brison and coauthors clearly brought up that 
automobile design is a potential risk factor that deserves further 
investigation 
brison and his collaborators suggested it might be possible to 
design vehicles especially light trucks and vans to offer more 
visibility in the rear 
the national center for health statistics says that in 1985 the 
latest year for which statistics are available 7157 pedestrians 
were killed in traffic accidents including 401 children under 5 
years old 
waxweiler said there were 430 pedestrians of all ages reported 
killed in nontraffic situations in 1985

humane and moral considerations will 
figure heavily in the decision on compensation to the victims of 
the iranian airliner tragedy president reagans chief spokesman 
said thursday 
in the strongest hint yet that the administration might support 
compensation for the destruction of the plane and the death of its 
290 occupants sunday spokesman marlin fitzwater said i suspect 
that doing what we think is right will be the deciding factor 
the comment came amid revelations that two iranians tried 
unsuccessfully several times to open a diplomatic dialogue between 
tehran and washington in recent months 
fitzwater emphasized that the compensation matter is under staff 
review and has not yet even gone to senior advisers or the 
president he said it was under active discussion and he 
declined to outline any timetable for the decision 
but in contrast to his suggestion earlier this week that the 
question would have to await the outcome of the navys 
investigation of the incident fitzwater said he wanted to 
emphasize that were moving along through the consideration 
process on the issue of compensation 
one of the driving forces behind our consideration is simply 
the moral responsibility of america and the fact that weve always 
been a humane nation that takes these kinds of problems very 
seriously and assumes personal responsibilities he said 
america has traditionally been a humane and moral nation who 
assumes those responsibilities 
the spokesman said there has been no response at all from 
iran to reagans message on sunday when he explained the shootdown 
of the iran air jetliner by a missile from the uss vincennes was an 
accident and expressed deep regret 
he said the administration would be deliberate in its 
considerations and would opt for more time and not less in 
reaching the decision 
asked if there was any dollar figure under discussion 
fitzwater said we arent willing to discuss any dollar figure 
meanwhile a us official said an iranian deputy foreign 
minister and an iranianborn scholar tried several times over the 
last few months to open a diplomatic dialogue with the united 
states but so far the initiatives have not panned out 
deputy foreign minister mohammed javad larijani sent a probing 
message through a un official in april while the scholar whose 
identify was not disclosed approached the reagan administration 
twice saying he represented iranian authorities the us official 
told the associated press 
in response to larijanis overture the administration asked for 
proof that he had the approval of the entire iranian government 
and it never got off the ground said the official who spoke 
only on condition of anonymity 
apparently alluding to the irancontra scandal the official 
said we wanted to make sure we werent burned 
meanwhile phyllis oakley the deputy state department 
spokeswoman stressed the united states remained interested in a 
dialogue with tehran 
our position still holds she said we are prepared to 
meet with an iranian who speaks authoritatively for his 
government 
some analysts view larijani as an ally of the relatively 
moderate speaker of irans parliament hashemi rafsanjani but not 
as a representative of the ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
fundamentalist government 
in the case of the scholar a nativeborn iranian the reagan 
administration also could not authenticate that his two probing 
messages had the support of the iranian government the us 
official who spoke anonymously said 
a spokesman for irans foreign ministry on thursday denied that 
iran recently tried to open direct talks with washington according 
to the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
the unidentified spokesman described such claims as futile 
efforts to divert world public attention from the destruction of 
the airliner 
the us downing of the iranian passenger jet led to revelations 
that the united states had tried to discuss ending the persian gulf 
war and other problems despite a nineyear break in relations and 
the continued plight of nine americans held hostage in lebanon 
operating through the swiss and other intermediaries especially 
at the united nations the administration attempted to find out if 
the iranians were willing to talk 
relations with tehran were broken in 1979 after the us embassy 
was sacked and its american occupants were taken hostage for more 
than a year 
the reagan administration also holds proiranian forces in 
lebanon responsible for the nine american hostages in that wartorn 
country 
we certainly couldnt expect to have a normal relationship 
with iran while american hostages are still being held while the 
war continues between iran and iraq and certainly while iran 
maintains its present position of supporting terrorism and 
violence mrs oakley said wednesday 
however she acknowledged various indirect messages had been 
passed to iran and secretary of state george p shultz told 
reporters traveling with him to asia that weve had a number of 
these probes from iran through various third parties saying 
that theyd like to talk with us and weve responded to those

george bush campaigned behind enemy lines on thursday with a 
foray into massachusetts while michael dukakis charged the vice 
president with favoring 7 billion in new taxes and said so much 
for ironclad notax commitments 
dukakis who will fly to atlanta in 10 days to claim the 
democratic presidential nomination also said bush had made a 
rather late commitment when he said wednesday that he would 
name a hispanic american to his cabinet 
before leaving on a western campaign swing the massachusetts 
governor added that he would select a running mate in the not too 
distant future but did nothing else to clarify the reigning 
mystery of the presidential campaign 
bush whose own nomination is set for the republican national 
convention in new orleans next month flew to dukakis political 
base of boston there he met with bay state republicans and spoke 
to leaders of the greek orthodox church which counts dukakis among 
its followers 
the vice president got a warm reception from the greek group 
which had heard a day earlier from dukakis bush said it was just 
as well they didnt appear together 
too much charisma can be dangerous to your health he said 
to laughter 
the vice president met with president reagan before leaving 
washington and the two men directed their aides to work closely to 
maximize bushs chances of victory in the fall presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater also disclosed that reagan may campaign 
on bushs behalf in california when he vacations there this summer 
california the nations largest state with 47 electoral votes 
is reagans home but bush has fared poorly there in polls and his 
aides are eager to cut into dukakis presumed lead in the state 
reagan is expected to campaign two days a week for bush 
beginning in the fall and bush said thursday the two would 
probably make some joint appearances 
the president feels he can be especially helpful with 
conservative republicans democrats and other key groups which are 
not registered republicans but which have voted for the 
reaganbush ticket in 80 and 84 said fitzwater 
reagan will be at his california ranch during the democratic 
convention but bush said he himself may campaign during the first 
two days of the convention hoping to get a little bit of ink 
in the news media during dukakis big week 
in addition to his trip to massachusetts bush dispatched new 
hampshire gov john sununu to washington for a news conference 
designed to tar dukakis 
sununu said tens of thousands of refugees are fleeing 
massachusetts and dukakis administration each year and moving to 
new hampshire 
if michael dukakis fulfills his promise to do for the rest of 
the nation what he did for massachusetts then we are in serious 
trouble he said 
dukakis has seemed to lose the political momentum in recent 
weeks and he sought to regain it with his charge that bush had 
forsaken his pledge to oppose any type of tax increase 
he said the vice president supports a provision in trade 
legislation that calls for 1 billion in taxes for job training 
programs and also supports recently signed catastrophic illness 
healthcare legislation with 6 billion in new taxes 
so much for ironclad notax commitments dukakis said of 
the centerpiece of bushs campaign 
bush in boston replied by making reference to dukakis signing 
of a cigarette tax and his support for another tax measure 
im against raising taxes and i think recent events here in 
this state that i dont plan to go into demonstrate we have a 
different view on taxes he said 
the bush campaign also quarreled with dukakis assertion about 
the trade legislation and the catastrophic illiness healthcare 
legislation 
he is dead wrong on both counts and he is trying to blow smoke 
into the room said spokesman mark goodin 
in his home state dukakis said he expected to conclude work by 
the middle of next week on legislation to wipe out a looming budget 
deficit for the 1988 fiscal year and on a package of tax increases 
and spending cuts for next year 
dukakis has been criticized repeatedly by bush for agreeing to a 
new cigarette tax and other measures as part of the budget plan 
for a total of 250 million in additional taxes and fees 
dukakis also scoffed at bushs pledge before a hispanic group in 
texas to name a hispanic member to the cabinet 
it strikes me that this is a rather late commitment said 
dukakis who made a similar pledge a year ago i dont know where 
he has been for the last eight years 
later in dallas dukakis spoke before the same group bush had 
addressed a day earlier and again jabbed at bush over the pledge 
to appoint a hispanic member of the cabinet 
some people think its enough to wake up after eight years and 
then promise opportunity for one hispanic i want to stand with you 
and create opportunity for 20 million hispanic citizens across the 
country he said 
dukakis also resurrected the issue of reagans veto of 
plantclosing legislation using it against bush 
the president opposes it the vice president opposes it i 
dont know why he said workers deserved the 60day notice the 
legislation would provide before a plant could be closed and said 
the issue represented the fundamental difference in what a 
democratic administration would mean to this country

despite medical advances heart attack victims 
still take as much time to get back to work today as they did 15 
years ago says a new study that finds many patients could return 
to their jobs earlier 
medical discoveries have shown that heart attack patients often 
benefit from getting up and around sooner being released from the 
hospital earlier and exercising said authors of the study in 
todays journal of the american medical association 
even so heart attack patients generally take 60 days to 90 days 
to get back to work and physicians recommendations concerning 
return to work are largely based on subjective judgments that have 
changed little since 1973 the study said 
the study led by dr charles dennis of the stanford cardiac 
rehabilitation program in palo alto calif evaluated 201 men who 
had suffered heart attacks without other medical problems subjects 
were divided into two groups those receiving usual care and those 
receiving a special medical evaluation to determine fitness for 
work 
evaluations were performed three weeks after the patients heart 
attack by a team of heart experts who administered a treadmill test 
and used data on previous victims to estimate the risk each subject 
would have of experiencing further heart trouble 
the team then advised each patients doctor of the findings so 
the doctor could make a more informed recommendation on when the 
patient could resume work 
the study found that unless otherwise informed doctors 
generally estimated risk as much higher than it was and patients 
perceptions of risk mirrored those of their doctors 
for instance doctors typically estimated patients in the study 
had a 20 percent chance of suffering another fatal or nonfatal 
heart attack within six months while heartteam evaluations 
typically found a 5 percent risk and the real risk turned out to be 
35 percent the researchers said 
patients in the usualcare group were told by their doctors they 
could go back to work at 60 days and did so at a median of 75 days 
the study said 
patients in the specialevaluation group were told by their 
doctors they could return at 48 days and did so at a median of 51 
days representing a 32 percent reduction in the convalescent 
period the study said 
this 32 percent reduction was associated with 2102 of 
additional earned salary per patient in the six months after the 
heart attack the researchers said 
the study found no significant difference in the rate of 
subsequent heart attacks or other heart trouble between the two 
groups 
patients performing manual labor returned to work no later than 
those performing sedentary jobs or lightphysical labor the 
researchers said 
previous studies have shown that among mployed patients who 
classify as lowrisk heartattack victims the advice of 
physicians and the patients own beliefs about his health are the 
most important factors in governing when that patient returns to 
work 
the researchers estimated that half of the 800000 heartattack 
cases each year could be considered lowrisk that is they are 
not accompanied by other medical problems and the patient has less 
than a 10 percent chance of suffering another fatal or nonfatal 
heart attack within a year 
patients who have an uncomplicated heart attack quite 
possibly can have a more rapid recovery than is allowed dennis 
said in a telephone interview thursday

interior secretary donald hodel is waging a 
letterwriting campaign harshly critical of house democrats 
supporting legislation to protect a national battleground but 
republicans backing the same bill are noticeably absent from his 
target list 
a spokesman for hodel said thursday that the only reason 29 
republican cosponsors of the bill escaped his scorn is that the 
targets were selected in haphazard fashion 
letters sent by hodel to 13 newspapers in the home districts of 
the democrats say they should be ashamed of themselves for 
backing a ludicrous plan to protect the manassas national 
battlefield park from nearby development 
hodel opposes the bill drafted by reps michael andrews 
dtexas and robert mrazek dny that would require the interior 
department to acquire land now owned by a developer who plans a 
shopping center office buildings and residential units next to the 
civil war battlefield in virginia 
critics say the massive development would destroy the 
stillrustic feeling of the 4600acre battleground 
interior department spokesman david prosperi confirmed thursday 
that seven house democrats had been singled out in letters by 
hodel but denied that the secretary was targeting only democrats 
the selection was done in a very haphazard manner prosperi 
said if we had had time we would have sent letters to 
everyone republicans and democrats 
prosperi said letters from hodel criticizing the measure were 
sent to 13 newspapers in the congressional districts of andrews and 
mrazek as well as democratic reps john lewis of georgia bill 
richardson of new mexico james clarke of north carolina robert 
kastenmeier of wisconsin jim slattery of kansas and barbara 
kennelly of connecticut 
the letters were published in some of the papers in late may and 
throughout june 
in a letter to the houston chronicle which appeared on may 27 
hodel wrote andrews ought to be ashamed of himself because he is 
playing politics with the future of manassas battlefield it is 
easy enough to grab an issue in washington in order to gain media 
attention but the congressmans idea that the solution here is to 
buy that land adjacent to the battlefield is ludicrous 
nearly identical language substituting only the name of the 
congressman appeared in the june 9 editions of long island newsday 
published in mrazeks district the june 16 issues of the atlanta 
daily world lewis district and the june 28 editions of the 
wisconsin state journal kastenmeiers district 
its clear that mr hodels actions have become extremely 
partisan said mrazek i found the harshness of the letter 
surprising 
while both andrews and mrazek were lambasted by hodel 
republican cosponsors of their bill from neighboring congressional 
districts escaped the interior secretarys scorn 
hodel favors a plan that would allow the shopping mall to be 
built next to the battlefield park but would close two roads 
running through the battlefield to reduce the effect of traffic 
heading to and from the complex 
the developmentcontrol bill has 200 cosponsors including 29 
republicans the associated press contacted 25 of the republicans 
all of whom said newspapers in their districts had not printed 
letters from hodel 
the letterwriting campaign especially angered andrews since 
two republican congressmen from districts adjacent to his houston 
district cosponsored the legislation but were not singled out by 
hodel 
jack fields a republican congressman from houston feels 
strongly about this issue but hodel didnt mention him andrews 
said the secretary of the interior does not serve himself well 
when he uses a blistering attack on people who disagree with him 
its disappointing

huge rock formations on mars that resemble a 
human face a pyramid and a fortress could be the work of a lost 
civilization or just a trick of nature say scientists urging a 
closeup look at the outcroppings 
four scientists including a former astronaut said thursday that 
the mysterious formations should be scrutinized further by 
spacecraft 
photographs taken in 1976 by the viking 1 spacecraft as it 
orbited mars show a sphinxlike face staring outward into space 
the image resembles a death mask with a long shadow obscuring one 
side of the face while emphasizing a humanlike brow nose eye 
socket and mouth 
nearby is an angular mountain suggesting the sharp lines of a 
pyramid and a grouping of rocks that some view as a fortress near 
the center of what they suggest could have been an ancient city of 
a lost civilization 
or the scientists said at a news conference thursday the 
images captured by the viking camera could all be a trick of 
light and shadow 
we have found something that is so interesting that it demands 
we go back to mars and get more data said richard c hoagland 
founder of the mars project an organization that is studying the 
viking photographs 
brian t oleary a former astronaut and an expert on mars said 
there is so much uncertainty about the origin of the rock face that 
it should be a major target for future spacecraft sent to mars 
the feature is sufficiently exciting that we must go back to 
mars and photograph it at a higher resolution said oleary 
gerald soffel the mission scientist on the viking project and 
currently chief of the space and earth sciences branch at the 
goddard space center said in a telephone interview that the 
facelike image captured by the camera has been dismissed by most 
scientists as an illusion caused by bright sunlight and shadow 
he said some of the worlds finest geologists have examined the 
photos and they said what we were seeing is light and shadow 
but mark carlotto an optical engineering expert said a new 
sophisticated computer study of the photos suggests that the face 
and other formations are not of natural origin 
in an article published in applied optics carlotto said a 
computer enhancement of the viking photographs shows the rock 
shapes appear to have been carved by intelligent design and not 
by the random forces of nature 
in one study carlotto said the face was compared statistically 
with other shapes photographed on mars and he concluded that the 
face is not natural 
its extremely unlikely that its a trick of light and 
shadow said carlotto 
soffel said he planned to study carlottos paper he said its 
publication in applied optics a learned journal supervised by 
scientists who evaluate each submission gives credibility to the 
work 
but he said viking scientists first spotted the face in 1976 and 
never took it seriously 
nasa has never taken a position that it is nonsense or 
science he said but i admit that nasa has not shown much 
interest 
the carlotto study was published in may but hoagland did not 
call the news conference until thursday the same day that the 
soviet union launched a probe toward mars 
oleary said soviet scientists showed great interest in the mars 
formations when he talked with them in january but was told their 
spacecraft was not technically designed for such a survey of the 
cydonia region of mars where the structures are located 
hoagland said nasa scientists dismissed the images found in the 
photographs as oddities of no significance or a trick of 
nature 
hoagland however said he has studied the photos for years and 
has discovered that in addition to the face there is a complex of 
unusual objects that he believes could have been built by 
intelligent design 
the complex which he calls a city includes a fivesided 
mountain that resembles a pyramid a grouping of rocks that he said 
could be a fortress and a bluff that he believes could have been 
part of an astronomical marker 
hoagland said a line drawn from the center of the city across 
the face to the bluff would line up exactly with the sun at the 
moment of mars summer solstice as it would have occurred 500000 
years ago he said mars has shifted on its axis since and that the 
solstice angle now is different 
geologically the odds are one in 300000 that this would be 
there by chance said hoagland 
nasa plans to launch an unmanned probe called the mars 
observer in five years and hoagland said it will have on board a 
camera that could settle the question about the origin of the stone 
features on the planet 
randolfo pozos executive director of the mars project said 
members of the organization are divided about the origin of the 
face on mars 
some of our group feel this is a lost civilization he said 
others think it is just an interesting geologic formation

accusations of insider trading with a political 
twist are rocking the dominant liberal democratic party in the 
latest scandal revealing the close ties between japanese politics 
and business 
but experts say it is unlikely to hurt the ldp seriously despite 
the participation of senior aides to prime minister noboru 
takeshita and at least three men who want to be premier 
the affair involves current or former private secretaries to 
takeshita finance minister kiichi miyazawa ldp secretary general 
shintaro abe expremier yasuhiro nakasone and at least four other 
excabinet ministers 
the aides have been identified among 76 people who obtained 
stocks of recruitcosmos co a real estate and leasing company at 
discounts before the shares were issued publicly 
this involves the most senior ldp officials and there is 
going to be a major outcry from the japanese people said shigeru 
ito a highranking official in the japan socialist party the no 
1 opposition party 
their obtaining stocks before they go on the market is unfair 
and dirty ito told the associated press although they broke 
no law they abused their positions to line their pockets 
political funding and the stock market are sure to be examined 
now 
under japanese law the stock deals were technically legal 
because firms can determine to whom they sell shares and at what 
price 
japans major newspapers quoted informed sources as saying the 
secretaries politicians top aides and confidants made up to 1 
million from sales of the stocks shortly after they were offered to 
the public in 1986 the profits apparently were used for campaign 
funds and not for personal gain 
news commentators said the deals raised suspicions that the 
company was trying to curry favor with the politicians but so far 
nothing has been proved 
fundraising and gifts of money have long been the key to 
success in japanese politics senior lawmakers routinely pass out 
envelopes stuffed with bills to their juniors to cultivate 
parliamentary votes and support 
in particular stock market manipulation is a major revenue 
source for politicians and it is rarely challenged according to 
masayuki fukuoka a professor of political science at tokyos 
komazawa university 
money politics is so longstanding and deeprooted in japanese 
politics that it is considered a necessary evil and seen as all 
right as long as people arent caught fukuoaka said 
the scandal is likely to throw the next diet parliament 
session scheduled to discuss the ldps tax plans into disarray as 
opposition politicians attack the party on moral and ethical 
grounds 
people are going to be saying we pay consumer taxes we pay 
sales taxes why should politicians get away with this fukuoka 
said 
the recruitcosmos affair is the latest of several financial 
quagmires to hit the ldp this year 
six people have been indicted since may for arranging bribes 
offered by advertising agencies to gain public relations contracts 
with the prime ministers office 
last month five executives of a tokyo electronics firm who made 
large donations to both the ldp and japan socialist party were 
arrested for evading income tax of 115 million earned from 
illegal stock manipulations 
despite the furor takeshita and abe miyazawa and ldp policy 
chief michio watanabe all prime contenders for takeshitas job 
are likely to emerge unscathed 
takeshitas main political rivals are in his own party and are 
all involved in the scandal takeshita has nothing to lose 
prominent political critic soichiro tawara said in an interview 
its like cutting off a lizards tail it will just grow 
back fukuoka said they are all denying they knew anything and 
blaming their secretaries so theyll get new secretaries and 
apologize and life will go on 
in 1974 japans biggest postwar scandal did not destroy the 
political career of former prime minister kakuei tanaka who was 
forced out of the premiership and the ldp over questionable land 
dealings and was convicted in 1983 of accepting bribes from the 
lockheed corp 
he was japans most powerful politician until he suffered a 
stroke in 1985 he remains a parliamentarian and is appealing his 
conviction 
the influential newspaper asahi shimbun which broke the 
recruitcosmos story said in an editorial we find it hard to 
believe that they really didnt know anything about the huge 
profits they were making 
the paper noted that in japan when a political scandal breaks 
the secretaries of politicians are invariably named as scapegoats 
two influential journalists also have been linked to the deals 
ko morita president of the nihon keizai shimbun japans most 
prestigious financial newspaper who stepped down wednesday and 
reizo utagawa former managing editor of the mainichi shimbun both 
reportedly made massive profits from sales of recruitcosmos stocks 
they received

the phoenix police chief denied thursday 
that his department maintained a computer list of suspected aids 
carriers although he acknowledged there were a few such notations 
in the files 
we do not have and we have never had a list chief ruben 
ortega said in response to an article in the arizona republic 
thursday that said phoenix police and maricopa county sheriffs 
officials both have maintained files on suspected aids carriers for 
at least a year 
ortega said the department had launched an investigation to 
determine how aids information was placed in some files he said 
the practice is unauthorized and speculated that officers who 
requested aids information be entered into files do so because they 
feel a need to warn other officers 
ortega denied the republics report that the police files were 
purged of the aids information after inquiries were received from 
the newspaper the purge already had begun at that point he said 
maricopa county sheriffs officials confirmed that they include 
information on aids and any other contagious disease in individual 
files when a person goes to jail the information is based on what 
officers are told by the inmates or on examinations capt frank 
waelde said 
jane aiken an arizona state university law professor who 
specializes in legal issues involving aids said that maintaining 
such files raises concerns about abuses of medical confidentiality 
and the discrimination that could result 
bill macdonald chairman of the phoenixbased arizona aids 
project a private organization expressed similar concerns 
it is outrageous that the police department has been carrying 
that type of information in a persons records macdonald said 
i thought there were laws that protect the rights of 
individuals 
mike petchel president of the phoenix law enforcement 
association said officers need such information for their own 
safety 
personally i think its an area that needs to be examined for 
a policy because officers feel they may be subjected to contact 
with someone carrying an infectious disease petchel said 
the number of names in the files was not known nor was it clear 
where police obtained the names 
chad butt a 45yearold phoenix man told the republic that he 
learned in may that police computer files had the phrase high 
risk aids next to his name 
butts said he was told by police that the information came 
from the health department 
however officials of the maricopa county health department and 
the arizona department of health services denied releasing names of 
any of the more than 2000 aids carriers on file in arizona

from sax solos to senegalese soul a sizzling 
stew of eclectic sounds is turning this frenchcanadian city into 
the new orleans of the north and luring thousands of fans to north 
americas biggest jazz bash 
a slew of streets have been shut down for the ninth montreal 
international jazz festival a 10day blowout expected to attract a 
record 600000 people by the time a louisiana bayou blues band lays 
down the final riffs early monday 
with a roster ranging from miles davis to manhattan transfer 
the festival which began last friday has transformed the town 
into a musical mecca 
under the castiron balconies of gabled houses on rue stdenis 
buskers acrobats and bongo players entertain between bandstands 
and the snap of bebop trumpets emerges from crowded cafes 
a few blocks away 60000 listeners packed place des arts 
earlier this week to hear white south african singer johnny clegg 
and his integrated band savuka deliver their soulful antiapartheid 
message 
organizers of the nonprofit 35 million festival also staged a 
cuban night featuring keyboard prodigy gonzalo rubalcaba the 
canadian debut of mamma tongue a gambianamerican band mixing 
africa oral tradition with jazz and an inspired double bill of 
pianist dorothy donegan and alto sax star phil woods that caused a 
happy riot 
after many encores an exhausted donegan quipped did i get 
the job 
guitarist pat metheny a guest at eight of the nine montreal 
gatherings was dubbed the festivals patron saint and appointed 
judge of a canadian jazz band contest 
its the best fest going metheny told a news conference 
i dont think theres anything that can compare its such a 
great town and a great setting especially with the whole 
environment of closing off the streets 
george wein who once ran the newport jazz festival has called 
montreal the most complete and bestorganized jazz festival in the 
world aided by 415000 in government grants 
with its gallic atmosphere and european sophistication montreal 
has always been hip to jazz its the hometown of oscar peterson 
a recent influx of third world immigrants has rejuvenated and 
broadened the tradition 
within the heart of the city you have french english cubans 
puerto ricans irish its so culturally varied said strolling 
musician jeremy dunlop who arrived from jamaica 13 years ago and is 
sitting in on the deepbarrelled african djembe drum whenever a 
band offers an invitation 
miles davis contributed not only the festivals opening night 
highlight on friday he drew a selfportrait in pastels that became 
the official poster and made its way onto stage backdrops and 
tshirts 
although afficionados paid up to 2450 to hear davis dizzy 
gillespie ornette coleman and robert cray the heart of the 
festival is the 250 free concerts in the open air plus five 
marching bands 
festival president alain simard defends his decision to invite 
reggae star jimmy cliff blues singer etta james senegalese 
sensation youssou ndour and other acts outside the realms of 
traditional jazz 
we dont have a dogmatic vision of jazz its not something to 
put in a museum lately jazz has been very influenced by latin and 
african music simard said in an interview 
he said musicians tell each other about montreal and its never 
any problem booking acts in nine years weve not had a 
cancellation 
people feel secure here even at late hours out in the 
streets it probably couldnt happen in new york

quick think back to the moscow summit it was 
only a few weeks ago 
what did it produce 
an end to the nuclear arms race a middle east agreement 
superpower cooperation to end the iraniraq war 
none of the above 
president reagan who now leads all us chief executives in 
superpower summits with four of them gave his enthusiastic support 
to mikhail gorbachevs campaign to restructure the soviet economy 
that was significant and very dramatic 
here was the american president a pronounced critic of 
communism in moscow endorsing gorbachevs perestroika program 
and blaming the bureaucracy not the kremlin for violations of 
human rights 
but the agreements reached in moscow were on the level of 
fishing and maritime pacts not the sort of accords that require 
the immense political power of the us president and the soviet 
general secretary 
charles m fairbanks jr a scholar at the johns hopkins school 
of advanced international studies has concluded that summits 
frequently fail to make effective use of the considerable authority 
of national leaders 
in a recent study and an interview fairbanks said summits 
frequently become occasions of drama rather than instruments of 
coordinated diplomacy 
the moscow summit he said produced essentially nothing in 
diplomatic terms the most important thing i think that took 
place was reagan speaking to a soviet audience that probably 
served a useful function but its certainly not the function a 
summit is held out to serve 
summits have come to be understood as occasions for personal 
negotiations between immensely powerful political leaders at 
reykjavik in 1986 for instance gorbachev presented reagan with a 
series of historic arms control proposals 
these included the abolition of ballistic missiles and 
possibly all nuclear weapons 
normally diplomats at lower levels work for years to reach the 
point where such cosmic decisions can be made at the summit 
the advantages of traditional diplomacy are that it is calm 
quiet and usually secret fairbanks writes summit conferences 
however are very dramatic 
gorbachev used the reykjavik summit to symbolize his dedication 
to arms control it also produced pressure for concessions from 
reagan but they were later withdrawn the idea of banning 
ballistic missiles was quickly and quietly buried only a few months 
later 
in the end reykjavik did not produce anything substantial 
because summits are so dramatic they create a desperate need 
for success and this fairbanks said gives birth to a tremendous 
temptation to proclaim fictitious results 
reporters get sucked in trivia is exalted but sometimes all 
that really happened is that the two most powerful leaders in the 
world met 
time magazine seemed to realize this in its account of the 1967 
summit meeting between president lyndon johnson and soviet premier 
alexei kosygin in glasboro nj in 1967 
in the aftermath of historys first hotline diplomacy time 
reported the most significant aspect of the smalltown summit was 
that it happened 
then there are the summits which really produce results 
president jimmy carter invited prime minister menachem begin of 
israel and president anwar sadat of egypt to camp david in 1978 and 
overcame differences between the two middle east leaders since 
their own summit meeting a year earlier 
the result was the 1979 peace treaty between egypt and israel 
reaching back into history fairbanks recalls the longforgotten 
summit held between wilhelm ii of germany and nikolai ii of russia 
at byorkyo in july 1905 
in terms of immediate results he writes this was perhaps the 
most successful summit in history 
germany signed an alliance with russia that might have changed 
the course of history 
but even that treaty was quickly canceled 
nikolais foreign minister explained to the czar that it 
undercut russias longstanding alliance with france and had to be 
discarded 
nine years later russia went to war with germany as an ally of 
france the war devastated russia and paved the way for the 
bolshevik revolution

us district judge alcee l hastings says his 
fight to remain on the federal bench is far from being over 
even though a house subcommittee unanimously recommended that he be 
impeached 
hastings floridas first black federal judge said from miami 
he is legally morally and spiritually correct and the 
subcommittees 70 decision thursday shows members do not respect 
the jury system 
a federal jury acquitted hastings five years ago of the bribery 
charges that account for part of the criminal justice subcommittee 
resolution containing 17 articles of impeachment 
the resolution charged that hastings conspired with a washington 
lawyer to seek a bribe from two convicted racketeers lied during 
his trial about his action and leaked information from an fbi 
wiretap over which he had jurisdiction 
the subcommittee found that hastings committed high crimes and 
misdemeanors and should be impeached the house judiciary 
committee will decide next thursday whether to send the resolution 
to the house floor 
if the full house impeaches hastings the senate would conduct a 
trial to determine whether he should be removed from office 
hastings attorney terence j anderson said he was surprised 
by the unanimous vote i thought there might be only five votes 
against him he said i take it in good faith that they believe 
it was an impeachable offense 
its now time to prepare for a trial in the senate said 
anderson echoing the thoughts of others that the unanimous vote 
almost assures that the resolution will be approved by the full 
committee and the house 
hastings said he would not step down from the bench voluntarily 
it aint over hastings said its far from being over 
anderson said hastings hasnt fought this battle for seven 
years for a 90000ayear job 
its the principle of it he said 
anderson said however that hastings may recuse himself from 
cases if there is a trial in the senate 
you cant be trying cases and be running back and forth 
between washington and miami to hear them he said 
hastings who calls the charges politically motivated and has 
insisted that he is innocent of any wrongdoing refused to testify 
on his own behalf during the subcommittees hearings an action 
more than one member commented on rep george w gekas rpa the 
ranking republican member said his refusal to testify hurt him and 
made for a weak defense 
he didnt testify on principle said anderson he 
testified before a jury of his peers under oath and those 
transcripts were available if they wanted to read them he didnt 
have to testify here 
in february 1983 hastings was acquitted of charges he conspired 
with washington lawyer william borders to receive a bribe in 
exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted racketeers 
borders was convicted in a separate trial was sent to prison and 
has now been released 
a month after hastings acquittal us district judges w 
terrell hodges of florida and anthony a alaimo of georgia filed a 
complaint under the 1980 discipline law asking the 11th us 
circuit of appeals which includes florida to investigate 
hastings after a lengthy inquiry made longer by hastings 
challenge to the laws constitutionality a fivemember panel of 
the 11th circuit recommended that the house begin the impeachment 
inquiry 
two years ago us district judge harry e claiborne of nevada 
became the first federal judge in 50 years to be impeached unlike 
hastings claiborne was convicted of a crime tax evasion and was 
brought to the senate for his trial from a federal penitentiary 
another house judiciary subcommittee is holding hearings on an 
impeachment resolution against us district judge walter l nixon 
jr of mississippi who was convicted of perjury and is serving a 
prison sentence impeachment charges were brought against claiborne 
and nixon when they refused to resign from the bench after their 
convictions

so fierce is the navys aegis system the 6 
millionpart 1 billion weaponry used to down an iranian jetliner 
that crewmen on the first aegis ship coined the motto if it 
flies it dies 
but some looking at sundays tragedy in the persian gulf say 
unleashing the aegis cruiser vincennes in the tiny crowded waters 
was the equivalent of letting a pit bull protect a playpen 
analysts speculating on the attack conclude the cruisers 
defense system did exactly what it was supposed to track and 
destroy an apparent threat suspected at the time to be an iranian 
f14 fighter 
but questions remain like why aegis supersophisticated 
technology could not separate civilian from military air traffic 
or distinguish a 63footlong fighter from a 176foot airliner 
the navy and the key aegis contractor rca corp of moorestown 
nj have given only limited answers but experts and extensive 
defense literature offer some suggestions 
the vincennes only the third ship to carry the technology 
relied on aegis to discover and track an unidentified aircraft 
approaching during hostilities between us and iranian forces 
aegis experts note that while radar consoles likely showed the 
plane as hostile it was vincennes capt will rogers iii not the 
emotionless aegis computers who gave the order to fire 
one of two aegisguided sm2 standard missiles found its mark 
later determined to be an unarmed airbus with 290 people aboard 
dr thomas amlie a former director of the naval weapons center 
in china lake calif said the system appears to have done 
exactly what it was supposed to do 
it worked perfectly unfortunately said amlie now 
employed by the air force 
aegis ships carry a complex mixture of radar computers and 
weapons to cast a protective net over a navy task force when the 
net is penetrated aegis evaluates the intruder and declares it 
friend or foe 
the system first deployed in 1983 is said to be able to sort 
out more than 200 targets from as far out as 250 miles 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee on thursday questioned whether such a powerful system 
should be deployed in the narrow gulf 
the aegis cruiser is essentially a bluewater ship that was 
operating in a brownwater lake said nunn 
but a capitol hill expert insisted aegis is the worlds best 
naval system for fighting in close quarters it gives the 
commander more time to make a ponderous decision said the 
researcher who asked to stay anonymous 
the vincennes crew had about four minutes from the time they 
picked up this target until it was declared hostile adm william 
j crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said sunday 
pentagon officials say rogers concluded the airbus was an enemy 
based on its flight path its failure to identify itself and its 
confusing broadcast of both civilian and military frequencies 
the information was processed electronically into the vincennes 
combat information center its nerve center the windowless chamber 
glows with the light of four 42inchsquare battle picture 
screens and other consoles 
they depict aircraft not as traditional radar blips but as 
graphic symbols white on a blue background roughly like a 
complex video game 
while navy officials have declined this week to let reporters 
view such a display one expert says aegis designates planes by 
showing circles around friends diamonds around foes and squares 
around unknowns 
like all navy antiaircraft systems aegis cannot definitively 
distinguish one type of plane from another especially when flying 
head on 
the system relies on friendly aircraft to emit or squawk 
their identities aegis sees all unidentified airplanes as 
potential foes 
humans using the system as a tool must make the ultimate 
decision 
its not designed to classify targets the congressional 
staffer said its just designed to detect and track them 
ironically he said an experienced radar operator using a less 
sophisticated system might have been able to tell an airbus from a 
fighter by comparing the size of blips 
in theory the vincennes controlroom screens could show 
civilian routes and even expected flights experts say 
the uss ticonderoga the first aegis cruiser acted as a de 
facto control tower off lebanon in 1983 according to its 
combatsystems officer 
the ticonderogas systems routinely sorted out traffic in 
the potentially hostile skies cmdr james mcclure wrote in a 
glowing 1985 review of aegis for proceedings 
however during that mission the ticonderogas computers 
reportedly failed to see a small incoming plane visible to the 
naked eye in 1986 hostilities off libya the aegis cruiser 
yorktown targeted and shot what some analysts say was a dense cloud 
on the waters surface 
even crowe acknowledges aegis has limitations it has not 
solved all of our problems and it does not defy the laws of 
physics he said

a boston banker nominated to the federal 
reserve board is denying accusations that he attempted to dodge 
taxes in a 25million golden parachute compensation package 
with the bank he heads 
the tax is being paid regardless and the federal 
government is losing no money john p laware told the senate 
banking committee im not sure its a dodge 
sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the committee saw it 
differently he noted that the 500000ayear deal requires the 
bank not laware to pay a 20 percent penalty that congress 
imposed on portions of such arrangements that are considered 
excessive 
how do you justify such an attempt to dodge the tax code 
proxmire asked he noted that congress enacted the special penalty 
in 1984 to discourage excessive payments which officers and 
directors vote themselves when corporations change ownership or 
control 
laware repeated im not sure a tax dodge is involved 
laware was given the special compensation package earlier this 
year just after turning 60 as part of a merger agreement that 
created shawmut national corp of boston and hartford a bank 
holding company a banker for 35 years he has been chairman and 
chief executive officer of another shawmut holding company since 
1980 
under the agreement the corporation will continue lawares 
annual salary of about 500000 until he is 65 even if he leaves 
the bank in addition the bank will give him enough extra to cover 
the 20 percent penalty laware must pay income tax on the full 
package 
proxmire estimated that having the bank pay the penalty was 
worth 200000 to laware 
laware has agreed to sever all financial connections with the 
bank before taking the federal reserve seat 
despite proxmires concerns about the financial deal the 
chairman and most other members who attended the hearing praised 
laware the president has made an excellent choice said sen 
jake garn rutah 
nevertheless there is no assurance laware a democrat will 
take a seat on the board which controls the nations money supply 
and thus interest rates that is because his confirmation would 
mean that president reagan would have filled all seven seats on the 
board 
committee aides say some democrats have expressed a reluctance 
to seat another reagan nominee this year preferring to leave a 
vacancy for the next president who they hope will be democrat 
michael dukakis 
proxmire told reporters he will confer with committee members 
before deciding whether the panel should vote on the laware 
nomination this year should the committee recommend the 
nomination it would be up to majority leader robert c byrd to 
determine whether the senate considers the nomination this year 
lawares term would expire jan 31 2002 
the issue of monetary policy was barely mentioned at the 
hearing most questions were about the federal budget and trade 
deficits the increasing share of us debt held by foreign 
investors and third world debt 
laware said he is little concerned about the fact that only one 
of the worlds 10 biggest banks is american 
i dont think that makes much difference he said its 
how wellmanaged and profitable they are i am more concerned 
with the profitandloss statement than with size

congress has sidestepped a final decision on 
one of the touchiest parochial issues faced by the 535 legislators 
closing military installations the pentagon says are no longer 
needed 
the house debated the issue for four hours thursday and could 
agree only that it should put off any final decision 
this is not something people around here like to deal with 
very much admitted rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house 
armed services committee 
while the house inconclusively debated house and senate 
negotiators agreed on a pentagon budget bill that dropped any 
mention of closing bases an issue on which the negotiators had 
been trying to reach agreement the final decision was to drop any 
mention of base closings from the bill 
bases mean jobs something legislators fight hard to protect 
several house members noted during thursdays debate 
it has been historically unthinkable and unworkable for the 
department of defense to close bases because of congressional 
opposition said rep william dickinson rala ranking 
republican on the armed services committee 
in fact congressional opposition has prevented any base 
closings since 1977 but in the 16 years before then the pentagon 
shut down 3600 installations 
there are about 3800 military installations around the nation 
and another 1900 overseas according to aspin who said the figure 
covers facilities ranging from recruiting stations to the largest 
bases 
defense secretary frank c carlucci has appointed a ninemember 
commission to review which of the military installations can be 
shut down that panel is meeting now and pentagon officials have 
said that between 2 billion and 5 billion annually could 
eventually be saved 
the commission is scheduled to make its recommendations by dec 
31 and president reagan would then have two weeks or shortly 
before he leaves office to either accept or reject the entire list 
the house is considering two separate bills that would implement 
the commissions decisions 
one sponsored by rep dick armey rtexas provides that the 
commissions recommendations would take effect unless both the 
house and senate vote to reject them 
the second backed by a trio of house committees provided that 
the recommendations only take effect if both chambers vote in favor 
of them but the house voted 250138 approval thursday of an 
amendment to the committeebacked bill a change that provides the 
closures will go ahead unless both chambers vote to block them 
that modified the bill to make it similar to the armey plan and 
provided a test of sentiment according to aspin 
then the chamber adjourned following its normal pattern of not 
doing business after thursday afternoon which allows west coast 
members to return home for a weekend of reelection campaigning 
rep dave mccurdy dokla said closing bases is certainly one 
of the toughest political issues we face 
until 1975 congress had placed few obstacles in the way of 
pentagon base closure plans but when the air force proposed 
shutting down loring air force base in northern maine that year 
congress blocked the procedure one requirement ordered lengthy 
and costly environmental impact studies for the loring closing 
and all future closings 
house approval of the baseclosing bill would send it directly 
to a conference committee with the senate which approved its own 
plan two months ago the package was dropped out of the pentagon 
budget bill in order to give the house time to decide what it 
wanted to do according to senate leaders

as the pentagon pieces together more 
information about what happened in the haze over the persian gulf 
on sunday it has been revising its explanations of the shooting 
down of an iranian airliner by a us warship 
starting with what type of plane was shot down the pentagon 
originally said it was an f14 jet fighter not a commercial 
airliner the pentagon has gone on to revise its account of 
whether it was in the commercial air corridor at what altitude it 
was flying and what sort of signals it was transmitting 
we all of us probably know a lot more about that situation now 
than the captain of the ship did defense department spokesman 
dan howard told reporters thursday at an 80minute briefing devoted 
almost entirely to the shooting 
still he said much remains unknown and the full official us 
explanation will have to await the report of a navy investigating 
team now in the gulf area that is expected to complete its report 
in two or three weeks 
from the beginning the affair has been marked by confusion as 
officials and reporters groped for information in the highly 
technical world of airandsea battle in the 1980s

the pentagons first announcement issued within hours after the 
251 am edt incident sunday said the plane shot down by the 
cruiser vincennes was an iranian f14 approaching in a hostile 
manner 
at 130 pm edt sunday however adm william crowe chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff appeared at a hastily called news 
briefing and confirmed iranian reports that the plane was in fact a 
civilian airliner 
pentagon sources said us military leaders changed their mind 
after an analysis of intelligence data showed an a300 airbus had 
been found in the waters of the gulf and no iranians warplanes were 
flying in the area at the time 
one source said the intelligence collected after the incident 
included radio signals from airplanes and ground stations as well 
as a limited and not always reliable network of informers on the 
ground 
in his sunday briefing crowe stressed that the information he 
was giving was based on the information currently available and 
was subject to correction later

the suspect aircraft was outside the prescribed commercial air 
corridor crowe said in a statement that became a subject of 
dispute in the ensuing days 
on wednesday according to congressional sources navy briefers 
told house and senate members that the airliner was inside the 
20mile wide corridor assigned to commercial airliners flying 
between the bandar abbas airfield and dubai 
howard said thursday the aircraft was about 4 miles outside 
the normal flight path which he said veteran air traffic 
controllers had told him was the center line of the corridor 
the width of such commercial air corridors varies although they 
are 20 miles wide in iran they are eight miles wide in the united 
states and there have been suggestions to make them narrower 
howard said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in another statement that has been called into question crowe 
said sunday that the airplane was decreasing in altitude as it 
neared the ship he said that it was at 7800 to 9000 feet when 
it was hit 
data from the frigate uss john h sides which was in the same 
area indicated that the plane was at 12600 feet and either steady 
or ascending 
howard said thursday that the altitude reported for the plane by 
air traffic controllers at dubai united arab emirates was similar 
to that given by crowe and that if the altitude were as different 
as reported by the sides the missile would not have hit the 
airplane 
he conceded however that authorities do not know whether the 
missile scored a direct hit or merely exploded somewhere within 
lethal range of the aircraft 
crowe also said sunday that the aircraft neither answered nor 
changed its course after being given warnings by the vincennes on 
both military and civilian frequencies 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at his briefings tuesday and thursday howard said the vincennes 
received signals from the airplane in modes common to civilian 
commercial and military aircraft and could not tell from the signal 
whether the plane was civilian or military 
both times howard said this was not inconsistent with the 
version given by crowe who said there were electronic 
indications on the vincennes that led it to believe the aircraft 
was an f14 
after the congressional briefing wednesday rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee said 
signals received by the vincennes were identical to those emitted 
earlier by iranian f14s from bandar abbas leading to speculation 
that they did not come from the airliner 
howard however said that such speculation was based on a 
discussion of remote possibilities and that almost certainly 
there is no phantom aircraft there

president reagan is expected to sign a 178 
billion package for energy and water development programs a bill 
whose timely passage made it something of a legislative oddity 
the measure sent to the white house on thursday following 913 
approval by the senate is the first regular appropriations bill 
for the coming fiscal year to clear congress 
for the past two years lawmakers have rolled the 13 regular 
bills into huge omnibus packages called continuing resolutions 
if the energy and water legislation is signed by reagan it 
would be the first regular spending bill to get a presidential 
signature since december 1985 
the bill is expected to get his approval it is one of the few 
fiscal 1989 appropriations bills wending their way through congress 
that has not drawn a veto threat 
the legislation is a holdtheline plan containing few new 
initiatives and lawmakers say not one dime to allow the army 
corps of engineers and bureau of reclamation to begin building any 
new dams harbor and irrigation projects next year 
another casualty is the superconducting super collider which 
was refused the 350 million the administration sought to begin its 
construction instead congress voted 100 million for more 
preliminary planning for the highenergy physics research project 
leaders of the house and senate appropriations committees said 
the next president should make the decision on whether to commit 
the nation to building the multibilliondollar project 
the legislation would give the corps 11 million less in fiscal 
1989 which begins next oct 1 than it is now getting the bureau 
would get 40 million more both agencies would have money to 
continue work on more than 200 existing construction projects but 
at a slower pace in a number of cases 
the energy department would get about twothirds of the 1783 
billion with 81 billion earmarked for the nuclear activities it 
conducts on behalf of the department of defense 
there is 3 million in the bill to bolster federal research into 
the greenhouse effect which some scientists say is a dangerous 
global warming trend caused by mankinds overloading the atmosphere 
with gases like carbon and fluorocarbons

members of congress are seeing red at federal 
regulators newest projections more than doubling the bill the 
government will be left with as it tries to bail out texas 
faltering savings and loan industry 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
raised the ante on the bailouts thursday telling the house banking 
committee that the estimated cost of dealing with the problems of 
texas thrifts would be 152 billion previously regulators had 
said the bill would be 7 billion 
now you see it now you dont said a frustrated rep 
fernand j st germain dri chairman of the banking panel 
watch the bouncing ball 
its called garbage in and garbage out said rep stan 
parris rva the definition of rosy scenario is changing so fast 
i cant even keep up with it 
wall said his agencys estimate of bailout costs in texas had 
increased because thrifts losses and the costs of resolving their 
problems have been more expensive than expected st germain 
however said there were other factors as well 
some of the problems are just plain oldfashioned 
mismanagement insider dealing fraud and highflying excesses 
exacerbated by lax supervision and hesitant enforcement he said 
many lawmakers have long been jousting with bank board 
officials accusing them of using optimistic economic scenarios to 
justify rosy cost projections 
wall did not reveal a new projection for what it would cost to 
bail out all of the countrys savings and loans facing financial 
problems but he said we see that the resources can be and 
would be sufficient for the size of the problem as we see it 
wall also told the lawmakers that his agency would be able to 
raise 425 billion over the next decade to cover insolvencies 
across the country 
the government had previously estimated that the cost of 
bailouts nationally would be in the 25 billion to 30 billion 
range and that the bank board would have 302 billion at its 
disposal to merge sell or liquidate troubled thrifts 
wall said that to pay for the newly estimated costs of the texas 
bailouts his agency will raise an additional 123 billion mostly 
by extending the special assessment the thrifts now pay on their 
deposits 
of the countrys 3100 thrifts the bank board has a caseload of 
259 that will need financial assistance from the government and has 
identified 252 others likely to need financial help 
about 60 percent of the troubled thrifts are in the southwest 
half of those are in texas alone where the economy has faltered in 
recent years because of falling oil prices until now the 
government had estimated it would cost 7 billion to deal with the 
texas savings and loans 
the countrys savings and loans hold 950 billion in deposits in 
100 million accounts 
the nations thrifts lost 76 billion last year making it the 
industrys worst year since the depression in the first three 
months of this year 133 insolvent savings and loans in texas have 
lost 34 billion 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp the federal 
program that insures thrifts spent 37 billion last year to 
handle the insolvencies of 47 savings and loans 
due to the increasing strains from growing numbers of bailouts 
the fslic saw its reserve rop from 68 billion in 1983 to 600 
million last year congress provided 108 billion more for the 
program last august

a new regulation limiting us companies 
ability to weaken the voting power of stockholders as a hostile 
takeover defense is being hailed by a prominent raider as a victory 
for corporate democracy 
after nearly two years of periodic hearings and debate the 
securities and exchange commission voted 41 on thursday to approve 
a oneshare onevote rule under it actions that dilute the power 
of existing shareholders are generally barred 
the secs action helps to restore democracy to corporate 
america said texas oilman and takeover specialist t boone 
pickens jr chairman of the united shareholders association 
the rule is not perfect and there are loopholes but all 
things considered shareholders won a great victory pickens said 
in unrelated action the commission backed off from recommending 
legislation that would guarantee investors the right to sue their 
stockbroker in court 
the commission had been considering asking congress to outlaw 
clauses in brokerage account agreements that require customers to 
settle disputes through industrysponsored arbitration panels 
rather than through the courts 
but by a 50 vote the commission decided instead to ask stock 
exchanges and other organizations that run arbitration systems to 
study the matter and report back by oct 15 
the oneshare onevote rule takes effect immediately and 
companies will have to comply if they want their stock traded on an 
exchange or through the national association of securities dealers 
automated quotation system the 359 us companies that already 
have unequal voting rights will be exempted 
one popular takeover defense in which companies entice 
stockholders into giving up their voting rights by offering a 
special onetime dividend would be prohibited 
also barred would be rules that require a stock purchaser to 
wait sometimes for several years before newly acquired shares 
accrue full voting rights 
however in another voting rights area the sec decided to defer 
to the states if state law permits companies will be allowed to 
deny voting power to takeover raiders unless the other shareholders 
approve about a dozen states have adopted such laws 
richard g ketchum director of the secs division of market 
regulation said he doubted the new rule would have a dramatic 
effect on takeovers but he conceded that in a few cases takeovers 
would be easier because the rule eliminates some extremely 
effective defenses 
commissioner charles c cox the only member to vote against the 
rule said he believed the sec was intruding into an area that has 
traditionally been left to states chartering and governance of 
corporations 
i believe this is an improper use of the listing standards to 
tamper with corporate governance he said 
however commission chairman david s ruder said the rule is 
structured to be as least intrusive as possible 
companies will still be permitted to issue new shares with 
diluted voting power dilutedpower shares can also be issued to 
accomplish a merger and private companies going public will be 
able to issue both strongvoting and weakvoting shares 
stocks of foreign companies traded in the united states will be 
exempted from the regulations as will the stocks of small 
companies listed in the nasds socalled pink sheets and traded 
by brokers over the telephone 
on the arbitration issue rep edward j markey dmass 
chairman of the house subcommittee with jurisdiction over the 
securities markets sharply criticized the sec for giving in to 
industry lobbying and said he would press forward with legislation 
i think the industry stared into the secs eyes on this issue 
and the sec blinked he said 
when the commission discussed arbitration clauses last month 
the legislative recommendation looked headed for approval it was 
supported by ruder and sec member aulana l peters cox said he was 
inclined to favor it but wanted to hear from securities firms 
which strongly opposed banning the clauses 
but on thursday ruder retreated from his earlier support for 
an immediate vote saying it was encouraging that the industry 
would at least favor disclosure notices to customers explaining the 
meaning of the clauses and he said many firms have put a hold on 
plans to require arbitration agreements for cash accounts 
however james c meyer president of the north american 
securities administrators association which represents state 
regulators said small investors will see the commission failure 
to act as another sign that the deck is stacked against them

the reagan administrations bid to sell kuwait 
40 advanced f18 fighters is running into strong congressional 
opposition as the senate votes to strip a potent missile from the 
warplanes weapons inventory 
the senate action to remove the airtoground maverick missile 
from the 19 billion arms package came only hours after the 
administration formally asked congress to approve the sale to give 
oilrich kuwait a first line of defense in a region racked by 
the war between iran and iraq 
before the measure was adopted on a voice vote senators made 
clear they believe the maverick would pose a security threat to 
israel if it should fall into the hands of the arab enemies of the 
jewish state 
earlier thursday before a house foreign affairs subcommittee 
administration officials said the maverick was an essential part of 
the f18s defensive systems and part of an arms package so 
structured as to pose no threat to israel 
but critics said the sale would fuel an escalating arms race in 
the volatile persian gulf 
sen dennis deconcini dariz at first attempted to bar the 
sale of mavericks to any nation in the persian gulf region then 
modified his proposal to apply to kuwait only 
sen arlen specter rpa said that if he had his way he would 
condition the sale of the maverick and other stateoftheart 
weapons to middle east nations only if they renounce the use of 
force and recognize the right of israel to exist 
congress has 30 days to block the f18 sale otherwise it goes 
ahead 
although there is wide opposition in congress to selling 
sensitive high technology weapons to middle east nations it was not 
clear whether a ban on transferring mavericks to kuwait will 
eventually become law 
testifying before a house foreign affairs subcommittee peter 
burleigh assistant deputy secretary of state for near eastern 
affairs described the maverick as an essential element in a purely 
defensive package 
burleigh said the deal is in the interests of the united states 
which is using naval forces to protect the ships of kuwait and 
other nations sailing through the persian gulf 
friendly states should be their own first line of defense so 
we dont have to be burleigh said 
by helping a moderate gulf state assume greater responsibility 
for its own defense it complements our highly successful escort 
operations he said 
burleigh also testified that a group of us allies will soon 
announce a major arms sale to saudi arabia another major oil 
producing arab state on the persian gulf 
one subcommittee member rep larry smith dfla described the 
pending sale to saudi arabia as enormous running into the 
tens of billions of dollars 
burleigh said he was not able to disclose which countries are 
involved in the deal the nature of the weapons to be sold or their 
total value 
the reagan administration seeks to sell kuwait not only the 40 
f18s but their armaments as well other than the maverick the 
weapons include sidewinder sparrow and harpoon missiles and 
cluster bombs 
the missiles are among the most advanced airtoair and 
airtosurface weapons in the us inventory 
but burleigh said only limited quantities of the missiles are 
being provided far less than would be necessary for an offensive 
purpose 
under the terms of the agreement with kuwait the first of the 
aircraft would be delivered in 1991 and the remainder over the next 
three years 
responding to critical questioning burleigh said f18s in 
kuwait will not have the range required to strike at targets in 
israel and that kuwait will not be sold the tanker aircraft needed 
to increase that range

through thick and thin the biggest buyers of 
farmland are other farmers says an agriculture department report 
according to the departments economic research service farm 
owneroperators accounted for 56 percent of all reported purchases 
64 percent of all acreage sold and 54 percent of the total sales 
value 
the agency said its farmland market survey included real estate 
brokers and appraisers commercial bankers federal lending 
institutions farmers and ranchers 
participants in the 1988 survey reported details on nearly 7150 
sales involving nearly 23 million acres sold between sept 1 
1987 and feb 1 1988 results were included in a recent general 
report on farmland values 
the 1988 percentages are comparable with those in preceding 
years the report said owneroperators were particularly 
prevalent buyers in the mountain 70 percent northern plains 67 
percent and pacific 62 percent regions 
nonfarmers constituted 30 percent of all farmland buyers and 
were especially active in the southeast making up 51 percent of 
the regions purchasers appalachia 42 percent and the northeast 
39 percent 
the survey also showed that fewer farm sales are being financed 
a trend that has persisted in the 1980s in the most recent 
tabulation about 70 percent of the land sales were financed down 
from 73 percent in 1987 and from 91 percent in 1980 
the percentage financed in 1988 is comparable with mid1960s 
levels the report said cash sales are occurring more 
frequently particularly in the corn belt over 90 percent of the 
corn belt sales in the late 1970s and early 1980s involved 
financing compared with only 67 percent in 1988 
another survey item showed that in the case of financing the 
amount of debt as a percentage of the purchase price averaged 72 
percent in 1988 down from 77 percent a year earlier 
this represents the first significant drop in several years 
and brings the share financed in line with that in the mid1960s 
the report said percentages were lower in nearly all regions in 
198788 especially in the northeast southeast and pacific 
regions debt percentages remain highest in the delta states and 
southern plains averaging around 80 percent 
the general report agricultural resources was an expanded 
version of the agencys report on farmland values which was issued 
on april 14 it showed that us farmland prices as of feb 1 were 
up for the first time in six years averaging 564 per acre a 3 
percent increase from the 19year low of 548 per acre on feb 1 
1987 
despite the increase farmland prices nationally remained far 
below the peak of 823 per acre in 1982 before large debt reduced 
exports lower commodity prices and high interest rates triggered 
the slide 
the latest report said that a may 1 survey showed farmland 
prices were estimated to climb an additional 18 percent since feb 
1 however that was before the current drought set in across much 
of the country 
some analysts believe the recovery in farmland values will 
continue or at least hold steady despite the bad news from 
drought higher commodity prices and lower levels of surplus grain 
could help maintain land prices they say

the agriculture department says 
droughtstricken counties no longer will have to have washingtons 
approval before making emergency feed programs available to 
livestock producers 
milton hertz administrator of the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service or ascs said thursday that 
each county committee will have the authority to make the 
declaration based on a determination of substantial feed loss in 
the county 
previously the procedure required the agencys county 
committees to submit requests for emergency feed help to the state 
office for review if approved the state committee would then 
forward the request to ascs headquarters 
the aid involves the emergency feed program and the emergency 
feed assistance program 
under the emergency feed program the usda pays eligible 
livestock owners a portion of the cost of feed bought to replace 
that which is normally produced on the farm the emergency feed 
assistance program allows the sale of usdaowned grain at reduced 
prices 75 percent of the basic county price support loan rate 
gov terry branstad of iowa told reporters of the change in 
program approval earlier in the day after meeting at usda with 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng 
this is going to avoid a lot of confusion and a lot of 
questions in the country that are hurting the livestock 
producers he said and i think it is a very positive 
development 
as of july 7 the feed programs were approved by usda for 492 
counties in 22 states overall 1880 counties in 37 states are on 
the departments drought list 
the emergency feed programs will now be available in all the 
remaining designated counties at the discretion of county 
committees

taco took on a new meaning on 
election day in mexico when fraudulent voters folded a ballot in 
half like a tortilla filled it with other votes and stuffed it 
into ballot boxes 
as opposition parties in this northern industrial center 
denounced widespread fraud in presidential elections local 
newspapers reported thursday that the taco tactic of vote 
rigging was well planned and favored the ruling institutional 
revolutionary party 
the party known as the pri claimed victory in wednesdays 
presidential election with candidate carlos salinas de gortari 
about 50 ballots make a fine taco discovering tacos and 
revealing the taqueros people who stuff ballot boxes became 
an election day frenzy for the media and opposition political 
parties 
the daily newspapers el porvenir and el norte reported thursday 
that their reporters passed themselves off as laborers or labor 
union supporters to gain access to taco operations 
the papers named the mexican labor federation and the 
revolutionary federation of workers and peasants two of the 
largest unions in the country and important arms of the pri as 
prime taqueros 
el porvenir reporters who passed themselves off as workers 
from both unions formed part of the brigades of voters verifiying 
the introduction of socalled tacos el porvenir reported 
tacos tarnish elections read a headline in el norte 
a teachers union sponsored classes on how to use tacos el 
norte reported 
el nortes francisco betancourt reported that he convinced the 
revolutionary federation he wanted to help stuff ballot boxes 
he said he went to the unions headquarters on election day and 
was among those given packets of ballots already marked in favor 
of the pri 
betancourt said he was driven along with other taqueros to a 
precinct but fled before doing anything illegal he turned his 
taco in at el norte 
el porvenir said one of its reporters jose juan olvera was 
discovered trying to pass himself off as a revolutionary federation 
taquero and received a punch in the face 
but union spokesman isaias vazquez said in a telephone interview 
that the union at no time attacked any reporter and neither did 
it promote the violation of electoral laws yes we had tacos but 
they were of the corn and flour kind 
olga roman a secretary at mexican labor federation 
headquarters said union spokesmen were out of the office and 
unavailable for comment 
the newspapers and opposition parties alleged many other types 
of voter fraud including people voting more than once refusals to 
allow opposition poll watchers into polling places and ballot boxes 
already filled before voting began 
in chihuahua meanwhile the main opposition party national 
action complained of widespread irregularities including the 
elimination from voter rolls of thousands of its sympathizers 
the partys strength is in the northern states two large 
cities the city of chihuahua and ciudad juarez across the border 
from el paso texas 
in many of the precincts checked by journalists late wednesday 
as the votes were being tallied the difference in favor of 
national action was as little as 20 to 40 votes 
hundreds of sympathizers carrying their voting cards showed up 
at party headquarters to complain their names did not appear on the 
voter rolls there were no similar reports by pri sympathizers 
this is a dictatorship said leopoldo corral who complained 
he had waited for hours only to be told he could not vote 
electoral commission president miguel etzal maldonado blamed the 
elimination of names from the voter rolls on technical 
failures gov fernando baeza said they were natural human 
errors 
pri officials declined to release any election figures in the 
state and said the electoral commission would have official results 
on sunday

congressional demands to have the air force 
and navy seal us borders against illegal drug shipments have been 
turned aside by the pentagon and legislators who say the defense 
department already has enough to do 
i think we changed a lot of minds with our hearings said 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee as 
he detailed a pentagon budget bill approved thursday by 
congressional negotiators 
nunn was the prime mover behind a series of committee hearings 
last month at which pentagon officials said giving them increased 
antidrug responsibilities would hurt the militarys main mission 
of being ready to defend the nation against enemies 
the house had earlier voted to order president reagan to have 
the pentagon essentially seal us borders against drug traffickers 
within 45 days the senate approved arrest powers for navy officers 
aboard warships which stop drug boats on the high seas 
both proposals were dropped in the final version of the bill 
the final measure does order the pentagon to improve and expand 
its role in providing antidrug intelligence to civilian law 
enforcement agencies including more extensive tracking of ships 
and planes 
the 300 billion bill also sharply reduces reagans star wars 
antimissile plan although it has money for thousands of missiles 
planes tanks and other weapons 
the measure which authorizes pentagon spending for the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 must now be passed separately by the house 
and senate before going to the white house for reagans signature 
the bill authorizes pentagon spending of 2995 billion the 
total is a slight reduction from the 301 billion authorized in the 
current year and marks the fourth straight year of either freezing 
or reducing the defense budget following large increases during 
reagans first term 
the pentagon spending bill authorizes 40 billion for the 
strategic defense initiative as reagans 5yearold star wars plan 
is formally known reagan had sought 48 billion for the program 
up 900 million from the 39 billion this year 
the bill also sharply restricts spending for the spacebased 
interceptor the weapon planned as a first phase of an eventual sdi 
program the pentagon had sought 330 million for the program but 
the bill restricts the total to only 85 million

the last texas democrat to run 
simultaneously for the us senate and vice president won both 
races and later became the first texan in the white house 
but lyndon johnsons dual 1960 victories cost his party a senate 
seat they have yet to win back 
under the state law customwritten for johnson in 1959 sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas could pursue similar dual candidacies this 
year bentsen long a powerful votegetter and moneyraiser on the 
texas ballot is among the potential running mates under 
consideration by expected democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis 
bentsen is a heavy favorite to win reelection to the senate 
over republican challenger beau boulter a west texas congressman 
in november but if bentsen became vice president his senate seat 
would be declared open in january and texas gov bill clements a 
republican would appoint an interim replacement 
a fulltime replacement would be picked by the voters in a 
spring special election the same route republican john tower used 
in 1961 to replace johnson in a wild race that drew 70 candidates 
tower and bill blakley a democrat appointed as interim senator 
by thendemocratic gov john connally advanced to a runoff which 
tower won 
the democrats could never beat tower he retired in 1984 and 
republican phil gramm won the seat 
texas democrats eager to see bentsen on the national ticket say 
they do not fear a recurrence of the gops big win in 1961 
were confident that if the democratic ticket wins and sen 
bentsen is vice president there is going to be an attitude and mood 
in this state that would facilitate electing a democrat to replace 
sen bentsen said ed martin executive director of the texas 
democratic party 
it would be however a junior democratic senator whose clout 
would be far less than that now wielded by bentsen as senate 
finance committee chairman 
texas democratic chairman bob slagle said the possibility of 
losing the senate seat is always a matter of concern 
but that doesnt cause me to wish sen bentsen was not on the 
ticket with dukakis he said 
mark sanders spokesman for the republican party of texas said 
the gop could pick up bentsens seat in a special election but 
it would be a tough battle running for both jobs though legal in 
texas is not fair he said 
lloyd bentsen needs to decide what he wants to be sanders 
said i dont think its the right thing to do for someone to run 
for two offices especially important offices like this you cant 
play games like that with texas voters 
boulter bentsens senate race opponent said it would be 
greedy for bentsen to run for two jobs 
hes making it look like the senate is unimportant boulter 
said

for controversial statements on aids testing and drug addiction 
has resigned after nine days in office premier michel rocards

testing of pregnant women for aids he declined to say whether the 
tests should be mandatory 
health policy under former conservative minister of health

pregnant women in france are routinely tested for aids but only

appointments to a socialist cabinet that rocard has tried to 
broaden by including centrists and nonpoliticians

difficult on wednesday rocard was forced to reverse a policy

governing party candidate carlos salinas de 
gortari claimed a national victory thursday in mexicos 
presidential election his party dismissed opposition charges of 
massive fraud as a publicity move 
in his first public appearance since polls closed wednesday 
evening salinas de gortari addressed thousands of supporters 
packed into the institutional revolutionary party headquarters 
we have achieved national victory in the presidential 
election he told the crowd which responded by chanting we 
have won we have won 
we have achieved this victory in one of the most contested 
elections in our history and one of the most peaceful salinas de 
gortari added 
in an apparent concession that his party had lost some 
congressional races he said the legal victories of the 
opposition would be respected 
information allows us to see that the opposition groups show a 
majority force in several districts of the country salinas de 
gortari said it is the new political reality of the nation and 
with which we will have to coexist in a harmonious and respectful 
fashion 
early results showed salinas de gortari leading the four 
opposition candidates 
an official of the federal election commission which supervised 
wednesdays balloting said salinas de gortari received 96379 
votes or 418 percent of the 230516 counted 
cuauhtemoc cardenas of the leftist national democratic front and 
the mexican socialist party received 80680 votes or 349 percent 
and manuel j clouthier of the conservative national action party 
had 37742 or 164 percent 
gumersindo magana of the conservative mexican democratic party 
got 2235 votes or just under 1 percent and rosario ibarra de 
piedra of the radical revolutionary workers party with less than 
half a percent or 1067 ballots 
the results showed listed 11573 votes annulled 70 blank 
ballots and 770 writeins 
the turnout among the estimated 38 million registered voters has 
not been announced so it was not known what percentage of the vote 
the results repreented 
octavio campos an interior department spokesman said no 
further partial results were expected before sunday and interior 
secretary manuel bartlett who heads the election commission 
suspended counting until sunday 
bartlett told commission officials at a thursday evening session 
there had been a delay in tabulating votes but that the process 
would be speeded up he did not elaborate on the delay 
we have had difficulties in receiving information but we are 
now able to say that the delay will be replaced by a better flow of 
results bartlett said 
election commission officials earlier blamed a computer failure 
for the delay in announcing results later they said results from 
around the country were being received by telephone 
president miguel de la madrids sixyear term expires dec 1 
and under the constitution he cannot be reelected 
in addition to chosing a president voters also chose a new 
500member chamber of deputies and a 64member senate opposition 
parties were expected to gain in the congress which in the past 
few years has begun to shed its rubberstamp image 
before the first returns were announced at 130 am jorge de 
la vega dominguez president of the institutional revolutionary 
party or pri announced a crushing legal and incontestable 
victory for salinas de gortari 
since its founding 1929 the pri has won every presidential 
election and has controlled the national congress and the 
governorships of all 31 states 
but this year a clear deterioration of the pris influence was 
evidenced by the strong campaigns waged by cardenas and clouthier 
cardenas clouthier and mrs ibarra de piedra with federal 
officials wednesday night and issued a statement accusing the 
government of rigging the election 
the statement accused the government of stuffing ballot boxes 
eliminating citizens from voting rolls paying people to vote and 
multiple voting 
the anticipated announcement of a supposed victory of the 
official party under these conditions long before the counting 
process was completed reaffirms our suspicions that a fraud of 
great proportions is being conjured the statement said mrs 
ibarra de piedra read the statement as cardenas and clouthier stood 
by 
pri representatives called the complaint a publicity move by the 
three candidates and challenged them to present proof supporting 
their allegations 
in the northern states of chihuahua and nuevo leon the 
governments claims of a fair election were met with widespread 
skepticism 
the monterrey newspaper el norte said fraud was widespread in 
salinas de gortaris adopted hometown of agualeguas in northern 
nuevo leon state near the us border 
el norte which had reporters at each of agualeguas three 
precincts count the number of people who voted reported that 626 
people cast ballots but the tally compiled by pri pollwatchers 
totaled 1725 votes 
the newspaper said it had a picture of an 8yearold boy who 
voted with his fathers voting card pri officials denied the 
reports 
the democratic assembly for effective suffrage a citizens 
watchdog group reported 1100 cases of balloting irregularities 
including 500 in the mexican capital alone 
the campaign was not without bloodshed 
gunmen on saturday killed francisco xavier ovando a strategist 
in cardenas campaign and an aide to ovando 
police said tuesday that the murders were not related to the 
election but to ovandos tenure as michoacan attorney general 
during that time ovando fought organized crime 
cardenas called the slayings a provocation

a lebanese man charged with 
murdering a us navy diver during a 1985 hijacking had been put on 
probation in 1983 after a court ruled he was not likely to break 
the law again court evidence indicated 
mohammed ali hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is on trial on 
charges of murder and air piracy in the june 1985 hijacking of a 
twa jetliner on an athenstorome flight 
us navy diver robert stethem of waldorf md was shot to 
death after the hijackers forced the plane to land in beirut 
thirtynine americans were held hostage during the 17day ordeal 
during a brief hearing thursday the court heard a document from 
a court in the southern west german state of saarland which 
convicted hamadi of theft and assault 
hamadi was charged with stealing a cash box from a street vendor 
and with assault after he smashed it into the face of a man who 
tried to stop the robbery the document said 
the court gave hamadi a suspended ninemonth sentence in 1983 
after ruling that there was no evidence that the defendant is 
predisposed to further criminal behavior 
the court said it believed hamadi who was ordered to perform 
120 hours of community service work would learn from the 
experience and not break the law again hamadi lived in saarland 
from 1982 to 1984 
the document also is being used by the frankfurt court in an 
attempt to determine hamadis exact age 
the saarland state court document listed hamadis date of birth 
as june 13 1964 hamadi says he was born in 1966 
the ruling on age is important because it will determine the 
length of any sentence hamadi receives if convicted the range is 
from 15 years to life 
also thursday chief judge heiner mueckenberger read a statement 
obtained from hamadi after he was arrested at frankfurt airport on 
jan 13 1987 with liquid explosives in his possession 
according to the statement hamadi said he thought the bottles 
contained alcohol he said he was to carry the bottles from beirut 
to frankfurt and deliver them to an acquaintance named ahmed 
hamadi said he was returning to west germany to try to set up a 
car dealership 
his statement to police at the time also listed his birth date 
as june 13 1964 
asked by mueckenberger if he had anything to say hamadi looked 
at his lawyer and declined to comment 
the trial which began tuesday under heavy security in a 
specially constructed prison courtroom adjourned after about an 
hour thursday because a witness who knew hamadi during his previous 
stay in west germany was unable to attend thursdays session 
the witness a social worker originally had been scheduled to 
testify july 13 but was later asked by the court to appear thursday 
the trials first two sessions have been cut short raising 
prospects the proceedings could extend into next year officials 
already have scheduled court days into december and say more could 
be added 
tuesdays opening session was suspended after hamadi refused to 
participate 
the united states tried unsuccessfully to have hamadi extradited 
to stand trial in a us court 
the trial is to resume july 13 
a duesseldorf court sentenced hamadis older brother abbas ali 
hamadi to 13 years in prison in april for kidnapping two west 
germans in beirut in an attempt to gain his brothers freedom 
one hostage later was released but the second still is being 
held in beirut by a radical shiite group

republican george bush says he has to do a 
better job of telling americans what makes me tick inside while 
voters need to learn where democratic rival michael dukakis really 
stands on the issues 
the vice president complained thursday that one recent poll 
found that twothirds of the people believed dukakis was more 
conservative than bush theres something wrong with that bush 
said the issues are not in focus i honestly believe that 
the country doesnt yet fully appreciate where the governor stands 
on a lot of key issues 
bush certain to be the republican presidential nominee made 
his observations during a foray into dukakis home turf of boston 
where he spoke before a greekamerican audience whose political 
sympathies could be expected to rest with dukakis 
however the audience of several thousand people gave bush a 
surprisingly warm reception 
the vice president said it had been a smart idea to have him and 
dukakis speak on separate days too much charisma can be 
dangerous to your health bush joked 
today the vice president flies to atlanta for a pep talk to a 
republican unity dinner in the same city where dukakis will claim 
the democratic presidential nomination this month 
at a news conference thursday bush said he has not done a 
sufficient job telling the nation what kind of person he is 
he said ive not felt too comfortable talking about the 
private side of the bush family and all of that what it means to 
me the loss of a child whatever it might be 
i now have concluded that i have to make clear what makes me 
tick inside 
referring to a speech wednesday before a hispanic audience in 
which he talked at length about his life bush said i was trying 
to say look i understand this heres what motiviates me heres 
the inner side 
he jokingly said he wasnt trying to draw a contrast that 
weve got 12 grandchildren and hes dukakis working for one 
however bushs wife barbara quickly corrected him on the number 
of grandchildren and the vice president said make that 10 
talking about the campaign bush said he would be positive 
outlining his views while surrogates focus on dukakis record and 
what they feel are its shortcomings factually without venom 
without vendetta 
nevertheless bush said he had an enormous difference on 
taxes with dukakis the vice president said he opposed new taxes 
while dukakis recently oversaw an increase in cigarette taxes in 
massachusetts 
bush also suggested he would do a better job than dukakis in the 
area of foreign affairs 
the vice president said he would talk about who has the most 
experience who best is qualified to sit down with mr mikhail 
gorbachev the leader of the soviet union what administration 
has achieved the only arms control agreement in the nuclear age to 
eliminate an entire category of weapons when some were sitting up 
here saying freeze freeze lock in soviet superiority with a 
thousand warheads and zero for the united states 
bush flew to boston after a political strategy session with 
president reagan at the white house 
in a break with tradition bush likely will campaign for votes 
and try to divert attention from dukakis during the democratic 
national convention which runs july 1821 
sheila tate the vice presidents press secretary said 
schedulers were looking at events on monday and tuesday of 
convention week followed by appearances friday and saturday after 
the convention closes 
usually the presidential candidates allow each other to have 
all the limelight during their conventions and expect the same 
courtesy in return 
yet bush who has trailed in many polls until just recently 
said he probably would do some political travel during dukakis 
convention 
on the one hand bush said wed just get a little bit of 
ink by being on the road 
on the other hand he said you dont want to look like youre 
trying to frantically elbow your way into the news cycle

the pentagon says the record of a radio 
encounter between an iranian f14 and a us cruiser shows that 
iranian aircraft respond to warnings from us warships in the 
persian gulf unlike iran air flight 655 which was shot down last 
sunday 
the iranian a300 airbus did not reply to seven warnings 
broadcast by the warship which shot it down the uss vincennes and 
five from another american vessel in the area the uss john h 
sides said pentagon spokesman dan howard 
to demonstrate that ignoring such warnings was unusual howard 
released a previously classified conversation between an iranian 
f14 fighter and the leahy class guided missile cruiser uss halsey 
the conversation took place last saturday the day before the 
airbus was shot down with 290 civilians aboard 
halsey unidentified warship bearing 310 speed 400 knots 
altitude 2000 feet you are approaching an american warship 
operating in international waters bearing 129 26 nautical miles 
from you request you to establish communications and identify 
yourself and state your intentions 
iranian f14 roger an iranian we will place you about 5 
nautical miles 
halsey from us naval warship say again 
iranian f14 we want to place your warship at about 10 
nautical miles 
halsey roger out 
iranian f14 roger 
howard said the text was the sum total of the transcript the 
iranian aircraft went away 
he identified himself and established where he was now the 
events worked out there was no hostile intent these aircraft were 
tracked 
last thursday the commander of us forces in the persian gulf 
marine corps gen george b crist cited another instance in which 
an iranian f4 came a little close to a us ship and our 
ship challenged him he said im on my way to engage an iraqi

the army and air force have ordered 
commanding officers to tell soldiers or airmen who test positive 
for the aids virus that they face discharge or prosecution unless 
they inform all sex partners of their condition and use condoms 
the regulations and a similar navy policy spell out rules of 
behavior at issue in a number of cases in which military personnel 
who have tested positive for the aids virus have been charged with 
criminal offenses the charges have ranged from aggravated assault 
to having unsafe sex without warning partners of the test results 
in an aidsrelated courtmartial scheduled to start at arizonas 
fort huachuca this month defense lawyers have argued that the 
defendant was not ordered either to use condoms or to inform 
partners of his condition 
all members of the military must submit to aids blood screening 
tests which detect the presence of antibodies and indicate whether 
a person has been exposed to the virus 
the army regulation which became effective april 1 requires a 
commander to discuss a written counseling statement with any 
soldier who has tested positive and has received medical 
counseling said lt col greg rixon an army spokesman at the 
pentagon 
the form states that the commander is imposing the following 
restrictions you will verbally advise all prospective sexual 
partners of your diagnosed condition prior to engaging in any 
sexual intercourse you are also ordered to use condoms should you 
engage in sexual intercourse with a partner 
rixon said the form also states that failure to adhere to your 
previous medical counseling or the counseling i have just given you 
will subject you to administrative separation andor punishment 
under the uniform code of military justice as i see fit 
this is serious business rixon said recently those words 
take the form of a direct order 
col harry beans staff judge advocate at fort huachuca in 
sierra vista in southeastern arizona said we dont order them 
to refrain from sex i dont think we could do that but he 
said partners must be informed so that he or she can make an 
informed decision 
the upcoming courtmartial at fort huachuca initiated by the 
army in 1987 was the militarys first aidsrelated prosecution 
thenpfc adrian g morris jr is accused of failing to use condoms 
and to warn three soldiers with whom he had sex including one man 
that he had tested positive for the virus 
his lawyers have argued that there was no order for morris to do 
either in july 1986 when he was informed of the virus potential 
danger and counseled that he should inform partners and use a 
condom 
his courtmartial was delayed while a ruling on blood test 
admissibility was appealed 
in the meantime a soldier at fort hood texas pleaded guilty 
last december to aidsrelated charges including disobeying an 
officers order virtually identical to the new regulation 
several other military aidsrelated cases have been tried 
including that of a soldier at fort sill okla who pleaded guilty 
to aggravated assault and of an airman at wrightpatterson air 
force base ohio who was convicted on such a charge 
rixon said that as the element of assault kept coming up it 
became clear that we needed a very definitive guideline to assure 
there is a standardization of orders 
the air force regulation similar to the armys provides a form 
that must be signed by both the affected airman and his or her 
commander signing acknowledges that the person has been given the 
directive and understands it 
the air force order also requires those carrying the aids virus 
to inform medical personnel treating them 
navy spokesman lt kenneth ross in washington said the similar 
navy policy took effect in january 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring 
beans said the army policy tells aids carriers rather 
precisely what their responsibilities are but he thinks 
individuals are going to argue that they did take those steps and 
preventative measures 
that proved to be a successful defense in at least one case on 
may 11 navy petty officer 2nd class john e crawford was acquitted 
of charges including assault and having wrongfully and in wanton 
disregard for human life exposed his former girlfriend to the aids 
virus 
its gonna be an odd case that comes along where someone says 
he didnt warn his partner beans said

parliament has approved the death 
penalty for people convicted of drug offenses or trafficking in 
women the government announced today 
the action was taken late thursday by the 300seat parliament 
in which president hussain muhammad ershads ruling jatiya party 
has a fourfifths majority 
ershad was expected to sign the new laws quickly 
the legislation sets a minimum penalty of seven years in jail 
and a maximum penalty of death for drugrelated crimes earlier 
the maximum sentence was 10 years in jail 
there had been no law against trafficking in women which has 
been an increasing problem in bangladesh 
police and border guards say that more than 4000 women have 
been rescued from being taken illegally across the border into 
india this year 
the security forces say the women are lured with promises of 
jobs outside bangladesh but often end up sold into prostitution 
the new womens protection law sets a minimum penalty of seven 
years in jail for traffickers and a maximum of death 
prime minister moudud ahmed told the parliament that the new 
laws would act as a deterrent to crimes involving drugs and against 
women 
let us hope we are not required to apply the laws he said

a republican political consultant says george 
bush will lose in november if he doesnt get the support of more 
women and that even a woman running mate would not help 
substantially 
the problem of gender gap is so serious that overcoming it 
is probably the most important demographic key to a bush victory 
said doug bailey a respected gop consultant 
if he doesnt bridge the gender gap he will not win there 
are not enough white men available for george bush to win this 
election bailey said thursday at a news conference called by the 
national federation of business and professional womens clubs 
bailey predicted that bush the likely republican nominee will 
win however by making changes in his campaign strategy to make 
him more appealing to women voters 
he recommended that the vice president concentrate on making his 
own family more visible at campaign appearances and make a more 
forceful commitment to issues like longterm health care job 
security and education

convention on thursday also warned dukakis against overly 
accommodating the civil rights leader 
it was illadvised under 1984 democratic nominee walter

not welladvised hollings said

the cornstalks that should have been at pete 
kodats eyes barely reached the silver buckle on his handtooled 
brown leather belt the soybeans that should have been flourishing 
full green leaves hugged the dusty dry soil instead 
if you want to bring this home to the people in the cities 
said kodat 40 the third generation of a family whose roots in 
grundy county stretch back to the 1800s tell them to imagine 
what its like to be facing a full year of expenses with very 
little income 
exactly how little depends on how soon his prayers get answered 
during the worst drought to hit the nations midsection since the 
1930s dust bowl 
last year each of kodats 720 acres of corn yielded between 140 
and 160 bushels but last year 998 inches of rain fell between 
april and july 1 
this year only 396 inches have fallen over the same period of 
time and many perhaps most of those same acres could yield no 
corn at all 
kodat has higher hopes for his 540acre bean crop because the 
plants have lapsed into a dormant stage a kind of natural defense 
against the drought but continued dryness would ravage them as 
well cutting deeply into a yield he patiently raised to 40 
bushels per acre 
if we catch some of the rain theyre predicting for this 
weekend and temperatures moderate kodat said thursday i might 
still get out with 40 or 50 percent of my corn and 70 percent of my 
beans 
but if another two or three weeks pass without rain 
therell be no pollination and what youll be looking at are ears 
of corn with no kernels on them 
when kodat put the seeds into the ground april 17 he was aiming 
at the modest price of about 2 per bushel with an investment of 
about 250 per acre he figured to pocket between 30 and 60 
profit on each 
but like some cruel joke the same drought that has driven the 
commodity market to push the price of corn to 3 per bushel is 
threatening to destroy many of the farmers who grow it 
this is a mediumsized operation like a lot of the ones 
around here now maybe only 3 or 4 percent of the farmers are going 
to take a hit they cant outlast said kodat but maybe a lot 
more are just going to throw in the towel 
not far from the kodats brown brick fourbedroom home about 
75000 bushels of corn harvested from last years bumper crop sit 
in four aluminumsided silos and not far away from those graze 
some cattle the kodats raise for their own table 
his wife carla hasnt cut back on the groceries and doesnt 
plan to at least not right away 
things havent changed for us right now and i tell him every 
morning that worrying wont make any difference anyway she said 
everybodys in the same shape it just seems so senseless 
so the kodats pray instead every day 
i started farming when i was a freshman in high school with 80 
acres and a little help from my dad and ive been at it ever 
since said kodat adding that when times were lean in the early 
1970s he left the farm and took a job sweeping floors at the 
nearby commonwealth edison nuclear power plant 
debt he figures is an occupational hazard 
no matter what happens i wont be planting any less next 
year in fact i expect ill be planting more 
but the hardest part about this is getting up every morning 
and trying not to think about it he said because there is 
absolutely nothing you can do

it recovered after opening lower on the tail of a weaker

that affected the currencys rise said the dealer speaking on

others said the dollar came under pressure as investors reacted 
to a comment late thursday by japans trade minister hajime tamura 
tamura speaking to a group of foreign reporters in tokyo 
denied reports of a clandestine usjapan agreement to prop up the 
dollar for political reasons 
tokyo currency dealers have said that japanese and us monetary 
authorities are favoring a higher dollar for mainly political 
reasons 
according to currency analysts a stronger dollar would pave the 
way for more latitude in managing monetary policy reducing fears 
of inflation circumventing higher interest rates and ensuring the 
health of us financial markets 
such developments would likely increase the chances of a 
republican party victory in the november presidential polls they 
said

in 1974 vladimir nemukhin and bela levikova 
helped organize an outdoor art show that drew cool reviews from kgb 
agents who bulldozed the artwork 
on thursday the two soviet artists displayed their work at the 
countrys first international art auction an unlikely event that 
raked in 36 million from a flock of artloving foreigners 
about 2000 people crowded into a hall at the international 
trade center for the auction organized by sothebys of london in 
two hectic hours 120 works of art were put up for bids 
the event drew more than a little curiosity in a country where 
prices usually are regulated by bureacrats 
maybe money is a bad standard for merit but its a worldwide 
standard said nikolai filatov a ukranianborn artist who had 
two works sold 
art that deviated from the principles of socialist realism once 
met with the kremlins disdain kgb agents used dump trucks and 
bulldozers to literally crush the exhibition that nemukhin and 
levikova helped organize in a moscow park 14 years ago 
bids at the auction were taken from the 1000 people in the 
audience as well as by telephone and through written offers 
submitted in advance 
because payment in british pounds was required soviets in 
theory were excluded from taking part in the auction since it is 
illegal for them to hold foreign currency 
but they made their feelings known applauding when a 
contemporary work fetched more than 400000 and when paintings by 
ilya glazunov an artist with highlevel official support failed 
to sell for their minimum estimated value 
the total bids was 36 million which sotheby auctioneer simon 
de pury said exceeded our wildest expectations 
london art dealer david juda won a fierce bidding war with a 
567000 offer for alexander rodchenkos line a 1920 oil 
painting that depicts a white line zigzagging across a matte black 
canvas 
that was my very last bid juda said i dont think i paid 
too much but maybe i did 
in all 18 works by artists from before world war ii were 
auctioned off but the bulk of the works on sale was by 
contemporary artists 
one 1986 work fundamental lexicon by moscowborn grisha 
bruskin sold for 416000 which de pury said was a record for a 
modern soviet artist 
gowrie said rockstar elton john had bid 75000 for a bluehued 
landscape by modern soviet painter svetlana kopystianskaya and the 
same sum for a portrait by her husband igor kopystiansky 
juda a veteran of art auctions said he though western interest 
in soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev reforms had caused a new 
curiosity in russian art but that the price level at the auction 
had been extremely high 
the artists get 60 percent of the sale price the soviet 
ministry of culture receives 30 percent and sothebys gets 10 
percent

water wasters in grand rapids mich now can go to jail for 90 
days oak brook ill residents have had their water cut off for 
oversprinkling their lawns and a switchboard in columbus ohio is 
being bombarded with calls from people snitching on neighbors for 
using too much water 
water police are on patrol in growing numbers as communities hit 
by drought are resorting to desperate measures to conserve water 
record heat in many areas is increasing the demand for water just 
when supplies are running low 
on thursday angry residents of columbus flooded the citys 
water division switchboard with calls accusing their neighbors of 
violating the citys new ban on lawn sprinkling and filling 
swimming pools officials hope the crackdown will reduce 
consumption by about 50 million gallons a day down from the 
current average of 170 million 
a water division spokeswoman said repeat violators of the ban 
which took effect thursday faced fines up to 100 and shutoff of 
their water service 
the biggest response were seeing is people calling in 
violators said jackie england public information manager for 
the water division were getting inundated by calls we are 
taking addresses and we are going to follow up 
she said 50 addresses were reported just half an hour after the 
switchboard opened the first call at 801 was a woman who had 20 
addresses she said 
a columbus radio station said its traffic reporter saw three 
high schools sprinkling football fields and reported it to school 
officials the sprinkling quickly stopped 
in georgia its not the people but whole counties in trouble 
over water 
gwinnett and cobb counties both suburbs of atlanta were each 
fined 75000 this week by the state department of natural 
resources for exceeding their june water allotments and told they 
have to cut back 
the counties protested that the limits were unreasonable because 
their populations have grown to a combined total of around 
600000 since the limits were set state resources commissioner j 
leonard ledbetter offered to take the counties to court if they 
dont comply 
oak brook ill also has patrols on the lookout for people 
sprinkling lawns when they shouldnt 
tom lane acting superintendent of public works in the chicago 
suburb of oak brook said thursday that 30 violators of the 
communitys restrictions on lawn sprinkling have had their water 
shut off since limits were enacted by law june 18 
we have public works and water department men on the street 24 
hours a day along with police to catch violators said lane a 
second violation prompts a water shutoff and the price of getting 
water turned back on is 200 he said 
we have had several people call outraged about the 
restrictions lane said but weve got people calling on each 
other now they figure if theyve been cited and cut off why 
shouldnt someone else 
police capt howard e rupard has traveled a beat in lexington 
ky for 28 years watching for burglars vandals and rowdies now 
he faces a new kind of criminal the water ordinance violator 
ive had many many other experiences rupard said but

its been neighbor against neighbor in lexington since the city 
went on a water alert friday a judge can impose fines up to 250 
rupard and another officer recently found a fast food restaurant 
still under construction that had a dozen sprinklers firing away 
representatives of the store said they hadnt heard of the 
ordinance but wanted to comply one problem was that the sprinklers 
were automatically programmed it took me 20 minutes to figure 
out how to turn it off said store manager paul marcinek

mexicos governing party was toasting victory 
in the presidential elections even before the votes were counted 
but it also was bracing for an end to the exclusive power it has 
wielded for six decades 
it is the new political reality of the nation and with which 
we will have to coexist in a harmonious and respectful fashion 
governing party candidate carlos salinas de gortari said thursday 
the institutional revolutionary party or pri went into 
wednesdays election squeezed between popular opposition candidates 
on both its left and its right and persistent suspicions it would 
cheat to stay in power 
in the hours after the polls closed the pridominated federal 
election commission said its votecounting computer was broken 
opposition leaders said that meant the pri had not done as well as 
it had hoped 
we have achieved this victory in one of the most contested 
elections in our history and one of the most peaceful salinas de 
gortari told thousands of cheering supporters at party headquarters 
thursday 
but cuauhtemoc cardenas candidate of the leftist coaltion said 
it was too soon to call any of the races he and other opposition 
leaders accused the pri of voterigging and he warned the election 
commission not to tailor the results to pris victory claim 
more than 38 million people were registered to vote 
interior minister manuel bartlett head of the election 
commission said thursday that official results will be released on 
sunday in the long wait the parties were trying to assess their 
showings 
it was clear that at least some segments of the governing party 
were bracing for a bigger bow to democracy than they had bargained 
for with all the talk of clean elections and democratization 
information allows us to see that the opposition groups show a 
majority force in several districts of the country salinas said 
in an apparent concession that pri had lost some congressional 
seats 
he said the legal victories of the opposition would be 
respected 
salinas seemed to be preparing the party faithful for what could 
be a pivotal moment in pri history less than overwhelming victory 
at all levels 
no pri presidential candidate has ever won with less than 70 
percent of the vote and it has never given up a governors race it 
lost only one senate seat since 1929 and that was to a candidate 
whose coalition included pri 
sources inside the pri and in opposition camps were saying 
cardenas might even win the federal district a sprawling area 
including mexico city that is home to a quarter of the nations 80 
million people 
six decades of uninterrupted power has given pri the reputation 
of a party that stoops to voter manipulation election fraud and 
intimidation the opposition made honest elections the main 
campaign issue 
the slaying of a top strategist for the leftist opposition only 
days before the election and reports of fraud on election day did 
little to dampen the allegations 
the democratic assembly for effective suffrage a citizens 
watchdog group reported 1100 cases of balloting irregularities 
including 500 in the mexican capital alone 
opposition spokesmen said thursday that some complaints had been 
filed with local and federal election officials and documentation 
was still being gathered on many cases 
the erosion of pris influence in a time of economic crisis and 
growing demands for democratization was evident in the strong 
campaigns waged by cardenas and manuel j clouthier of the rightist 
national action party 
privately salinas inner circle was admitting its doomsday 
scenario included giving up one or two spots in the 64seat senate 
and taking the presidency with a smaller margin than any president 
in party history 
we are viewing it with serenity one aide said agreeing to 
meet with foreign reporters only on condition of anonymity 
although the president dominates the political system in mexico 
and pris majority in the 500seat chamber of deputies is not at 
risk anything more than a figurehead role for the opposition would 
be a dramatic change 
aides said that salinas constant campaign talk about holding a 
clean election laid the groundwork for such an eventuality 
cardenas clouthier and rosario ibarra de piedra of the small 
radical revolutionary workers party met with federal officials 
wednesday night and issued a statement accusing the government of 
rigging the election 
the statement accused the government of stuffing ballot boxes 
eliminating citizens from voting rolls paying people to vote and 
multiple voting 
the mexican political system is corrupt and lacks 
credibility clouthier told a news conference thursday 
pri representatives called the fraud allegations a publicity 
move and challenged the opposition to prove its allegations 
president miguel de la madrid whose sixyear term expires dec 
1 was quoted in the government newspaper el nacional thursday as 
saying the voting showed the world that mexico is capable of 
holding a clean election

officials in soweto said they 
plan electrical blackouts to counter a twoyear boycott of rent and 
service payments by residents of the countrys largest black 
township 
local officials switched off power for several hours wednesday 
evening to three sections of soweto the action forced postponement 
of a professional soccer game put out street lights and prompted 
some police and fire stations to operate on emergency generators 
on thursday officials said they planned more blackouts 
unless residents pay their bills we will continue with the 
blackouts said re du toit chief electrical officer for 
soweto the main township outside johannesburg 
the blackouts effect all residents in the targeted areas not 
just those participating in the boycott 
it is unfortunate that those who pay their rent water and 
electricity will suffer as much as those who do not du toit said 
the soweto city council has threatened to cut off electricity to 
the entire township in two months unless residents resume paying 
rent and service fees 
an estimated 80 percent of the townships 25 million residents 
are participating in the boycott that begain in 1986 the soweto 
city council is 40 million in debt and no longer can afford to 
purchase electricity du toit said 
the boycotts were launched to protest poor services 
dissatisfaction with township officials and a host of political 
grievances the black township officials were elected in polls that 
drew only 1020 percent of voters and they are widely viewed by 
blacks as collaborators with the whitedominated national 
government 
the level of black political violence has fallen from the 
turbulent period of 19846 but widespread civil disobedience 
remains in townships such as soweto 
in addition to the rent boycott most high school students in 
soweto are staying away from classes this week to protest the 
detention of student activists the boycott was called by the 
soweto students congress and coincided with a return to school 
after the midyear holidays 
local officials appear helpless to end the rent boycott despite 
repeated pleas there have been some evictions but most residents 
immediately move back into their homes 
du toit said that one section of the township had its 
electricity shut off in may but there has been no increase in 
payments 
some township residents say local activists have intimidated 
them into not paying rent adding that they fear retribution from 
members of the community more than they fear eviction or the loss 
of services 
most houses in soweto have electric lights although many 
township residents use coal for cooking and heating 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

madame chiang kaishek one of the most 
influential women in chinese history made a rare public appearance 
today to bid farewell to her aging nationalist party comrades who 
will soon retire 
the nearly 1200 delegates attending the morning session of the 
ruling partys 13th congress gave madame chiang an emotional 
standing ovation as she stepped onto the stage at the chung shan 
building in the hills of suburban taipei 
wearing a white traditional chinese gown covered by a black 
vest madame chiang walked slowly with a cane as a bodyguard and 
nurse accompanied her government publications say she was born in 
1901 but local newspapers report she is at least 90 
how are you comrades she said in a strong voice before 
asking party secretarygeneral lee huan to read her 15minute 
statement 
the strongwilled second wife of chiang kaishek wielded power 
that was considered second only to her husbands when he led the 
nationalist government on the chinese mainland and after losing a 
civil war to the communists in 1949 in exile on taiwan 
madame chiang left taiwan for a mansion on long island in new 
york soon after her husband died in 1975 but returned in 1986 to 
attend ceremonies marking his 100th birthday 
she since has lived in seclusion at her estate in the taipei 
suburb of shihlin leading to intense speculation she was trying to 
influence taiwans future from behind the scenes 
in her statement today madame chiang urged the nationalist 
party or kuomintang to use taiwan as a starting point to rescue 
our 1 billion compatriots on the mainland 
the nationalists still claim to be the rightful ruler of all 
china and madame chiang attacked taiwanese who seek to declare the 
island a separate nation 
invoking the names of her husband and of sun yatsen who 
founded the party 94 years ago madame chiang told the congress 
delegates not to forget the partys glorious history 
we are facing a critical moment as our senior members are 
retiring and are succeeded by the new blood she said adding 
that the old guards contribution to the party and the state 
should never be ignored 
many of the elderly members who theoretically represent 
districts on the mainland are retiring 
the senior party members led taiwan to economic prosperity 
during the past 40 years but generally have viewed with concern the 
democratic change introduced by her late stepson chiang chingkuo 
who eased authoritarian oneparty rule 
we should make innovations without forgetting the past and 
move ahead without forgetting our roots madame chiangs 
statement said the development of our party rests on the 
observance of discipline and the introduction of younger people 
with integrity 
madame chiang her black hair tied back waved a white 
handkerchief to acknowledge the applause of congress delegates 
newly elected party chairman lee tenghui approached her and they 
shook hands 
local media reported that madame chiang participated in an 
unsuccessful lastditch effort to block lees appointment as acting 
party secretary after chiang chingkuos death in january but she 
was quoted this week as saying lee a native taiwanese was the 
best man to be party leader 
political observers in taiwan generally view madame chiang who 
attended the congress as chairman of the partys central advisory 
committee as maintaining strong influence over the elderly 
nationalists loyal to her husband 
wellesleyeducated madame chiang was adviser confidante 
amabassador and english interpreter to her husband and was 
sometimes called the brains of china she once headed the 
chinese air force 
her eldest sister ailing married hh kung later a 
nationalist chinese premier and governor of chinas central bank 
sister chingling married sun who died in 1925 and eventually 
split ideologically with the rest of the family by remaining in 
china after the civil war and taking a post equivalent to vice 
president in the communist government

the parents of a 10yearold girl killed 
in a fiery church bus crash say they have offered to give up a 
settlement from ford motor co if the automaker agrees to recall 
and modify its older school buses 
if someone was ever injured or killed in a similar accident 
and we hadnt done everything we could to prevent it from happening 
again we couldnt live with ourselves said james nunnallee 
whose daughter patricia died may 14 with 26 others on the 
radcliff assembly of god church bus 
people might think were crazy but it doesnt bother us 
nunnallee an air force major and his wife karolyn said 
recently they would accept a 1 settlement if ford agreed to the 
recall and to revamp the gas tanks on thousands of its older buses 
when the churchs bus was struck by an allegedly drunken driver 
heading the wrong way on interstate 71 the gas tank was punctured 
and smoke from the ensuing fire that spread rapidly through the bus 
was blamed for all 27 deaths 
sixtyfour of the 67 families whose relatives were killed or 
injured in the accident have accepted the outofcourt settlements 
jointly offered by ford which manufactured the bus chassis and 
sheller globe corp which made the bus body 
ford representatives have agreed to meet with the nunnallees to 
discuss the recall proposal the couples lawyer said 
robert waite a spokesman for the company said thursday ford 
has been considering the possibility of a recall since the crash 
occurred there may be an action taken its under active 
consideration here he said 
the bus was one of the last made in the united states before a 
1977 federal rule took effect requiring manufacturers to start 
protecting their fuel tanks from the impact of crashes 
michael hance the nunnallees lawyer said his clients have 
asked ford to replace the tank on each old bus install a cage 
around the existing tank or remount each tank inside the chassis 
where it would be shielded by the frame 
but the company which has disclaimed responsibility for the 
accident is concerned that performing the repairs might give 
owners a false sense of security waite said 
we dont want people to think you can magically make a 
20yearold bus brand new he said 
lawyers familiar with the case have told the courierjournal 
that the settlements by ford include payments of 63000 apiece to 
families of children who suffered minor injuries and 700000 to 
the estates of each of the 24 children who died

the nations infants and mothers will not have 
the survival rates in 1990 that health officials hoped for a decade 
ago according to a new report from the centers for disease control 
of the 13 toppriority goals concerning pregnancy and infant 
health in the governments 1990 health objectives for the nation 
only three are likely to be met the cdc said thursday 
its certainly sobering and concerning said dr ann koontz 
a specialist with the health resources and services administration 
in rockville md this indicates that we have some significant 
problems relating to maternal and infant health 
the cdc using national center for health statistics data 
projects that the nations infant mortality rate infants dying 
before age 1 will be 91 per 1000 live births 
thats a drop from the 106 rate in 1985 but still short of the 
90 rate in the 1990 objectives which were published in 1979 
based on earlier data from 197081 health officials had 
projected a 1990 infant mortality rate of 78 but the decline in 
the infant mortality rate has slowed the cdc said 
the reasons ms koontz said are not known for certain its 
a very complex field wed all like to see improvements but 
theres not been a simple solution 
another objective was that no racial or ethnic group should have 
an infant mortality rate worse than 12 per 1000 among black 
americans the rate stood at 182 in 1985 and is projected to 
decline only to 159 by 1990 the cdc said 
the infant mortality rate among whites stood at 93 per 1000 in 
1985 and is projected to fall to 79 by 1990 the cdc said 
economics may play a part in the discrepancy between the 
mortality rates for blacks and whites we know that poor economic 
circumstances are distributed disproportionately among minority 
populations ms koontz said 
but the complete reason is not clear she said noting that 
previous studies have shown that among collegeeducated mothers 
black infants still have nearly twice the mortality rate of 
comparable white infants 
among the other goals not likely to be met 
no county racial or ethnic group should have a maternal death 
rate above five per 100000 live births the 1990 national rate is 
projected at 70 with black mothers at 205 
no more than 5 percent of babies should be born under 55 
pounds the 1990 projection 67 percent 
no more than 10 percent of pregnant women in any county racial 
or ethnic group should go without prenatal care in the first three 
months of pregnancy the 1990 national projection 236 percent 
385 percent for blacks 
one of the goals that is likely to be met concerns the nations 
neonatal mortality rate babies dying in the first 28 days of 
life that rate is projected to be 57 per 1000 in 1990 below the 
target of 65 
two other goals are considered likely to be met having most 
babies leave the hospital in car safety seats and putting into 
place programs to screen newborns for metabolic disorders 
a 1987 survey found safetyseat use at hospitals of 75 percent 
and all states now have such metabolic screening programs the cdc 
said

iran today urged everyone who can carry a 
gun to report for duty on the war front with iraq earlier a 
senior iranian official demanded that the united states pay 
compensation for shooting down a civilian jetliner and killing all 
290 people aboard 
the call to arms was issued by the newly formed general command 
at a time when arrogance is brandishing its teeth and claws at 
our nation at a time when the united states is carrying out 
aggressive actions in the persian gulf 
the general command sincerely demands that the nation should 
fill the fronts with fresh and trained forces the general 
command said calling on all persons who can carry a gun to 
report to military bases 
the statement the most sweeping mobilization call to be issued 
in recent months was carried by tehran radio and by the official 
islamic republic news agency 
in recent battles iraq has recaptured the majnoon islands the 
faw peninsula and other chunks of iranianoccupied iraqi territory 
east of basra 
the airbus jet was downed by us not iraqi forces but iranian 
leaders have constantly accused washington of backing baghdad in 
the nearly 8yearold war the phrasing of the mobilization call 
implied it was aimed at defending iran from both us and iraqi 
attack 
washington has said the jetliner was shot down when the crew of 
the uss vincennes mistook it for an f14 
on thursday deputy foreign minister hussein sheikholeslam 
reiterated iranian threats of a blow against the united states 
in retaliation for the jetliner attack 
they are responsible for all political and legal debts 
including compensation sheikholeslam said thursday in a speech 
on tehran radio monitored by the british broadcasting corp in a 
report made available today 
until there is a blow in response to the blow they have dealt 
us the issue is not closed the time place and form of the blow 
will be our decision in order to give us the advantage of 
surprise 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
thursday that humane and moral considerations will figure 
heavily in any decision on compensation 
i suspect that doing what we think is right will be the 
deciding factor he said 
sheikholeslam claimed that us military authorities gave 
permission to shoot down the jetliner in advance and that the 
united states had planned a show of force to provide 
justification for their presence in the region 
in the same radio broadcast iran air managing director mohammad 
reza majidi said less than 200 bodies had been recovered and only 
150 identified he said the planes black box data recorder had 
not been recovered 
of the 290 people on the jet 66 were children there were 38 
foreigners aboard 
earlier thursday pallbearers carried 76 flagdraped coffins 
through tehrans streets as thousands of mourners shouted their 
anger at the united states 
no compromise no surrender fight with america shouted 
waves of marchers who carried wreaths antiamerican posters and 
goldenframed photographs of the victims 
aside from the funeral procession foreign reporters who arrived 
in tehran the past two days have found little evidence of rage 
life in the capital halfempty during iraqi missile attacks 
earlier this year is once again busy and congested with traffic 
the sprawling bazaar and all shops are open 
everybody is saddened sure said an iranian merchant who 
expressed the views of several others interviewed at random but 
we have really become used to tragic blows and people are too busy 
to cope with their daytoday problems inflation shortages and so 
on 
but even prowestern iranians found it hard to understand how 
the vincennes carrying sophisticated electronic equiment could 
mistake an airliner for a hostile f14 
its a terrible blunder said another iranian a physician 
who was trained in the west americans seem to be too much under 
the influence of rambo films

navy experts were examining radio 
telemetry data today in an effort to learn why a trident 2 
submarine missile went off course and had to be destroyed 60 
seconds after it lifted off on a test flight 
the failure was only the second for the trident 2 in 13 test 
launchings from a land pad here the weapon able to carry 10 
nuclear warheads will be the most powerful in the navys arsenal 
when it becomes operational late next year 
the 237 million threestage missile vaulted skyward thursday 
evening and darted quickly into a heavy cloud layer 
the navy reported 20 minutes after liftoff that there had been a 
malfunction a statement later said the trident 2 had developed a 
problem during first stage flight and that the range safety officer 
sent a radio signal that ignited explosive packages in the missile 
debris from the shattered rocket fell harmlessly into the ocean 
several miles down the atlantic tracking range to the southeast of 
here 
the navy said the cause of the problem could not be determined 
immediately and that an investigation was underway 
the 44foot trident 2 was to have hurled a dummy warhead package 
to an ocean target several thousand miles to the southeast the 
weapon has a range of nearly 6000 miles but the intended range 
thursday night was not disclosed 
the test was the 13th of 20 landpad launches planned here to 
be followed by at least five submarine firings the missile is 
scheduled to become operational late in 1989 and will be deployed 
initially aboard the new submarine uss tennessee the first of nine 
trident subs planned by the navy 
each submarine will hold 24 trident 2s each of which will be 
able to deliver up to 10 nuclear warheads to different targets 
the trident 2 test launch program began here in january 1987 and 
logged nine straight successes before suffering its first failure 
last january two more successes followed prior to thursday nights

the united states will not process any soviet 
immigrants until oct 1 because a huge surge in refugees has 
exhausted government funds a us embassy spokeswoman said today 
armenians who were the hardest hit by the move criticized the 
decision 
embassy spokeswoman marguerite squire said the united states 
would continue to accept applications from soviets wishing to 
resettle in the united states but on monday embassy officials 
began postponing the last step in approval of the applications 
predeparture interviews 
she said the government has run out of funds for the refugees 
housing food clothing and transportation the cutback is to last 
until a new fiscal year begins oct 1 
the restrictions affect any soviet applying to the embassy for 
political asylum in the united states but they affect armenians 
most of all 
last month the embassy issued a record 2063 immigration visas 
94 percent of which were for armenians the figures do not include 
most soviet jews who generally leave the soviet union on israeli 
visas and get us visas in western europe 
we are ready to start a new life in a new country and what 
happens wouldbe immigrant mushegh sarafyan said today 
already they are deceiving us 
sarafyan was among about 50 armenian men women and children 
huddled on a street next to the embassy under overcast skies they 
said they had received permission from the soviet government to 
emigrate to join relatives in los angeles but that american 
diplomats told them of the delay this week 
they accused the us government of being insensitive and 
questioned whether budgetary contraints are the real reason for the 
new restrictions 
america is such a rich country why cant it afford to take in 
70 families sarafyan said he said american diplomats had told 
70 armenian families who applied for immigration within the past 
few months to show up this week at the embassy for the 
predeparture interviews but now the families have been left out 
in the cold 
we moved out of our apartments our homes we sold our clothes 
and quit our jobs and now we are left practically on the street 
he said 
sarafyan said the wouldbe emigres had expected to leave the 
soviet union this week after completing american paperwork and have 
no place to stay in moscow until october 
the us embassy should have given us at least a month this 
way they told us nothing who is responsible no one is helping 
us he said 
ms squire and other american diplomats refused comment on the 
armenians complaints and said any response would have to come from 
washington 
from last oct 1 to sept 30 of this year the embassy expects 
to grant 9500 soviets mostly armenians permission to resettle in 
the united states from oct 1 1986 to sept 30 1987 1800 
immigration requests were approved 
the sharp rise is a result of a recent easing of soviet 
emigration restrictions under kremlin chief mikhail s gorbachev

when mechanic brian pelletier began to 
check out a customers car to see what was wrong with the air 
conditioning he found a 3footlong boa constrictor behind the 
dashboard 
i was laying right there on the floor unscrewed the dash and 
all of a sudden i looked over and six inches from my head there was 
this snake said pelletier 45 an auto mechanic for 25 years 
i was going to retire in three years but i think this will move 
it up 
a crowd of nearly two dozen mechanics sales people and police 
officers surrounded the car wednesday but were reluctant to move 
on the reptile after two hours the snake finally was extracted by 
former peabody dog officer nancy kiley and william ramsey a game 
warden with the state environmental police 
ramsey said he was not sure whether the snake crawled into the 
car in massachusetts or if it accompanied the vehicle from detroit 
a lump in the snakes belly indicated it had recently eaten 
something 
they eat about once a month so it could have come from 
detroit said ramsey who said boas prefer cool places 
how it got in there no one knows but he was in there a 
while he said he was all tangled up in the wires and they 
usually dont get into corners like that 
ramsey took home the snake which he named lester and plans to 
turn it over to the state division of wildlife and fisheries for 
placement with a new owner 
all i want is the car back said frank luongo whose 
daughter jessie purchased it i hope there are no babies in 
there

iraq said its warplanes attacked three 
maritime targets in the persian gulf and shipping executives 
said today that two supertankers were set ablaze in the raid 
the gulfbased executives said the iranians had chartered the 
two vessels to shuttle oil from the key kharg island oil terminal 
at the head of the waterway to the export terminal in the strait of 
hormuz 
they identified the tankers as the 264108ton fellowship l and 
the cypriot 215780ton star ray the fellowship l flies the 
liberian flag but is owned by a greek company 
both tankers were attacked in the vicinity of kharg said the 
executives they spoke on condition they not be named no 
casualties were reported 
the executives also said they believed another greek vessel on 
charter to the iranians might also have been hit 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit which 
monitors maritime traffic around the world said the bridge and 
crew quarters of each vessel were set on fire in the attacks 
it said the fellowship l managed by ceres hellenic shipping 
ltd of piraeus was raided thursday night when it was 30 miles 
into its southbound trip after loading at kharg 
the tanker was hit once before in february 1985 
in a statement quoted by staterun baghdad radio an iraqi 
military spokesman reported the raids thursday 
the raids were carried out in continuation of our course to 
destroy the iranian regimes oil resources which it exploits for 
aggression said the spokesman in the radio broadcast 
he said two of the targets were large and one was very 
large 
iraq has used the term maritime target to refer to vessels 
mainly tankers sailing to and from iranian ports it has been 
attacking them since early 1984 as part of a blockade to throttle 
the oilbased iranian economy 
the aim of the blockade has been to force the government of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to accept a negotiated peace in the war 
between the two gulf oil powers the war began in september 1980 
iran has been retaliating on a shipforship basis in the 
tanker war in which the londonbased lloyds shipping 
intelligence unit estimates that 540 commercial vessels have been 
attacked 
lloyds said 88 of those attacks occurred in the first six 
months of this year alone 
the tanker war is fought in bursts usually sparked by the iraqi 
strikes the last two iraqi strikes were on july 1 when the 
supertankers fortune ship l a sistership of the latest victim and 
khark 4 which is iranian were struck and set ablaze 
because iraq has had no ports in operation since the outbreak of 
the war iran selects targets for its retaliatory strikes from 
among neutral commercial vessels especially those sailing to and 
from kuwait and saudi arabia 
us and other naval task forces that patrol the waterway have 
been providing military escort to their nationalflag vessels the 
us warships also expanded their protective mantle in early may to 
nonus flagged vessels if attacked in their vicinity

to meet with the chief negotiator for the alliance of motion 
picture and television producers the industrys bargaining group 
i am hopeful that we can continue to explore ways of resolving 
the impasse and that we can do so quickly walton said thursday 
the pressure is on both sides to get the industry working again 
waltons optimism reflected a change in the tense environment 
that has surrounded the strike since it began march 7 
union members voting in new york and los angeles wednesday night 
approved an interim contract with independent producers by an 81 
margin the interim contracts are a union effort to split the 
industrys ranks 
thirteen companies have already signed the new deal including 
carolco pictures makers of the rambo movies and actress 
shelly duvalls platypus productions inc union officials said 
walton said that he and j nicholas counter iii negotiator for 
the alliance of motion picture and television producers met 
through the night tuesday with talks concluding wednesday 
the alliance has said it is not in negotiations with the wga and 
that its last contract offer to the guild rejected by the wga by a 
31 margin june 22 is final but walton said he believed 
wednesdays vote would lead to talks that could end the 18week 
strike that has idled most hollywood production 
referring to the interim contract walton said it is now 
clear that the writers guild has a contract that can put the town 
back to work it is fair reasonable and works for both sides the 
obstacle to ending the strike therefore is not obviously the 
writers guild 
walton predicted the new interim agreement in conjunction with 
a previously approved independent contract would mean that between 
300 and 500 writers would resume work in coming weeks 
as of thursday 124 production companies mostly small 
operations had broken ranks 
the two sides in the strike remain divided on payments for 
television reruns and foreign television syndication

episcopal church leaders have approved a 
resolution calling abortion a tragic dimension that should only 
be used in unusual cases such as incest rape or if the pregnancy 
endangers the mothers life 
the churchs house of bishops passed the resolution by voice 
vote thursday and continued discussions on homosexuality the role 
of female bishops and an economic package to help the poor 
the mood of our culture swings toward accepting abortion 
said the rt rev craig b anderson bishop of the diocese of south 
dakota the church is saying hey wait a minute lets 
acknowledge that life is sacred 
we acknowledge in this country that it is the legal right of 
every woman to have a medically safe abortion the resolution 
said this church emphatically opposes abortion as a means of 
birth control family planning sex selection or for any reason of 
mere convenience 
this is an attempt by the church to reach out with compassion 
on both sides and not to close off dialogue said the rt rev 
donald j davis bishop of northwestern pennsylvania 
the statement now must be considered by the house of deputies 
church leaders meeting in detroit through monday hold a 
general convention every three years 
during debate thursday members decided further study of the 
homosexuality issue would be necessary 
i believe we have given signals all over this church that we 
are very divided said south carolina bishop fitzsimons allison 
the church also upheld a controversial resolution that would 
permit a congregation in a diocese with a female bishop to call in 
a visiting male bishop to officiate at sacraments 
opponents attacked the vote in the house of delegates as 
discriminatory to women and a questioning of their right to 
ordination 
also thursday mayor coleman young urged church leaders to pass 
an economic package that would assist poor people in beleaguered 
cities such as detroit they plan to vote on the economic package 
later this week 
young told leaders that detroit has the countrys highest 
unemployment rate 20 percent prompting mass migration from the 
city 
no city in the country has experienced the wholesale 
abandonment that detroit has we have the same borders as we did in 
1950 but half the population the mayor said 
the economic package dubbed the michigan proposal has been 
passed by the house of deputies of the bicameral convention and now 
goes before the house of bishops 
the proposal written by h coleman mcgehee bishop of the 
diocese of michigan calls for 250000 to be allotted by the 
national episcopal church in a bid to raise 4 million for six 
years through foundation grants and other denominations to aid 
areas in economic crisis nationwide 
if passed the resolution would establish cooperative housing 
and employee owned businesses and develop community credit unions 
as well as offering aid to the poor

a meeting on budget cuts turned into an airing of 
political differences among contra leaders as the nicaraguan rebel 
movement drastically trimmed its scope due to the us aid cutoff 
by congress 
a contra leader speaking at a news conference thursday to 
discuss nonmilitary budget cuts accused dissidents within the 
movement of giving ammunition to the sandinistas 
resistance directors alfredo cesar and aristides sanchez 
reportedly support contra military commander col enrique bermudez 
whom dissidents accuse of corruption and close links to ousted 
nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza debayle 
there is no doubt that the divisions the lack of unity in the 
movement is giving ammunition to the sandinistas said sanchez 
who complained that the declarations of dissident commanders were 
showing up in the nicaraguan press 
dissidence is a sacred right in all organizations that believe 
in democracy cesar said but not when it begins to damage the 
nicaraguan resistance struggle against the sandinistas 
on the budget cuts cesar and sanchez said nonmilitary spending 
has been slashed by 42 percent and 130 of 320 employees worldwide 
have been laid off the longanticipated cuts in political and 
administrative staff will close some offices in europe and latin 
america 
cesar denied this months round of layoffs were politically 
motivated but conceded politics was one of the priorities in 
deciding whom to let go 
the cuts will save about 250000 on the monthly budget of close 
to 700000 said cesar emphasizing the cuts have nothing to do 
with operations in the field 
at least some of those laid off had aided the dissidents 
including the contras miami spokeswoman marta sacasa cesar said 
ms sacasa would be given a new position as head of public 
relations for the directors 
but asked later if she would assume that position ms sacasa 
laughed and said i doubt it she said she expected to be gone 
within a few weeks 
cesar and sanchez strongly denied a new york times report that 
each contra leader receives 75000 a year in us funds and a 
monthly expense account 
the directors of the nicaraguan resistance do not receive any 
salary from the united states government said sanchez 
contra leaders also repeated their refusal to resume peace 
negotiations with the sandinistas until they agree to put president 
daniel ortega at the head of their delegation move the talks out 
of nicaragua and get better guarantees from central american 
presidents that ortega will fulfill any agreement

cambodian resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk and indonesias foreign minister said today that 
peace talks on cambodia would go on despite vietnams hints it 
wont participate 
i am ready to go to jakarta on the 25th of july with my 
partners of the coalition sihanouk said after meeting with 
secretary of state george shultz we will be there 
a state department spokesman said shultz gave sihanouk a letter 
from president reagan repeating us positions that sihanouk has a 
central role in a cambodian settlement and that the khmer rouge 
should be shunned it said the united states will continue to 
pressure vietnam to withdraw its troops from cambodia 
reagans letter invited sihanouk to visit washington this year 
indonesias foreign minister ali alatas who is organizing the 
talks said they were still on 
there is no intention to recast the terms of the meeting he 
told reporters when asked about vietnams charges that indonesia 
and its allies were trying to turn the informal talks into 
negotiations between vietnam and the cambodian resistance 
sihanouk and alatas were in bangkok for an annual meeting of 
foreign ministers of the association of southeast asian nations or 
asean and counterparts from japan and several western nations 
shultz is attending the meeting as part of ninecountry tour of 
asia 
vietnams foreign ministry issued a statement thursday saying 
the asean ministers joint communique issued this week prolonged 
the 9yearold deadlock on the conflict and undermined the 
indonesia talks the communique voiced strong support for the 
cambodian resistance 
the statement said such a hostile communique released by the 
asean countries heralds their negative stance at the talks with 
such a stance the talks will not bring about expected results 
it said 
the statement was carried by the official vietnam news agency 
monitored today in bangkok 
sihanouk heads a coalition of resistance groups fighting the 
vietnamesebacked government in phnom penh the coalition includes 
the khmer rouge which killed hundreds of thousands of people 
during its 197578 rule 
vietnam ousted the regime and set up a new government in 1979 
it has promised to withdraw 50000 soldiers from cambodia this year 
and the other 50000 by 1990 
sihanouk said the khmer rouge wants to retake power in cambodia 
he said it was not possible to disarm the group because china its 
main source of weapons was not in favor of that 
he favors forming a national army comprising the three guerrilla 
groups and the government 
if the khmer rouge were a member of the quadripartite 
organization then i think they would not be able to exploit the 
situation he said 
on thursday shultz said the united states is unalterably 
opposed to the khmer rouge reclaiming power 
asean members include thailand malaysia indonesia the 
philippines singapore and brunei 
the vietnamese statement said the foreign ministers deliberately 
repeated a stance that has caused confrontation between southeast 
asian countries and resulted in the deadlock to the cambodia 
issue over the past nine years 
it said the group was trying to protect the khmer rouge and 
ignored the fact that the prohanoi government has control over the 
country

the indepedent counsel investigating edwin 
meese iii concluded he could have prosecuted the attorney general 
on two felony charges but decided not to national public radio 
said today 
the network citing unnamed sources said the office of the 
independent counsel james mckay had informed meeses lawyers that 
mckay felt he could technically file charges in connection with 
the attorney generals ownership of 14000 in telephone company 
stock 
mckay is known to have investigated a possible conflict of 
interest in connection with meeses ownership of the stock in 
regional baby bell companies at the same time he was meeting 
with the heads of regional telephone companies to discuss legal 
restrictions on the companies 
npr said it could not learn why mckay declined to press charges 
nor the network reported could it be learned how mckay 
characterized the matter in the report he filed this week with a 
federal court on his 14month investigation of meese 
both mckays office and james rocap meeses lawyer refused to 
discuss the matter npr said 
mckays office filed an 830page report earlier this week on his 
criminal investigation of meese the report is under a court 
secrecy order but meese said he had been vindicated by the fact 
that mckay concluded his investigation without seeking indictment 
meese who announced tuesday that he was resigning effective in 
late july or early august says he isnt leaving the justice 
department in a state of disarray even though top posts are filled 
with replacements who have only been on the job a month or two 
we have one of the finest management teams of any department 
in the government meese said thursday in an interview he said 
the new nominees certainly bring all kinds of experience and 
that there will be no leadership gap with his own departure 
scheduled for late july or early august 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater meanwhile said the 
white house is moving as rapidly as possible to find a meese 
successor but its not the end of the world if the search goes 
beyond the convention recess for congress he said the democrats 
meet in atlanta july 18 
one of the new arrivals at the justice department is deputy 
attorney general harold christensen who was a civil lawyer in utah 
before arriving in washington last month he still faces senate 
confirmation hearings late this month 
associate attorney general francis keating and criminal division 
head edward dennis also face confirmation hearings then 
dennis who took his new post in june is a former us 
attorney while keating who came aboard in may has been an 
assistant treasury department secretary 
christensen and dennis are replacing former deputy attorney 
general arnold burns and assistant attorney general william weld 
who resigned in protest march 29 over meeses continued tenure at 
the justice department keating is replacing stephen trott who is 
now a federal appeals court judge 
we have people in all the positions we have an ongoing 
program we have success said meese theres no disarray and 
there will be no leadership gap 
a goingaway party was held thursday for another key department 
official assistant attorney general charles cooper head of the 
office of legal counsel 
meese has recommended that president reagan nominate douglas 
kmiec a deputy in olc to replace cooper 
in the interview meese also said that 
he intends to seek payment of his legal fees from the public 
for the justcompleted 14month criminal investigation by mckay on 
his 1987 financial disclosure form issued this week meese 
estimated those fees for the first 7 months of the investigation 
at 100000 to 250000 
members of congress ought to stick to legislation and not try 
to run the departments i think that would improve the 
relationship considerably between congress and the executive 
branch 
he would have handled his role in connection with 
scandalplagued wedtech corp differently if he had known at the 
time that this was a gang of crooks 
his reference to crooks apparently was directed at four 
former wedtech executives who pleaded guilty to criminal charges 
and are cooperating in the governments prosecution of rep mario 
biaggi dny and other politicians and businessmen in the 
wedtech scandal 
as attorney general he has lived up to the promise he made 3 
years ago to the senate judiciary committee that he would avoid the 
appearance of a conflict of interest or even a situation in which 
someone might unfairly interpret something as a conflict of 
interest

norwegian authorities issued a pollution 
alert because of oil floating from the burnedout piper alpha rig 
in the north sea an official said today 
but the oil slicks from the striken piper alpha rig in the 
british sector of the north sea were breaking up and were not 
expected to reach the coast of western norway said erik nygaard of 
the state antipollution agency 
a norwegian plane was being sent to observe and assess the 
dangers he said 
the information weve got indicates that the slicks are being 
broken down by the water and that the addition of new oil is small 
if this is correct its unlikely that the oil slick will drift 
towards the norwegian coast nygaard said on the national nrk 
radio 
a british surveillance plane reported one oil slick six miles 
long and 12 miles wide near the oil rig but it was considerably 
smaller than on thursday another smaller slick was observed 18 
miles away from the rig the agency said 
it said the main slick would have to be 20 times larger to be a 
threat to norway 
an explosion wednesday night broke the rig apart and 166 people 
were believed killed

khmer rouge return to power totally unacceptable 
in remarks to reporters after the meeting sihanouk said the

chinesesupported guerrillas would be difficult 
shultz and sihanouk met as part of a threeday dialogue 
between the sixmember association of southeast asian nations and 
six close partners the united states canada new zealand

asean ministers he praised the united states for playing an 
indispensable role in maintaining stability in the region

leaders of the dutch reformed 
church the church of most government officials have questioned 
the ethical grounds for keeping south african troops in angola 
these are the questions in the hearts of our people said 
the churchs moderator johan heyns 
while the government may have its reasons for maintaining a 
military presence in angola parents of national servicemen are 
entitled to ask whether this is necessary 
he was commenting thursday on an editorial in the churchs 
newsletter this week in which editor fritz gaum asked if the 
government would not be acting ethically if it withdrew its troops 
from angola 
gaum said south africa could become more deeply involved in a 
struggle on foreign soil with a corresponding increase in loss of 
life 
defense minister magnus malan responded by saying the editorial 
appeared to ignore south africas national security interests 
the military acknowledged for the first time in november that 
its forces were maintaining a longterm presence in angola and were 
fighting cuban soldiers and forces of the marxist government south 
africa supports the national union for the total independence of 
angola guerrillas 
the white branch of the dutch reformed church seldom criticizes 
government policy last year it reversed decades of church policy 
declaring the policy of apartheid a sin and not supported by the 
bible but the church has not criticized specific apartheid laws 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

diplomatic relations between the united states and the cambodian 
government the united states has not recognized the government 
that vietnam installed after a 1978 invasion 
negotiations were handled by the phnom penh office of the 
swissbased international committee of the red cross 
it had appeared the cambodians were using the bono affair to 
extract some form of us recognition but they recently announced 
bono was free to go no reason for the release was given 
we are pleased to report that mr bono has already arrived 
safely in bangkok petzing said we hope we can now move ahead 
as well with the repatriation of the remains of american servicemen 
lost in cambodia during the indochina war

state for east asia and pacific affairs told a congressional task 
force there was no progress on the remains in cambodia

a delaware childrens hospital must 
rescind its controversial policy of not treating patients with the 
aids virus or face legal action the states attorney general said 
charles m oberly iii said thursday the policy violates 
delawares public accommodations law 
weve said emphatically that unless they rescind the policy 
immediately we will take whatever action that is necessary whether 
it be through the courts or through the state human relations 
commission he said 
the attorney generals order was contained in a letter sent 
wednesday to officials of the alfred i du pont institute a 150 
million 90bed pediatric hospital in rockland just north of 
wilmington 
so far hospital administrators have not responded to oberlys 
letter 
the attorney generals order was the latest development in a 
growing controversy sparked two weeks ago by the announcement of a 
policy that all prospective patients would be tested for exposure 
to the human immunodeficiency virus and those who tested positive 
would be sent elsewhere 
amid a storm of criticism hospital officials later said they 
might agree to care for children in extreme cases but the policy 
did not define an extreme case 
earlier this week about a dozen doctors from the childrens 
hospital of philadephi in response to a plea from top delaware 
health officials angered by the policy 
its our belief that a hospital to some extent is subject to 
the public accommodations sections of the state law oberly said 
they just arent free to discriminate against who can come in and 
who can go out of their institution 
i disdain the idea that aids patients are becoming the lepers 
of the 20th century oberly said i think we have to be a 
little more compassionate

condemned killer ted bundys lawyers vowed to 
fight to the supreme court if necessary to contest a federal 
appeals court ruling upholding his death sentence for the murder of 
a 12yearold florida girl 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals which stayed bundys 
execution just seven hours before it was to be carried out in 
november agreed with a lower court that none of bundys claims had 
merit 
bundy has also been convicted of killing two women in florida 
and is a suspect in at least 10 other slayings 
one of bundys attorneys polly nelson said lawyers will either 
ask for a rehearing before all 12 judges of the 11th circuit or 
appeal thursdays decision by a threejudge panel to the us 
supreme court 
the state is very pleased that the federal appeals court has 
found no merit in this defendants claims we are hopeful that the 
process of seeing that justice is served can now continue said 
florida attorney general bob butterworth 
bundy is also under death sentence for killing two sorority 
sisters in tallahassee fla three weeks before 12yearold 
kimberly diane leach of lake city fla was abducted the 11th 
circuit has stayed that death sentence ordering a lower court to 
review the appeal which ms nelson said involves issues similar to 
the leach case 
bundy had challenged his conviction in the leach case by 
claiming he was incompetent to stand trial had been denied his 
choice of attorneys and had ineffective assistance of counsel 
thursdays 60page decision said bundy had presented a cogent 
wellreasoned argument to the trial judge and he had a 
rational understanding of the proceedings 
consequently a hard look at the record evidence supports 
the conclusion that bundy was competent to stand trial circuit 
judge frank johnson wrote 
bundy was an escapee from a colorado jail where he was being 
held on murder charges when the florida murders were committed he 
is also a suspect in seven to nine slayings dating back to 1974 in 
seattle three disappearances and two slayings in utah and one 
murder and three disappearances in colorado

crew members of the spy ship uss pueblo suffer 
from lingering emotional as well as physical wounds from their 
capture by the north koreans 20 years ago says the organizer of a 
crew reunion 
at least 50 of the 83 men aboard the illfated vessel plan to 
attend the fourday reunion beginning today said bob chicca of 
bonita calif the gettogethers organizer who was a marine staff 
sergeant aboard the ship 
the jan 23 1968 capture of the pueblo in waters off north 
korea proved an embarrassing episode for president lyndon johnson 
one crew member was killed during a brief skirmish in which the 
pueblo was struck by gunfire but didnt fire a single shot the 
ship was armed with only an ondeck cannon two 50caliber machine 
guns and assorted handheld weapons 
north korea seized the vessel and hundreds of documents 
detailing how the united states conducted seagoing espionage the 
crew was imprisoned for 11 months 
some men are dogged by physical problems caused by malnutrition 
and beatings and others suffer from psychological problems some 
serious said chicca who was wounded in the seizure 
talking about it is like therapy for me said chicca 44 
one of two marine corps intelligence analysts aboard the pueblo 
you realize youre not alone and others have the same problems 
you have 
during the reunion the men will be the guests of honor at 
graduation ceremonies at the naval training center and will visit 
the centers prisoner of war museum 
the ships commander lloyd m bucher who lives in nearby 
poway will attend the gettogether 
debate continues over whether bucher should have surrendered the 
ship without a fight while some hold the government culpable for 
leaving the lightly armed spy ship unprotected 
after 11 months of captivity the prisoners were finally freed 
on dec 23 1969 after the united states issued a statement 
apologizing for grave acts committed by the ship against north 
korea however a statement disavowing the confession was read both 
before and after the statement 
bucher said disappointment rather than bitterness describes 
his feelings about the incident 
disappointment that no naval forces came to my aid even though 
i was promised protection before starting the mission in japan 
he said 
chicca said there was a public outcry when a navy court of 
inquiry recommended bucher be courtmartialed no action was taken 
the navy is still polarized chicca said either they want 
to praise cmdr bucher or they want to kill him

the odds of a catastrophic earthquake 
that could kill thousands of people in southern california are 
higher than once believed and the san francisco bay area faces a 
similar threat a federal report says 
recent concern about the socalled big one on the san 
andreas fault has centered on the greater los angelessan 
bernardino area because so much strain on the faults north end was 
released by san franciscos great quake of 1906 which measured an 
estimated 83 on the richter scale 
but a report issued thursday by the us geological survey and a 
working group of its national earthquake prediction evaluation 
council said the san francisco bay area is nearly as likely to 
suffer a major quake 
unless we aggressively pursue earthquake reduction measures 
there is the potential for many people to die perhaps more people 
than ever died in a single day from any natural disaster in the 
united states said richard andrews deputy director of 
californias office of emergency services 
a 1983 state emergency plan said a great quake near metropolitan 
los angeles would be americas worst disaster since the civil war 
two separate studies one being published today in the journal 
science say that quakes along the san andreas in the mojave region 
near los angeles tend historically to occur in bursts of two or 
three within a relatively short time followed by 200 to 300year 
periods without large temblors 
by demonstrating such clustering both studies suggest the 
mojave segment may be in a quiet period with another major quake 
unlikely for 70 years or more 
the new geological survey report however said there is a 50 
percent chance in 30 years and a 20 percent chance within the next 
decade that a major quake measuring 70 on the richter scale will 
rupture the northern san andreas or hayward faults which border 
the west and east sides of san francisco bay 
in southern california the report said there is a 60 percent 
probability within 30 years and a 20 percent chance within 10 years 
that a great quake measuring 80 or a major quake registering 75 
will rupture two or three segments of the san andreas fault 
many scientists said previously that southern california faces a 
50 percent chance of a great quake in 30 to 50 years 
the odds of a 75magnitude quake in southern california rise to 
70 percent within 30 years if only one of the three segments 
breaks but scientists dont expect that kind of fault behavior 
the federal report said 
chances are less than 10 percent in 30 years for an exact repeat 
of san franciscos 83magnitude 1906 disaster which recent 
studies show killed at least 3000 people 
a 1980 federal emergency management agency report said a repeat 
of the 1906 quake could kill 3000 to 11000 people hospitalize 
12000 to 44000 and cause 38 billion in damage it said a 74 
jolt on the hayward fault could kill 3000 to 7000 people 
hospitalize 13000 to 27000 and cause 44 billion in damage 
the disaster agency also said an 83magnitude quake in southern 
california could kill 3000 to 14000 people hospitalize 12000 to 
55000 and cause 17 billion in damage 
the geological survey report also listed chances of 50 percent 
in 30 years for quakes measuring 65 on the imperial fault and 65 
to 70 on the san jacinto fault which runs near the burgeoning san 
bernardinoriverside area 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number say from 55 to 65 
magnitude means that the ground motion is 10 times greater 
a magnitude of 8 is considered a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage

irans acting commander in chief hashemi 
rafsanjani said today his nation will not seek revenge against the 
united states for shooting down an iranian jetliner and killing all 
290 people aboard 
irans air force chief said us systems must have been able to 
monitor 21 minutes of conversation in english between the iran air 
jetliner and the airport control tower brig gen mansour satari 
said the missile attack showed that the us military was unable 
to control its sophisticated systems 
the cruiser uss vincennes shot down the jetliner on sunday 
american officials said the europeanbuilt airbus was mistaken for 
an attacking iranian f14 fighter 
satari told foreign reporters thursday that the destruction of 
the plane was an intentional and unprovoked attack 
but he later qualified this by saying the us military 
accepted on purpose the risk of shooting down civilian planes 
because they were unable to control their sophisticated systems 
satari said iran had all the tapes needed to prove that 
normal conversation was going on from the time the engines were 
started up on the ground until the plane was shot down 
he also said the plane was traveling in the center of the 
international air corridor between bandar abbas and dubai and 
could have deviated 10 miles either side and still have been within 
the corridor 
in a prayer congregation rafsanjani said the united states is 
trying to push us to commit the same crime but if we did that 
the world would turn against us 
that is why we do not push to take revenge wise people 
understand why we do not take revenge 
he spoke after the newly formed general command issued a 
statement calling on all persons who can carry a gun to report 
for duty on the war front 
the remarks by rafsanjani who is also parliament speaker 
signaled that tehran may have decided on restraint in the wake of 
the incident western diplomatic sources said they spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the crowd chanted death to america and war war until 
victory the audience included young basij or volunteers in 
red headbands and a few wounded war veterans 
in the united arab emirates a newspaper reported today that 
iran air will take a circuitous route from the southern iran city 
of bandar abbas to dubai until the direct one becomes safe for 
civilian air traffic 
the new route is aimed at avoiding the corridor used by the 
airbus on sunday said the report published in the dubaibased 
englishlanguage newspaper khaleej times 
the paper quoted unidentified iranian sources in bandar abbas as 
saying the new route takes the aircraft to shiraz about 300 miles 
to the east it then doubles back to dubai adding 32 minutes to 
the previously 28minute flight 
iran air officials in abu dhabi and in the neighboring port of 
dubai refused comment on the report 
the general command in a statement carried by tehran radio and 
the official islamic republic news agency said it sincerely 
demands that the nation should fill the fronts with fresh and 
trained forces 
it was not the first general mobilization call but it was the 
most sweeping to be issued in recent months and it followed several 
major battlefield defeats for iran 
although the airbus jet was downed by us not iraqi forces 
iranian leaders have constantly accused washington of backing 
baghdad in the nearly 8yearold war the phrasing of the 
mobilization call implied it was aimed at defending iran against 
both us and iraqi attack 
on thursday deputy foreign minister hussein sheikholeslam 
reiterated iranian threats of a blow in response to the downing 
of the passenger plane tehran radio reported 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
thursday that humane and moral considerations will figure 
heavily in any decision on compensation 
sheikholeslam was quoted as saying that iran had contacted the 
international civil aviation administration and requested that an 
expert delegation be sent to study the incident 
in the same radio broadcast iran air managing director mohammad 
reza majidi said less than 200 bodies had been recovered and only 
150 identified 
he said the planes black box data recorder had not been 
recovered nor had any portions of the plane that were big enough 
for studies to really be carried out 
of the 290 people on the jet 66 were children there were 38 
foreigners aboard

rescue workers said today they had 
abandoned hope of finding 149 workers missing after an explosion 
blew apart a north sea oil rig in the worst such disaster ever 
seventeen bodies and 64 survivors were pulled from the chilly 
waters after the blast police said at least two americans were on 
the rig when it exploded their fate was unknown 
we of course gave up any chance of finding anyone else 
alive most regrettably at sunset last night thursday derek 
ancona commander of the aberdeen search and rescue region told 
the british broadcasting corp 
more than 100 contract workers refurbishing oil rigs in the 
north sea resigned today citing concerns about safety of the 
offshore industry in the north sea 
they felt some action had to be taken concerning safety 
keith gibson an official with the general municipal 
boilermakers and allied trades union told the bbc 
usbased occidental petroleum said a gas leak apparently 
caused the blast wednesday night on the piper alpha oil rig 120 
miles off scotland but it did not know what caused the gas to 
ignite 
the disaster is expected to cost insurers more than 1 billion 
in claims which would be a record the lloyds of london insurance 
market said lloyds spokesman david larner said occidental insured 
the rig plus the costs of any loss of life claims salvaging the 
rig redrilling and pollution 
the rig was still burning occidental said paul red adair of 
houston texas an expert in capping outofcontrol oil wells 
would try to stop it adair was brought in to cap the first blowout 
on a north sea rig in april 1977 
armand hammer the chairman of occidental petroleum flew in 
from los angeles and landed at aberdeens airport where flags were 
at halfstaff he conferred with company heads in aberdeen before 
visiting injured survivors at aberdeen royal infirmary 
hammer told reporters the company was donating one million 
pounds or 17 million to a trust fund set up for the victims and 
their families 
the coast guard said six oil industry ships the 
semisubmersible rig tharos and one coast guard helicopter resumed 
searching today at dawn 
on thursday about 30 ships 15 helicopters and a royal air 
force reconnaissance plane were involved in the search 
a death toll of 166 would make this the worlds worst oil rig 
disaster surpassing the 123 deaths when the alexander l kielland 
platform capsized in norwegian north sea waters in march 1980 
aberdeen police spokesman donald halkerson said those aboard the 
rig when it blew up included two americans two canadians a south 
african a frenchman a west german a portuguese and a spaniard 
he said the rest were believed to be british 
authorities have refused to issue any names and halkerson 
refused to say if the nonbritish were among survivors the 
confirmed dead or those still missing 
survivors said that when the platform blew up at least half of 
those on the rig were in its accommodation block the blast 
demolished the block and turned the rig into a tower of flame 
eoin kerr communications officer at british telecoms maritime 
radio station at wick on the scottish coast told reporters he was 
in contact with the rig when the blast occurred 
kerr said the last message he heard was were abandoning the 
rig jesus christ weve got to get out of here theres no more 
time weve got to get out then the line went dead 
occidental said 75 percent of the 649foothigh rig was 
destroyed 
some survivors told of having to choose between braving the 
flames in hope help would come or plunging 150 feet into an ocean 
blanketed with burning oil but cold enough to kill 
it was a case of fry and die or jump and try said roy 
carey 45 who jumped rescue pilots said flames were up to 400 
feet high 
john maxwell 50 who was aboard the semisubmersible rig tharos 
alongside the doomed platform said i saw a group of about six 
or seven men in survival suits on the rigs helicopter pad with 
flames all round them they were screaming shouting and waving for 
help then the whole of the rig was rocked by another huge 
explosion and a kind of fireball shot across the helipad and all 
the men on it disappeared 
others said the rig became so hot that water jetted onto it from 
firefighting ships simply turned to steam 
mrs thatchers government promised what it called a deep and 
farreaching inquiry into the disaster but questions arose over 
safety standards in the north sea which oilmen regard as one of 
the most hazardous production areas in the world 
opposition politicians said safety was neglected ron todd 
general secretary of the 13million member transport and general 
workers union some of whose members work on north sea rigs said 
the tragedy will clearly raise questions regarding safety in the 
north sea oil industry

federal health officials have reported the 
nations first case of human anthrax since 1984 which apparently 
started with contaminated cashmere at a textile plant 
a 42yearold maintenance man at the north carolina textile mill 
became ill in july 1987 with a small red lesion on his arm and 
developed pain fever and chills over the following week the 
centers for disease control said thursday in its weekly report 
the patient was diagnosed with a cutaneous form of anthrax a 
severe and potentially fatal disease most commonly found in cattle 
and sheep 
only nine other human anthrax cases have occurred in the united 
states in the past decade the cdc said 
vaccination programs were recommended for workers at the north 
carolina plant and at a texas plant where the cashmere was washed 
said the cdc which as is its custom did not identify the 
locations involved 
the patient who later recovered hadnt recently been out of 
north carolina the cdc said however his mill used wool from 
australia and new zealand cashmere goat hair from china 
afghanistan and iran and camel hair from china and mongolia 
eight of 59 textile samples from the mill tested including 
five samples of west asian cashmere showed contamination with 
anthrax bacteria the cdc said in its weekly report 
the west asian cashmere was probably the contaminant the 
cdc reported western asia is an endemic area for anthrax 
the other three contaminated samples were either debris or 
australian wool which may have been crosscontaminated while 
stored near the cashmere the agency said

more than 100 contract workers refurbishing oil 
rigs in the north sea resigned today over concerns about safety 
following the worlds worst oil rig disaster 
wednesday nights fire on occidental petroleum corps piper 
alpha platform off the coast of scotland left 17 people dead and 
another 149 people missing and presumed dead occidental said a gas 
leak triggered the blaze 
in the west sole gas field 100 to 150 workers employed by a 
contractor refurbishing three british petroleum co platforms 
resigned over safety concerns in the north sea in general british 
petroleum said 
a company spokesman said the workers issued a letter saying they 
resigned due to current offshore working conditions in general in 
the offshore industry 
they felt some action had to be taken concerning safety 
keith gibson an official with the general municipal boilermakers 
and allied trades union told the british broadcasting corp radio 
the british petroleum spokesman who wasnt identified in 
accordance with british practice said negotiations between the 
contractor press offshore services division and its employees 
are in progress 
the workers were being brought back on shore he said 
but another company spokesman said workers were not involved and 
that production was running normally 
the north sea oil platform blaze is expected to cost insurers 
more than 1 billion in claims which would be a record the lloyds 
of london insurance market said 
david larner a spokesman for lloyds said the insurance costs 
for the fire could top 1 billion it would make it the largest 
loss in the north sea and probably the largest loss on any one 
unit 
a unit is one item as opposed to a wider disaster which 
prompts a myriad of related claims 
occidental petroleum said thursday that the company has adequate 
insurance to cover the disaster the company insured the rig plus 
the costs of any loss of life claims salvaging the rig redrilling 
and any pollution larner said 
the latest figure dwarfs the estimated 172 million in insurance 
costs for the previous worst oil rig disaster the 1980 capsize of 
the alexander l kielland rig in the north sea off norway which 
killed 123 people according to press association the domestic 
news agency 
press association reported that the piper alpha rig was insured 
for 550 million and that the loss of life claims would come to an 
estimated 172 million 
the insurance policies for the platform have been spread 
throughout the lloyds of london market and overseas and nobody is 
expected to go out of business over the disaster larner said 
the risk is placed literally around the world although its a 
very large loss its unlikely to hurt any particular individual 
the whole essence of insurance is to spead the risk as widely as 
possible larner said 
occidental petroleum said thursday the destruction of the 
platform would cut the companys annual profit by about 5 percent 
to 10 percent 
company president ray irani said the accident would cost 5 cents 
to 10 cents a share 
occidental petroleums stock fell 625 cents to close at 2625 
in new york stock exchange composite trading thursday 
occidentals profit in 1987 was 240 million or 106 a share

ira guerrillas today shelled 
two police stations and mistakenly hit a school and several houses 
a british soldier was killed by a bomb blast near a swimming pool 
where two people were slain earlier police said 
the irish republican army said one of its fighters seamus 
woods 22 died in a mortar attack on a police station at pomeroy 
in county tyrone police said his body was found in a field 
alongside a tractortrailer used in the attack 
six people suffered minor injuries when a mortar raid on a 
second police station in stewartson about 10 miles from pomeroy 
went astray and damaged a primary school and several houses police 
said they said 80 families were evacuated 
the ira claimed reponsibilty for the attacks 
the ira said the bombing of a swimming pool in west belfast on 
thursday evening was an operation that went tragically wrong 
the outlawed group said in a statement to belfast media that the 
bomb which killed two civilians was accidentally triggered by one 
of its men 
the british soldier a bomb disposal expert was killed early 
today by a blast only yards from the swimming pool where he was 
involved in cleanup operations police said 
the mainly catholic ira targets security forces in its guerrilla 
war to end british rule in predominantly protestant northern 
ireland and unite it with the overwhelmingly catholic republic of 
ireland under socialist rule 
on thursday police said a bomb was planted against the inside 
wall of a building housing the swimming pool in the predominately 
roman catholic falls road area of west belfast the blast killed 
two people and injured four others 
the bomb exploded after armed and masked men ordered staff and 
members of the public out of the swimming pool 
the royal ulster constabulary said the bomb apparently was meant 
to bring the walls of the building down on a security patrol 
passing by outside but the blast missed the patrol and hit

the soviet unions top military officer got 
a firsthand look at american military power as he watched the navy 
flex its sea and air muscle and saw marines deploy men and 
equipment under simulated combat conditions 
it was part of a whirlwind tour of american military bases 
thursday by marshal sergei akhromeyev chief of the soviet unions 
general staff 
after watching air force demonstrations at nearby langley air 
force base today the group was to leave for visits to bases in 
texas oklahoma and south dakota they will return to washington 
dc on sunday 
akhromeyev a soldier since 1940 when he joined the soviet army 
as a 17yearold started the tour thursday at camp lejeune nc 
where elements of the 2nd marine division demonstrated quick 
deployment in the afternoon the party was flown out to the 
aircraft carrier theodore roosevelt as it cruised about 80 miles 
off the virginia coast 
there the commanderinchief of the atlantic fleet adm frank 
b kelso ii gave the soviet officer a tour of the navys newest 
nuclearpowered carrier 
the carrier visit featured a demonstration of various aircraft 
aboard the ship including the f14 tomcat and f18 hornet and was 
topped by a wall of water demonstration in which an a6e 
intruder attack bomber dropped 18000 pounds of bombs creating a 
huge surge of water 
asked whether the united states should be showing its best 
military hardware to a potential enemy kelso said i guess 
theres always a risk that you give something away when you show 
anybody anything but remember deterrence also is a perception

to think about

the worlds worst offshore oil platform disaster 
is raising questions about safety in an industry in which hundreds 
have died and the carnage has led some britons to wonder whether 
the oil is worth the human cost 
the price of north sea oil and gas is written in blood the 
daily mirror said in an editorial today 
more than 160 people were killed or missing and presumed killed 
in the the explosion and fire wednesday on the piper alpha platform 
in the north sea 
charges of putting oil production above life preservation are 
bound to resurge in the coming weeks the times of london said in 
an editorial today 
the general attention to safety in the north sea is extremely 
high but it is not always enough the paper said on 
wednesday night it was not enough 
roy carey who was badly burned said from a bed in aberdeen 
royal infirmary in aberdeen scotland we had all that water 
around us and no way to get it to us we had sprinklers but they 
werent strong enough 
the deaths bring to more than 300 the number of people who have 
died in the british sector of the north sea since gas was first 
pumped ashore in 1967 
drilling accidents killed 76 and a helicopter crash killed 45 
last year six workers were killed and 59 seriously hurt among the 
28000 british workers 
three workers from piper alpha died after being thrown into the 
sea when a gangway collapsed in 1982 in 1984 a nonfatal 
explosion and fire forced the evacuation of 174 men 
today more than 100 contract workers refurbishing oil rigs in 
the north sea resigned citing concerns about safety of the 
offshore industry in the north sea 
they felt some action had to be taken keith gibson a 
spokesman for the general municipal boilermakers and allied 
trades union told the british broadcasting corp 
the daily mirror which supports the socialist opposition labor 
party said we must harness the talents of the best engineers 
scientists and managers to develop new and better materials 
systems and services to make the crews safer from all hazards 
including human error 
occidental petroleum which operates the platform said 
wednesdays fire apparently was caused by a gas leak 
the liberal london newspaper the guardian wrote if as 
initial diagnosis suggests only a leak of gas could have triggered 
the series of explosions which wrecked the platform there are 
obvious questions about standards of maintenance the handling and 
storage of flammable materials and the rest 
account must be taken of the testimony from the unions 
that they were frozen out of safety management procedures and that 
complaints and warnings were insufficiently heeded 
ron todd general secretary of the 13million member transport 
and general workers union some of whose members work on north sea 
oil rigs said thursday the tragedy will clearly raise questions 
regarding safety in the north sea oil industry 
labor unions also have complained about the quality and 
avilability of survival gear and too few rescue helicopters they 
see a conflict of interest in making the energy department 
responsible for oil production as well as safety 
in parliament lawmaker john prescott of the opposition labor 
party contended that inspection and maintenance of rigs had been 
reduced in recent years he said insufficient money was spent on 
training and that government health and safety legislation did not 
apply fully to the north sea oil and gas industry 
energy secretary cecil parkinson said serious north sea 
accidents had declined from 101 in 1986 to 59 last year but that 
is too high a figure and we wish to keep the pressure on to ensure 
that improvement is maintained he said 
the department thursday postponed the process for granting new 
offshore licenses which would open up more areas for exploration 
meanwhile the price of brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil jumped on thursday to 1505 a barrel for 
september delivery up 32 cents from late wednesday 
occidental petroleum said the rig produced 167200 barrels a 
day a barrel contains 42 gallons 
the energy department said that in addition to the piper oil 
field five other fields were shut down cutting production by 
about 220000 barrels a day to 250000 barrels a day or about 
onetenth of the british sectors production 
theres pressure on the immediate availability for north sea 
crude said philip morgan an oil analyst with the london 
investment firm warburg securities 
but lucy mullins an oil analyst with the london investment firm 
barclays de zoete wedd ltd said the shortage would be shortterm 
she said the related fields should be back in production in a week 
and piper alpha should be back in about a year 
but there were concerns about claims against the company and 
occidental petroleums stock fell 625 cents to close at 2625 
thursday on the new york stock exchange 
the disaster could prove expensive for the north sea oil 
producers in general morgan said 
obviously questions are going to be raised about safety which 
might involve companies in a lot more expenditure he said

deposed ptl founder jim bakker says his 
proposal to buy and revive ptls christian theme park and 
television ministry is the best but ptls bankruptcy trustee says 
an australian is the leading candidate 
this is 100 percent payout of all debts to all creditors 
bakker said of his plan thursday i dont know of a better deal 
over the table or under the table 
bakker said at a brief news conference outside his office that 
an overseas financial group is willing to lend him the money he 
needs to regain control of the ministry he said the lenders 
insisted they not be identified publicly 
bakker said he gave details of his takeover plan to trustee mc 
red benton on thursday and said he was allowing benton 48 hours 
to consider it before releasing it to the public 
but while benton had previously said he was open to any plan to 
save ptl and that bakker was welcome to submit a plan he said 
wednesday that he changed his position this week because bakkers 
presence threatened to deprive the ministry of all donations 
with mr bakker sort of confusing the issue at this time with 
his appearances people have said they wont give while hes here 
i know the bring bakkers back group wont support us i cant 
afford to risk losing the people we do have supporting us benton 
said 
he will not have a part in this ministry as long as im 
trustee 
benton said gavin morehu described as a millionaire christian 
involved in the importexport business in australia has offered to 
pay 200 million for the ptl complex just south of charlotte nc 
morehu has until july 15 to come up with an initial deposit of 
an earnest 50 million then well work out a contract if he 
doesnt make the deposit hes out benton said 
the ministry has been in financial straits since bakker left in 
march 1987 after revelations he had a sexual tryst with a church 
secretary jessica hahn then paid her to keep quiet about it 
revelations of jim and tammy bakkers luxurious lifestyle 
followed the ministry foundered as donations dwindled and the 
ministry filed for bankruptcy court reorganization with 130 
million in debt 
benton said bakker needs to work out many of his own financial 
and personal problems before he could return to ptl including 
troubles with the internal revenue service his failure to 
reconcile with the assemblies of god church and several lawsuits 
including one with ptl 
bakker and his financial dealings at ptl also are the object of 
a federal grand jury investigation in charlotte according to 
published reports 
bakker said he would provide a financial statement from dun amp 
bradstreet showing his lender is worth 23 billion 
the latest reorganization plan calls for much of ptls assets to 
be sold and for a new debtfree nonprofit ministry to be formed 
with the leased use of the ptl complexs studios and church 
benton said he is continuing to discuss the possible sale with 
potential buyers and hopes to recommend a buyer to us bankruptcy

window service at the nations post offices 
reduced earlier this year to save money will return to normal in 
september the postal service announced today 
postmaster general anthony frank who made the announcement 
said the agency has found sufficient savings in other areas to 
allow it to restore full window hours 
the announcement came at a meeting of the postal board of 
governors at which frank disclosed that the controversial 
consulting contract with texas billionaire h ross perot may have 
to be renegotiated 
the postal service announced the 10 percent reduction in window 
hours in january as one step to save 160 million from its 
expenditures this year and bring it into compliance with spending 
reductions ordered by congress it was left to local postmasters to 
decide when to close the windows 
frank said that normal window service will be restored effective 
on sept 10 
but the service restoration will not necessarily mean a return 
to the old schedules frank said rather he said he has told 
postmasters to open windows during the hours deemed most 
appropriate for their communities 
frank did not address cutbacks in sunday mail sorting a 
reduction also made earlier in january to save money 
turning to the perot contract frank said will have to be 
modified because of the controversy surrounding the deal 
if some sort of agreement cant be worked out with perot he 
said the deal may have to be cancelled i hope that will not be 
the case frank added 
the perot contract is a potentially multimilliondollar deal 
calling for an analysis of postal operations in an effort to find 
ways of saving money it carries an initial 500000 price tag but 
subsequently would provide perot a share of any savings that result 
from recommendations he makes 
the contract which was not open for bids has been challenged 
by at least two wouldbe competitors who asked the general services 
administration to order it suspended the postal service has argued 
that the gsa has no jurisdiction in the matter 
congress has also been involved in the controversy ordering a 
study of the arrangement by the general accounting office 
frank gave no details on what sort of modifications might be 
made in the deal with perot

us commanders in the persian gulf were on 
watch over the july 4th weekend for a handful of iranian f14 
fighters recently stationed near the mouth of the persian gulf but 
rarely risked in combat 
the commander of the uss vincennes capt will c rogers iii 
thought he was under attack by an iranian f14 when he fired two 
sm2 antiaircraft missiles at iran air flight 655 an a300 airbus 
with 290 civilians aboard 
but the f14 is primarily designed for combat against other 
aircraft and pentagon sources said iran hardly ever flies any of 
its few operational f14s in combat 
assistant secretary of defense richard armitage said last 
february that it appeared iran had begun increasing its use of 
f14s because of the planes strong radar and that one of them 
shot down an iraqi mirage over the the main iranian oil terminal at 
kharg island last feb 9 
this is the first effective use in combat weve seen in 
several months as i remember armitage said then 
a us military source with gulf experience said the iranians 
although using the f14s more in recent months to monitor the 
movement of tankers carrying iranian oil seemed wary of sending 
them into combat they have sent them up to escort tankers and 
put them up when iraqi fighters were around but they always veered 
off and stayed out of danger said the source speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
that raises yet another question in the mystery of why a 1 
billion aegis cruiser with the most sophisticated radar and 
tracking system in the navy mistook an iranian a300 airbus with 
290 civilians aboard for an f14 and blasted it out of the sky at a 
range of nine miles 
to be effective against a ship as large as the vincennes 567 
feet long and displacing 9600 tons when fully loaded the f14 
would need to be equipped with armaments that it does not 
ordinarily carry such as antiship missiles or bombs 
or said one air industry source if somebody loaded that 
sucker with 30000 pounds of fuel it would make one hell of a bomb 
on a kamikaze run 
the commander of us forces in the region marine corps gen 
george b crist told reporters last thursday that iran recently 
moved an unspecified number of f14s from their main base at 
isfahan central iran to bandar abbas on the persian gulf 
iran air flight 655 took off from the joint civilianmilitary 
field at bandar abbas while iranian boghammar gunboats were 
attacking the vincennes in the strait of hormuz and headed for the 
us warship 
the airliner broadcast an identification signal similar to one 
used by iranian f14s said pentagon spokesman dan howard 
i dont think it is related to us said crist i think 
this has to do with reaction to the iraqis attacking tankers in 
the southern gulf and not so much the americans 
but the development clearly worried us skipper in the gulf 
asked why the vincennes was afraid of a plane that had never 
been used against a surface target pentagon spokesman dan howard 
said we do know that the iranians have harpoon antiship 
missiles in their inventory which they can sling under an f14 
with no difficulty 
we have suspected for some time that they have been working 
with standards in an airtoground or airtosurface mode and the 
iron bomb is another possibility so if your question is does an 
iranian f14 constitute a threat to us naval vessels the answer 
is yes 
the chaiman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william crowe 
told a news conference sunday that we have alerted our forces of 
indications that iranian units might carry out attacks against our 
forces over the july fourth period 
before the fall of shah mohammed reza pahlavi in 1979 iran 
acquired about 80 of the f14s from the grumman corp of long 
island new york 
hundreds of american technicans were stationed at isfahan 
maintaining the f14s and teaching the iranians to fly them 
after the revolution us arms shipments were cut off and iran 
more or less grounded its f14s once its war with iraq began in 
september 1980 
only within the past year has iran managed to get the spare 
parts it needs to make as many as 15 of the f14s operational 
according to administration officials 
it is not clear where iran is getting the parts but us 
intelligence reports that a north korean ship docked at bandar 
abbas at the end of june and may have contained f14 components 
and possibly weapons 
the f14 can fly faster than mach 2 twice the speed of sound 
or about 1320 mph at an altitude of 30000 feet and those in the 
us navy carry six phoenix four sparrow and four sidewinder 
antiaircraft missiles and are armed with a 20mm vulcan mk61 
cannon capable of firing up to 6000 rounds a minute

democrat michael dukakis campaigned 
today with another potential vice presidential candidate sen 
lloyd bentsen and said im pondering whether to select the 
texan 
dukakis also said he favored some form of us payments to the 
victims of the shotdown iranian airliner 
i think some sort of humanitarian assistance would probably be 
appropriate he said 
the democratic nomineeinwaiting praised bentsens work as 
chairman of the senate finance committee and was asked by reporters 
whether bentsen would be more valuable in the senate 
im pondering he could make a great contribution to the 
country in many many ways he already has dukakis said 
dukakis spoke at an outdoor rally with bentsen arkansas sen 
dale bumpers and arkansas gov bill clinton who will place 
dukakis name in nomination at the democratic national convention 
in atlanta in less than two weeks 
bentsen asked if he wanted the job said i dont think we 
have to worry about that 
dukakis said he had discussed the job with bentsen from time 
to time but declined to say if they had talked on the subject 
today 
dukakis also declined to say when he would select a running 
mate saying only sometime between now and the last day of the 
convention i guess 
the massachusetts governor began his fourday trip through six 
western and rocky mountain states wednesday evening jabbing at 
bush in the vice presidents adopted home state of texas dukakis 
went before a hispanic group in dallas where bush a day earlier had 
made a solemn pledge to put a hispanic in his cabinet 
some people think its enough to wake up after eight years and 
then promise opportunity for one hispanic dukakis said in 
reference to bushs promise i want to stand with you and create 
opportunity for 20 million hispanic citizens across this country 
speaking to the league of united latin american citizens 
convention dukakis made fleeting reference to a similar pledge he 
made to appoint a hispanic to his cabinet if elected at the 
groups meeting a year earlier 
im just looking around the room for cabinet secretaries 
dukakis said as he received the gatherings welcoming applause 
dukakis was flying to arizona later in the day for an appearance 
with former gov bruce babbitt an early dropout from the 
democratic presidential race he also planned stops in california 
oregon washington and at a park in the colorado rockies before 
returning to boston on sunday 
texas and california loom as major electoral battlegrounds for 
the fall campaign and like the others represent states that have 
generally gone republican in recent presidential elections 
dukakis aides depicted his trip his third campaign swing since 
locking up the nomination in california a month ago as signaling 
the democrats intention to challenge for those states this fall 
and serve notice on bush that he will have to protect his 
traditional gop base as that partys nominee 
it sends another strong geographic signal that we can win 
anywhere even in places that have been historically republican 
because thats the nature of this thing said leslie dach 
dukakis communications director 
he said that extended to arizona the most reliably republican 
and conservative of those states 
it means george bush has no secure base and if he wants to 
win there hes going to have to campaign there dach said 
dukakis schedule remained in flux up to his departure however 
as the campaign dropped plans to visit montana and added a stop in 
oregon 
dukakis and bush both made forays into each others territory 
thursday as bushs air force ii taxied by dukakis chartered jet 
on the tarmac in boston as the vice president arrived for 
appearances in the democrats home city 
before departing boston dukakis said bushs promise to 
hispanics amounted to a rather late commitment to affirmative 
action he accused the vice president of breaking his pledge not to 
support new taxes by supporting a provision of the trade bill that 
calls for 1 billion in taxes for job training programs and 
catastrophic health care legislation that included 6 billion in 
taxes on elderly people who opt for the comprehensive care 
so much for ironclad no tax commitments said dukakis who 
himself had to renege on a notax pledge in his first term as 
governor 
in dallas dukakis took a swipe at departing attorney general 
edwin meese iii while at the same time criticizing bush and the 
reagan administration for opposing legislation passed by the senate 
requiring 60 days notice for workers before companies close plants 
he said it was ironic that meese in resigning was willing to 
give himself 30 days notice while the reagan and bush dont 
believe working americans are entitled to one days notice before 
theyre thrown out of their jobs

president reagan said today the administration 
is considering the question of compensation for the destruction of 
iran air flight 655 but a spokesman said the issue has not yet 
been submitted to the president for decision 
reagan asked what he was going to do about compensation said 
all of thats under consideration he was asked during a brief 
appearance in the white house briefing room 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there were still 
some open questions on the compensation issue and it had not yet 
gone to the president for a decision 
there is a universe of issues to be considered related to 
legal aspects of it to the specifics of the incident to relations 
between the two countries and to past experience and history 
fitzwater said 
he would not be more specific 
fitzwater also disclosed that the united states has sent 
messages of condolence to the countries from which the airline 
passengers came asking that sympathies be extended to the 
families the countries are pakistan united arab emirates kuwait 
india yugoslavia and italy 
on thursday fitzwater said i suspect that doing what we 
think is right will be the deciding factor 
fitzwaters comments marked a significant change in the tone of 
administration pronouncements after several days of noncommittal 
responses on the issue of reparations for families of the 290 
victims 
one of the driving forces behind our consideration is simply 
the moral responsibility of america and the fact that weve always 
been a humane nation that takes these kinds of problems very 
seriously and assumes personal responsibilities he said 
the defense department acknowledged thursday that the iranian 
a300 airbus shot down by the us warship was within a commercial 
airline corridor but said that alone did not guarantee its safety 
an airway is not a safety zone said pentagon spokesman dan 
howard all this means is that within that zone within that 
area the air traffic control authorities have agreed to track 
aircraft 
meawhile irans deputy foreign minister hussein sheikholeslam 
demanded that the united states pay compensation for shooting down 
the civilian airliner 
sheikholeslam also called for revenge thursday in a speech on 
tehran radio monitored by the british broadcasting corp in a 
report made available today 
fitzwater stressed that no decision on reparations has been made 
either by senior staff or president reagan but in contrast to his 
suggestion earlier this week that the decision will await the 
outcome of the navys investigation of the incident fitzwater said 
he wanted to emphasize that were moving along through the 
consideration process 
we dont have final decisions yet but it clearly is an issue 
that is under active discussion fitzwater said 
on capitol hill house speaker jim wright dtexas said 
congress would likely support a request for compensation if it came 
from the president 
it should come from the president wright said 
the pentagon spokesman in a briefing with reporters said that 
even though the airliner was in a civilian air corridor vincennes 
skipper capt will c rogers iii still could not rule out the 
chance he was facing an attacking f14 fighter 
howard said iran must share some responsibility for the deaths 
because the airbus took off from a militarycivilian airport at 
bandar abbas during an exchange of fire between the vincennes and 
iranian gunboats 
the iranians are the ones who bear the responsibility for 
ensuring that if they are the ones who provoke the hostilities 
they are the ones who began the shooting in this incident that 
they ensure the safety of their civilian aircraft by not sending 
them into harms way howard said 
howard discounted speculation on capitol hill that an iranian 
warplane might have been flying behind the commercial flight in an 
attempt to use it as a cover to sneak up on the uss vincennes 
he repeated that us warships had broadcast 12 warnings to the 
iranian aircraft seven from the vincennes and five from the uss 
john h sides and he released the transcript of an iranian f14 
responding to a similiar warning the day before the airbus went 
down 
the f14 identified itself to the uss halsey and went away 
howard said 
on sunday the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm 
william crowe had told reporters one reason rogers believed the 
iranian aircraft was a military jet was that it was outside the air 
corridor 
but both crowe and howard have said the most compelling reason 
rogers mistook the aircraft for a military plane was an electronic 
emission from the airbus on tuesday howard identified the 
transmission as signals broadcast on a frequency used only by 
military aircraft 
the signal sent by the airbus said howard was similar to codes 
broadcast within the previous several days by iranian f14 fighters 
recently stationed at bandar abbas 
iranian air flight 655 was 4 miles from the center of a 
civilian air corridor stretching from its departure point bandar 
abbas to dubai in the united arab emirates on the opposite side 
of the strait of hormuz at the mouth of the persian gulf 
according to the code governing international air flights said 
howard commercial airliners those carrying passengers are 
expected to adhere to the centerline of the airway 
but he said it was unclear how wide the air corridor was at the 
point where the airbus was hit because iran claims a corridor 10 
miles on each side and many other countries including the united 
arab emirates recognize a corridor fourandahalf miles from the 
center 
the aircraft was at least fourandahalf miles off the center 
line of the airway and in that regard could be considered to be off 
the normal track of commercial aircraft said howard 
the chairman of the house armed services committee rep les 
aspin dwis said he had been told by pentagon officials tuesday 
that the plane had wandered to the edge of the corridor then tried 
to right itself heading straight at the vincennes 
the vincennes was slightly to the east of the center of the 
airway he said 
fitzwater said there has been no response at all from iran 
to reagans message sunday saying the incident was an accident and 
expressing deep regret

some long island beaches were closed even 
to sun bathers today after more medical waste washed ashore and 
one official said midnight dumpers were suspected of illegally 
disposing of the debris 
we are concerned that these people may be inadvertently hurt 
by picking up this material said michael asheroff deputy 
regional director of the long island state park commission the 
public is being kept from using this absolutely gorgeous facility 
its a pity thery are being denied its use 
jones beach and robert moses state park were closed today after 
plastic refuse including syringes washed ashore 
asheroff said any decision about reopening the beaches for the 
weekend will be made after they are inspected each morning 
the state park was closed to swimmers thursday hours after 
health officials lifted a ban initiated wednesday when the first 
wave of hospital waste hit parts of long islands south shore 
similar orders were given for nassau beach county park and at 
four fire island beaches kismet fair harbor dunewood and 
atlantique several other beaches that were closed wednesday were 
reopened 
elsewhere bayonne nj officials found four more glass blood 
vials thursday bringing to 145 the number of vials found since 
sunday five of 105 vials tested were found to have the aids 
antibody 36 vials were still awaiting testing 
the discovery came a month after five vials of blood were found 
along the beach in ocean county on the new jersey shore two of 
those vials were contaminated with the aids antibody while a third 
tested positive for the more highly infectious hepatitis b virus 
on thursday new jersey investigators met in new york with 
representatives of the nassau county district attorneys office and 
the new york attorney generals office to discuss the cases 
new york officials ordered the beach closings as a precaution 
against the risk of infection from the potentially hazardous waste 
which also included intravenous tubing gauze rubber gloves and 
pill containers 
rw groneman a spokesman for the department of environmental 
conservation in albany said midnight dumpers were suspected 
haulers unwilling to abide by new yorks toughened regulations on 
medical trash disposal who get rid of it at sea under cover of 
darkness 
groneman said the volume of debris indicated that it came from a 
hospital or large clinic and that any such institutions disposal 
of medical trash would be regulated by the state such garbage must 
be incinerated at the hospital or trucked by an approved hauler to 
an incinerator or approved dump site 
inspectors combed the beaches collecting the material but found 
no identifying markings said russell keller senior sanitary 
engineer for the environmental conservation department 
the nassau and suffolk county health departments took samples of 
the ocean water to test for quality with results expected today 
thursdays debris appeared to be heavier than the amounts that 
forced the wednesday shutdown of a 25mile stretch of beaches 
including the robert moses and jones beach state parks said 
michael asheroff deputy director of the long island state park 
commission 
despite a summer heat wave attendance at the beaches seemed 
light thursday normal attendance during weekdays is 50000 to 
60000 at the state beaches

the us department of labor is seeking 
31800 in penalties against ashland oil inc in connection with an 
oil tank collapse that fouled water supplies in pennsylvania ohio 
and west virginia 
the jan 2 collapse of the 4 milliongallon storage tank near 
pittsburgh spewed more than 700000 gallons of diesel fuel into the 
monongahela and ohio rivers in one of the worst inland oil spills 
in us history 
some 23000 suburban pittsburgh residents were without tap water 
for a week and cities all along the two rivers had water supplies 
contaminated until the oil slick was finally diluted 
the labor departments occupational health and safety 
administration accused ashland of willful violations in failing to 
properly weld steel plates that formed the tank wall and failing to 
repair defective welds after they were discovered osha proposed a 
30000 penalty on those points 
osha also claimed a serious safety violation with a proposed 
penalty of 1000 because the dike surrounding the tank was 
inadequate to contain the oil said garry griess osha area 
director in pittsburgh 
the agency is seeking an 800 penalty because ashland failed to 
establish a plan for responding to such an emergency and failed to 
have a written safety plan for the floreffe terminal 
ashland officials are reviewing the citations and weighing their 
options which include formally contesting the civil charges said 
company spokesman roger schrum 
osha spokesman al belsky in philadelphia said thursday that 
ashland had not yet contested the citations 
the company did contest citations issued jan 28 totaling 
18000 concerning alleged violations during the river cleanup

democrat michael dukakis campaigned in texas today repaying 
republican george bushs trip the previous day to the massachusetts 
governors home grounds dukakis standing by texas sen lloyd 
bentsen said he was still deciding whom to choose as his running 
mate 
at a brief news conference in texarkana texas dukakis 
commented briefly about possible us actions in the aftermath of 
last sundays shooting down of an iranian airliner by a us ship 
i think some form of humanitarian assistance would probably be 
appropriate he said without elaboration 
in atlanta meanwhile democratic party chairman paul kirk 
released his letter to the white house accusing the bush campaign 
of not reimbursing the government for use of air force two and 
other vice presidential benefits on campaign trips 
bush campaign manager lee atwater said kirks statements are 
totally without merit and are obviously designed to distract public 
attention from the real issues while i have not yet seen 
kirks letter the events i am told he questioned were financed in 
accordanace with the law and in no case were public funds used to 
defray either campaign or republican national committee expenses 
associated with trips 
the vice president was flying to atlanta today to give a pep 
talk at a republican unity dinner 
dukakis in bushs adopted home state praised bentsen as 
chairman of the senate finance committee and was asked whether 
bentsen would be more valuable in the senate than as a vice 
presidential running mate 
im pondering he could make a great contribution to the 
country in many many ways he already has dukakis said 
bentsen asked if he wanted the job said i dont think we 
have to worry about that 
dukakis spoke at an outdoor rally with bentsen arkansas gov 
bill clinton and arkansas sen dale bumpers at his side 
on thursday bush campaigned in dukakis boston back yard and 
said he shares the traditional values of the greekamerican 
community from which the massachusetts governor hails dukakis 
describing bushs pledge to appoint a hispanic to his cabinet as 
too little and too late said americans are tired of waiting for 
opportunity to trickle down from a privileged few 
the two candidates also sparred from a distance over taxes as 
dukakis accused the vice president of abandoning ironclad 
commitments and favoring 7 billion in new taxes 
jesse jackson meanwhile was traveling to dallas today for a 
meeting with dukakis aides his campaign said the dukakis camp is 
still negotiating with jacksons forces over the civil rights 
leaders plan to pursue as many as 13 minority planks at the 
convention in atlanta july 18 
bush on dukakis home turf spoke well of his rival 
what a tribute it is to greekamericans to our political 
system and to this great country of ours that we find it totally 
natural that the son of an immigrant is one of two men still 
contending to be president of the united states bush said in a 
speech to a conference of the greek orthodox church 
family faith education hard work those are the keys and 
no one knows it better than you bush said its the same 
message you preach in your homes the same way i was raised the 
same way barbara bushs wife and i raised our family 
dukakis however portrayed bush on thursday as an elitist and 
said the vice presidents pledge to appoint a hispanicamerican to 
his cabinet comes after years of reagan administration neglect of 
minorities 
some people think its enough to wake up after eight years and 
then promise opportunity for one hispanic dukakis told the 
league of united latin american citizens the same group bush had 
addressed a day earlier i want to stand with you and create 
opportunity for 20 million hispanic citizens across the country 
ive campaigned from one end of this country to another and i 
know that we americans are ready for a change were tired of 
waiting for opportunity to trickle down from a few privileged 
neighborhoods into our cities and into the small communities of 
rural america 
earlier thursday while still in boston dukakis said bush had 
broken his pledge to oppose any new taxes he said bush supported a 
provision of the trade bill that calls for 1 billion in taxes for 
job training programs and catastrophic health care legislation that 
included 6 billion in taxes on elderly people who opt for the 
comprehensive care 
so much for ironclad notax commitments said dukakis 
bush responded in boston by referring to dukakis recent signing 
of a state cigarette tax and his support for another measure 
raising taxes im against raising taxes and i think recent 
events here in this state that i dont plan to go into demonstrate 
we have a different view on taxes he said 
in an effort to limit public disagreements as november nears 
reagan and bush directed their chiefs of staff thursday to 
coordinate campaign policy pronouncements and strategy 
i think everyone agrees that the main issue is no 
surprises presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said after 
reagan bush and aides met over lunch at the white house 
jackson meanwhile announced plans thursday to lead a threeday 
jackson action rainbow express bus trip from chicago to the 
atlanta convention 
jackson in atlanta said his presidential campaign also will 
sponsor workshops for people outside the convention hall he said 
the emphasis on nondelegates is intended to strengthen the party 
not detract from dukakis

pentagon officials said today they are 
awaiting results of an official investigation to learn whether us 
naval forces in the gulf were monitoring air traffic control 
conversations with iran air flight 655 communications which iran 
says made clear that the airplane was civilian 
we are looking forward to an analysis of the tapes to help 
clarify the issue said lt cmdr chris baumann a pentagon 
spokesman 
the chief of irans air force brig gen mansour satari told 
reporters in tehran on thursday that us systems should have been 
able to monitor 21 minutes of conversation in english between the 
jetliner and the airport control tower in bandar abbas near the 
mouth of the persian gulf 
satari also said the downing of the a300 airbus by the uss 
vincennes showed that the american military was unable to 
control its sophisticated systems 
us officials said the vincennes mistook the airbus for an 
iranian f14 fighter because the plane was broadcasting an 
identification signal on a frequency used only by military 
airplanes as well as sending a signal on a channel used by both 
civilian and military aircraft 
satari said destruction of the plane was an intentional and 
unprovoked attack but he later qualified this by saying the us 
military accepted on purpose the risk of shooting down civilian 
planes because they were unable to control their sophisticated 
systems 
and he said iran had all the tapes needed to prove that 
normal conversation was going on from the time the engines were 
started up on the ground until the plane was shot down 
the iranian general also said the plane was traveling in the 
center of the international air corridor between bandar abbas and 
dubai and could have deviated 10 miles either side but still have 
been within the corridor 
on thursday the chief pentagon spokesman dan howard said that 
defense department officials dont know whether us forces in 
the gulf were listening to the control tower or not we will learn 
that in the course of the investigation being directed by rear 
adm william m fogarty 
tapes from the vincennes were flown from the gulf for analysis 
at a specialized installation at dahlgren va said howard the 
tapes contain data from the vincennes sophisticated aegis radar and 
tracking system said howard but he was unable to say whether they 
included voice communications among the ships officers us 
commanders in the gulf and in the united states or any intercepted 
iranian transmissions 
it is probable that their highest priority at the moment was 
not listening to the air traffic control radio discussions at 
bandar abbas said howard there are many many radio 
frequencies it would take a heck of a lot of people to monitor 
all of them 
howard also said that iranian air flight 655 was 4 miles from 
the center of a civilian air corridor stretching from bandar abbas 
to dubai in the united arab emirates on the opposite side of the 
strait of hormuz 
according to the code governing international air flights said 
howard commercial airliners those carrying passengers are 
expected to adhere to the centerline of the airway 
but he said it was unclear how wide the air corridor was at the 
point where the airbus was hit because iran claims a corridor 10 
miles on each side and many other countries including the united 
arab emirates recognize a corridor 4 miles from the center 
the aircraft was at least 4 miles off the center line of the 
airway and in that regard could be considered to be off the normal 
track of commercial aircraft said howard 
an airway is not a safety zone he said all this means is 
that within that zone within that area the air traffic control 
authorities have agreed to track aircraft

dr jose carrera could only utter the 
names of his missing wife and children before burying his face in 
his hands and crying 
the physician from matamoros mexico sat outside the 
brownsville civic center late thursday praying that his wife and 
two children had survived the collapse of the amigo store 
a third child daughter charlene 7 was waiting at the stores 
entrance when the roof caved in said ruth garcia a family friend 
the girl was treated in a san benito hospital and released early 
today she told her father that her mother letty 37 sister 
denise 8 brother israel 4 and her aunt rosalinda carrera were 
at a cash register paying when the disaster hit 
carrera was riding a rollercoaster of emotion as at one point 
this morning it appeared his family had survived 
we believe there is a possibility they are not dead because 
they were in the center very close to the street under something 
metal said ms garcia who accompanied carrera from matamoros 
just across the rio grande from brownsville 
i feel very happy that they are alive and i hope they can get 
them out soon carrera said this morning 
but it was not clear as rescue workers rescued some of those 
trapped alive in the wreckage whether any of the survivors were 
members of carreras family 
about 200 people most from mexico had traveled to the quickly 
organized civic center information area by midnight to learn what 
they could about loved ones who might have been caught in the 
rubble said diana t lerma a red cross volunteer 
theyve been pretty calm we are trying to be very cautious 
ms lerma said 
for those who were told their families and friends did not 
survive a social worker nurse and priest were standing by to 
help said the rev mike scifert a catholic priest 
at this point there is nothing you can say you just 
listen he said one guy was there to fix a leak in the roof 
and the roof fell in on him 
the chaos of the accident was worsened by the difficulty 
authorities had in getting information to relatives scifert said 
a lot of people are confused many people live in matamoros 
and dont have phones so there is no way to get in touch with 
them he said 
selma torres thought it was a sick joke when a caller telephoned 
her lab at brownsville medical center to say the roof had collapsed 
at the store where her mother is a cashier 
but minutes later the same woman called again in tears 
i just took off from the lab ms torres said we drove 
all the way as close as we could get until we were four blocks from 
there i ran the rest of the way she said 
everything was fine until i saw the building and said oh my 
god no ones survived 
ms torres and her family were lucky 
her mother juanita torres had escaped with apparently minor 
injuries and was back at brownsville medical center being xrayed 
arnold torres had a chance to talk to his wife briefly before 
doctors began examining her 
there were a lot of people shopping at that time because it 
was raining they were shopping buying umbrellas torres said 
his wife told him 
torres heard about the building collapse on the radio and drove 
25 minutes to reach the hospital after phone calls to his daughter 
at the medical center he determined his wife was well later he 
saw the rubble 
im just glad someone else had told me she was all right 
before i saw the building he said truthfully i didnt think 
there were any survivors

the tank when fire broke out the flames were extinguished but the 
gas reignited early this morning he said

two reporters for the providence journalbulletin 
are investigating the death last year of their publisher even 
though police concluded after a fivemonth investigation that the 
death was accidental 
michael p metcalf 54 who also was chief executive officer of 
the providence journal co was found last sept 13 unconscious 
with head injuries next to his bicycle in westport mass 
he never regained consciousness and died a week later at st 
marys hospital in fall river 
westport police said the death was accidental 
bristol county district attorney ronald pina agreed to conduct 
another investigation at the request of the providence journal co 
his office and state police ended a fivemonth investigation last 
february and came to the same conclusion although pina said the 
case officially remains open 
but reporters g wayne miller and robert kramer began their 
investigation in march and will continue as they think necessary 
we decided there were enough nagging doubts even after the 
pina investigation that it would be wrong for us to just sit back 
and not do anything especially about something that was so 
mysterious and touched so close to home carol young metro 
managing editor of the journal told the boston globe this week 
we didnt want to wake up two years from now knowing we hadnt 
tested it she said 
many rumors circulated following metcalfs death and miller 
told the globe virtually all of them had something to do with 
something other than a freak accident 
he said the rumors included theories that metcalf was tripped by 
an animal knocked down by a hitrun driver or murdered by 
gangsters 
police estimated metcalf was cycling at 20 mph but doctors said 
they were surprised he suffered such massive injuries at that speed 
steven hamblett who succeeded metcalf as publisher and 
metcalfs widow charlotte metcalf said they were not satisfied 
with the outcome of the police investigation 
we cannot forget that mr metcalf was publisher of newspapers 
known for their investigative stories and editorials on crime 
hamblett said this fact coupled with the unique circumstances 
surrounding his death make it impossible for us to rule out foul 
play 
pina said he would welcome new evidence but stood by the 
conclusion his office reached 
we dont know why he fell off his bicycle but the evidence we 
have is consistent with the fact that he fell off his bike hit the 
ground with his full body weight on the skull and fractured it 
pina said its a freakish accident but it can occur 
the reporters sent more than 1000 letters to people who may 
have been in the area the morning of the accident including 
participants in a 100mile bike rally on a route that passed the 
spot where metcalf fell 
miller declined to comment on what if anything the reporters 
have learned so far 
metcalf had been publisher of the newspapers since 1979 his 
father and his grandfather had been president of the company before 
him

hungarian trade unions want parliament 
to pass a law giving them the right to strike it was reported 
friday 
such a law would make hungary the first soviet bloc country in 
which strikes would be a legitimate form of worker protest 
current law makes a vague reference to the right to work 
stoppage but strikes virtually are illegal in hungary 
the state news agency mti quoted sandor nagy general secretary 
of the hungrian trade union council as saying parliament should 
pass a trade union law with due stipulations about the right 
to strike and the conditions of taking that industrial action 
the next parliamentary session is in september 
nagy was elected to the post in june as part of the communist 
party and government reshuffle the moves followed a party 
conference in may at which karoly grosz replaced longtime party 
leader janos kadar 
for decades strikes were officially nonexistent in communist 
eastern europe and the goverments official line was that they 
were unnecessary because workers are the owners of factories under 
marxist doctrine 
strikes have occurred recently however in the soviet union 
poland and yugoslavia

japan decided friday to lower by 46 percent the 
price paid to farmers for this years rice crop government 
officials said 
the cabinet decision marks a second consecutive decline in the 
producer rice price which determines consumer rice prices as well 
japanese customers now pay up to eight times the price paid for 
rice in other countries 
the government postponed for one year a new method to calculate 
the producer rice price under the new price producers will 
receive 127 for every 132 pounds of rice 
after going through japans complex distribution system rice 
costs about 4 a pound 
analysts pointed to excess rice production in the past few years 
and the declining consumption as reasons for the price decline 
more than 18 million tons of rice are stockpiled 
excess production is the direct motivation to lower the 
price said masatsune adachi an agricultural analyst 
but the bottom line is the appreciation of the yen the 
agricultural ministry wants japanese rice production competitive 
enough to endure foreign competition in case foreign demands to 
open the market is extended to rice adachi said 
rice is japans top agricultural product the government 
controls distribution by buying rice from farmers and releasing it 
to the market the country also bans the importation of rice 
japan has been under strong pressure from the united states to 
open its agricultural markets including rice 
the governments decision to delay the introduction of the new 
method is widely attributed to the strong political influence of 
the farm lobby 
recent agreements with the united states to open japanese 
markets are expected to have a severe impact on japanese farmers 
tokyo has promised to open its agricultural markets to american 
beef and oranges which are considerably cheaper than domestic beef 
and oranges

democratic party chairman paul kirk today accused 
vice president george bush of improperly using taxpayers money to 
finance campaign travel or exceeding legal spending limits 
in a letter to white house counsel ab culvahouse kirk said 
evidence strongly suggests improper spending kirk told 
reporters in atlanta the democratic party may file a complaint with 
the federal election commission which enforces federal election 
laws 
the only thing that matches the hypocrisy of the republican 
party of the 1980s claiming the party of fiscal conservatism is the 
republican party of the 1980s preaching about law and order kirk 
said 
kirk said bush may have used tax money improperly to pay for 
some campaign expenses 
but he said even if the bush campaign reimburses the 
government for trips the vice president made including appearances 
in louisville ky and columbus ohio he would question whether 
the campaign has exceeded the spending limit for the preconvention 
period 
in the letter delivered today kirk said bush is conserving 
his limited remaining resources by not reimbursing the federal 
government for the use of air force two and other vice presidential 
perks during two june political trips 
he asked culvahouse to take immediate action on the 
allegations 
federal law says the government will pay the vice presidents 
expenses only in the discharge of executive duties and 
responsibilities but interpretation of those duties is up to the 
federal election commission 
bush campaign spokesman mark goodin said the louisville trip and 
another oneday outing to columbus ohio cited by kirk will be 
paid for fully by the bush campaign 
it was a campaign expenditure goodin said the bill 
hasnt been paid but when its paid the campaign will pay it he 
said the determination that the trips were campaign trips was made 
well in advance of kirks letter 
today in washington bush campaign chairman lee atwater said 
kirks statements are totally without merit and are obviously 
designed to distract public attention from the real issues 
while i have not yet seen kirks letter the events i am told he 
questioned were financed in accordanace with the law and in no 
case were public funds used to defray either campaign or republican 
national committee expenses associated with trips 
atwater added mr kirk is wrong on the facts and i challenge 
him to come forward with something more than political innuendo if 
he wants to level accusations against this campaign 
bush has been forced to limit his campaign travel because he has 
spent nearly all the money allowed under federal election law for 
the preconvention campaign but he has taken several trips billed 
as partybuilding events at the expense of the rnc 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the white house is 
scrupulously careful in determining who pays for political 
activities this sounds like more political hot air to me

thirteen farmers died after they went into 
wells contaminated with carbon dioxide a government official said 
today 
kartar singh bhoria deputy commissioner in karnal in the 
northern state of haryana said the deaths occurred thursday and 
today in six villages near karnal 
he said all of the farmers were stricken after they climbed into 
the wells to start up underground pumps for irrigating rice 
paddies tests showed the wells to be filled with carbon dioxide 
he said 
the colorless and odorless gas was believed formed underground 
because of radical climate changes over the past year last year 
the region suffered severe drought 
karnal is 72 miles north of new delhi 
the press trust of india said other villages were warned of 
possible danger 
government officials urged farmers to lower burning candles or 
lamps into the well to check for gas before entering the wells 
themselves the flame will be extinguished if carbon dioxide gas is 
present they said

firefighters beat back a forest fire that prompted the 
evacuation of more than 1000 people near mount rushmore national 
memorial allowing it to be reopened while a second blaze nearly 
brushed the alaska pipeline 
in south carolina a 1000acre blaze jumped plowed fire lines 
in four locations thursday and ate up another 150 acres of timber 
and brush dried by heat and drought while land managers in alaska 
took a new tack in their battle against four fires raging over 
270000 acres 
fifty percent of south dakotas custer state park fire which 
has burned 16000 acres was contained by thursday night said fire 
information officer jerry hagen 
we have 13 miles of fire line built at this point we have 13 
miles to go hagen said we expect to have the rest of it 
contained by 8 pm sunday 
the weather was finally working on the side of the firefighters 
instead of searing temperatures high wind and low humidity crews 
this morning faced temperatures in the 60s higher humidity and 
light southeasterly winds at 610 mph said richard homann a 
spokesman for the state division of forestry 
although authorities today revised the number of acres upward 
from thursdays figure of 13000 the fire didnt really grow that 
much overnight said tom farver a public information officer with 
the state division of forestry he said officials used an infrared 
scanner in an airplane thursday to get a more accurate reading of 
the acreage as well as pinpoint hotspots 
about 1000 people in or near the park the town of keystone and 
mount rushmore were evacuated wednesday night as the fire in the 
black hills national forest spread northward but a wind shift 
stopped the flames short of the granite monument of four presidents 
crews today planned to strengthen the fire lines on the west 
edge and southwest perimeter of the blaze homann said 
on thursday fire commander bob miller said the objective 
today was to keep the fire from spreading to the north toward mount 
rushmore that was accomplished 
with the exception of the facilities in custer state park the 
black hills are open said park superintendent dan wenk the 
fire is in a very small area of the black hills 
mount rushmore and keystone were reopened thursday but custer 
state park remained offlimits the fire was four miles east of 
custer today and homann said an evacuation plan has been drawn up 
for the town 
the cost to fight the fire thus far is 361000 and it could 
cost 1 million when all the expenses are tallied homann said 
in south carolina timberland near nixonville defied 
firefighters by jumping their lines 
if we can get a good wide break established tonight 
hopefully thatll take care of it said firefighter mike remion 
thursday night 
instead of using water firefighters plow up large fire breaks 
to starve the fire and stop its spread 
we can keep it under control but it wont actually be out 
until we get some rain not just a little rain but a lot of 
rain said forestry spokeswoman jennie morris 
in alaska firefighters held a blaze in check that had come 
within 10 miles of the alaska pipeline while land managers altered 
their overall strategy because of debilitating smoke 
their goal has been to stop the fire from getting closer to 
the pipeline said sue mitchell an information officer for the 
bureau of land management so far they seem to have been 
successful they have the head of the fire corraled between two 
creeks and a fire line 
alyeska pipeline service co spokesman tom brennan said the 
pipeline stands in a large cleared rightofway is constructed of 
thick steel that has been heavily insulated and was not 
susceptible to serious damage even if the fire had reached it 
northern alaskas major fires are a 126000acre blaze 15 miles 
north of livengood a 40000acre fire near ambler a 53000acre 
fire northeast of fort yukon and a 51000acre fire north of 
central all but the last are manned more than 600 firefighters 
are on the job 
elsewhere in a nation made fireprone by drought and heat 
low winds and cooler temperatures helped to bring under 
control today a 1300acre fire ignited by fireworks in wyomings 
bridgerteton national forest 
firefighters contained a 1650acre fire in wyomings shoshone 
national forest said incident commander tut anderson the fire 
was started by lightning two weeks ago 
in yellowstone national park three fires covering nearly 
1900 acres of backcountry were being allowed to burn themselves 
out 
a 920acre brush fire in the los padres national forest in 
california was nearly encircled thursday as firefighters made 
progress against the slowmoving but stubborn blaze 
firefighters gained the upper hand thursday on utah brush and 
range fires that charred more than 5000 acres in three separate 
areas including 900 acres in zion national park

the american who trained dolphins for the 
television series flipper said he is leaving for china on 
saturday to try to save endangered river dolphins from extinction 
ric obarry who has been working with dolphins for 25 years 
said only about 300 freshwater dolphins or baiji remain in 
the polluted yangtze river 
the problem is that 10 percent of the worlds population lives 
along that river he said in an interview from hong kong where 
he arrived monday from the united states 
its not a traditional pollution problem involving chemical 
waste but animal and human waste obarry said 
the chinese plan to block off a loop in the yangtze for a 
dolphin preserve but he said this might not be the solution 
because of the yangtzes pollution 
obarry would like to move the dolphins to taihu a lake near 
nanjing on the yangtze in southeastern china he believes this 
might be the only way to save them from extinction 
the survival of the river dolphins he said is not a chinese 
problem but a world problem a human problem 
obarry 48 decided to go to china after a meeting in miami 
with zhou kaiya dean of the nanjing normal university when he 
heard about the problems facing the river dolphins 
he borrowed 3000 from his 16yearold sons college fund for 
the trip but said he also is looking for corporate sponsorship for 
the project 
i dont have a lot of money but i have lots of patience 
thats a necessary tool obarry said 
after arriving in hong kong obarry tried to telephone zhou in 
nanjing but they said they had no dr zhou there 
fearing failure in his mission obarry contacted officials of 
the world wildlife fund in hong kong and the conservationist 
organization tracked down zhou 
from nanjing obarry plans to take a boat down the yangtze 
river to the institute of hydrobiology in wuhan to see qi qi an 
8foot bluish grey male dolphin the only chinese river dolphin in

the voters want major changes in the nations 
direction but may face a presidential campaign based more on the 
personalities of michael dukakis and george bush a new poll 
suggested friday 
the democratic governor of massachusetts apparently riding the 
desire for change holds a ninepoint lead over bush in the latest 
poll conducted by hamilton frederick and schneiders a washington 
survey firm 
however charles rund a republican consultant on the poll 
said americans are moving faster than their political leadership 
is we may be in for the biggest personality contest because of a 
lack of big issues that weve ever seen 
the poll conducted for the american medical political action 
committee also suggested that both parties are suffering from the 
sleaze factor a perception of unethical conduct by the 
nations leaders 
recent national surveys have put dukakis margin over bush in 
single digits down from a wave of polls giving him doubledigit 
margins earlier in the spring the new survey gave dukakis support 
of 50 percent and bush 41 percent nine percent were undecided in 
the telephone interviews with 1502 registered voters june 819 
the sampling error for such a survey is three percentage points in 
either direction 
change is the major thought on the voters minds the poll 
suggested 
the need for change is driving this election said pollster 
william hamilton they want change but they dont want a 
revolution 
by a 6032 margin those polled agreed that the next president 
should make major changes and set new goals and directions 
for the country by a similar 6131 edge the registered voters 
agreed they want the next president to initiate new economic 
policies 
and dukakis does best among those who want change the most the 
poll said 
for example among respondents who took the strongest prochange 
stance on both questions dukakis led bush 7319 among those 
taking the strongest prostatus quo position the result was 
reversed with bush leading 7813 
while the drive for change is broadbased it is not focused on 
specific issues 
thirtyfive percent named issues closely linking the government 
and the economy such as the budget deficit and trade deficit as 
the most critical that complex of issues was followed closely by 
social concerns such as aids the homeless and medical care 
totaling 33 percent 
twentynine percent mentioned foreign policy and defense matters 
and 26 percent talked about drugs and crime another 26 percent 
cited unemployment and inflation respondents were allowed to name 
more than one issue 
the poll said as others have that bush is viewed negatively by 
many voters while dukakis is not clearly perceived yet by the 
public 
bush has to get michael dukakis as a personality into this 
race with some negatives on him hamilton said 
voters gave bush a 53 percent positive rating but a substantial 
42 percent negative one in contrast dukakis drew favorable marks 
from 66 percent to only 23 percent unfavorable 
democratic strategists have been saying that bush and 
republicans generally will be damaged in the fall elections by the 
sleaze factor allegations of wrongdoing and unethical behavior by 
reagan appointees bush has been fighting back by pointing to the 
investigation of house speaker jim wrights finances 
the poll suggested that it is losing issue for both parties 
its tarring everyone hamilton said 
twothirds of those questioned said the leaders of business 
government and religious groups are less trustworthy and honest 
than they were 10 or 15 years ago up from 58 percent in a poll 
taken in july 1987 in both polls about one out of ten said the 
leaders are more honest than they were

a federal judge today rejected a newspapers 
attempt to obtain secret applications for warrants to search and 
wiretap the offices of defense consultants under investigation for 
alleged procurement fraud 
us district judge john h pratt denied a request by the 
washington times to unseal applications for the searches and 
wiretaps that he had authorized in the nations capital 
pratt ruled there was a compelling public interest to keep the 
material secret until the investigation into contract fraud 
proceeds further along 
asistant us attorney joseph aronica argued at a hearing that 
the justice department was seeking to keep the documents under seal 
only for a limited time to permit major steps in the 
investigation 
we dont have any great dispute for the publics right to 
know what we are saying now is not the appopriate time for that 
aronica said 
pratt agreed saying 
all this material is going to be in the public domain in the 
reasonably near future there is no denial of the public right to 
know what we do deny is when that right to know is to be 
effective 
jerome barron a george washington university law professor who 
represented the newspaper said the times had both a commonlaw and 
first amendment right to obtain the affidavits 
barron argued there was a compelling public interest to obtain 
information about the contractfraud investigation he noted that 
the release of an affidavit in dallas prompted defense secretary 
frank carlucci to freeze payment on a number of defense contracts 
that might be tainted 
the washington times suit was among several filed by a number of 
newspapers in several cities the times has another action pending 
in alexandria va where the investigation is based and the 
largest number of sealed affidavits located 
on wednesday the washington post made a similar request in 
hyattsville md while the st louis postdispatch applied for 
unsealing in st louis 
newsday published in long island ny and new york city 
filed in brooklyn june 23 
the washington post cited a strong public interest in 
unsealing the documents supporting three searches in maryland a 
hearing is scheduled for next week 
the post said the papers were sealed presumably because 
disclosure originally would have impaired the investigation but 
said the application these interests no doubt wellfounded in 
the first instance cannot justify secrecy for an unlimited period 
of time 
said the post it is hardly a secret any more that the 
government is conducting a wideranging probe of defense 
procurement practices 
the pulitzer publishing co which publishes the postdispatch 
seeks information about a search of the offices of thomas gunn the 
vice president for marketing of mcdonnell aircraft co a 
subsidiary of mcdonnell douglas corp 
the newspaper claims constitutional guarantees of freedom of the 
press give it the right of immediate access to the affidavits 
us district judge clyde s cahill in st louis issued a search 
warrant june 14 authorizing the fbi to seize documents and 
computer records related to the work of two consultants melvyn r 
paisley and james a ace lyons who have worked for mcdonnell 
paisley is one of the major targets of the fbis nationwide 
investigation into defense purchases an investigation called 
operation ill wind he was the navys assistant secretary for 
research engineering and systems from 1981 to last year 
paisleys application to inspect the application for the warrant 
fbi agents obtained to search the office of paisley associates 
inc was denied during a hearing before pratt 
the judge told paisleys lawyer the application was merely an 
attempt on your part to find out information the government has 
with respect to your client 
pratt who had originally scheduled a closed proceeding on 
paisleys motion held the hearing in open court 
in st louis mcdonnell douglas an aerospace giant has denied 
any wrongdoing and has promised to cooperate with the pentagon 
probe 
cahill allowed the search warrant and the inventory of material 
seized in the search to be made public but he agreed to a request 
by prosecutors that the affidavits in support of the warrant remain 
sealed indefinitely 
the us attorneys office said wednesday that it opposed the 
publishing companys request release of the affidavits would 
disclose classified information and harm national security 
prosecutors said 
james r reed a corporate spokesman for mcdonnell said the 
company had not seen the affidavit but wanted to discuss its 
contents with the government before any consideration of its 
release 
cahill gave prosecutors until monday and mcdonnell douglas until 
tuesday to respond to the request for disclosure he said he hoped 
to rule by july 18 
meanwhile judge pratt in washington unsealed portions of 
affidavits the fbi submitted to search the offices of united 
technologies executive eugene tallia and defense consultant william 
galvin last month 
the unsealed portions do not shed any new light on the 
governments continuing investigation the passages which the 
government did not object to being released merely describe in 
general terms the pentagon procurement system and the role of 
defense contractors 
pratt refused a request by united technologies to review the 
rest of the affidavits contents

the martyrdom of saint sebastian mixes 
dancing with the slow motion of some oriental theater and with the 
gestures martha graham uses to denote passions 
unfortunately it doesnt mix them enough before the 3 hours 
are over a viewer loses interest and becomes restless 
the slowmotion tableaux are interesting at first slowing a 
viewer into serenity the best of saint sebastian is the 
dancing but that frequently stops and with narration in french 
the story is tediously acted out martha graham has her dancers 
gesture while dancing sustaining tension 
robert wilson known for creating long operas along with modern 
composers has created a long ballet his first with japanese 
classical dancer suzushi hanayagi 
the paris opera ballet which premiered it in march is ending 
its threeweek metropolitan opera season this weekend with the 
american premiere of the work 
the martyrdom of saint sebastian is beautiful the final 
scene is paradise white grass bears and monkeys with a 
breathtaking bright white light costumes and sets are wonderful 
with large striking images like the lily which comes from above 
filling the backdrop as its petals open 
sylvie guillem was always marvelous to look at as saint 
sebastian she is lovely and has total muscle control and grace 
when she stood in front of a pillar in white sarong to be shot by 
arrows it was the pose of a 1930s hollywood star but miss guillem 
was so convincing as saint sebastian that nobody snickered 
when patrick dupond as the emperor danced he looked splendid 
michael denard was effective as a second saint sebastian 
program notes were extensive enough to make everything clear 
the text was written for a fivehour ballet in 1911 claude debussy 
composed the music 
wilson wrote a 20th century prologue directed and collaborated 
on sets and lighting 
the small amount of dancing in saint sebastian however 
reminds one of the claim made for some great voices that they would 
be fascinating reading the entire phone book its best not to put 
that to the test

people around her who are believed dead said lt victor 
rodriguez of the citys police department 
another rescued child 8yearold jorge mena lire was pulled 
from the rubble and taken on a stretcher to be examined by waiting 
doctors 
the little boy kept crying that he wanted to come out he was

refreshments said fireman william briggs he was also a little 
scared which is natural and hes also afraid of dying 
the threestory amigo store collapsed thursday afternoon during 
a storm that dumped more than 2 inches of rain in less than 30 
minutes some witnesses said as many as 125 people sought shelter 
inside the downtown building before it crumbled but sgt dean 
poos a police spokesman said only about 50 had been inside 
there was continuing confusion over the numbers and identities 
of people in the building officials first said that the wife and 
two children of dr jose carrera were alive in the rubble later in 
the morning they were less certain 
hundreds of rescuers working through the night removed debris 
with tractors a crane and finally by hand fearful of further 
injuring trapped survivors working through the night under 
portable floodlights they used dogs and sensitive microphones to 
hunt for victims 
later in the morning hundreds of onlookers cheered as one woman 
was carried to safety and taken to a first aid station across the 
st 
believed one of the victims scribbled the message 
to reach trapped survivors rescuers dug a makeshift 17foot 
tunnel and doctors were able to check their vital signs said 
johnny economedes head of one rescue team 
its very hard for them they are in terrible pain both 
emotional and physical he said 
further rescues of survivors could take hours said poos 
one of those saved was a 14yearold girl who was wedged between 
two concrete slabs every time theres movement the slabs hit 
her in the head said pamela downing of the citys public 
utilities board before she was freed 
brownsville mayor ygnacio garza said i think they the people 
who are still trapped have been panicked they have been afraid 
we have had some priests in there talking to them 
now that were to them were able to get them through it i 
think we have an iv in one or two of them so i think theyre being 
calming down now but obviously they want to get out of there and 
were making every effort to get them out of there as fast as 
possible 
the store was half a block from the international bridge across 
the rio grande river to matamoros mexico when the storm began a 
large number of mexican nationals were running there to get out 
of the rain the store was packed sheriffs lt johnny castillo 
said 
a woman sitting in a car in front of the store was among those 
killed when the roof and walls collapsed 
rescuers cut through a wall inside a woolworths store next door 
to reach some of those trapped linens and clothing blown from the 
store by high winds were used to wrap the wounds of the injured 
six bodies had been removed from the rubble by midnight and 
poos said two more were removed this morning officials said three 
others were still in the wreckage 
theyve got two steel beams across them and about 20 or 30 
tons of concrete on them economedes said authorities fear that 
dozens of people may still be trapped 
ambulances firefighters and volunteers from across the rio 
grande valley joined the rescue effort and numerous companies 
provided heavy machinery 
there are so many helping hands that its too much once you 
look at it said city commissioner harry mcnair brownsville 
hasnt seen a disaster of this magnitude since 1967 with hurricane 
beulah 
many people went to blood banks to donate blood in case it was 
needed 
as of noon today 47 people were known to be injured rodriguez 
said at least eight of the injured were admitted to hospitals 34 
others were treated and released poos said earlier 
among those injured slightly was store owner bernard levin 67 
who was working at the cash register at the time 
it was a shock i was cashiering and all of a sudden it 
happened levin said it was a wellbuilt building and we still 
dont know what caused it to collapse 
he escaped with three employees and three customers and said 
there were 10 other employees and several more customers in the 
store 
the 40yearold structure housed the department store on the 
first floor with the other two floors vacant but made of concrete 
economedes said 
thats whats making us go much slower there are tons of 
concrete on there and we are using cherry pickers to help us remove 
the debris he said 
the national weather service said the collapse could have been 
caused by the weight of rainwater from a storm that also caused 
street flooding especially in the downtown area 
anthony padilla a photographer for the brownsville herald was 
taking weather pictures across from the store before it collapsed 
it was coming forward then the window the entire storefront 
the windows just exploded out padilla said glass just went 
out people just went like this covered their heads kind of 
ducked down and in the next instant the whole thing just came 
down 
the people i had been looking at were just covered with 
rubble he said

dallas beat out san antonio in a texassized 
duel for the right to hold an exhibition featuring artifacts of 
ramses ii one of egypts greatest pharaohs 
cairos archaeological circles dubbed it the second gunfight 
at the ok corral 
each city was armed with what it considered a valid 
letterofintent signed by egyptian officials promising the popular 
exhibit of the pharoah who ruled egypt 3200 years ago 
the ramses exhibit will go to the museum of natural history in 
dallas in april and then return to egypt a compromise worked out 
thursday wont leave san antonio emptyhanded 
the san antonio museum of art will be second in line for art 
of ancient egypt a new exhibition of art treasures from egypts 
nile delta region the exhibit debuts in november at washingtons 
national gallery and then travels to san antonio in march 1990 
i think its a good solution said zahi hawass the 
archaeological adviser to egypts minister of culture who drafted 
the compromise 
the ramses exhibit opened in montreal in 1985 and is on display 
in boston 
the us tour opened in provo utah in october 1985 and it has 
been an attraction at jacksonville fla memphis tenn and 
denver it heads to charlotte nc in september before moving to 
dallas 
hawass said the problem between dallas and san antonio occurred 
because both cities thought the ramses exhibit was going to their 
museums 
dallas has been interested in ramses for about two years he 
said and there is letter signed by egyptian officials which 
dallas considered a letter of intent and san antonio later signed 
a regular letter of intent 
so we were left with two cities each wanting ramses and each 
thinking its letter was legal we had to reach some sort of 
solution 
money from both exhibits will help finance a new museum of the 
egyptian civilization to be built in cairo and the nubia museum at 
aswan 615 miles to the south 
hawass said dallas contract calls for payment to the egyptian 
antiquities organization of 750000 plus 100000 for the use of 
a 27foottall ramses statue restored by egyptian and american 
experts in honor of the exhibition 
he said the agreement also calls for the organization to receive 
5 percent of profits from the catalog and related items sold in the 
museum shop 
in the past egypt didnt get a proper financial return for its 
exhibits sent abroad the tutankhamun exhibit that toured england 
and the united states is the best example hawass said we know 
every museum hosting such an exhibit makes 10 million to 12 
million each exhibit draws more than a million viewers 
the exhibit featured gold and other items from pharaoh 
tutankhamuns tomb which toured several countries in the 1970s 
egyptian officials complained that contracts were too tightly 
drawn leaving them out in the cold as far as sharing the profits 
hawass said the culture ministry has decided to demand for 
future exhibits a minimum of 850000 plus 50 percent from the 
sale of catalogues and other items 
we take a risk in sending artifacts out of egypt he said

syrianbacked faction police said 
members of the mainstream fatah group left bourj elbarajneh 
camp early in the day for to sidon a port city about 25 miles 
south of the capital 
three leftist lebanese militias supervised the evacuation at the 
request of sultan abulainen the commander of fatah forces in 
bourj elbarajneh 
bourj elbarajneh fell to the forces of col saeed mousas 
fatahuprising late thursday after more than two months of fighting

vehicles for the evacuation to sidon 
mousas men watched from a distance waving victoriously as 
arafats fighters withdrew from the camp 
the evacuees were the last group of arafats guerrillas in 
beirut 
israels army invaded the lebanese capital in 1982 and forced 
arafat and his fighters to leave police have estimated that 5000 
hardline plo guerrillas have filtered back to lebanon since then

lebanon with a population of nearly 50000 
abulainen talking to reporters at ein elhilweh said fatah 
fighters were ousted from beirut as a result of an 
americansyrian plot 
the plot aims at finishing the plo abulainen charged he 
declineds to elaborate 
mousa with syrias backing broke away from the palestine 
liberation organization in 1983 and set up headquarters in 
damascus the syrian capital 
fighting between mousas followers and arafats loyalists 
erupted two months ago despite a reconciliation meeting between 
arafat syrian president hafez assad in april 
the plo has claimed syria despite the reconciliation was 
behind the effort to drive arafats forces out of beirut syria 
denied any involvement

displaced the roof authorities said today 
no injuries were reported in the thursday evening fire at the 
80000 gallon tank which contained unleaded gasoline said the 
hutchinson county sheriffs office

pilots of civilian 
helicopters say they often have communications problems with us 
navy vessels in the persian gulf and the warships sometimes 
misjudge altitude when warning aircraft away 
us navy officials say the uss vincennes was unable to 
communicate with or identify iran air flight 655 on sunday before 
shooting it down with missiles killing 290 people 
pentagon spokesmen said the vincennes and a second ship sent 12 
unanswered warnings to the airbus a300 before the guidedmissile 
cruiser fired iranian officials say the ship should have heard the 
plane talking to ground control in iran 
pilots of helicopters chartered by news organizations who fly 
much closer to warships than airliners described several incidents 
in which they did not hear warnings or the navy did not respond to 
their calls 
one of them chris howard said he and another charter pilot 
could not reach a navy vessel thursday on channel 16 the universal 
emergency frequency i called and called and eventually 
another american ship farther away responded he said 
the american destroyer john hancock locked its weapons on a 
helicopter chartered by nbc news when the chopper did not respond 
wednesday to at least two warnings overheard by other pilots nearby 
when the helicopter pilot finally made contact with the ship he 
said he had been monitoring the emergency frequency but did not 
hear the earlier messages 
capt massoud razavi of iran air told a news conference in 
london that pilots sometimes cant be sure they are talking to 
you when they hear navy messages he sometimes flies the bandar 
abbasdubai route on which the airbus was shot down 
charter pilot peter byrne also said it is not always clear which 
aircraft is being addressed byrne said he ignored a warning 
recently because he was over the desert five miles from water and 
didnt realize the call was for his helicopter until he heard a 
second warning 
he said navy ships quite often appear to have trouble 
pinpointing altitude he reported overhearing a ship warning off a 
chopper recently that was flying at 500 feet addressing it on the 
radio as being at 1500 feet 
pentagon officials said the vincennes fired at the iranian jet 
partly because it was detected at about 7000 feet and descending 
but also said another navy ship reported the jet as did iran at 
12000 feet or higher 
no previous incident led to a navy attack on a civilian 
aircraft but pilots said iranian ships have fired on helicopters 
several times without warning 
byrne said the navys prudence might stem from its familiarity 
with the flight patterns of news helicopters which have dogged the 
fleet since it expanded operations in the gulf in july 1987 
howard said theres a communications problem but things 
are certainly better than they were a year ago it was chaos 
they were calling on the uhf frequency which civilian aircraft 
dont carry 
he added in sympathy with the difficulties of communications 
officers we are only aware of our side of the problem 
byrne said pilots often have several radios receiving messages 
on different frequencies and might briefly turn down the volume on 
the general emergency frequency to hear a message on another 
channel 
iran air officials say the pilot of flight 655 was busy 
communicating with control towers after taking off from bandar 
abbas on the short flight to dubai the airbus was shot down 
minutes later 
mansour ahmadyan deputy senior air traffic controller in dubai 
said a hot air inversion layer common in the gulf sometimes 
interferes with radio and radar reception at low altitudes he said 
the problem is rare at higher altitudes however and would not 
speculate about what happened last sunday 
us officials said the iranian airliner appeared to be using a 
military transponder a device that helps radars identify planes 
as well as a civilian version ahmadyan said he had no information 
about the airbus but had never seen a civilian aircraft with such 
a transponder on a flight to dubai

a sixday visit by soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev beginning monday provides polish authorities a chance to 
highlight their own restructuring of politics and the economy 
party leaders say it will strengthen proreform forces in poland 
in public statements and private conversations officials have 
expressed delight that gorbachev is arriving fresh from his 
triumphs at a special party congress in moscow and they stress 
parallels between soviet perestroika and polish socialist 
renewal 
soviet perestroika helps polish renewal and vice versa 
said stefan staniszewski polands foreign affairs spokesman 
poland a sometimes unruly communist ally straddling the pathway 
between moscow and western europe is vital to the soviet union 
the trip appears designed mainly to reinforce ties between the two 
countries during an era when each is embarking on dramatic 
political changes 
gorbachev who is personally popular in poland also will be 
working to overcome a traditional antipathy among poles toward 
russians that has existed for centuries 
it is unclear however if he will defuse the single most 
painful issue between the two peoples admitting that soviet forces 
massacred 4000 polish officers in katyn forest in the ukraine in 
1940 
official polish and soviet histories have maintained the 
massacre was committed by the nazis in 1941 contrary to evidence 
in the west and the belief of most poles a polishsoviet 
historical commission charged last year with correcting blank 
spots in history has been reexamining the question amid signals 
that soviet responsibility finally would be acknowledged 
but polish officials prior to gorbachevs arrival were playing 
down the possibility of a dramatic admission by the soviet leader 
saying it is a matter of ongoing research 
gorbachev will say something about the issue generally 
because of polish feelings said one polish official who 
requested anonymity how he will say it we dont know 
since assuming leadership of the communist party of the soviet 
union in 1985 gorbachev has been to poland twice for a party 
conference and a warsaw pact meeting but polish authorities say 
this is his first fullscale ceremonial visit 
in addition to meeting polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
and addressing the sejm or parliament gorbachev will travel south 
to the medieval polish capital of krakow and to the northwestern 
baltic port city of szczecin where he will address shipyard 
workers 
a side trip will take him to the tatra mountain village of 
poronin where vladimir i lenin spent two years in exile from 
czarist russia before returning to lead the bolshevik revolution of 
1917 
gorbachevs wife raisa will visit the former nazi death camp 
of auschwitzbirkenau where 4 million people were murdered before 
the camps liberation by the red army on jan 27 1945 
after the bilateral portion of the trip ends thursday 
gorbachev jaruzelski and party chiefs from the other five warsaw 
pact nations meet for two days in warsaw gorbachev returns to 
moscow on saturday 
squeezed between a recalcitrant apparatus slowing reforms and an 
active opposition movement spearheaded by the outlawed solidarity 
trade union leaders of the communist polish united workers party 
say the visit will provide them a political boost 
it is without doubt that mr gorbachevs stay in poland will 
strengthen those who are aiming at reconstruction said politburo 
member mieczyslaw rakowski at a news conference thursday 
gorbachev is expected to endorse the polish reforms 
undercutting the hardliners traditional reliance on their ties to 
moscow while emphasizing that the party should be the agent of 
change and not outside dissenters 
opposition spokesmen have said the visit will have an important 
effect in determining how far the government can go towards 
political pluralism but rakowski dismissed such expectations 
the question of the opposition is an internal one he said 
the visit will have no influence on the existing relations 
the visit comes two months after a wave of strikes that 
contained echoes of the 198081 labor upheaval in poland and 
gorbachev could use his meeting with shipyard workers in szczecin 
to address the issue of worker demands 
poland is the soviet unions largest east bloc ally putting 
szczecin on the itinerary also underlined polands security 
interest in the alliance 
the city is part of the western territories secured for poland 
from defeated germany at the end of world war ii and official 
propaganda stresses that soviet strength helps guarantee the 
existing borders 
authorities also say they expect gorbachev to speak on eastwest 
relations during the visit

the reagan administration believes 
guerrilla leader prince norodom sihanouk is the key to peace in 
cambodia according to a letter delivered to him friday by 
secretary of state george p shultz 
the letter from president reagan also invited the resistance 
leader to visit washington and reaffirmed us opposition to a 
return to power by the communist khmer rouge said state department 
spokesman charles redman 
shultz and sihanouk who once described the united states as 
cambodias no 1 enemy met for 45 minutes friday in bangkok where 
both attended discussions between the sixmember association of 
southeast asian nations and six allies 
shultz told sihanouk that the united states believed he had a 
central role to play in whatever will be arrived at in 
cambodia redman said 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in 1978 has pledged to withdraw 
all troops by 1990 that would leave a fragile prohanoi government 
facing a threeparty sihanoukled coalition the khmer rouge 
which killed hundreds of thousands of people during its 197578 
rule is considered the strongest force in the antivietnamese 
coalition 
redman declined to say if sihanouk had asked shultz for us 
military aid for his own followers in the coalition washington 
says it supplies only nonmilitary humanitarian assistance 
sihanouk said he was ready to go to jakarta with his coalition 
partners july 25 to take part in informal discussions among the 
warring cambodian factions

the senate voted friday to replace a district 
of columbia rule requiring city employees to live in the nations 
capital with a hiring plan giving preference to city residents 
modifying earlier house action that killed the residency rule 
the senate approved by voice vote an amendment offered by sen 
john warner rva that would direct the city to adopt a 
preferential hiring plan by may 1 1989 and implement the law by 
sept 30 1989 or else forfeit federal money used to enforce the 
requirement 
the amendment crafted in a flurry of talks late thursday and 
early friday between warner and sens barbara mikulski dmd and 
paul sarbanes dmd came as the senate debated the districts 
32 billion budget for the 1989 fiscal year which begins oct 1 
the city is slated to receive 4305 million in federal money in 
1989 to compensate for taxexempt property the federal government 
occupies and the public services it receives 
congressional involvement in the citys residency requirement 
was sparked by concerns that the law was restricting police hiring 
while crime was on the increase opponents charged that congress 
was interfering with the citys right to selfgovernance 
rep stanford parris rva attached an amendment to the citys 
house appropriations bill on tuesday that eliminated the 8yearold 
residency rule after house democrats removed a preferentialhiring 
clause from the amendment the measure passed the house by a 
246163 margin 
the two bills now go to a housesenate conference to draft a 
compromise version but supporters and opponents of the residency 
requirement both praised the senates action 
opponents of the rule persuaded members of congress that the 
districts high cost of living made it difficult for municipal 
workers to reside in the city leaving crucial positions vacant 
police union officials pointed to a steady decline in police 
department applications in the midst of a recordlevel crime wave 
in the city 
police statistics indicate that crime climbed by 17 percent in 
the first four months of 1988 compared with the same period last 
year and police blame a surge of drugrelated violence for much of 
the record pace of 157 homicides 
there were 107 homicides at this time last year and 228 in all 
of 1987 
supporters of the rule argued that police applications are 
declining nationwide and that the citys residency rule could not 
be blamed for hiring difficulties

a judge rejected a prosecutors plea 
for stiff sentences for seven members of a farm family who ran an 
elaborate marijuana farm 
in montanas early days district judge chan ettien said 
thursday more than one rancher saved the family homestead by the 
manufacture and sale of moonshine whiskey 
the richard kurth family said it ran the hightech farm to pay 
off farm debts 
he said the evil of marijuana use does not approach that of 
alcohol and noted an expanding argument that marijuana should 
be decriminalized 
ettien sentenced richard kurth to 20 years in prison with 15 
years suspended kurths wife was sentenced to five years with the 
judge saying she should be held accountable for involving her 
children 
the other five members of the family the kurths children and 
their spouses were given suspended or deferred sentences 
deferred sentences carry no permanent criminal record 
chouteau county attorney tom sheehy proposed 30 years for kurth 
10 years for his wife 10 for one child and suspended felony 
sentences with some local jail time for the others 
sheehy described the marijuana operation as a 
controlledgrowing situation of essentially greenhouse quality 
with timed lights and electronic watering and insecticide spraying 
systems 
just before the october 1987 raid on the farm the family had 
begun manufacturing hashish oil from the plants he said 
over two years the family took in about 400000 for the 
marijuana sheehy said law enforcement officials who raided the 
farm estimated the street value of the drugs at 3 million to 5 
million 
the kurths have maintained throughout the case that they got 
into the marijuana business in an attempt to pay off debts on their 
farm property 
officials estimated that with good behavior richard kurth 
would spend about one year in prison while his wife would spend 
about two months 
the sentences brought some angry reaction from the farming 
community of fort benton where the kurths ran their operation 
we might as well go out and pull up our gardens and plant 
pot bev dollar said were safer doing that than drinking 
beer 
mary lynn knudsen who is involved in a local drug task force 
said the sentences send a message to teenagers that just about 
anybody could grow marijuana and its ok justice wasnt done

president lee tenghui was elected 
chairman of the ruling nationalist party on friday in a vote that 
strengthens his power in the factional leadership that followed the 
chiang kaishek family dynasty 
lee is the first native taiwanese to lead the party in its 
94yearhistory 
the 65yearold lee was elected at a congress of the party 
known as the kuomintang which was formed in 1894 on mainland china 
and still claims to be the legitimate ruler of all china the 
nationalists fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the 
communists 
lee follows sun yatsen chiang kaishek and his son chiang 
chingkuo as party leader he became president and acting party 
leader upon the death of chiang chingkuo on jan 13 
the congress also received a discussion paper on china policy 
issued by party leaders that proposed only a limited relaxation of 
civilian contacts with the mainland last year a ban on travel to 
mainland china was lifted so taiwan residents could visit relatives 
overshadowing the official business of the congress however 
was the surprise appearance of aging madame chiang kaishek who 
received an emotional standing ovation from the nearly 1200 
delegates 
madame chiang who is at least 87 and rarely appears in public 
sat on the stage as party secretarygeneral lee huan read her 
statement praising elderly party comrades set to retire and urging 
the nationalists not to forget their goal of reunifying china 
we are facing a critical moment as our senior members are 
retiring and are succeeded by the new blood she said in the 
statement reminding delegates the old guards contribution to 
the party and the state should never be ignored 
wearing a white traditional chinese dress and black vest she 
shook hands with lee tenghui before leaving the stage 
all but eight of the 1184 delegates attending fridays session 
stood up to support lees nomination jaw shaukong a young 
nationalist lawmaker did not stand because he wanted a secret 
ballot as an expression of democractic change from past practice 
the congress is the first in which delegates were not picked by 
top party officials and in which the central committee election 
will not be restricted to candidates proposed by the party leader 
the selection of lee is the first of several crucial personnel 
moves to be made new faces are expected in the partys 
policymaking central standing committee and the cabinet as some 
oldguard kuomintang conservatives from the chinese mainland step 
down 
during nearly 40 years of the kuomintangs authoritarian rule 
taiwan developed into an exportfueled economic powerhouse chiang 
chingkuo in his final years also introduced democratic change by 
lifting martial law and allowing opposition political parties 
lee has vowed to continue the democratic trend and also supports 
reforming the statedominated financial system and other 
liberalizing moves 
polls have shown lee to be immensely popular as the first native 
taiwanese to lead the country native taiwanese ethnic chinese 
whose families settled in taiwan before 1949 account for about 85 
percent of its nearly 20 million people 
lees popularity and his efforts not to alienate conservatives 
have helped increase his influence as he deals with powerful 
nationalist mainlanders including lee huan premier yu kuohwa and 
gen hau peitsun chief of the military general staff 
in beijing chinas communist party chief zhao ziyang sent 
congratulations to lee saying he hoped it would lead to 
reunification the official xinhua news agency said 
taiwan has rebuffed beijings overtures to reunify under a one 
country two system program

the california shield law doesnt exempt 
journalists from giving eyewitness accounts when called on to 
testify an appeals court ruled 
arguments by lawyers from the los angeles times that a reporter 
and photographer were protected from disclosing unpublished 
information regarding an arrest they witnessed were unanimously 
rejected thursday by the threejustice 2nd appellate district court 
in los angeles 
reversing a superior court ruling the justices said reporters 
have the same duty as any bystander if called to testify about what 
they witnessed in public 
i think the shield law was never intended to protect news 
reporters said gerry ensley a long beach deputy city 
prosecutor it was intended to protect reporters confidential 
sources 
in cases where reporters arent protecting confidential sources 
there is no basis to differentiate the newspersons observation 
of the event from that of any other citizen said the opinion 
written by justice robert devich 
the ruling takes effect 30 days from thursday 
times general counsel william niese said a request for a state 
supreme court review was likely 
if reporters are converted into automatic witnesses the 
ability of reporters to retain their objectivity and be objective 
witnesses would be seriously undermined niese said 
the case stemmed from the prosecution of a long beach man for 
alleged possession of brass knuckles in september 1986 
sean patrick delaney 21 contended that police never asked his 
permission to search his jacket pocket where officers allegedly 
found the weapon 
reporter roxana kopetman and former photographer roberto 
santiago bertero witnessed the search and arrest but their news 
account did not mention whether officers asked such permission 
called to testify in municipal court ms kopetman and bertero 
declined to answer questions about whether permission was requested 
they contended that since the information wasnt included in the 
story the shield law protected them from having to answer both 
were found in contempt of court

an austrian won israels 
first international balloon race friday capping a threeday event 
in which more than 40 balloons glided through skies and israeli 
fighter planes buzzed overhead 
first place earned hubert kusternigg 4000 
bill arras of redmond ore and wallace henderson of vienna 
va took second and third places at the international hot air 
balloon goodwill fiesta organized as part of israels 40th 
anniversary celebration 
about 40000 spectators braved scorching heat and dust clouds to 
watch the colorful 70foot balloons which floated thousands of 
feet above israels southern negev desert 
on one balloon competitor ron bush rose to about 5000 feet in 
a blue and white striped balloon and then got stuck during a lull 
in the wind 
bush 48 of lubbock texas didnt seem worried when he saw 
that he was far from the target and not moving any closer 
its peaceful up here he said pushing his stetson to the 
back of his neck im doing this for fun not to win 
competitions 
the calm was interrupted several times by israeli fighter planes 
which flew loops around the balloonists sometimes buzzing them 
from only 200 feet awaythe planes flew in formation spewing blue 
and white smoke israels national colors 
fortyone people participated in the race including 19 from the 
united states and competitors from canada france hungary and west 
germany 
the competitors were graded on how close they came to a certain 
target 
spectators thronged the balloonists between races asking 
technical questions and pleading to be taken for a ride 
balloonist alfred riesser 40 of vienna austria said his most 
enjoyable moment came when the wind carried him into a nearby 
bedouin tent village 
a little boy was so afraid that at first he threw a stone and 
then screamed for his dad riesser said the adults also didnt 
come near us but then we handed out some stickers with a picture 
of the balloon and that broke the ice 
ted ohara 44 an insurance agent from schenectady ny said 
he was startled thursday when two men armed with submachine guns 
rushed to the landing site as he touched down 
it turned out they were spectators trying to help him steady the 
balloon he said 
ohara said he was not conerned about his safety in israel 
despite a sevenmonth wave of clashes between arabs and jews 
i heard theres been shooting in jerusalem for the last couple 
of days but i still think its safer than in some parts of new york

the federal government has for a third 
time denied aid to residents affected by the may 4 explosion at the 
pacific engineering plant 
gov richard bryan said thursday he was informed that the third 
request for aid was turned down by the federal emergency management 
agency because insurance covered most of the 73 million in 
property damage caused by the explosions henderson officials have 
estimated uninsured damage at 20 million 
i was disappointed and a bit frustrated bryan said the 
federal government makes an appeal to our patriotism which 
nevadans respond to and then when a problem arises of this nature 
the federal government says these are problems you have to take 
elsewhere 
city manager gary bloomquist said he was upset that the federal 
government would help rebuild the plant while denying help to those 
who suffered damage 
the fact is the plant damaged many people in the area and now 
the federal government is going to see it is rebuilt again 
bloomquist said thats not reasonable 
the blast killed two people and injured 326 
the government has agreed to pay surcharges on the ammonium 
perchlorate produced by pacfic engineering to assist in rebuilding 
the plant company officials have indicated they will rebuild 
outside the las vegas valley 
ammonium perchlorate is a key ingredient in solid rocket fuel 
used in the space shuttle and military rockets the kerrmcgee 
plant in henderson is the only facility in the us producing the 
rocket fuel oxidizer 
bryan said he would continue to make state services available 
and urged congress to create a special fund to compensate victims 
of such disasters 
the cause of the blast remains under investigation

the explosion and fire that destroyed the piper 
alpha oil rig wednesday night was the worlds worst oilfield 
disaster claiming 166 lives this is a reconstruction compiled 
from official logs and interviews with survivors 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the men from the 12hour day shift 
were going to bed on the piper alpha oil platform and derek 
ellington was in the control room he heard a gas leak screaming 
like a banshee 
it was 931 pm wednesday in the north sea 120 miles from 
scotland thirty seconds later an explosion and fire began 
devouring the platform which had 230 men aboard 
not until 27 minutes after the initial explosion did word reach 
the mainland the aberdeen coast guard picked up a distress signal 
from the supply vessel lowland cavalier near the manmade island 
which was 649 feet tall twothirds submerged and supported by 
steel stilts planted in the seabed 
four minutes later at 1002 eoin kerr a telecommunications 
officer in scotland heard a man say from the piper alpha the 
radio rooms on fire were abandoning the rig 
kerr heard nothing more 
within one minute of the first distress call royal air force 
rescue helicopters scrambled and a nimrod reconnaissance aircraft 
headed to the scene 
there was a big bang and i knew there had been an explosion 
said james mcdonald 50 who managed to get off the piper alpha 
the rig was plunged into darkness 
he and some others tried to leave the crews quarters but the 
flames were shooting into the doors for about threequarters 
of an hour we were sitting inside nobody seemed to know what to 
do 
the nimrod pilot garfield porter could see the horizon stained 
orange with fire from 80 miles away approaching at 15000 feet 
the whole area was lit up and the flames were very high into the 
sky he said 
helicopter pilots said they felt the heat from more than a mile 
away choppers swept in low and dropped ropes to survivors in the 
water 
a converted trawler on standby duty lowered lifeboats that 
collected 37 survivors a lifeboat from the support ship sandhaven 
vanished into the flames 
fire spread rapidly turning metal girders redhot and bringing 
decks crashing down in halfmolten heaps 
the men faced a hard choice stay aboard and hope aid got to 
them before the flames or jump into a sea that was cold enough 
below the burning oil to kill them even on a clear summer night 
the water temperature was 57 degrees 
burning oil was spreading across the few bare patches of water 
remaining and the decision had to be made quickly 
i decided to get myself out mcdonald said i wasnt going 
to sit down and get burned to death you either stayed where 
you were and burned to death or you tried to get out 
roy carey an instrument technician said it was a case of 
fry and die or jump and try 
mcdonald said he had to push past other men clogging the 
stairways then through the flames onto the drill deck which was 
not yet burning he slithered down a pipe and dropped the last few 
feet into the water 
when he looked up the only thing standing was the drill 
derrick there was no accommodation living deck no rig no 
helideck just flames coming shooting out of the sea 
carey dived 50 feet into the water debris showered down and 
bodies floated past him i found my head was being cooked he 
said i had to keep ducking down to get it cool 
the coast guard appealed for ships to help the 15 helicopters 
and 30 responded including a sixship nato task force that radioed 
at 1036 it was breaking off maneuvers to join the search 
a supply and support vessel the tharos sprayed the fire with 
seawater but the only result was clouds of steam 
there was nothing anybody could do said tony sinnett who 
watched from the tharos it was like the platform had been hit by 
an atomic bomb 
porter the reconnaissance pilot said the flames shot hundreds 
of feet into the sky 
at 1130 pm lifeboats had picked up 25 survivors the crews 
quarters were an inferno 
windows and the emergency door were cracking under the intense 
heat there must have been at least 100 men in there said harry 
calder 35 
it was sheer panic a lot of guys were lying on the floor 
just trying to breathe we had towels and we were just dipping them 
in anything to help us breathe 
he managed to get out but believes all the others died 
at 1124 the tharos radioed that underwater explosions of 
escaping gas were forcing it to retreat at three minutes after 
midnight it said everyone likely to have survived had been picked 
up 
the search continued occidental petroleum which owns the 
platform said the last of 64 survivors was rescued at 305 am 
at 1246 am the living quarters sank beneath the sea when the 
nato ships arrived next morning there was nothing left to do but 
search for bodies 
seventeen had been found by friday night 
only about onequarter of the rig remained standing thick 
support girders were bent double and flames still flickered on the 
wreck 
in aberdeen kay harney watched the scenes on television and 
remembered the telephone call wednesday night from her boyfriend 
eddie crowden 
he said he was bored with his job of checking lifeboats and 
safety equipment on the piper alpha 
that was at 925 pm 
eddie crowdens name was not on the list of survivors

dudley moores lovable drunk in arthur 
returns in the sequel arthur 2 on the rocks just as lovable 
but not quite as drunk 
moore who won an oscar nomination for his portrayal of the 
pickled millionaire arthur bach said his approach to the character 
this time was different because of a heightened awareness of 
alcoholism 
there was no official pressure from the studio or from any 
organized groups moore said in a recent interview but i 
personally have an educated awareness of the problem and there 
were discussions on how aware we should make arthur it was 
difficult to decide but eventually we decided to make him aware 
the producers also avoided any scenes in arthur 2 on the 
rocks of arthur drinking and driving unlike the original in 
which arthur is seen cruising in his rolls royce swigging from a 
bottle 
theres a scene in which linda liza minnelli says she never 
lets him drink and drive moore said and you can tell that 
arthur knows exactly what he should or should not do he still gets 
very drunk but thats because he feels panicked and isolated 
sometimes and unable to cope with the world 
moore is quick to point out however that the film doesnt 
preach 
we never intended to make a documentary moore said 
arthurs behavior doesnt have to mirror real life 
the sequel opened friday at theaters nationwide

irans small fleet of f14 fighters has 
become one focus of attention in the investigation of why the us 
missile cruiser vincennes shot down an iranian airliner with 290 
people aboard 
the pentagon has said transponder signals from the iran air 
airbus a300 civilian aircraft caused the warship to mistake it for 
an iranian f14 
the americanbuilt fighters called the tomcat are part of a 
depleted inventory of combatready warplanes that iran has used 
sparingly in its war with iraq 
the swingwing interceptors were one of the most advanced 
aircraft in the world when about 80 of them were sold to shah 
mohammed reza pahlavis air force in the mid1970s 
after nearly eight years of warfare tehrans f14 force was 
believed to have dwindled to fewer than 10 operational aircraft 
according to some military analysts 
us officials put their numbers somewhat higher in the 
teens and have said in recent days that the force may have been 
increased by irans success in acquiring badly needed spare parts 
the grumman aircraft saw combat action in 1985 since then it 
has been used primarily for its powerful radar systems that can 
alert other iranian fighters to the approach of iraqi warplanes 
the operational area of the f14s was around irans kharg island 
oil terminal in the northern persian gulf and over the coastal 
sealanes used by tehrans oil shuttle tankers carrying oil from 
kharg to the larak island terminal in the strait of hormuz 
on feb 9 iran claimed it shot down three iraqi jets during a 
raid on kharg 
days later us assistant defense secretary richard armitage 
disclosed in a pentagon briefing that one iraqi aircraft was shot 
down by an f14 using a usmade sidewinder airtoair missile 
he said it was the f14s first effective use in combat that 
weve seen in several months 
us officials said recently that some of the f14s had been 
shifted from the northern gulf to the big military base at bandar 
abbas on the strait of hormuz 
it was from bandar abbas that the iran air airbus took off last 
sunday 
us sources who spoke on condition they not to be named said 
friday that the transfer of f14s from bushehr to bandar abbas may 
have been motivated by iraqs devastating longrange air strike on 
may 14 on the larak island terminal in the strait where 
international tankers pick up the oil brought south from kharg 
in that raid the worlds biggest ship the seawise giant which 
iran uses as a storage and transfer tanker and four others were 
damaged 
the f14s were airborne in the skies around the strait in the 
days prior to the iran air incident but had not taken part in any 
combat action as interceptors equipped with airtoair missiles 
they are not designed for ttacks on ships 
in addition to the f14s iran has some aging f4 phantoms and 
some f5s acquired from the united states during the shahs regime 
although they watch the aircraft carefully us warships in the 
gulf have not faced many serious threats from irans warplanes the 
iranian fighters generally give the americans a wide berth and 
observe good radio protocol when challenged us officers say 
us commanders have worried most about iraqi pilots 
particularly in view of the may 17 1987 attack on the missile 
frigate stark by an iraqi mirage in which 37 american crewmen 
died washington officially accepted iraqs explanation that the 
attack was a mistake 
several subsequent incidents including one in which a us 
missile cruiser richmond k turner came within a second of shooting 
down three iraqi warplanes led the two governments to work out 
procedures to protect us warships from another iraqi attack in 
the northern gulf 
us officials said they had no information to support a 
published report that another us missile cruiser the halsey had 
fired a flare in a brush with two iranian f14s on july 2 the day 
before the airbus disaster 
this is the first weve heard of the halsey firing a flare or 
any of those other details said one source who has access to 
operational reports and spoke on condition he not be named 
the pentagon on thursday released the transcript of a radio 
exchange between the halsey on station in the northern gulf and 
an iranian f14 on that same day 
the brief exchange was presented by the us officials to show 
that the iranians routinely respond to such queries from the us 
navy ships in the gulf 
the pentagon says the vincennes and another us ship issued 12 
warnings to the iran air jetliner before it was shot down 
there have been some reports in the aftermath of the tragedy 
that the two sides do not routinely communicate by radio

a judge has forbidden the city to hire 
firefighters while the state investigates complaints that physical 
tests for the job discriminate against women 
ramsey county judge joanne smith issued a temporary injunction 
thursday at the request of state human rights commissioner steve 
cooper who said the investigation will take about 45 days smith 
set a hearing on continuation of the injunction for july 14 
the complaints were lodged after none of 17 women who recently 
took the firefighter test passed 
the city already has sent offers of employment to 25 men who 
passed the test before being hired the men must pass medical 
exams and background checks but smith specifically prohibited the 
fire department from following through on the job offers until the 
ban is lifted 
she included six minority men in the ban despite a request by 
the southern minnesota regional legal services that they be allowed 
to take offered jobs 
attorney bruce beneke argued that the minorities should be 
exempt from the injunction because all but one of them were chosen 
under affirmative action hiring rules to reverse racial 
discrimination 
ten women who failed the test filed a discrimination suit 
claiming the test was rigged to favor physical attributes more 
common to men and that the cutoff score was set artificially high 
the cutoff was determined by 45 volunteers now working as 
firefighters who have good excellent or superior physical ratings 
firefighters in poorer condition and men in higher ranks were not 
allowed to participate in the socalled norming test 
women who work as firefighters in nearby minneapolis also were 
not allowed to volunteer 
st paul fire chief steve conroy said he has 19 openings in his 
414firefighter department and expects six more through 
retirements within the next six months 
twentyfive is a good percent of the department he said 
its bound to affect the overall operation some way it may be 
the difference between four men that we normally have on each truck 
and three men if we dont get replacements 
but the shortage would likely become a financial burden to the 
city before public safety would be threatened he said wed have 
to go to the city for authorization to bring men in on overtime on 
their time off

jesse jackson ensuring he arrives in atlanta 
amid fanfare will lead a bus tour to the democratic national 
convention that will name michael dukakis its 1988 standardbearer 
the threeday jackson action rainbow express from chicago to 
atlanta will make three stops for large projackson rallies along 
the way and will undoubtedly add to the thousands of jackson 
supporters who already were expected to show up in atlanta 
many will have no official access to the convention so the 
campaign is planning to occupy them with a series of rallies and 
forums with an eye toward consolidating a progressive coalition 
jackson hopes to lead in the future 
although jackson is not setting up the bus tour as a caravan 
vehicles are expected to join along the way said spokeswoman pam 
smith 
its a way of involving people this is a people campaign 
she said 
more than 1100 of the jackson troops in atlanta will be 
delegates but others are going south to show support for the 
runnerup candidate 
and some in those ranks are not happy with the way the 
democratic picture is turning out for this election 
while jackson pledging to be a democratic ticket team player 
has said he wants no disruption of the convention they may not be 
as muted on disagreements with the party platform or a possible 
rejection of jackson by dukakis as a running mate 
jackson has a very heavy burden as he tries to balance among 
what the different constituencies expect of him said eleanor 
holmes norton a former carter administration official now heading 
jacksons platform team 
some want to see jackson as vice president others cant 
conceive of him in any other role than presidential nominee 
while still others are looking toward his leadership of a new 
progressive coalition norton noted 
it is not known whether the disgruntled will adhere to what 
jacksons delegate coordinator joseph gardner says are the the 
watchwords for the convention discipline detail and hope 
floor debate over jackson platform proposals will be 
constructive not destructive he said 
despite such reassurances grumbling among some jackson 
supporters is just beneath the surface 
at least one street demonstration not officially sanctioned by 
the campaign is planned by rep gus savage a longtime jackson 
friend and ally 
savages staff declined to comment on the intent but 
indications were the rally will call on dukakis to choose jackson 
for his running mate 
walda katz fishman a washington supporter and sociologist at 
howard university is organizing a small group of people to travel 
to atlanta she said that in addition to attending jackson campaign 
events she will join in protests by other progressive groups that 
might be more critical of the democrats 
many people thought jackson was really saying something now 
theyre kind of being told well all that was just for show 
she said 
on the vice presidential question jacksons own words have 
inflamed supporters passions as he has repeatedly touted his 
qualifications for the post 
ron walters a howard university political scientist and 
consultant to jacksons campaign said some people have 
expressed the sentiment they will not vote if jackson is not on the 
ticket 
however he said theres some way to salvage that if 
dukakis comes up with something important like adopting some of 
jacksons economic positions 
many jackson backers are disgruntled about the 
dukakiscontrolled platform which walters called exceedingly 
vague he said it will shock a lot of people who wanted to 
see in the platform a substantial view of their own interest and 
constituency 
jackson has filed a dozen minority planks and will decide which 
ones to take to a floor fight 
among his most controversial proposals are a call for a nofirst 
use nuclear policy support for a palestinian state a military 
budget freeze and a tax hike on the wealthy and corporations

a us decision to delay immigration of soviet 
refugees brought bitter disappointment friday to armenians who have 
waited for years to join relatives in america 
we moved out of our apartments our homes said mushegh 
sarafyan one of about 50 armenians huddled on a street next to the 
us embassy we sold our clothes and quit our jobs and now we 
are left practically on the street 
sarafyan and the others had come to moscow from their southern 
republic earlier in the week expecting to receive permission to 
travel to the united states 
but embassy spokeswoman marguerite squire said the us 
consulate on monday stopped processing soviet refugees most of 
whom are armenians for travel to the united states 
we want to emphasize this is only a postponement of 
departure us ambassador jack matlock told reporters 
matlock said the us government had run out of money to 
resettle soviet refugees for this fiscal year which ends sept 30 
the process is to resume oct 1 when a new fiscal year begins ms 
squire said 
the embassy in june gave permission to a record 2063 soviets 
94 percent of whom are armenians to immigrate to the united 
states that was more than all of fiscal year 1987 
the us government has made soviet emigration restrictions a 
key human rights issue in relations between the two countries and 
the soviets have eased their policy to permit thousands of citizens 
who claim family ties in the west to leave the country 
we are ready to start a new life in a new country and what 
happens asked sarafyan already they are deceiving us 
the 50 armenians said they had received permission after months 
or years of waiting from the soviet government to emigrate many 
hoping to join relatives in los angeles los angeles has a large 
armenian population and californias governor republican george 
deukmejian is of armenian descent 
the armenians said they had sent telegrams protesting the delay 
to deukmejian and secretary of state george p shultz 
armenia in the caucasus mountains has been the scene of 
strikes rallies and violence since february as residents demand 
control of nagornokarabakh a region now part of neighboring 
azerbaijan republic 
the delay affects any soviet applying to the embassy for 
political asylum in the united states other than armenians the 
other major group emigrating soviet jews generally leave the 
soviet union on israeli visas and many then pick up us visas in 
western europe 
sarafyan said the armenian families now have no place to stay 
and few belongings for the threemonth wait 
matlock called the delays very regrettable and said the 
embassy was trying to warn other soviets scheduled for departure 
interviews of the holdup 
from oct 1 1987 to this sept 30 the embassy expects to 
grant 9500 soviets mostly armenians permission to resettle in 
the united states from oct 1 1986 to sept 30 1987 1800 
immigration requests were approved

britain announced friday it had signed its 
biggestever arms deal with saudi arabia supplanting the united 
states as the major arms supplier to the oilrich kingdom 
a defense ministry statement gave no details but official 
sources said the deal which includes mine sweepers and some 50 
tornado fighters was worth more than 17 billion that dwarfed a 
75 billion contract won by britain in 1986 to supply saudi arabia 
with 72 tornado fighters and other aircraft 
the ministry statement said the deal signed sunday in a 
memorandum of understanding was a new phase of the previous 
contract and involved the supply of additional aircraft a 
construction program and specialized navy vessels 
it included an economic offset program the statement said 
apparently meaning an agreement to step up british investment in 
saudi arabia 
in the saudi capital of riyadh a brief official saudi statement 
confirmed a deal was signed that would provide significant 
enhancement of the existing defense capabilities of saudi arabia 
the deal a huge boost for the british armaments industry in the 
next decade followed years of british lobbying 
unlike the us administration prime minister margaret 
thatchers government is not constrained by lawmakers protesting 
that weapons sales to saudi arabia may endanger or offend israel 
official sources said the agreement involved the supply of 50 to 
60 tornado aircraft 50 to 60 hawk jet training aircraft six mine 
sweepers for use in the persian gulf 90 helicopters weapons 
systems and the construction of two tornado bases 
the contract also included several civil aircraft for use by the 
saudi royal family said the sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
british aerospace lead contractor for the tornados which it 
manufacturers with west german and italian companies also will 
build the two tornado bases the sources said the bases will be at 
dhahran to cover oil installations in the persian gulf and near 
the saudi capital riyadh the sources said 
the other major british companies involved are westland 
helicopters and vosper thorneycroft makers of sandown class mine 
sweepers 
british sources said the saudis have ordered westlands new 
black hawk helicopter 
defense sources said detailed contracts for the whole package 
still had to be negotiated 
legislator sir antony buck chairman of the governing 
conservative partys defense committee said the agreement was an 
important breakthrough especially as the various pieces of 
equipment were in hot competition from the french and others 
britain has a long history of arms links with saudi arabia and 
mrs thatcher has cultivated the relationship since coming to power 
in 1979 
this included apologizing in 1980 to saudi arabia after 
television companies refused to bow to british government pressure 
not to screen a film death of a princess the fictional story 
about the execution of a saudi princess and her lover offended the 
saudi authorities

the pentagon the governments largest agency 
is having a difficult time determining how many private consultants 
it employs because it still hasnt properly defined the term 
consultant the defense departments deputy inspector general 
said friday 
as a result the number of consultants and the total value of 
their contracts is likely to continue to be underreported derek j 
vander schaaf told the senate governmental affairs federal service 
subcommittee 
vander schaaf told the panel that the pentagon recently 
overhauled its administrative system for overseeing consultants 
but that new regulations to implement the changes have not yet been 
published and that field audit personnel had not been 
adequately trained in the application of the consulting service 
definitions 
the general accounting office a congressional watchdog agency 
recently reported that the pentagon spent 28 billion to 188 
billion on consultants in fiscal year 1987 the pentagon reported 
spending only 155 million 
sen david pryor dark chairman of the subcommittee agreed 
with vander schaaf that part of the pentagons problem in tracking 
down all its consultants is the definition of the term 
consultants pryor said can be called contract employees or a 
variety of other titles 
the hearing did not focus on the ongoing criminal investigation 
of pentagon fraud and bribery that probe centers on allegations 
that defense contractors and consultants many of them former 
military men bribed pentagon officials for contracting details 
that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
however pryor did say that he was angry about the pentagons 
handling of its apparent procurement problems 
the pentagon public relations machine is working overtime to 
minimize dodge shift blame and squirm he said they say the 
system is great 
as a citizen im not only outraged he said im ashamed 
as a senator for being a part of an institution that knows the 
problem but has been impotent to change it im ashamed of us for 
not standing on our desk tops and demanding some public hangings 
pryors statement in turn angered sen ted stevens ralaska 
the ranking republican on the panel 
theres no reason to malign distinguished public servants 
stevens told pryor 
part of the problem stevens said is that the question of 
what or what is not a consultant contract needs to be settled 
sen alan dixon dill meanwhile introduced a bill on friday 
that would strengthen the position of undersecretary of defense for 
acquisition the measure centralizes authority within that office 
whereas all four services currently have wideranging authority to 
sign contracts 
we must do everything possible to correct the inherent 
inefficiencies of the current system and to reduce the potential 
for abuse dixon said 
meantime at the house armed service committee two former 
pentagon acquisition officials differed about the need for new 
legislation to fix the procurement system 
richard delauer undersecretary for research and engineering 
during the first term of the reagan administration opposed new 
legislation 
if you would support defense secretary frank carlucci in the 
next four months and let him find out whats wrong with it we 
could make some changes delauer said hes got the muscle and 
is not afraid of stepping on toes 
delauer described the system as sick and added dont ask 
me to give it a grade 
but james wade assistant secretary for acquisition in 198586 
proposed that a law be passed to establish a single civilian 
defense acquisition corps with procurement authority over all 
the services 
i think the bureaucracy fights change wade testified the 
system is failing and getting worse were not going to make 
structural changes in the heat of a political campaign more 
tinkering at the margins will actually hurt the system 
delauer also criticized former defense secretary caspar 
weinberger saying cap did not have an interest in really 
understanding in depth the whole procurement process it was not 
his interest and he did not understand it and he delegated and 
unfortunately he delegated it to anybody who would pick it up

independent counsel james mckay concluded 
attorney general edwin meese iii could have been charged in 
connection with his holdings of 14000 in regional bell telephone 
stock but decided against prosecution national public radio 
reported friday 
npr quoted unidentified sources as saying meeses lawyers were 
told toward the end of the 14month investigation that at least 
technically mckay determined meese could have been charged with 
two felonies npr said it could not determine what mckays reasons 
were for not proceeding with a criminal case 
nathan lewin and james rocap meeses attorneys declined to 
discuss the npr report saying in a statement that mckays decision 
not to prosecute meese is in every real sense a vindication 
of the attorney general 
the statement added that the avenue by which mckay arrived 
at that result or the rationale he employed is entirely beside the 
point 
federal law prohibits any official from participating personally 
and substantially in any matter in which he or his family has a 
financial interest sources familiar with the probe speaking on 
condition of anonymity have said mckay was examining a possible 
violation by meese against the provisions of this federal 
conflictofinterest law 
meese met in 1985 and 1986 with executives of four regional bell 
companies which wanted the justice department to switch its 
position and urge that restrictions on the types of business they 
could engage in be lifted early in 1987 a few weeks after he 
obtained a white house waiver allowing him to make a decision 
despite his stock holdings meese approved a reversal of justice 
department stand recommending to a federal judge that the regional 
bell companies be allowed to enter new lines of business 
meeses waiver granted by the white house counsels office was 
based partly on erroneous information supplied by one of meeses 
aides justice department sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity have said meeses office underestimated the value of 
the stock saying it was worth 9600 instead of 14000 
in granting the waiver the white house counsels office 
mischaracterized meese as having sold the stock in fact meese had 
transferred the stock to someone else as a meese aide had 
explained to the departments office of legal counsel which 
supplied the white house with the information on which the waiver 
was based meese was still the legal owner of the stock a number 
of legal experts said earlier this year in fact the attorney 
general finally retrieved his telephone holdings last year and sold 
them 
the person to whom the stock had been transferred was meeses 
investment manager w franklyn chinn who is currently under 
indictment for racketeering in the wedtech scandal 
also in granting the waiver the white house counsels office 
told meese that you indicate that you have no financial interest 
in or immediate family relationship with the new owner of the 
stock in fact meese and his wife had entered a partnership with 
chinns corporation 
mckays office filed an 830page report tuesday on his criminal 
investigation of meese which remains under seal hours later 
meese announced he was resigning effective in late july or early 
august 
mckays report has been referred to the justice department 
office of solicitor general charles fried who has the authority to 
send it to the departments office of professional responsibility 
opr which investigates alleged improper activity inside the 
justice department could then conduct an ethics review of meeses 
activities 
department spokesman mark sheehan declined to comment when asked 
whether fried had sent the report to opr the washington times 
reported that the report was sent to that office thursday 
the federal appeals court panel which appointed mckay issued an 
order wednesday directing that copies of the report be sent to 
fried and to meeses lawyers the order which is under seal 
contained language saying the recipients of the report were to 
discuss the contents with no one according to sources familiar 
with the probe the court issued a clarification thursday also 
under seal specifying that sending the report to fried was a 
formal referral enabling the solicitor general to share the report 
with opr if he thought that step was necessary

cambodian resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk said friday that his antivietnamese ally the 
khmer rouge opposes an international peacekeeping force in 
cambodia because it wants to retake power 
sihanouk said the communist khmer rouge and its enemy the 
vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia have the same stand 
they are opposed to the sending of an international peacekeeping 
force after a political settlement of the 9yearold war 
why because the khmer rouge they want to retake power to 
take our cambodia like they did in april 1975 after the departure 
of foreign troops 
sihanouk talked to reporters after meeting with us secretary 
of state george p shultz the two men were in bangkok for 
consultations between foreign ministers of the association of 
southeast asian nations and western allies 
shultz gave sihanouk a letter from president reagan declaring 
that the prince has a central role in a cambodian settlement and 
the khmer rouge must not return said state department spokesman 
charles redman reagan assured sihanouk the united states will 
continue to pressure vietnam until all its troops leave cambodia 
redman said 
fears of a khmer rouge return to power have heightened as 
vietnam has begun a claimed withdrawal of 50000 troops and the 
khmer rouge has been reported storing arms for an offensive 
the khmer rouge seized power with the fall of the usbacked 
lon nol government in 1975 and killed hundreds of thousands of 
people until vietnam invaded in late 1978 
the khmer rouge is now the most powerful group in a threeparty 
guerrilla coalition headed by sihanouk 
during this weeks consultations japan announced it would 
consider funding an international peacekeeping force sihanouk said 
friday that the united nations must dispatch a strong enough force 
to prevent the khmer rouge from taking our cambodia 
sihanouk said it wasnt possible to disarm the khmer rouges 
40000 troops because the main source of weapons china was not in 
favor of that 
he favors forming a national army comprising the three guerrilla 
groups and the prohanoi government 
the prince charged that vietnam also wanted the khmer rouge to 
return to power so it could again invade cambodia after its stated 
plan to pull out by 1990 and tell world leaders that it was 
preventing a khmer rouge takeover 
shultz met friday with prime minister prem tinsulanonda of 
thailand which gives sanctuary to khmer rouge guerrillas and they 
agreed that the khmer rouge should not be allowed to have a 
leading role in a future government radio thailand said 
also friday sihanouk and indonesias foreign minister ali 
alatas said they would attend peace talks on cambodia planned for 
july 25 despite vietnams threats to cancel its pledge to 
participate the talks in indonesias capital of jakarta would be 
the first to involve all the warring parties

the state department accused congress on 
friday of causing confusion about us ties to arab countries by 
seeking to strip potent missiles from f18 jet fighters being sold 
to kuwait 
concern that the airtoground mavericks could be used against 
israel prompted the senate on thursday to remove the missiles from 
the 18 billion arms purchase by the persian gulf state 
withholding the missiles would make the jets ineffective 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
moreover she said it creates confusion about the 
direction of us policy in the gulf congress and the 
administration have long encouraged our friends in the gulf to 
share more of the burden of defending the region consequently we 
are concerned about this situation 
the state department in the past few weeks has also voiced 
concern about the proliferation of missiles in the gulf and the 
middle east 
but mrs oakley said the airtofround mavericks ticketed for 
kuwait were not in the same category as ballistic rockets and did 
not pose a threat to peace clearly weve supplied various 
missiles in defense of our national interest she said 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater described 
president reagan as dismayed at the precipitate action taken by 
the senate 
he said the senate action taken in a matter of minutes 
without the benefit of committee hearings or deliberation is 
unfortunate and damaging to us foreign policy interests 
congress has repeatedly asked what the gulf states are doing 
for their own defense he said kuwait has answered that they 
wish do more and have indicated their preference to work with us in 
doing so yet some in the senate apparently wish to reject this 
request and have kuwait turn elsewhere 
the state department has lobbied for congressional support of 
the maverick sale to kuwait as vital to the arab sheikdoms defense 
against iran 
by helping a moderate gulf state assume greater responsibility 
for its own defense it complements our highly successful escort 
operations peter burleigh the deputy secretary for near eastern 
affairs told a house foreign affairs subcommittee thursday 
he referred to the us navys escort of merchant ships carrying 
oil through the persian gulf 
a key congressional opponent of the maverick purchase sen 
arlen specter rpa said arab countries buying us arms should 
be required to renounce the use of force and recognize the right 
of israel to exist 
mrs oakley said the united states would maintain its commitment 
to israel that it have a military margin of safety over the 
combined forces of hostile arab countries 
at the same time she said some of our objectives in the gulf 
are to prove that we are a reliable partner in the legitimate 
selfdefense needs of friendly gulf arab states 
on friday britain announced it would sell saudi arabia 72 
tornado jet fighters and other weapons in a 75 billion deal 
mrs oakley said the united states did not oppose the deal in 
principle but did not know all the vital details including 
whether the british had imposed restrictions to minimize any 
potential threat to israel 
clearly we would have preferred to make these sales 
ourselves she said 
asked if the purchase hurt us interests the spokeswoman said 
of course we think it does hurt american interests we think our 
interests are better served when we can sell legitimate 
selfdefense items to friendly arab countries when we can consult 
with them when we can put the restrictions on them that prevent 
threats to other countries

a boom in summertime work for teenagers 
dropped the nations unemployment rate to a 14year low 53 
percent the government said friday joblessness among black youths 
plummeted more than 6 percentage points to its lowest level on 
record 
the 03 percentage point drop from mays 56 percent jobless 
rate was caused by a seasonally adjusted surge of 820000 people 
threefourths of them youths 16 to 24 years old onto americas 
payrolls the labor department said 
including an unusual decline of 536000 in the number of people 
at work in may employment increases had been averaging only 90000 
a month this year until june 
the governments raw data showed 14 million more teenagers at 
work in june than in may dropping the adjusted unemployment rate 
among them 2 percentage points to 136 percent the lowest since 
early 1970 
among black teens joblessness dropped from 348 percent in may 
to 284 percent last month the lowest since the government began 
keeping separate data on them in 1972 and the first time since late 
1973 that it has dipped below 30 percent 
analysts had anticipated a large increase this year in the usual 
number of available summer jobs especially in the tourist 
industry as foreigners taking advantage of the devalued american 
dollar flock to the united states for their vacations 
however some were skeptical that overall job growth and the 
consequent decline in the unemployment rate was as great as it 
appeared in june figures 
anything in the report that deals with summer workers will 
look better than it is said larry chimerine president of the 
wefa group an economic forecasting firm in bala cynwyd pa the 
july report will be the purest indication because thats all 
summer 
the labor department acknowledged its june figures were affected 
in part by the fact its survey was conducted late in the month 
allowing extra time for students graduates and seasonal workers 
to find jobs 
as a result according to chimerine the filters used to 
adjust the total figures treated some of the normal seasonal 
increase as nonsummer employment 
the numbers were good enough for president reagan to claim them 
as solid evidence that his economic policies have worked and 
he put in a thinly veiled plug for vice president george bush 
i predict that 1988 will be a banner year for republicans 
because its a banner year for peace and prosperity in america 
he said as they sit around their kitchen tables more americans 
are planning for their future not desperately searching the want 
ads for jobs 
the numbers were not so good for democratic presidential 
candidate michael dukakis unemployment in the massachusetts 
governors state jumped from 28 percent to 35 percent 
but it was the first time in more than four years that 
massachusetts has not had the lowest unemployment rate of the 
nations 11 largest states its rate in june was equaled by new 
york and exceeded by north carolina where joblessness dropped from 
35 percent in may to 32 percent last month 
nationwide the number of unemployed fell by 328000 in june to 
65 million with teenagers and adult men accounting for all of 
the decline and the percentage of workingage americans holding 
jobs climbed to 623 percent an alltime high matched only once 
before in april 
construction employment rose by 55000 and factories added 
45000 new workers 20000 more than their average monthly increase 
from january through may 
there are no signs that a growing economy driven by exports 
and capital equipment investment is slowing down said jerry 
jasinowski chief economist for the national association of 
manufacturers 
jasinowski said manufacturers are begining to run up against 
labor shortages and predicting that if employment growth continues 
at its june pace there will be an acceleration of wage inflation by 
christmas 
some other economists also echoed those fears although there 
was no indication of any wage spike in june average hourly wages 
actually fell by 2 cents to 923 last month after rising at an 
annual rate of 6 percent in april and may 
over the past six months as weve watched the unemployment 
figures weve seen no signs of inflation at this point said 
labor secretary anne mclaughlin

hundreds of government officials gathered on 
friday to map strategy for safeguarding sensitive information 
stored in federal computer systems ranging from desktop models to 
big mainframe facilities 
we must give the federal governments computers a model for 
security and reliability said james burrows director of the 
institute for computer sciences and technology at the national 
bureau of standards 
he spoke to about 700 officials from agencies throughout the 
government who met at the bureaus headquarters in suburban 
gaithersburg md to receive formal guidelines for implementing an 
ambitious new computer security program 
charged with overseeing the program are nbs a unit of the 
commerce department and the pentagons national security agency 
which for years has issued regulations for protecting classified 
information 
other lead agencies for the program are the white house office 
of management and budget and the office of personnel management 
the effort is mandated by legislation signed into law early this 
year by president reagan requiring that agencies establish 
computer security training and awareness programs identify 
sensitive computer systems prepare security plans for each system 
and submit those plans to nbs and nsa for advice and comment 
due to be formulated by next january the security plans are 
intended to help deal with unauthorized computer system breakins 
by hackers as well as the threat posed by socalled computer 
viruses small strings of computer code that can cause computer 
programs to go haywire 
anthony c taylor a technical consultant to the house science 
space and technology committee said a recent survey of federal 
agencies by the general accounting office had confirmed our worst 
fears in finding that many computer managers are largely 
unaware of the threats to their systems 
he told the meeting that although the danger from hacker 
breakins has been widely publicized far greater damage comes 
not from hackers but from insiders at agencies who may attempt to 
steal damage or destroy sensitive data 
the computer security program faces a possible budget squeeze 
because congress so far has been unwilling to vote the additional 
3 million for nbs requested by the reagan administration to pay 
for implementing the program 
a fiscal 1989 bill passed by the house includes no extra money 
for the program while companion legislation approved by a senate 
appropriations panel would provide only 1 million capitol hill 
proponents of the computer security program are expected to press 
for full funding on the senate floor and in a senatehouse 
conference

gov rose mofford will not be charged in 
connection with gifts she gave as secretary of state or financial 
disclosure statements she filed as a public official the county 
attorney announced today 
maricopa county attorney tom collins said technical violations 
in the statements were not significant in that they did not 
involve large amounts of money or personal gain for governor 
mofford 
mrs mofford was not available for comment immediately but 
aides issued a statement on her behalf 
obviously i am relieved that this investigation has concluded 
and i can continue to lead arizona without any doubts about my 
integrity it said it feels good to be exonerated from these 
charges because every decision i have ever made in public service 
has been for the benefit of the state of arizona 
the gifts collins said in a statement were given in the 
state interest in governor moffords official capacity and they 
lack any clear element of personal gain in a thoroughly private 
capacity 
state attorney general bob corbin had asked collins office to 
investigate omissions from financialdisclosure statements mrs 
mofford filed over the last 10 years and at thousands of dollars in 
state money that went for gifts and office decorations while she 
was secretary of state 
sources close to the probe said before the announcement that 
investigators had concluded mrs mofford had broad authority to 
spend money they also said the investigators had concentrated in 
fairly narrow areas for example they said no one was able to 
discover to whom most of the gifts went so mrs mofford was taken 
at her word that they went to appropriate people 
and while they found some evidence of payments by mrs mofford 
of bills that her late husband incurred sources said the 
investigators had been unable to locate a will for tr mofford 
that could have helped prove or disprove her claim that items 
omitted from her disclosure statements were not really hers because 
they were being used to pay her former husbands debts 
the investigation began after the associated press reported in 
april that mrs mofford had failed to list numerous land loan and 
partnership dealings in financial disclosure forms covering the 
past 10 years 
as secretary of state mrs mofford was in charge of ensuring 
that forms were easy to fill out she initially referred to the ap 
story as nitpicking but later filed amended reports saying she 
had made an honest mistake and didnt feel she had to list some 
items because she was using the proceeds to pay off bills tr 
mofford incurred after their divorce but before he died 
the investigation was broadened in may after the ap reviewed 
five years of bills from the secretary of states office and found 
more than 50000 spent on items including a jokewriting service 
kachina dolls and 30 expensive watches 
the review also found that mrs mofford had bought 10000 worth 
of us and arizona flags from unauthorized vendors at higher 
prices than they could have cost if purchased from stateapproved 
vendors 
mrs mofford refused to discuss the disclosures but said in a 
statement that a 2400 appropriation in her 198081 budget for 
other items and later lumpsum budgets gave her authority to 
purchase gifts for visiting dignitaries arizonans who gave 
outstanding service and groups that advance civic pride

a minor degradation in radar aboard the 
uss vincennes was repaired before the warship entered the persian 
gulf and played no role in the vessels failure to correctly 
identify the iranian airliner it shot down last weekend a navy 
spokesman said friday 
other pentagon officials said they were awaiting results of an 
investigation to learn why the vincennes missed air traffic 
communications and other clues indicating that the iran air a300 
airbus was a civilian plane and not an f14 fighter as officers 
aboard the ship believed 
the chief of irans air force brig gen mansour satari told 
reporters in tehran on thursday that us systems should have been 
able to monitor 21 minutes of conversation in english between the 
jetliner and the airport control tower in bandar abbas near the 
mouth of the persian gulf 
but pentagon spokesman said they were not sure us forces in 
the gulf were monitoring or were able to monitor air traffic 
control communications at the time of the incident 
we are looking forward to an analysis of the tapes to help 
clarify the issue said lt cmdr chris baumann a pentagon 
spokesman 
as the vincennes steamed from its home port in san diego toward 
the gulf in may said navy spokesman lt brian cullin an 
unspecified part in the ships sophisticated spy1 radar proved to 
be unreliable 
a replacement was flown to the arabian sea outside the gulf 
the repair made and the vincennes was fully operational on june 
6 before she entered the gulf cullin said the ship reported to 
the battle group in the arabian sea on may 22 he said 
the 1 billion ships aegis radar and tracking complex of which 
spy1 is part mistook the airbus for an iranian f14 fighter and 
shot it down with all 290 civilians aboard last sunday since then 
pentagon officials have been trying to figure out why 
in other developments friday 
president reagan said the question of compensation for the 
families of those killed in the incident is one issue under 
consideration white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there 
were still some open questions on the compensation issue he 
said messages of condolence had gone to the victims families in 
pakistan the united arab emirates kuwait india yugoslavia and 
italy 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said the united states should adopt a new stance in the 
iraniraq war equidistant between the two warring countries 
i do believe that wed be much better served in trying to end the 
war if we were really in a position of condemning both attacks by 
iran and by iraq and also condemning the chemical warfare being 
conducted against innocent people by iraq he said 
at his tehran news conference satari said the downing of the 
airbus showed that the american military was unable to 
control its sophisticated systems 
us officials said the mistake was made in part because iran 
air flight 655 was broadcasting an identification signal on a 
frequency used only by military airplanes as well as sending a 
signal on a channel used by both civilian and military aircraft 
the iranian general said destruction of the plane was an 
intentional and unprovoked attack but he later qualified this 
by saying the us military accepted on purpose the risk of 
shooting down civilian planes because they were unable to control 
their sophisticated systems 
and he said iran had all the tapes needed to prove that 
normal conversation was going on from the time the engines were 
started up on the ground until the plane was shot down 
the chief pentagon spokesman dan howard said thursday that 
defense department officials dont know whether us forces in 
the gulf were listening to the control tower or not we will learn 
that in the course of the investigation being directed by rear 
adm william m fogarty 
tapes from the vincennes were flown from the gulf for analysis 
in the united states said howard he said the tapes contain data 
from the aegis system but he was unable to say whether they 
included voice communications among the ships officers us 
commanders in the gulf and in the united states or any intercepted 
iranian transmissions 
it is probable that their highest priority at the moment was 
not listening to the air traffic control radio discussions at 
bandar abbas said howard there are many many radio 
frequencies it would take a heck of a lot of people to monitor 
all of them 
howard declined to explain whether us satellites aircraft and 
vessels routinely monitor iranian radio communications calling it 
an area of intelligence that i wont comment on 
another pentagon official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said that air traffic conversations are usually carried on vhf 
wavelengths which are best received when the transmitter is within 
site of the receiver as would be the case of an airliner near an 
airport 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william crowe 
said last sunday that no american surveillance or attack planes 
were in the air near the incident decreasing chances that us 
forces might have been able to overhear the air traffic 
conversations 
crowe also said the aircraft made no voice transmissions after 
it was picked by us radar a statement the iranian appeared to 
challenge 
another dispute centered on whether the airliner which howard 
described as 27 minutes off schedule was within the commercial air 
corridor 
howard said the plane was 4 miles from the center of the 
corridor according to the code governing international air 
flights he said commercial airliners those carrying 
passengers are expected to adhere to the centerline of the 
airway 
in tehran satari said the plane was traveling in the center 
of the international air corridor between bandar abbas and dubai 
and could have deviated 10 miles either side but still have been 
within the corridor

cautioning certain nominee michael dukakis against overly 
accommodating jackson 
it was illadvised under 1984 democratic nominee walter 
mondale and now to fall into this same thing of calling him in is 
not welladvised hollings said thursday

alienate black voters during the 1984 campaign 
while hollings reiterated his support for jackson at the 
national convention in atlanta later this month he indicated he 
would not take a lead role in lobbying for him 
ill certainly have a good word for him hollings said 
ill cast my vote for him and well see what happens

the piper alpha platform explosion is expected to 
cost insurers more than 1 billion in claims a spokesman for the 
lloyds of london insurance market said friday 
david larner a spokesman for the lloyds insurance market said 
the insurance costs look as though they could top a billion 
dollars it would make it the largest loss in the north sea and 
probably the largest loss on any one unit 
a unit is one item as opposed to the myriad of related claims 
prompted from wider disasters 
also on friday more than 100 contract workers refurbishing oil 
rigs in the north sea quit over general concerns about safety in 
the north sea oil industry

coast of scotland killing 166 people in the worlds worst oil rig 
disaster the company said it believed a gas leak was responsible 
in addition to the piper oil field five other fields were shut 
down which meant production was cut up to 250000 barrels a day 
or about onetenth of the total output of the north seas british 
sector a barrel is 42 gallons 
the oil markets relaxed when they realized that all but the 
pipers production of 167200 barrels a day should come back fairly 
quickly said chris grudniewicz an oil analyst with the london 
investment firm smith new court ltd 
in the separate west sole gas field from 100 to 150 workers who 
are employed by a contractor refurbishing three british petroleum

insurance costs for the previous worst north sea disaster the 1980 
capsizing of the alexander l kielland rig which killed 123 
people according to press association the domestic news agency 
occidental petroleum said thursday the destruction of the

recent advances made by the soviet union in 
the production of livestock products should continue well into the 
1990s if some technical and policy problems can be smoothed out an 
agriculture department analyst said friday 
a drive to increase meat and dairy production to upgrade soviet 
diets has been an important factor in moscows decisions to import 
large quantities of us grains when domestic harvests have been 
short 
the policies now in place or in the process of implementation 
portend improved performance compared with the late 1970s and early 
1980s but they will leave substantial productivity potential 
unrealized said edward c cook of the departments economic 
research service 
between 1982 and 1987 increases in soviet output of meat and 
milk marked a notably reversal of the downtrends between 1977 
and 1982 cook wrote in a new report about the soviet unions 
livestock sector 
milk yields increased per cent a year after 1982 and the 
perhead productivity of hogs and cattle increased 2 percent and 
34 percent a year respectively 
prospects for soviet livestock production hinge on how much 
the technical approaches particularly improvements in feed 
supplies will be pushed in coming years cook said a lack of 
coherence has continued to hinder the broad policies addressing 
pricing farm finances and agroindustrial integration 
cook said that without smoothing out these problems moscows 
policies can accomplish little more than modest improvement in 
the livestock sector

military commanders must tell soldiers and 
airmen testing positive for the aids virus that they face discharge 
or prosecution if they dont tell sex partners of their condition 
and use condoms under new army and air force regulations 
defense lawyers in an aidsrelated courtmartial scheduled to 
start the week of july 25 at fort huachuca in southeastern arizona 
have argued that the defendant had not been ordered either to use 
condoms or to inform partners 
spelled out under the regulations and a similar navy policy 
are rules of behavior at issue in a number of cases in which 
military personnel who have tested positive for the aids virus have 
been charged with criminal offenses from aggravated assault to 
having unsafe sex without warning partners of the test results 
the military services require all personnel to submit to aids 
blood screening tests which detect the presence of antibodies and 
indicate whether a person has been exposed to the virus 
lt col greg rixon an army spokesman at the pentagon said 
recently the army regulation which became effective april 1 
requires a commander to discuss a written counseling statement with 
any soldier who has tested positive and has received medical 
counseling 
it says the commander is imposing the following restrictions 
you will verbally advise all prospective sexual partners of your 
diagnosed condition prior to engaging in any sexual intercourse 
you are also ordered to use condoms should you engage in sexual 
intercourse with a partner 
the form also states that failure to adhere to your previous 
medical counseling or the counseling i have just given you will 
subject you to administrative separation andor punishment under 
the uniform code of military justice as i see fit 
this is serious business rixon said those words take the 
form of a direct order 
we dont order them to refrain from sex i dont think we 
could do that said col harry beans staff judge advocate at 
fort huachuca 75 miles southeast of tucson but partners must be 
informed so that he or she can make an informed decision 
the upcoming courtmartial of pvt adrian g morris jr 
initiated by the army in 1987 was the militarys first 
aidsrelated prosecution morris then a private first class is 
accused of failing to warn three soldiers with whom he had sex 
including one man that he had tested positive for the virus and 
to use condoms 
his lawyers have argued that there was no order for morris to do 
either in july 1986 when he was informed of the virus potential 
danger and counseled that he should inform partners and use a 
condom 
morris courtmartial was delayed pending appeal of a blood test 
admissibility ruling 
last december a soldier at fort hood texas pleaded guilty to 
aidsrelated charges including disobeying an officers order 
virtually identical to the new regulation 
in addition several other military aidsrelated cases have been 
tried including that of a fort sill okla soldier who pleaded 
guilty to aggravated assault and of an airman at wrightpatterson 
air force base ohio who was convicted on such a charge 
recurrence of the element of assault in the cases made clear 
that we needed a very definitive guideline to assure there is a 
standardization of orders rixon said 
the air force regulation like the armys provides a form both 
the affected airman and his or her commander must sign 
acknowledging that the person has been given the directive and 
understands it 
the air force order also requires people carrying the aids virus 
to inform medical personnel treating them 
navy spokesman lt kenneth ross in washington said a navy policy 
took effect in january telling affected sailors that if they do 
not tell their sex partners of their test status they face 
administrative or disciplinary measures ross said he knew of no 
requirement that a commander issue a direct order to affected 
individuals

six cars of a packed express passenger 
train derailed and plunged into a rainswollen lake in southern 
kerala state friday killing 85 people and injuring 500 others 
authorities said 
the death toll was expected to rise because up to 200 people 
were missing 
the united news of india news agency said as many as 250 people 
were feared dead the figure could not be independently confirmed 
six brickred passenger cars tumbled into the 20 to 
30footdeep lake asthamudi and were submerged while three others 
dangled from the bridge said ik chari a spokesman for the 
indian railways ministry 
rescuers worked under flood lights as navy divers searched 
submerged cars for survivors and bodies an official at the 
accident site told the associated press by telephone 
kerala railways minister a neelalohitadasan nadar said he 
suspected poor maintenance of tracks was the cause of the accident 
it is monsoon season in coastal kerala a state known for its 
palmfringed backwaters it had rained heavily earlier friday and 
was drizzling when the cars derailed near quilon about 30 miles 
north of the state capital of trivandrum 
the engine and one coach of the 14car island express crossed a 
bridge over the lake before the passenger cars derailed about 115 
pm chari said four of the last cars remained on the track 
dozens of fishermen in long narrow boats joined in rescue 
operations below the bridge which is about 15 feet above the water 
dr fritz mario saldana a dentist told the news agency that he 
saved himself inside a submerged car by clinging to a ceiling fan 
and keeping his head above the rising water he praised fishermen 
who were at the site within minutes to save trapped passengers 
among those killed were 60 men 20 women and five children 
according to vellu kutty head constable in quilon 
at least 192 people were hospitalized in quilon and trivandrum 
after the accident including 23 who were critically injured said 
matthew john a safety official for the indian railways ministry 
others were released after treatment 
most of the passengers on the train which was heading from 
bangalore to trivandrum were military personnel and government 
officials heading home for the weekend railway officials said 
john said the train can carry up to 1700 passengers and usually 
is crowded on fridays 
television and indian news agency reports said the cars plunged 
into the water after part of the 540foot bridge caved in but 
railway officials said the cause was not yet known 
it will take a lot of investigation to determine whether it 
was sabotage or something wrong with the tracks said sp 
sharma director of the safety division of the railways ministry 
john said two spans of the bridge were damaged by the accident 
nadar told the united news of india that he discussed bad 
maintenance with railway officials recently but the officials did 
not pay much attention 
dr thomas verghese deputy director of the quilon district 
hospital told the associated press by telephone that the death 
toll was expected to rise because three cars still were under water 
we have been very busy with the tragedy we are well equipped 
to handle the tragedy he said 
trains are the major form of transport in india carrying about 
9 million people daily the vast network of the railways stretches 
over 38347 miles of rail lines 
train accidents in india are common often taking dozens of 
lives the railway ministry announced in parliament in february 
that 227 people were killed in 613 train accidents during 1987 
the worst train accident in india is listed in the guiness book 
of records as the worlds worst claiming more than 800 lives when 
a train plunged into a river in the eastern state of bihar in june 
1981

a federal magistrate in virginia agreed today 
to give attorneys for defense consultant melvyn paisley a detailed 
affidavit fbi agents filed to justify searching the former navy 
officials home in the pentagon procurement fraud probe 
us magistrate w curtis sewell said paisleys attorneys but 
not paisley should be allowed to see the governments papers so 
they can provide their client with a reasonable defense 
sewells action in nearby alexandria va came just hours after 
us district judge john h pratt denied paisley 
request to see the affadavit that accompanied a search warrant for 
paisleys office 
pratt who sits in s lawyers theirthe district of columbia told the 
lawyers 
their request was merely an attempt on your part to find out 
information the government has with respect to your client 
search warrants were filed in two different jurisdictions 
because paisley lives in mclean va but has an office in 
washington 
while sewell said the attorneys could scrutinize the affidavit 
he agreed with the prosecutors that allowing paisley a look at the 
affidavit could allow him to sabotagng business was legally proper 
aronica argued that the government wants to keep search warrant 
applications under court seal for a limited period of time because 
of concern about the possibility of the destruction of records as 
well as other forms of possible obstruction of the investigation 
release of the detailed affidivits which identify subjects 
and targets of the probe could hinder the investigation aronica 
said 
he noted that the government does not have possession of all 
the documents we believe are relevant to the investigation 
aronica said 
aronica argued that the only reason we are here is because mr 
paisley wants to see what the government has on him 
if and when mr paisley is indicted by a grand jury the 
federal rules of criminal procedure provide the means of 
discovering the evience the government has on him aronica said 
barcella said the suggestion that destruction of documents 
would take place if it the affidavit were given to us has no 
basis 
paisley was seeking to inspect the affidavit not place it in 
the public record and barcella said he was willing to abide by any 
court order to keep it secret 
but pratt said he was concerned about leaks of confidential 
information about the case given the breadth of the investigation 
the judge said he couldnt guarantee that the paisley affidavit 
would not be leaked 
the document is extremely detailed it names a lot of names 
the judge said 
the investigation focuses on allegations that defense 
contractors and consultants many of them former military men 
bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that could be 
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
paisley resigned as assistant secretary of the navy for 
research engineering and systems in 1987 to become a private 
consultant for several defense contractors including mcdonnell 
douglas martin marietta pratt amp whitney and ltv 
his office telephone has been tapped for much of the 18month 
investigation pratt noted in court that he has been reading weekly 
wiretap reports for 45 weeks though he didnt specify if they were 
about paisleys telephone 
the mclean va home of paisley and his fourth wife vicki 
also a defense consultant was also searched by fbi agents 
aronica said the detailed affidavits identify subjects and 
targets of the investigation evidence the government has and the 
governments theory of the case 
expressing concern about leaks from the investigation pratt 
cited a report in todays editions of the washington post about the 
release of wiretap transcripts 
the post reported that aronicas boss us attorney henry 
hudson of alexandria va is trying to track down who leaked 
transcripts of wiretapped conversations to nbc news 
the newspaper quoting sources it did not identify said hudson 
called for the investigation in a letter wednesday to the justice 
departments office of professional responsibility 
nbc nightly news quoted the wiretap information two nights 
this week hudson also requested an examination of other leaks that 
have plagued the investigation since it became public june 14 when 
federal agents searched more than 40 locations nationwide

canada firmly closed the door friday on proposals 
to divert water from the great lakes into the parched mississippi 
valley 
justice minister ray hnatyshyn told parliament that the canadian 
ambassador in washington allan gotlieb would deliver a formal 
notice to the us state department saying that canada is 
unalterably opposed to any diversion 
the united states has no right to divert great lakes water and 
cannot expect one he said there is no consent forthcoming 
illinois gov james thompson has proposed diverting water from 
lake michigan through the chicago sanitary and ship canal into the 
illinois and mississippi rivers where barge traffic is stalled by 
low water levels 
although lake michigan lies entirely within the united states 
such a diversion would affect water levels in the other great 
lakes which are jointly managed by canada and the united states 
the us army corps of engineers is studying the illinois 
proposal before deciding whether to begin the complex process of 
seeking permission from the us supreme court to open a lock at 
the chicago canal for the diversion 
hnatyshyn said canada can veto any such proposal as a result of 
several treaties we control our resources we will continue to 
control our resources he said 
environment minister tom mcmillan said thursday that canada had 
been officially informed of the proposal last month and assured of 
full consultations he termed the illinois plan an insane idea 
and noted that other us states bordering the great lakes are 
against it 
opposition parties in canada have criticized prime minister 
brian mulroneys conservative government for failing to exempt 
water under the free trade agreement negotiated with the united 
states last year and now undergoing ratification 
but in a policy statement the government said it would never 
approve largescale diversions of water south of the border canada 
has 9 percent of the worlds renewable water supplies but 60 
percent of it drains north toward the arctic ninety percent of the 
canadian population lives within 200 miles of the us border 
to dramatize the point voluntary water restrictions are in 
force in southern ontario province where crops are withering in 
95degree heat because of a prolonged dry spell heavy rains this 
week in the prairie provinces of alberta saskatchewan and manitoba 
eased a ninemonth drought in that farming region

the navys aegis weaponry is awesome but 
imperfect according to experts trying to analyze how the 6 
millionpart 1 billion system came to target an unarmed iranian 
jetliner 
some scrutinizing the tragedy this week in the persian gulf say 
unleashing the aegis cruiser vincennes in the tiny crowded waters 
was the equivalent of letting a pit bull protect a playpen 
others say the system a complex mix of radar computers and 
weapons did just what it was designed to do destroyed a presumed 
hostile target on an apparent attack course 
the target thought to be an iranian f14 fighter was actually 
a civilian airbus with 290 aboard all were killed in the incident 
sunday 
questions have been raised like why aegis supersophisticated 
technology could not separate civilian from military air traffic 
or distinguish a 63footlong fighter from a 176foot airliner 
the navy and the key aegis contractor rca corp of moorestown 
nj have given only limited answers 
the technology at sea only five years is said to be able to 
track some 200 targets from as far as 250 miles so effective is 
the system that crewmen on the first aegis ship coined the motto 
if it flies it dies 
but there are problems say experts including aegis missile 
marksmanship its complex maintenance and its effectiveness in 
close quarters 
it is not meant to be sitting in the potomac next to national 
airport said one congressional staffer 
the persian gulf with its constant mix of civilian and military 
traffic may be too cramped for the system said sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the senate armed services committee 
the aegis cruiser is essentially a bluewater ship that was 
operating in a brownwater lake said nunn 
in theory experts surmise the vincennes controlroom screens 
could show civilian routes and even expected flights the navy has 
not said what flight information the crew had 
the uss ticonderoga the first aegis cruiser acted as a de 
facto control tower off lebanon in 1983 according to its 
combatsystems officer the ships aegis systems routinely 
sorted out air traffic cmdr james mcclure wrote in a 1985 issue 
of the naval journal proceedings 
experts say the vincennes radar consoles likely showed the 
airbus as hostile since aegis like other antiair warfare 
systems has to assume unidentified targets may be enemies 
released by vincennes capt will rogers iii the emotionless 
aegis let fly sm2 standard missiles one found its mark 
one capitol hill expert insisted aegis is the worlds best naval 
system for fighting in cramped quarters its more suitable 
because you can wait longer said the researcher who asked to 
stay anonymous 
still the vincennes skipper had about four minutes from the 
time they picked up this target until it was declared hostile 
adm william j crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said sunday 
that gave rogers little time to do anything but trust his 
computers analysts said and decide to protect his crew of some 
300 and the billiondollar ship 
pentagon officials say rogers justifiably concluded the airbus 
was an enemy based on its flight path its failure to identify 
itself and its confusing broadcast on both civilian and military 
frequencies 
they had a lot of indicators all of which added up to enemy 
aircraft said rep h james saxton rnj in whose area aegis 
is assembled and tested 
the information was likely flashed in white symbols on the blue 
backgrounds of the four 42inchsquare battle picture screens 
in the vincennes combat information center 
the screens providing a dim unwordly glow in the windowless 
chamber do not show aircraft as traditional radar blips 
navy officials have declined this week to let reporters view an 
aegis display but one expert says the boards designate planes by 
showing circles around friends diamonds around foes and squares 
around unknowns 
in trying to tell friend from foe the system relies on aircraft 
to emit or squawk their identities humans using the system 
as a tool must make the ultimate decisions 
its not designed to classify targets the congressional 
staffer said its just designed to detect and track them 
ironically he said an experienced radar operator using a less 
sophisticated system might have been able to tell an airbus from a 
fighter by comparing the size of blips 
during aegis first combat deployment the ticonderogas 
computers reportedly failed to see a small incoming plane visible 
to the naked eye in 1986 hostilities off libya the aegis cruiser 
yorktown targeted and shot at what some analysts say was nothing 
more than a dense cloud on the waters surface

a haitian farmworker testified friday that she lost 
her job cannot support her children and and faces expulsion from 
the united states because immigration authorities improperly denied 
her a work permit 
marie france jeanphilippe testified in support of a federal 
suit accusing the us immigration and naturalization service of 
illegally denying permits to 14000 predominantly haitian and 
mexican farmworkers in the southeast 
the farmworkers face expulsion from the country if they cannot 
obtain special agricultural workers permits required under the new 
federal immigration law 
about 125 haitians sat quietly in the courtroom friday listening 
to witnesses testify below a mural depicting floridas history 
including scenes showing field workers and a benevolent judge 
ms jeanphilippe 34 testified friday she arrived in the 
united states from haiti on a boat in 1985 and quickly got a job as 
a picker in homestead 
first i worked in lemons but i didnt like that the thorns 
scratched me and anyway im allergic to them she said through 
a creole interpreter then i went to the beans i liked that 
better 
she was paid 250 a bushel and sometimes made as much as 200 
a week but worked from 5 am to as late as 9 pm during the 
harvest she said 
ms jeanphilippe said that like many crew bosses hers kept few 
records paying workers in cash at the end of the week but when 
she applied for her work permit with the ins he supplied 
affidavits and what documents he had 
the ins interviewer at one point made her bend down to show how 
she picked beans but she was denied a permit after the ins called 
not the crew boss but the farm owner who did not know her she 
said 
since the permit denial she has been unable to work to support 
herself or her three children still living in haiti she said 
in the suit filed by the roman catholic diocese of palm beach 
county the haitian refugee center and several farmworkers says the 
ins has failed to respect congress wishes 
the plaintiffs say congress intended the ins to accept sworn 
affidavits as proof that farmworkers met the requirment that they 
have worked 90 days in us fields prior to the laws cutoff date 
but the ins says fraud has been rampant and has insisted on 
documentary evidence which the plaintiffs say often does not 
exist because crew bosses did not keep records for their illegal 
workers 
the hearing was expected to conclude monday senior us 
district judge c clyde atkins who is presiding over the case 
said he would not rule immediately

a black softball player on 
friday appealed for help from canadas prime minister after being 
refused a visa to attend an international softball tournament in 
saskatchewan 
albert ramovha was denied a visa because of the international 
sports boycott of south africa 
ramovha 32 said he had been saving money since last year for a 
ticket to canada the soweto resident said he hoped to witness 
softball at its best and learn new techniques to teach my brothers 
and sisters back home 
bill farrell a diplomat who handles visa matters at the 
canadian embassy in pretoria said canadian officials advised that 
ramovha could not be issued a visa because of boycott 
the boycott normally applies to competitors ramovha wanted only 
to watch the world championship that starts in saskatoon at the end 
of july but farrell said officials in ottawa feared ramovha might 
be viewed as an official representative of the south african 
softball federation 
ramovha who plays and umpires softball belongs to the black 
federation and serves on a committee of umpires 
farrell also said ramovha had been offered accommodation and 
meals by the tournament organizers thus putting him in a different 
category than an ordinary spectator 
he doesnt have to be on the field pitching to be seen as an 
official representative of his federation farrell said 
ramovha who works at a truck rental company near johannesburg 
said he sent a telex today to prime minister brian mulroney 
appealing for reconsideration of his application 
ramovha said he had applied for the visa in february and did not 
get a reply until june 30 in the interim he said he had borrowed 
1400 to buy an air ticket shifted his vacation dates and shopped 
for the trip 
i really feel frustrated and destroyed morally ramovha said 
in the message to mulroney 
allow me to learn he wrote appealing for a chance to 
visit your democratic land and learn not only more about softball 
but about your way of life 
softball has been played in south africa since 1946 the 
federation to which ramovha belongs has about 4000 members 
virtually all of them black the 3500member south african 
softball association is predominantly white despite being open to 
all races 
the international softball federation which is based in 
oklahoma city and is sponsoring the saskatoon championship 
suspended south africa in 1975 as worldwide antiapartheid pressure 
increased but ramovha said the federation had encouraged him to 
attend the tournament as an individual 
my fellow sowetans are aware of my intended trip and they are 
also eager to learn from me ramovha said in his telex they 
will be most disappointed to learn i cannot visit canada

volunteers from across the lower rio 
grande valley flocked here friday to donate blood crawl shirtless 
through tight spaces and do whatever else they could for victims of 
a department store collapse 
they ignored temperatures in the 90s and the threat of 
collapsing rubble to help dig the living and the dead out of the 
amigo store 
its such an overwhelming response to the point that weve 
been asking people to come back later and relieve the people who 
are tired said police sgt ben reyna said 
the roof of the popular discount department store crumbled under 
torrential rain thursday afternoon at least 11 died 47 were 
injured and an unknown number were missing 
im just here to help somebody who needs help said mario 
camarillo of brownsville who inched his way into a crawl space to 
help deliver oxygen to survivors trapped in the twisted jungle of 
concrete and steel 
you cant turn your back on them i hope somebody would do 
that for me he said 
some volunteers crawled deep into the rubble through a path 
cleared by a wiry freddie gonzalez 34 who is 4foot8 
we kept hearing them crying in there so we kept digging and 
digging they were all tangled with wire and pieces of wood said 
gonzalez 
police were not sure how many people and agencies had responded 
to calls for help by noon friday but reyna said the volunteers 
came from all over the state and some from across the border mexico 
despite the call for volunteers to work in shifts many were 
ready to stay until the rescue was complete 
im not even sleepy said berta capatillo 34 of 
brownsville i just want to get those people out i think thats 
whats keeping me awake im hoping they will be alive

the government filed a petition in the 
supreme court on friday seeking to overturn another courts 
decision to lower the amount of interim relief for victims of the 
bhopal gas disaster 
the petition challenged an order issued by a panel of the madhya 
pradesh high court on april 4 that union carbide corp be required 
to pay 192 million in relief to victims of the 1984 gas leak at a 
carbide subsidiary plant 
a trial court in bhopal earlier had set payments at 269 million 
union carbide also has asked the full madhya pradesh high court 
to review the interim relief order contending that any demand for 
payments before the overall damage suit is resolved would be unfair 
india is suing union carbide for 3 billion in damages stemming 
from the leak of toxic methyl isocyanate gas from a pesticide plant 
in bhopal on dec 3 1984 the case is in preliminary hearings in 
bhopal in central india 
nearly 3000 people were killed and more than 20000 seriously 
injured by the gas it is considered the worlds worst industrial 
disaster 
the petition filed friday said the high court failed to 
appreciate that in a tragedy of this nature grant of interim 
relief need not be determined with mathematical accuracy 
it added if the trial court adopted and arrived at the figure 
by applying its judicial mind on the facts of the case there will 
be no justifying ground for interfering with the quantum by the 
high court 
the statement also said that damages that may be ultimately 
decreed are bound to be far in excess of the interim relief granted 
by the trial court 
no date was set for hearing the petition

health officials opened thousands of acres of 
oyster beds that were closed for 20 years because the 
droughtslowed mississippi river is carrying less sewage and 
industrial waste into the gulf of mexico 
the lack of moisture over the midwest and plains has left the 
mississippi flowing past new orleans at about 114000 cubic feet 
per second about a fourth of its normal flow upriver barges run 
aground on newly bared sandbars downriver a wedge of saltwater is 
edging upstream from the gulf toward drinking water intakes at new 
orleans and neighboring communities 
the river is very polluted when its flowing normally said 
jim cosgrove of the state department of health with the river flow 
dropping its spewing less pollution into coastal areas where 
oysters grow 
plaquemines parish officials estimate that about 4 million 
worth of prime oysters soon will be heading to the market from the 
areas opened thursday 
theres always perhaps a silver lining to the big clouds 
said ron dugas of the state department of state wildlife amp 
fisheries 
it looks real good said oysterman kenny fox of pointe a la 
hache these are quality oysters salty and fat and very 
productive 
fox has had leases in cox bay for 20 years but pollution had 
kept him from harvesting a single oyster 
plaquemines parish officials had been monitoring the areas daily 
for about three weeks recent samples showed that the counts of 
fecal coliform bacteria had dropped from double digit numbers to 
almost nothing 
in another indicator of the rivers weakness biologists from 
louisiana state university say saltwater fish are making their way 
up the mississippi ahead of the leading edge of salty seawater 
flowing upstream beneath the lighter river water 
without the rivers normal flow pushing the saltwater back to 
the gulf the tip of the wedge of saltwater was at new orleans 
about 100 miles from the mouth of the river and saltwater fish 
were netted about 35 miles farther upstream 
sheepshead and saltwater catfish are among the species reported 
caught by fishermen and lsu researchers say they have caught 
menhaden flounder and atlantic rays 130 miles from the mouth of 
the river 
catching saltwater fish in the area of laplace is unusual said 
allen rutherford of the lsu school of forestry wildlife and 
fisheries 
saltwater fish including sail catfish also are being caught by 
fishermen in the atchafalaya river 10 miles upstream from 
sherrington said sandy corkern lsu marine advisory agent the 
atchafalaya also empties into the gulf of mexico 
the army corps of engineers said the tip of the saltwater slid 
by mile 99 three miles past the citys water intake at algiers 
on thursday 
the bulk of the saltwater is 20 miles behind the tip of the 
wedge salt water hugs the bottom because it is heavier than the 
rivers fresh water 
the corps hopes to slow the salts advance from the gulf of 
mexico by constructing a dam of dirt 15 to 25 feet high across the 
river bottom near myrtle beach 32 miles downstream from canal 
street 
on thursday gov buddy roemer declared a state of emergency for 
orleans jefferson plaquemines and st bernard parishes all draw 
their public water supplies from the river and are making special 
preparations to combat the salt 
several industries below new orleans have begun barging millions 
of gallons of water a day to maintain operation 
salt concentrations at chalmette 10 miles downstream from new 
orleans reached 129 parts per million thursday the federal 
standard for safe drinking water is 250 ppm but that is out of a 
concern for corrosion and taste rather than health effects

gov terry branstad declared a statewide 
disaster friday because of the drought saying experts had told him 
iowa faces the loss of half of its corn crop the bedrock of its 
economy 
we clearly have a statewide disaster on our hands and a 
disaster of national proportions as well branstad said 
this drought came much quicker and hit much harder than 
anything weve had before this is certainly appropriate action in 
light of the severity of the problem 
the declaration frees state vehicles for transporting feed and 
water allows use of the national guard for well drilling or 
hauling water and waives some restrictions on transporting 
oversized loads of hay 
also state agencies begin spelling out disaster plans 
including water allocation plans if needed 
branstad also asked federal officials to open lowinterest loan 
programs and other disaster aid for droughtstricken farmers and 
said he hoped to make that case in person to president reagan next 
week 
it is a natural disaster that is beyond the control of any 
state he said 
iowa joins indiana missouri and ohio in declaring statewide 
emergencies because of the drought 
there is no question the 1988 drought is one of the most 
severe iowa has ever experienced branstad said 
last year iowa was the nations leading cornproducing state 
turning out 13 billion bushels valued more than 2 billion 
the governors decision came after he met with a task force of 
farm experts earlier friday and was urged by the states 
congressional delegation to take the step during a lobbying trip to 
washington on thursday 
it looks like the corn crop will be cut in half branstad 
said the best estimate we have at this point in time is that we 
will have nearly a 50 percent loss 
we are the leading corn producing state its a very important 
crop in this state and a loss of this magnitude is very 
significant branstad said

4foot8 frame to save lives friday by crawling deep into the 
dangerous rubble of a collapsed department store considers himself 
just another volunteer 
gonzalez 34 was one of hundreds of people who flocked to the 
site of the store in the humid summer heat of the rio grande 
valley he crawled into the teetering mass of concrete and steel 
all that was left of the amigo store 
we went in through a little hole we kept going in deeper and 
deeper and making it bigger and bigger digging it out with our 
hands and we found the people gonzalez said we went right up 
to them and pulled them out by their legs 
we kept hearing them crying in there so we kept digging and 
digging they were all tangled with wire and pieces of wood he 
said 
gonzalez works for brownsville equipment and maintenance the 
company that will probably end up clearing the shattered block 
shirtless and sweaty he stayed at the accident scene all night 
until 11 am friday 
it was a little bit hot the people were running out of 
oxygen that was their major complaint we ran a little tube 
through a small hole then we made a bigger hole and put in a 
bigger pipe to get oxygen to the trapped survivors he said 
what if people call him a hero

some residents at a school for the 
mentally retarded said friday the state had failed to live up to an 
agreement aimed at moving more residents into communitybased group 
homes 
a consent decree signed in 1986 sets as a goal 100 community 
placements a year from the southbury training school just 35 were 
placed in the year ending june 30 the residents said 
i want to have my own apartment so i can be on my own said 
mirabel silva a resident at the school for six years 
thomas j monroe who lived at the school 11 years before moving 
into a group home and then to his own apartment said the issue was 
one of civil rights 
he said that almost all the 1048 people living at southbury 
could make it on their own with the proper support services in the 
community 
the residents should be treated as people not as a vegetable 
or a dog on a leash he said 
some of these people shouldnt be here now he said 
gesturing to those at a news conference in an auditorium at the 
institution but he said many people dont want group homes in 
their communities 
school director steven d staugaitis who spoke on behalf of 
state department of mental retardation officials said the 
residents frustration is understandable they were promised 
something and they didnt get it he said 
he conceded that the state has complied with as much of the 
consent decree as it can but that support services such as 
nursing and therapy are inadequate in most communities 
anne rotzal a woman whose son alan has lived at southbury for 
29 years scoffed at the notion of having virtually everyone move 
out of the training school 
those that can go out god bless em they should go out 
she said after listening to the news conference but she said 
its not for everyone 
staugaitis said not all residents want to leave some have been 
there more than 40 years and fear such a change he said

the national judicial college about to 
celebrate 25 years of teaching americas judges how to judge has 
courses that cover everything from the ethical dilemmas of medicine 
to the proper way to wear that black robe 
and most of the 22000 graduates about onethird of all us 
judges have completed the one to four weeks of classes without 
incident 
but william b lawless a former notre dame law school dean who 
now heads the college can recollect at least one class that was a 
bit too realistic it landed five students all judges behind 
bars 
oh it was wonderful those were experimental times lawless 
said we were trying everything to teach people the judicial 
process 
the jurists went to a bar and as part of the scheme were 
propositioned by two young women a man pretending to be angry 
intervened and hit one of the startled judges in the stomach twice 
all were arrested and jailed and it was several hours before 
they figured out it was an act to introduce them to the other side 
of the bench 
a couple of them threatened to sue us for false 
imprisonment said lawless with a laugh they dropped it 
though yes we have a checkered past 
this weekend the school celebrates its 25th anniversary in 
ceremonies presided over by judge joseph wapner of televisions 
peoples court 
the college was founed in 1963 by us supreme court justice tom 
clark who saw a void in judicial training as one former dean 
liked to say law schools train lawyers they dont train 
judges 
the college on the university of nevadareno campus has 
volunteer rotating instructors from across the us and is funded 
by an endowment of more than 68 million in state funds private 
donations and american bar association money 
although the 1600 who attend the college each year dont face 
jail any more new judges usually begin with an intense fourweek 
general course affectionately known as boot camp 
the course explains just about everything from how to put on 
your robe and how to conduct yourself in court to actual court 
proceedings 
other issues covered at the college are ways of keeping court 
cases flowing alcohol drugs and the courts how to handle 
evidence how to write an opinion sentencing guidelines medical 
evidence search and seizure jury instructions and traffic court 
the college has ongoing courses to update judges on current 
issues like aids surrogacy bioethics and conducts seminars 
across the country 
graduates who include us supreme court justice sandra day 
oconnor receive a certificate 
were still growing said lawless who has been dean since 
last september one of the schools goals is to build a mock 
courtroom 
the judges are encouraged to bring their families and often go 
to shows and casinos in their spare time they also take advantage 
of the hiking skiing and boating available in the area 
it was tough but extremely valuable to a new judge because it 
touched on most of the issues judges have to deal with said 
alabama circuit court judge joseph colquitt of tuscaloosa 
colquitt said the training helped when he decided against a 
hospital that was trying to get court permission to amputate a 
womans gangrenous leg arguing that she would die without the 
operation 
the last time i heard she was still walking around the 
judge said what i did in that case was rely on what i had 
learned about prevailing law in similar cases 
in most jurisdictions you dont come up against the unusual 
case but every once in a while you do judges must be prepared and 
i think the national judicial college does that

nudism buffs will circulate petitions at john d macarthur beach 
state park near north palm beach and in surfside just north of 
miami beach asking that strips of florida shoreline be designated 
as clothingoptional beaches 
chittenden said thousands of tourism dollars are lost each year 
because nude sunbathers have nowhere to go in the region 
european and canadian nudists go to the bahamas or the rest of 
the caribbean he said 
in 1982 miami police chased nudists from virginia key which 
for 30 years was a favorite location for nude volleyball and total 
tanning 
in 1986 the florida supreme court upheld the state law

the colorful mastermind of a north dakota 
seedpotato sale to honduras that went sour and rocked state 
politics pleaded guilty friday to bribing a former key official in 
the state agriculture department 
william messner who helped arrange the deal two years ago as 
president of a miamibased trading firm admitted friday he gave 
the departments former marketing director a 5000 caribbean 
cruise and as much as 4000 in cash for business considerations 
sentencing was deferred under a plea agreement under which he 
can avoid jail and in which he also agreed to pay the state 
restitution for expenses 
messner boasted the former director laurence mcmerty had made 
him millions of dollars by using him as a middleman in the 
states effort to market north dakota farm commodities in central 
america according to deputy attorney general bruce quick 
i think if we were to sum this case up is that it involves 
the great expectations of most the good intentions of some and 
the disappointment of all quick said 
mcmerty who also faces two bribery charges has pleaded 
innocent and has not been trying to strike a deal with prosecutors 
quick said mcmertys trial has been set for sept 7 his attorney 
orell schmitz declined comment friday 
the case is credited with ruining the political career of 
agriculture commissioner kent jones a republican who was denied 
endorsement for his third term in office because of the lingering 
scandal 
state officials had initially envisioned selling 4 million 
pounds of seed potatoes to a honduran farm cooperative within a 
year after contracts were signed in june 1986 
but the deal collapsed after attorney general nicholas spaeth 
raised questions about its financing and the state has never been 
paid for the only 400000pound potato shipment that was actually 
delivered 
mcmerty has charged spaeth and gov george sinner who are both 
democrats helped to sabotage the potato deal and were bent on 
using it for political gain both men who are running for 
reelection this year deny the charges sinner declined comment 
friday 
jones became embroiled in the controversy when he and herbert 
thorndal former president of the stateowned bank of north dakota 
signed a 300000 note meant to help finance the deal 
messner later sold the note to a miami bank for 264000 
putting 180000 of the money in his personal bank account to cover 
overdrafts quick said 
spaeth contends jones and thorndal had no authority to issue 
either the 300000 note or a subsequent 155 million note signed 
by thorndal that was given to messner and later returned to the 
state 
quick said friday there were no grounds to prosecute jones or 
thorndal 
messner was to have gone on trial tuesday in grand forks on two 
bribery charges the felony counts were consolidated into one 
charge friday as part of a plea arrangement 
associates of messner quoted him as calling the state officials 
he dealt with a bunch of idiots according to investigative 
documents made public in the case the associates said messner 
bragged of having the papers to rape steal and pillage after 
he set up the potato deal according to the documents 
the plea agreement calls for messner to pay the state 6088838 
in restitution which quick called the states outofpocket 
expenses in connection with the sale 
messner will not have a felony conviction if he abides by the 
agreement and completes three years of supervised probation without 
incident said his attorney michael hoffman 
messner who spent six months in jail after his arrest in 
november will not have to serve additional jail time if he 
complies with the plea agreement quick said

shooting down an iranian airliner was part 
of a world plot against iran and the nations leaders agree the 
best way of foiling it is to confront america parliament speaker 
hashemi rafsanjani said friday 
iranian news reports said three more bodies from the iran air 
jet of a man woman and child were found in the persian gulf 
a us warship shot down the airbus a300 last sunday killing 
all 290 people aboard american officials said officers of the uss 
vincennes thought it was an attacking iranian f14 fighter 
rafsanjani who also is irans military commander said an 
extensive program has been prepared in order to save iraq to 
deprive the islamic republic of its rights iran and iraq have 
been at war since september 1980 
he said iran would not seek revenge for the attack which 
contradicted statements by other iranian leaders 
the united states is trying to push us to commit the same 
crime but if we did that the world would turn against us 
rafsanjani told tens of thousands at a weekly prayer service 
that is why we do not push to take revenge wise people 
understand why we do not take revenge 
prayer services on the moslem sabbath often are forums for 
important political speaches 
rafsanjani said the united states was emphasizing different 
reactions among the iranian leadership in an attempt to portray it 
as divided 
in iran all the officials are agreed on the fact that we 
should confront america and all our officials and people believe 
that we should continue on our path until we achieve our rights 
he said 
iran has said often it will continue the war until it achieves 
its rights a fluctuating body of demands centered on the world 
branding iraq the aggressor iraq invaded iran in september 1980 
after several border skirmishes 
before rafsanjani spoke the newly formed general command issued 
a statement exhorting all persons who can carry a gun to report 
for war duty 
western diplomats said the remarks by rafsanjani considered 
second in power to revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini indicate tehran may have decided on a restrained response 
to the loss of the airliner 
as is common during prayer services in iran the crowd chanted 
death to america and war war until victory in the 
audience were young basij or volunteers in red headbands a 
few wounded war veterans and iraqi prisoners of war 
brig gen mansour satari the ustrained chief of the iranian 
air force said late thursday that the us navy must have been 
able to monitor 21 minutes of conversation in english between the 
airbus and its iranian control tower 
satari told foreign reporters the shooting was intentional and 
unprovoked but qualified that later by saying the us military 
accepted on purpose the risk of attacking civilian planes 
because it could not control its sophisticated systems 
the radar contact was a big widebodied airliner and totally 
different from a fighterbomber satari said the climbing the 
maneuverability of an airliner is totally different so a radar man 
is able to tell the difference speaking fluent english with an 
american accent sartari said he had been a radar man earlier 
in his career 
he said iran had all the tapes needed to prove normal 
conversation was going on from the time the jets engines were 
started on the ground until the attack it was shot down with 
missiles a few minutes into a short flight from a militarycivilian 
airport at bandar abbas to dubai across the strait of hormuz 
the plane was traveling in the center of the international air 
corridor between those cities and could have deviated 10 miles on 
either side and still be in the corridor he said 
mohammad reza majidi manager of iran air said in a statement 
fewer than 200 bodies had been recovered out of the 290 people on 
board and only 150 identified he said the black box data 
recorder had not been found

for the first time in more than four years 
massachusetts in june failed to have the lowest unemployment rate 
among the nations 11 most populous states so democratic gov 
michael s dukakis is losing a standard line in his presidential 
campaign speeches 
the government reported friday that while the nations civilian 
jobless rate dropped 03 percentage point to a 14year low 53 
percent last month unemployment in dukakis home state climbed to 
35 percent from 28 percent in may 
it was the first time since february 1984 before the collapse 
of world oil prices that massachusetts has not had the lowest 
jobless rate of the 11 most populous states according to the 
bureau of labor statistics 
texas then had the lowest rate 56 percent compared with 57 
percent for massachusetts 
last month new york matched massachusetts 35 percent jobless 
rate and north carolina dropped below it to 32 percent from 35 
percent in may 
massachusetts officials attributed the june increase in the 
states unemployment to a flow of outofschool teenagers coming 
into the labor market 
private analysts while cautioning not to put too much store in 
one months figures said it is the inevitable reaction to the 
economic boom that massachusetts has had over the past five years 
and that dukakis has been touting in his presidential campaign 
growth in massachusetts has slowed down theres no doubt 
about that said roger brinner a labor market specialist for 
data resources inc of lexington mass 
but not even the most ardent republican would try to claim 
that the massachusetts miracle has become the massachusetts 
debacle he said if it holds at 35 percent or rises to 4 
percent over the next several months it will be shoved under 
dukakis nose but one months figure is not enough 
marlene seltzer director of the massachusetts division of 
employment security said 70 percent of the 112000 people 
unemployed in the state last month had been jobless for less than a 
month indicating many of them were new entrants in the labor 
market 
by comparison only 47 percent of the nations unemployed had 
been jobless for less than a month indicating a much smaller share 
of people seeking jobs for the first time and unable to find them 
in june 
larry chimerine president of the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa economic forecasting firm said it is impossible to draw any 
conclusions about massachusetts economy from one months 
employment numbers 
the monthly statebystate rates are so unreliable because of 
the small samples they are based on that i would not believe there 
was a fundamental change occurring until i saw it continue for 
several months he said 
jerry jasinowski chief economist for the national association 
of manufacturers said he has seen no evidence of slackening demand 
for workers in the state 
dukakis is really having some poor luck recently jasinowski 
said of the figures im getting reports that labor shortage 
problems are greater in massachusetts than any other state in the 
country

days in lockup with only limited privileges and 15 days in solitary 
confinement

democratic party chairman paul kirk said friday 
that vice president george bush may have used tax money on campaign 
trips and he questioned whether bush can make any more trips in 
the next month without violating federal spending limits 
bush denied kirks allegation calling it an outrageous 
charge 
we are not abusing the public trust bush said in atlanta 
arriving for a fundraising event several hours after kirks 
remarks 
weve bent over backwards to be within the letter certainly 
the spirit of the law bush said to reporters traveling on air 
force two with him from washington fridays trip was political and 
financed as such aides said 
kirk made his statements at a news conference in atlanta and in 
a letter delivered to president reagans counsel ab culvahouse 
asking for immediate attention 
he also said the party may complain to the federal election 
commission 
the only thing that matches the hypocrisy of the republican 
party of the 1980s claiming to be the party of fiscal conservatism 
is the republican party of the 1980s preaching about law and 
order kirk told reporters 
he said bush the expected republican presidential nominee may 
have violated the law by using vice presidential funds for campaign 
trips to louisville ky and columbus ohio 
even if the bush campaign pays for the trips kirk said it may 
be exceeding the limit for campaign expenses in the preconvention 
period 
kirk said bush should disclose how he intends to pay for any 
further campaign travel before the republican national convention 
in august and whether he intends to borrow against the money 
allocated for the postconvention campaign 
reminded that 1984 democratic presidential nominee walter 
mondale exceeded his preconvention spending limit kirk said in 
1984 we learned a lesson wed like for both parties to come to 
this issue with clean hands 
kirks news conference was held in the same hotel as a 
republican unity 88 meeting that the vice president was to 
address later friday bush representatives attended kirks news 
conference to distribute copies of a response from bush campaign 
manager lee atwater 
atwater said the louisville and columbus trips were paid for by 
the bush campaign 
mr kirk is wrong on the facts and i challenge him to come 
forward with something more than political innuendo if he wants to 
level accusations against this campaign atwaters statement said 
kirks statements are totally without merit and are obviously 
designed to distract public attention from the real issues of the 
last two weeks mike dukakis compulsion to raise taxes and his 
reckless prison furlough program which has released firstdegree 
murderers and rapists onto the streets of america where they can 
continue their reigns of terror atwater said 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the reagan 
administration is scrupulously careful in determining who pays 
for political activities this sounds like more political hot air 
to me

but with the lowest margin in its six decades of rule sources said 
friday 
the figures from the federal electoral commission which a 
reliable source gave the associated press show presidential 
candidate carlos salinas de gortari ahead with 474 percent of the 
popular vote 
cuauhtemoc cardenas of the leftist coalition national democratic 
front was second with 267 percent and manuel j clouthier of the 
conservative national action party third with 207 percent 
the count is for 117 million of the 38 million registered 
voters or 307 percent 
in addition to the presidency 64 senate seats and 500 in the 
newly expanded chamber of deputies also are at stake 
the federal electoral commission which controls the vote count 
released fragmentary unofficial results early thursday one day 
after the nationwide elections it said final results were not 
expected until sunday 
the leak of a vote count appeared to be made to deflect growing 
speculation that the ruling party known as the pri had suffered a 
devastating loss 
no presidential candidate since the pris inception in 1929 has 
won with less than 70 percent of the vote 
the slow vote count also is making evident splits within the 
party between the 40yearold salinas de gortari and his closest 
associates known as technocrats and the oldstyle politicians 
the federal electoral commission is headed by interior secretary 
manuel bartlett who was one of salinas de gortaris chief rivals 
for the pris presidential nomination 
salinas de gortari has insisted throughout the campaign that a 
new era of modern mexico will be recognized in which opposition 
voices will be heard 
in issuing his proclamation of victory thursday salinas de 
gortari said it is the new political reality of the nation and 
with which we will have to coexist in a harmonious and respectful 
fashion 
the commission has warned candidates against claiming victory 
before the final tally is in 
no official preliminary results have been issued on the 
presidential election consequently claims by candidates and 
parties are not based on any official information the commission 
said in a brief statement thursday night 
bartlett first said technical difficulties with a new computer 
system delayed the returns he later blamed bad weather 
the government says the elections were peaceful and clean pri 
officials have said charges by opposition parties that the 
balloting was fraudulent was simply a publicityseeking move 
the mexican political system is corrupt and lacks 
credibility clouthier said in announcing a protest march 
saturday afternoon in downtown mexico city 
as sure as i am that i did not win the presidency i can 
affirm the electoral process was not clean gumersindo magana 
candidate of the small conservative mexican democratic party was 
quoted as saying friday by the government newspaper el nacional 
political analyst jorge castaneda said cardenas who split away 
from the pri and ran as the candidate of the leftist coalition 
national democratic front apparently did well in urban areas 
the question is whether the votes that come in from the 
countryside will be enough to compensate for the cardenas lead in 
urban mexico castaneda said 
he defined urban as any town of at least 5000 people 
accounting for twothirds of the 38 million registered voters 
cardenas clouthier and presidential candidate rosario ibarra de 
piedra of the tiny radical revolutionary workers party met with 
federal officials wednesday night and issued a statement accusing 
the government of massive fraud 
magana did not sign the statement but also accused the 
government of fraud 
the assembly for effective suffrage a civic watchdog group 
recorded 1100 cases of voting irregularities ranging from 
ballotstuffing to tampering with voter registration rolls 
fourteen complaints were filed with the attorney generals 
office including falsification of electoral documents to the 
disappearance of 11000 ballots in mexico citys 27th electoral 
district and thousands more in western michoacan state 
the pri has controlled the presidency congress and 
gubernatorial offices in all of mexicos 31 states since its 
founding in 1929 
while claiming victory salinas de gortari called the campaign 
one of the most contested elections in our history and one of the 
most peaceful 
he seemed to be preparing the party for what could be a pivotal 
moment in pri history less than overwhelming victory at all 
levels 
the era of practically one party ends and we enter now in a 
new political stage in the life of the country he said

a truck packed with explosives 
exploded friday in a crowded business section of the afghan city of 
jalalabad killing 31 people and damaging cars and buildings the 
staterun kabul radio reported 
it was the third car bomb attack in an afghan city in as many 
days 
the radio quoting afghanistans official bakhtar news agency 
said the blast also destroyed 25 vehicles parked in a nearby 
parking lot and damaged a local theater and 45 shops 
kabul radio monitored in islamabad blamed criminal extremist 
opposition for the explosion apparently referring to afghan 
guerrillas fighting the prosoviet government it called the attack 
an unforgiveable crime 
the radio did not mention injuries the official soviet news 
agency tass reported 33 injured most of them women children and 
elderly people 
kabul radio said the latest deaths brought to 38 the number of 
people killed in the three car bomb explosions 
on wednesday six people died when a car bomb blew up in kabul 
the afghan capital the radio said western diplomats reported four 
dead 
a second car bomb exploded in the capital thursday killing one 
person the radio said 
no group has claimed responsibility for any of the explosions 
jalalabad about 70 miles east of kabul has been the scene of 
heavy fighting during the afghan civil war the soviet union began 
its troop withdrawal from afghanistan on may 15 and jalalabad was 
the first city to be emptied of red army soldiers 
the kremlin sent troops and tanks into afghanistan in december 
1979 to back the marxist government last april the soviets agreed 
to a unsponsored agreement that commits them to pull the 
estimated 115000 troops they deployed in the country 
afghan guerrilla leaders have said previously they would not 
target residential areas in their eightyear war against the 
government because the civilian death toll would be too high 
tass also reported friday that guerrillas had shelled 
rudeahmadzai in paktia province along the pakistani border it 
said one person was killed and several houses destroyed when a 
shell touched off a fire 
the soviets have accused pakistan of violating the geneva 
accords on afghanistan by allowing guerrillas based on its 
territory to ship weapons ammunition and supplies into afghanistan

the complex aegis air defense system used by 
the cruiser vincennes last week to shoot down an iranian passenger 
jet was never thoroughly tested before the navy began deploying 
it according to a classified general accounting office report 
the report as described by congressional sources found that 
the ability of the aegis to discriminate among various targets was 
never adequately proven 
the report was begun long before last sundays incident in 
which the vincennes shot down iran air flight 655 thinking it was 
an iranian f14 fighter jet all 290 people aboard the commercial 
plane were lost 
pentagon officials are reviewing information that led the 
vincennes skipper capt will c rogers iii to have his ship fire 
missiles at the plane in the strait of hormuz they have said the 
aegis system aboard the vincennes was not malfunctioning 
in an interview with the portland oregonian rep denny smith 
rore who was an outspoken critic of the aegis system when it was 
being debated in congress in 1983 criticized former navy secretary 
john lehman for moving too quickly on the aegis 
smith said lehman and adm james watkins former chief of naval 
operations oversold this program to themselves to the navy and 
to the public this is a public relations coup not a technological 
coup 
smith disputed the navys claim that the 500 million aegis 
system was built to detect and follow 200 or more targets at a time 
if they had trouble with one airliner what would they do with 
a halfdozen highspeed fighters on the deck he said 
he said the navy was guilty of a damn the torpedoes full 
speed ahead get the hulls in the water well fix it later kind of 
attitude 
aegis named after the mythic shield of the greek god zeus is a 
complex mix of radars and computers it was developed as the main 
component of protection for navy surface ships against enemy ships 
and planes 
the navy is building a fleet of aegisclass cruisers of which 
the vincennes is the third the service is also some components of 
the aegis system aboard other surface ships the system was first 
deployed in 1983 
the gao review started last year looked at the aegis testing 
program before the system went into service said the congressionl 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the congressional watchdog agency criticized a series of 1984 
tests in which the aegis system tracked 11 targets and guided the 
firing of weapons which hit 10 the sources said at one point two 
targets were fired at the same time 
the tests didnt conclusively show that aegis can distinguish 
among potential targets said one source 
the 1984 test program was set up specifically to answer 
complaints from aegis critics who argued that the system needed 
more realistic tests 
the tests were set up so carefully they did not approximate a 
reallife combat environment the sources quoted the gao report 
as saying 
navy officials did not return a telephone call seeking comment 
on the gao study first reported upon this week by the washington 
post and the seattle times 
but service officials in the past have disputed similar 
criticisms by the gao and have argued the aegis tests were 
realistic and showed the system worked as advertised

the legal cases against people who took part in 
ethnic riots in the azerbaijan republic were moved friday to courts 
in the russian federation as armenians had demanding for months 
armenians say courts in azerbaijan would be too lenient because 
of ethnic bias 
the soviet supreme court and the prosecutors office ordered the 
transfer 
courts have been investigating riots feb 28 in the azerbaijani 
port of sumgait in whch 32 people were killed 26 of them ethnic 
armenians most of the suspects are believed to azerbaijanis who 
differ in culture and religion from armenians 
most armenians are christian and azerbaijanis are predominantly 
moslem 
soviet officials have said more than 80 people have been charged 
in the unrest in the caucasus in which six azerbajanis have been 
killed and 200 people have been injured 
pending cases involve premeditated murder robberies and mass 
disorders according to the friday announcement by the high court 
and prosecutors office 
the announcement read during the national evening television 
news program vremya did not say why the cases were being 
transferred but moscow officials may feel russian courts would be 
less prejudiced 
azerbaijans supreme court on may 16 convicted an azerbajiani 
metalworker of murder in the rioting and sentenced him to the 
maximum 15 years in prison 
the riots sprang from a dispute over control of 
nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian mountain enclave in 
azerbaijan armenians demand that the area be made part of their 
southern republic 
the dispute has also led to strikes and street rallies the 
latest round of strikes in armenia began monday apparently 
prompted by dissatisfaction with a national communist party 
conference that failed to resolve the dispute 
soviet newspapers reported friday that some armenians have 
returned to work after a general strike that has paralyzed yerevan 
the capital of armenia but that a walkout persists in 
nagornokarabakh 
armenias parliament has endorsed the annexation demand but 
azerbaijan has balked armenia asked moscow to intervene 
on monday and tuesday demonstrators stormed yerevans airport 
and one was killed by a plastic bullet fired by soviet troops 
the disturbances disrupted 65 flights the newspaper 
sotsialisticheskaya industriya reported it said 16 million a day 
was being lost in industrial production 
the labor newspaper trud said a strike in stepanakert 
nagornokarabakhs main city had cost 64 million in lost 
industrial production and that factories elsewhere in the soviet 
union were suffering because stepanakert enterprises failed to 
deliver 32 million worth of supplies 
the soviet news agency tass reported the stepanakert strike 
continued friday 
but some workers were back at their jobs in yerevan a broadcast 
journalist speaking from yerevan by telephone on condition of 
anonymity said about half of the citys public transport began 
running friday sotsialisticheskaya industriya said foodproducing 
enterprises were operating

reagans former chief of staff donald t regan used his book 
for the record to reveal that the first lady relied on an 
astrologer to help formulate the presidents schedule regan also 
contended that mrs reagan formed a cabal to force him from office

lifeguards tried a new way of protecting 
swimmers friday keeping them off beaches altogether as medical 
waste once again washed ashore 
with temperatures in the 90s jones beach and robert moses state 
park beach were closed because officials decided a ban on swimming 
would be insufficient to ensure no one was hurt by the debris 
the only people on the beach were cleanup crews searching for 
additional garbage floating ashore bad news for the state and 
concessionaires who say the weekend after july 4 is traditionally 
summers biggest a crowd of more than 100000 would normally be 
expected at the state beaches 
its really a creepy feeling sifting through this stuff 
said sharon moynahan 18 who assisted in the cleanup im trying 
to be really careful i dont want to catch anything 
ron foley long island regional director for state parks said 
no decision on reopening the beaches would be made until saturday 
officials wanted to see what the next tide brings 
jones beach was reopened 4 pm friday more of a token gesture 
than anything else as it was set to close at 730 pm and did not 
mean beaches would be open saturday officials said 
the assortment of syringes bandages and blood vials could have 
entered the ocean through the sewer system either when washed off 
a street or dumped into a sewer said environmental protection 
agency spokesman richard cahill 
we dont believe this is the result of illegally dumped 
hospital waste said randy braun an epa worker who examined the 
ocean water by helicopter 
james marshall another epa spokesman said debris collected 
thursday and friday included fewer than three dozen syringes also 
found were three blood vials and numerous vials associated with 
crack use he said 
mixed in with the medical waste has been garbage consistent with 
beach usage littering and sewage overflow he said 
although hospitals everywhere have to deal with the problem 
federal environmental officials say these kinds of incidents appear 
to be confined to new york and new jersey 
we havent found anything like this anywhere else said j 
winston porter the federal environmental protection agencys 
assistant administrator for solid waste 
the garbage recovered from the beaches will be turned over to 
the office of us attorney andrew j maloney to determine if it 
can be traced and whether criminal charges are called for said 
us rep thomas downey dny

astronaut charles bolden twice rode 
a safety basket at 50 mph down a 1200foot slide for life wire 
friday to practice an emergency launch pad escape from the space 
shuttle discovery 
two safety workers rode with him on the second trip 
it was the first time humans had ridden the basket escape system 
since it was installed several years ago for the shuttle program 
astronauts and pad personnel would use the system in case of a 
fire fuel or gas leak or other emergency on the pad that gave them 
time to reach the baskets 
after a simulated emergency was declared bolden a veteran of 
one shuttle mission made his way from the cabin level of discovery 
195 feet up launch pad 39b and climbed into the basket for the 
dizzying descent 
the baskets fast fall was arrested abruptly at the bottom by a 
braking system made up of a series of increasingdensity steel 
chains that dragged through the sand in the landing zone 
had the brakes failed the basket would have been jolted to a 
stop by a net stretched across the baskets path 
once at the bottom bolden leaped from the basket and ran to the 
safety of a nearby concretelined underground bunker 
he reported the ride was smooth and then returned to the 
spacecraft cabin level and repeated the ride with two pad safety 
personnel george hoggard and albert bumgardner each of the seven 
baskets is rated to hold three people 
nasa reported both tests were completed successfully 
previous basket tests were run with sandbags and dummies for 
ballast and two sandbag tests preceded boldens first run friday 
until recently some nasa officials felt the swift ride would be 
risky and should be tried only in an actual emergency 
but with the added emphasis on safety following the loss of 
shuttle challenger and its seven crew members the space agency 
decided recently to manrate the basket system after making several 
improvements 
bolden hoggard and bumgardner volunteered for the job 
among the improvements were the addition of two baskets 
increasing the number to seven the cutting of a side exit in each 
basket to ease entry and exit adding a flame protective covering 
over the existing webbed material and the installation of an 
antirollback brake to ensure the basket stopped as quickly as 
possible 
discovery was moved to the launch pad monday to be prepared for 
the first shuttle launching since challenger exploded on jan 28 
1986 the launch is scheduled in early september 
bolden flew as pilot on the shuttle mission before the 
challenger accident he has been named to pilot another flight next 
year

the judge in the irancontra case friday 
ordered oliver l north to stand trial sept 20 and gave the fired 
white house aide access to a wide range of secret documents to show 
he acted with higher authority 
the order by us district judge gerhard a gesell means that 
the first criminal trial resulting from the irancontra affair is 
scheduled to be under way when the fall presidential campaign is in 
full swing 
but gesells ruling on secret documents also pointedly raised 
the possibility that three major charges stemming from the 
diversion of usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
would not be part of the case when it goes to trial if ever 
gesells order said that the defense had shown during a closed 
hearing on wednesday that highly sensitive passages of documents 
that government security experts want deleted from the 
prosecutions case tended to exonerate north of guilt on certain 
charges 
the documents and others are relevant to the major charges 
against north former national security adviser john m poindexter 
and arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen 
richard v secord the judge said 
gesell directed independent counsel lawrence e walsh to produce 
any documents to support norths claims that money raised by hakim 
and secord from the arms deals was combined with government money 
to plan and carry out various covert operations including 
actions directly or indirectly supporting the contras 
the judge ordered walsh to turn over documents that corroborate 
norths claim that these activities were all approved at or near 
cabinet level their execution was closely monitored through the 
use of a variety of intelligence methods and sources 
the documents should include those that show funding of the 
activity from any source and whether or not senior government 
officials were aware of the activity gesell said 
gesell said he was not ruling on the merits of norths defense 
or the admissibility of any documents as evidence 
the jury must decide where the truth lies gesell said but 
the judge said he was ordering the government to produce the highly 
secret documents to assure that the truth whatever it ultimately 
proves to be will out 
under the classified information procedures act cipa the 
government could decide it does not want to prosecute north on the 
major conspiracy charge because doing so would require disclosure 
of sensitive information that would jeopardize national security 
if the problems of disclosing secret government documents cannot 
be resolved by september gesell said he will proceed to try north 
on charges that dont require extensive use of classified material 
at a minimum substantive charges of coverup falsification 
and norths alleged receipt of personal benefit derived from his 
conduct as a government employee can proceed to trial gesell 
said 
this trial date is six months after indictment it must be 
met 
in a brief statement walsh said we are ready to proceed as 
directed by the court 
the charge that north conspired with his three codefendants to 
defraud the government by illegally diverting armssale proceeds 
requires the most use of classified documents 
this charge plus two others charging all four defendants with 
wire fraud and theft of government property involve questions of 
whether the defendants intended to violate the law 
among the secret materials sought by north gesell noted are 
documents bearing primarily on issues of criminal intent which is 
of particular significance to the first three counts of the 
indictment 
they may also support defense challenges to the credibility of 
certain known prosecution witnesses who have in the past denied 
that norths funding and other activities were monitored known and 
approved at the highest levels of government 
an expected defense to the three charges is that north and his 
codefendants acted with the implicit or explicit approval of 
higher officials in the reagan administration gesell has ordered 
separate trials for all four defendants 
north should be given documents containing any references to 
covert aid to the contras in president reagans daily intelligence 
briefings between sept 1 1984 and dec 31 1986 or in the 
presidents regular daily briefing by his staff gesell said 
any other information about aid to the contras that was 
forwarded to the white house by the central american joint 
intelligence task force during this period should also be provided 
the judge said 
the judge also ordered walsh to specify by aug 1 the documents 
he intends to produce as evidence against north on the other 13 
charges against the former white house aide 
these include charges that north lied to congress about his role 
in providing covert aid to the contras and that he shredded 
documents during attorney general edwin meese iiis november 1986 
investigation of the irancontra affair 
he is also charged with accepting an illegal gratuity a 
15000 security fence installed around his suburban virginia home 
the indictment charges that secord paid for the fence 
north is accused of obstructing an fbi investigation into the 
fence as well as pocketing 4300 worth of travelers checks from 
the 90000 he was given by contra leaders to defray expenses of 
helping the rebels 
a jury trial on those counts remaining after the cipa process 
takes its course is set for sept 20 gesell said 
the classified information law has provisions for substituting 
secret documents with statements of facts about what the material 
would prove or by redacting or deleting especially sensitive 
portions of classified material 
gesell noted that a government task force studying documents 
walsh intends to produce in his case against north remains 
adamantly opposed to any public disclosure of the classified 
information redacted by prosecutors from the material 
this includes passages that tended to exonerate north of guilt 
on certain charges the judge said 
at wednesdays hearing which was not attended by prosecutors 
norths lawyer also demonstrated how his theory of the defense 
requires use of redacted portions of the governments case 
the judge said he had concluded that the prosecution has 
redacted certain information from its documentary caseinchief 
which must be available to north for his use in trial 
the judge said north is entitled to obtain documents showing he 
participated under a pseudonym in covert activities and any use 
of contemplated use of the vessel erria 
the danish freighter was used in clandestine arms shipments from 
europe to the contras in 1986 it carried arms to the mediterranean 
as part of an anticipated armsforhostage deal that never occurred

spokesman said was linked to an underground islamic fundamentalist 
group

slashed my face ravivo said 
the army statement said six of the deportees are from the west 
bank and four from gaza they have all served prison terms for 
antiisraeli actions in the past and some are still in jail

iran and iraq reported making jet bombing 
runs along their southern war front on friday and the tehran 
government accused iraq of dropping chemical weapons on three 
cities in the region iraq denied it 
the persian gulf itself again turned into an arena in the nearly 
8yearold war the burning greek supertanker fellowship l was 
under tow in the northern gulf late friday almost 24 hours after 
it was attacked in iraqi raids on shipping off iran 
shipping executives in the gulf and in london said flames were 
extinguished aboard the 215780ton cypriot tanker star ray 
another victim of the iraqi raid 
they said no injuries were reported on either ship 
gulfbased executives speaking on condition of anonymity said 
they believe another greek vessel on charter to the iranians also 
may have been hit the executives said they feared the iraqi air 
raids off iran may provoke iran to retaliate on commercial shipping 
elsewhere in the gulf 
tensions in the oilrich region already ran high because of the 
downing of an iranian civilian airliner sunday all 290 people on 
board were killed when us naval missile fire downed the jetliner 
in the belief it was an attacking warplane 
an iraqi military spokesman reported the latest raids on three 
maritime targets thursday in a statement quoted by staterun 
baghdad radio 
since early 1984 iraq has been attacking vessels sailing to and 
from iranian ports as part of a blockade to throttle the oilbased 
iranian economy the targets were mainly tankers 
iraqs objective is to force the government of ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini to accept a negotiated peace in the war between 
the two gulf oil powers iran retaliates by attacking any merchant 
vessels in the gulf regardless on whether its doing business with 
iraq or not 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit which 
monitors maritime traffic around the world said the two tankers 
were attacked thursday night off irans kharg island oil terminal 
at the head of the waterway 
gulfbased shipping executives and the londonbased lloyds 
shipping intelligence unit which monitors maritime traffic around 
the world said the two tankers were raided overnight off irans 
kharg island oil terminal at the head of the waterway 
it said the fellowship l was struck at 910 pm about 30 miles 
south of kharg as it was southbound after loading a shipment of 
crude oil 
it said the engine room and crew quarters were set ablaze in the 
attack while on the star ray fire broke out in the bow 
lloyds later reported that the fire aboard the fellowship l was 
partially extinguished and that the tanker was under tow but that 
firefighting was still in progress it said the fire on star ray 
had been put out 
both tankers are on charter to iranian oil authorities part of 
a shuttle fleet that ferries the kharg oil to the larak makeshift 
export terminal about 500 miles southward in the strait of hormuz 
to circumvent the blockade 
the united states deployed its navy in the gulf last summer in 
order to protect 11 kuwaiti tankers flying the american flag 
several other western navies protect their own flag vessels 
carrying cargo through the gulf 
the iraqi news agency said iraqi jets and helicopter gunships 
flew a total of 265 combat missions along the 730mile front friday 
and that all aircraft returned safely 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus as was ina issued a war communique saying iranian 
warplanes flew nine sorties inflicting heavy casualties and 
losses on the enemy at troop concentration points along the 
northern and southern fronts 
irna also reported that iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs 
on the cities of khoramshahr abadan and khosrowabad at the same 
time the areas were subjected to heavy artillery fire of the 
iraqi troops 
iraqs official news agency later put out a communique saying 
such action and saying iraqi targets friday were limited to oil 
installations and tankers

interest rates on 30year fixedrate 
mortgages moved higher in june the third consecutive monthly 
increase the government said friday 
the federal home loan bank board the regulator of savings 
institutions said the national average for conventional 
singlefamily loans jumped to 1075 percent in early june up from 
1065 percent in early may 
it was the highest rate since january when the average was 
1097 percent 
however a separate report by the federal home loan mortgage 
corp known as freddie mac indicates that rates eased later in 
june and early this month it said the average this week was 1038 
percent down from 1039 percent last week and 1058 percent in the 
week ending june 3 
freddie mac averages are lower than the bank boards comparable 
averages because they do not include addon fees known as points 
which are paid by borrowers 
the bank board averages which hit 1142 percent just before the 
october stock market crash dropped steadily for five months 
hitting 1033 percent in early march and then began rising 
after the brief respite in june and early this month economists 
are expecting rates to begin climbing again 
richard w peach deputy chief economist of the mortgage bankers 
association of america said he expected 30year fixedrate 
mortgages to be in the 1125 to 115 percent range by the end of 
the year 
we had a temporary lull in interest rates during the last 
three weeks of june the dollar strengthened and that boosted the 
confidence of the bond market in the past week though weve seen 
some renewal of concerns about inflation pressures todays 
employment release showing joblessness at a 14year low of 53 
percent in june is going to accentuate that fear he said 
the bank board said rates for the most popular type of oneyear 
adjustablerate mortgages those with caps on how high the rate can 
increase also rose from 863 percent in early may to 880 percent 
in early june 
the percentage of mortgages closed with adjustable rates rose to 
55 percent in june up from 53 percent in may and 49 percent in 
april 
peach said as fixedrates rise home buyers turn to the 
lesscostly adjustable rates

the ira claimed responsibility 
friday for two bombings and two mortar attacks that killed four 
people three of them by mistake 
the attacks killed two civilians a british soldier and one of 
the irish republican armys own men the outlawed ira apologized 
for killing the civilians both roman catholics 
ten civilians including a 4yearold girl and her grandmother 
were injured 
eighty families had to be evacuated when a mortar barrage missed 
a police station and damaged a primary school and several houses 
police said 
in a statement to belfast news media the ira said a bomb at a 
swimming pool in west belfast was accidentally triggered thursday 
evening in an operation that went tragically wrong 
the ira fighting to end british rule and unite the mainly 
protestant province with the overwhelmingly catholic irish 
republic extended its condolences to relatives of those killed 
gerry adams president of the iras legal political wing sinn 
fein denied that the ira changed its policy of targeting the 
security forces saying it wasnt an attack on civilians it was 
an accident 
but dr joe hendron a leader of the moderate catholic social 
democratic and labor party whose offices are near the swimming 
pool replied sickening apologies mean nothing to the dead and 
injured ira savagery is with us again 
the royal ulster constabulary said the bomb planted against the 
enclosing wall of an indoor public swimming hall apparently was 
meant to bring the wall down on a security patrol passing outside 
on the predominantly catholic falls road 
instead it killed civilians elizabeth hamill 60 and eamonn 
gilroy 24 
among the four injured were ellen mccormick and her 4yearold 
granddaughter ciara burns 
mrs mccormick said they went to buy ice cream and were walking 
past the pool when the wall seemed to come out towards us ciara 
started to scream and there was blood running all over me she had 
blood on her dress 
both suffered cuts to the legs and other minor injuries 
seven hours later a british army bomb disposal expert helping 
to clear the area was killed yards away by another bomb police 
said 
unconfirmed reports said warrant officer john howards foot set 
off the explosion he was the 400th soldier to die in nearly 20 
years of violence in the province 
the ira said one of its member seamus woods 22 died in a 
mortar attack on a police station at pomeroy in county tyrone early 
friday one shell exploded inside the stations perimeter fence but 
caused little damage police said 
woods body was found in a field outside town near a tractor 
and trailer used in the attack police said 
the officers said that since police fired no shots woods death 
apparently was connected with the mortar fire itself 
a second mortar attack 15 minutes later missed the police 
station in stewartstown about 10 miles away but damaged a primary 
school and houses six civilians suffered minor injuries police 
said

jesse jackson said friday he has no veto over the 
running mate michael dukakis will pick and he doesnt want to 
appear to have one 
jackson made the comment in the process of distancing himself 
from his campaign managers disparaging remarks about sen albert 
gore jr as a possible democratic vice presidential candidate 
the civil rights leader who has been pushing for an offer of 
the no 2 spot himself said his campaign does not have a veto over 
dukakis choice and does not choose to exercise the appearance as 
though we have a veto over anyone in the process 
as for his own chances jackson spoke in terms of knowing the 
rules and fitting qualifications 
the issue is not so much who will be in office who will be 
governor who will be on the supreme court as that there are 
rules based on a tradition on which we have been locked out he 
said 
the hoop is too small he said i may not fit the rules 
but i know what they are i can teach them to my children and they 
will learn 
his comments on not having a vice presidential veto were in 
reaction to a boston globe story it said gore had become a leading 
contender and quoted jackson campaign manager gerald austin as 
saying such a choice by dukakis would outrage jackson supporters 
and increase the republicans chances of winning black votes in the 
november election 
jackson told reporters austin was speaking only for himself 
i have not made any negative statements either privately or 
publicly on any value judgment concerning potential vice 
presidential candidates jackson said i think it would be 
unethical to do so 
throughout our campaign we have kept a moral tone on the 
subject he said we will keep talking that way because its good 
for the process its good for the party its good for the 
country 
jackson was in dallas to address the same league of united latin 
american citizens convention that dukakis and likely republican 
presidential nominee george bush spoke to earlier this week 
he drew cheers from the group when he declared that if bush is 
serious about helping hispanics he should be calling for 
appointment of one to replace attorney general edwin meese iii 
bush promised the group on wednesday that he would appoint a 
hispanic to his cabinet if elected president but jackson said if 
thats so bush should recommend right now an hispanic to replace 
ed meese 
bush came through here the other day talking about his 
conversion to a new religion respecting hispanics is a new 
religion of his jackson said 
on the subject of vice presidential considerations jackson told 
reporters that his campaign staff attempted to call dukakis 
campaign manager paul brountas late thursday night but brountas 
then called jackson friday morning 
he was coming here for us to have a meeting jackson said 
and he said he is still accumulating data and responding to the 
data and we will meet at some subsequent time not very far from 
now for a rather extended oral interview 
jackson said putting him on the ticket as dukakis running mate 
would give voters a balance between two candidates of divergent 
economic and geographic backgrounds he said but he also said it 
was dukakis decision if the massachusetts governor is confirmed 
as the presidential nominee

republican george bush vowed friday to 
never ever under any circumstances pay reparations to the 
iranian government for the downing of a civilian airliner though 
he said payments to victims families are being considered 
democrat michael dukakis said he favored humanitarian 
assistance in the case 
under the torrid summer sun it was a day for each of the 
nomineestobe to campaign hard on the others turf 
in atlanta where the democrats gather in ten days for their 
national convention the vice president tried to shrug off 
democratic charges that his cashstarved campaign was illegally 
using tax dollars to keep going 
in texas where bush votes dukakis campaigned with a potential 
running mate homestate sen lloyd bentsen amid indications that 
the massachusetts governors search for a vice presidential choice 
may be entering its final days 
im pondering dukakis said of the senate finance committee 
chairman at a rally in texarkana texas he could make a great 
contribution in this country in many many ways he already has 
bentsen seemed to minimize his chances of being the choice 
saying when asked if he wanted the job i dont think we have to 
worry about that 
dukakis also campaigned in phoenix accompanied by former 
arizona gov bruce babbitt a former nomination rival and gov 
rose mofford he then left for los angeles 
with new pressure on the democratic nomineetobe from jesse 
jacksons camp dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas and jackson 
put off a meeting to discuss the vice presidential situation 
jackson campaign manager gerald austin said dukakis should not 
pick presidential alsoran albert gore jr of tennessee one of the 
men under consideration but jackson himself said in dallas that 
austin was speaking for himself and that he jackson had not 
made any negative statements either privately or publicly on 
other vice presidential prospects it would be unethical to do 
so he said 
he said his campaign has no veto over dukakis choice and does 
not choose to exercise the appearance as though we have a veto 
over anyone in the process 
jackson spoke to the league of united latin american citizens 
the same group that bush told earlier this week that he would 
appoint a hispanic american to his cabinet jackson drew cheers 
from the crowd when he declared bush should recommend right now 
an hispanic to replace ed meese as attorney general 
dukakis beginning a sixstate campaign swing suggested he 
would back aid to the families of the 290 people who died when a 
us cruiser shot down an iranian airliner sunday over the persian 
gulf 
i think some form of humanitarian assistance can ought to be 
seriously considered dukakis said in answer to a question about 
reparations im as anxious as members of congress and the 
american people to get the results of the investigation but i 
would think some form of humanitarian assistance would probably be 
appropriate 
asked about the issue of reparations bush said in atlanta that 
he feels terribly sad for the families of those people killed 
in the attack and repeated his understanding that payments to the 
families are under consideration by the reagan administration but 
not reparations 
i would never ever under any circumstances offer reparations 
to the iranian government he said 
the republican nomineeinwaiting was in atlanta for a gop unity 
rally 10 days before the democratic convention convenes there 
but democratic national committee chairman paul kirk got to 
atlanta ahead of bush to declare at a news conference that evidence 
strongly suggests improper spending by the vice presidents 
campaign 
in a letter to white house counsel ab culvahouse kirk said 
bush is conserving his limited remaining resources by not 
reimbursing the federal government for the use of air force two and 
other vice presidential benefits during two june political trips 
with only 13 days to go before the vice presidential roll call 
at the democratic convention there was a swirl of reports about 
the selection process scrippshoward news service reported that 
bentsen and sen bob graham of florida had been dropped from the 
top of the list 
dukakis spokesman dayton duncan said any reports of who was 
rising or falling on the list could be dismissed as baloney 
with dukakis on the campaign trail the news from his home state 
was mixed for the candidate who boasts of his record of running the 
state government efficiently and helping keep the states economy 
booming 
the massachusetts legislature finally sent a new 1175 billion 
state budget to dukakis desk seven days late and perhaps needing 
even more cuts to keep it in balance dukakis has already backed 
two tax hikes to keep the income and expenses in balance 
and the state dropped off the top rung of the honor roll for 
unemployment 
joblessness in the state jumped from 28 to 35 percent in june 
making it the first time in 51 months that massachusetts was not 
first or tied for first among 11 industrial states for the lowest 
unemployment rates

vice president george bush said friday that 
allegations he has used public money for campaigning are just the 
latest attack from the democrats in a battle the republicans are 
only now turning into a twoway street 
bush at a news conference before a gop fundraising rally said 
in answer to a separate democratic charge that he has gone back 
on his notaxincrease pledge that his definition of a tax 
increase does not include the new levies on the elderly for 
catastrophic illness coverage 
he also said he might support paying reparations to the families 
of the iranian citizens killed when a us navy ship downed an 
iranian jetliner this week but not to the iran government 
in an evening address at the republican rally bush stressed 
national defense policy and contended democrat michael dukakis who 
is expected to be his presidential rival in november would leave 
the united states generally depending on the united nations to keep 
world peace 
multilateralism seems to be my opponents answer to soviet 
aggression he told the gathering of gop activists including 
most of his former rivals for the republican presidential 
nomination 
now hes proposing to cut the mx midgetman and sdi the 
strategic defense initiative also known as star wars he said 
adding preemptive concessions are no way to bargain with the 
soviets 
bush also attacked dukakis attempt as governor of 
massachusetts to block a president from deploying a states 
national guard units without the governors permission 
you cant run a foreign policy if 50 state governors each have 
the right to veto a presidential decision bush said thank 
heavens that the courts rejected the case and didnt hamstring 
the presidents ability to defend our nation he added 
however bushs news conference was dominated by questions about 
whether his campaign was properly repaying the government for the 
costs of campaign trips on air force planes democratic national 
chairman paul kirk on friday said he was raising the question with 
the white house counsel in regard to two recent outings 
we are not abusing the public trust bush said calling it 
an outrageous charge 
the vice president speaking to reporters earlier on the trip 
from washington said weve bent over backwards to be within the 
letter certainly the spirit of the law 
at the news conference he said if you abide by the law 
whatever you do is fair 
bush put forward his campaign attorney ede holiday to answer 
questions from reporters she was unable to provide details about 
how much of the trips were paid by the campaign and how much by the 
government but said it was determined by longstanding formulas 
bush said the intensity of democratic attacks was no greater 
than it had been for several months but that his campaign was 
firing back 
its only now were beginning to make it a twoway street 
said bush who has for some time been deploying gop officials to 
attack dukakis the likely democratic nominee at events around the 
country 
the trip to atlanta made it the second straight day the vice 
president was invading what might be considered enemy turf he 
spoke to a greek audience in dukakis boston hometown on thursday 
night and atlanta will be the site of the democratic national 
convention the week after next 
bush said the timing of the atlanta appearance was not aimed at 
the democrats 
we are not going to rain on their parade that is not to say 
were not praying for rain he said 
asked about dukakis statement that bushs support of the new 
catastrophic illness insurance program amounted to support of a tax 
boost the vice president said the increased levies on the elderly 
to finance the program amounted to something different a 
premium he said that fit in with his earlier exclusion of user 
fees from his notax pledge 
i think the voters know what im talking about he said 
bush said president reagans support of several tax bills during 
his presidency didnt mean he himself would eventually do the same 
whats that have to do with what ill do as president he asked 
the vice president also expanded his criticism of dukakis 
statements favoring a conventional weapons modernization program 
saying the democrat was antinuclearweapons to the degree that 
he moves us to a very different form of deterrence that would 
be more costly 
bush said he felt terribly sad for the families of those 
people killed in the downing of the iranian airbus and added that 
the national security council was considering the matter of 
reparations 
i would never ever under any circumstances offer reparations 
to the iranian government he said 
dukakis said friday in texarkana texas im as anxious as 
members of congress and the american people to get the results of 
the investigation but i would think some form of humanitarian 
assistance would probably be appropriate

the former top education adviser to gov michael 
s dukakis was sentenced friday to 2 years in prison and ordered 
to pay up to 80000 to the state in restitution for skimming money 
from a program he ran 
gerard t indelicato 42 was ordered to surrender to federal 
officials aug 5 where he will serve his prison term has yet to be 
determined 
he had pleaded guilty in federal court in april to five charges 
of conspiracy mail fraud and tax evasion in a scheme with three 
others to bilk an adult education program of some 80000 
assistant us attorney ralph gants said indelicato would be 
eligible to seek parole in 10 months based on precedent 
indelicato would likely serve 12 to 18 months in prison gants said 
the sentence handed down by us district court judge douglas 
woodlock was half the fiveyear term gants recommended but the 
judge said it was more severe than most similar cases 
woodlock said it was important that whitecollar pickpockets 
are subject to the same punishment as those who use cruder 
implements 
under a plea bargain indelicato testified in the trial of 
michael freedman whom federal prosecutors identified as one of the 
minor players in the scheme indelicato was considered the 
mastermind behind the plan that involved paying inflated rent and 
receiving some of the money back taking the salaries of fictitious 
employees and skimming funds intended to pay for classroom 
renovations 
indelicato has said he wondered whether the case would have 
drawn the same level of publicity if he had no links to dukakis 
the presumptive democratic presidential nominee 
all of the alleged activities occurred between 1979 and early 
1983 and ended a few weeks prior to the time dukakis named 
indelicato his chief education adviser 
dukakis has condemned indelicatos activities and has said his 
administration is cooperating fully with all pending 
investigations indelicato is the highest ranking member of 
dukakis administration to face criminal indictment

president daniel ortega said 
thursday that the rebels were deploying landtoair rockets that 
could endanger civilian planes he said the us downing of an 
iranian a300 airbus was an example of what could happen in 
nicaragua 
the president also accused the usbacked rebels known as 
contras of breaking the nearly 4monthold ceasefire 
he blamed the reagan administration for the developments 
referring to the airliner disaster ortega said the contras 
could do the same thing here we now are experiencing the effects 
of the dirty illegal war and of the terrorist activity that has 
been approved 
the iranian jetliner was shot down by missile fire from the uss 
vincennes last sunday with the loss of 290 lives in the mistaken 
belief that the plane was an attacking f14 fighter jet 
earlier thursday prosandinista newspapers said rebels firing 
mortars and rifles killed two children along the caribbean coast 
the purported attack on a miskito indian village saturday was 
among a series of increased raids reported in recent days as 
violating the truce 
the sandinista newspaper barricada said lackia saballos 5 and 
efram martinez died in a predawn attack from rebel mortars and 
rifles fired from the honduran side of the coco river 
ortega said in a nationally broadcast meeting with coffee 
workers in the northern city of matagalpa the ceasefire has 
been broken they the rebels are deploying at this moment 
landtoair rockets putting civilian aviation in danger 
ortega did not say that he would end the truce his government 
has extended unilaterally until the end of july the contras 
agreed but did not specify how long it would last 
they are beating the war drums and because of that we should 
not let down our guard but rather repulse those criminals ortega 
said 
the contras have been fighting the leftist sandinista government 
since 1981 
the sandinistas had played down reported violations of the 
truce which began march 21 two days before the government and 
contras signed an agreement to seek a negotiated settlement to the 
war on monday however the sandinistas issued their first monthly 
casualty bulletin since march 
the defense ministry reported 87 rebels killed and 31 wounded in 
combat in june it said 15 soldiers were killed and 62 injured the 
figures indicate that substantially more fighting was under way in 
the isolated mountainous regions than was previously revealed 
the government also said 184 civilians were kidnapped by the 
rebels last month on wednesday the defense ministry said nine 
civilians were kidnapped in northeastern rio blanco 
last monday a land mine blew up a military truck in central

a series of highlevel talks since the march meeting have failed 
to define ways to end the war that has killed more than 26000

the last round broke off june 9 when the contras responded to a 
government proposal with a new plan that went beyond points agreed 
upon earlier it would have disbanded the the supreme court 
established a constituent assembly and immediately freed all 
political prisoners 
the sandinistas bowed to a contra demand to move toward 
democratic reforms but the rebels said it didnt go far enough 
the government called for new talks to be held july 27 but the 
contras rejected the proposal 
the sandinistas came to power in july 1979 concluding a 
revolutionary war that ended 42 years of rule by the rightist 
proamerican somoza dynasty

his speech he said he already has a government platform for the 
next presidential term but declined to disclose it

remark before a cheering audience at a sports arena seemed a clear 
confirmation that the military government is planning the 
plebiscite for september or october this year

president will be elected in a plebiscite in which chileans will be 
able to vote only yes or no on one candidate nominated by the heads

four military leaders making the nomination

if the candidate is rejected an open presidential election 
should be called within one year with pinochet remaining in power 
until then 
in his speech today pinochet blasted his opponents and said

the opposition which unsuccessfully tried to prevent the 
plebiscite and promote a competitive election instead has now 
united to urge citizens to vote no in the referendum 
sixteen political parties from left to right have joined in a 
national command for the vote no campaign the outlawed 
communist party said it would participate in the plebiscite

us rep tom delay said friday upon 
his arrival here with three other members of congress that 
political prisoners in nicaragua are being overlooked in the search 
for peace in central america 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government acknowledges the 
existence of more than 3000 political prisoners 
the four members of congress said they wanted to take a 
firsthand look at the human rights situation in nicaragua 
we were very concerned that during this whole peace process 
that weve forgotten the most important people here thats the 
political prisoners delay a texas republican told a news 
conference at managua airport 
were very concerned about the conditions and reasons they are 
being held 
release of the prisoners is called for by a central american 
peace plan signed by the regions five presidents on aug 7 1987 
and a ceasefire agreement reached in last march by the sandinistas 
and nicaraguas usbacked rebels 
the sandinistas pardoned and freed more than 900 political 
prisoners last november as a goodwill gesture to get truce 
negotiations going more than 3000 remain jailed 
the truce still holds despite occasional clashes 
we are hoping with our visits to once again make sure our 
concerns on political prisoners are heard rep beverly b bryon 
dmd said 
also visiting nicaragua were reps robin m tallon dsc and 
barbara vucanovich rnev both are sponsors of a resolution 
calling on the sandinistas to comply with the central american 
peace plan 
the congressional team said their trip was not linked to 
speculation in washington about renewing us military aid to the 
rebels known as contras the united states has been supplying such 
aid off and on since the rebels began fighting to overthrow the 
sandinistas in 1981 
the peace plan which aims to negotiate an end to the civil war 
in nicaragua and leftist insurgencies in guatemala and el salvador 
also calls for political amnesties an end to outside interference 
and provision of military aid to insurgents and reforms to bring 
greater democracy to the region 
if the government wants to tell their story this is their 
chance delay said 
the four representatives are scheduled to meet over the weekend 
with opposition and government leaders

a prosecutor will bring no charges against 
gov rose mofford even though he said she violated financial 
disclosure laws and the state procurement code 
i think governor mofford would agree that she did something 
wrong maricopa county attorney tom collins said 
however he added whatever she did wrong was not serious enough 
to warrant prosecution 
arizona law says an officeholder or candidate who knowingly 
files an incomplete financial disclosure statement is guilty of a 
misdemeanor but collins said mrs moffords violations were just 
not the kind of level where you impose criminal sanctions its 
just not worth the candle to the taxpayers 
mrs mofford said obviously i am relieved that this 
investigation has concluded and i can continue to lead arizona 
without any doubts about my integrity it feels good to be 
exonerated from these charges because every decision i have ever 
made in public service has been for the benefit of the state of 
arizona 
later during an appearance with presumptive democratic 
presidential nominee michael s dukakis she complimented collins 
and his staff and said several times im very pleased 
her attorney mike hawkins said mrs mofford planned to follow 
up by calling for establishment of an ethics commission but her 
press secretary vada manager said such talk was premature 
collins office was asked by attorney general bob corbin to look 
at omissions from financial disclosure statements mrs mofford 
filed over the last 10 years and at thousands of dollars in state 
money that went for gifts and office decorations while she was 
secretary of state 
no record exists of where most of the gifts went and mrs 
mofford has no recollection 
but they were all arguably given in the state interest and 
they lack any clear element of personal gain in a thoroughly 
private capacity collins told a news conference 
some of the items were purchased in technical violation of the 
state procurement code but mrs moffords office followed 
procedures that were parallel to what the state procurement office 
would have done in any case collins said 
omissions from her financial disclosure statements were not 
significant in that they did not involve large amounts of money 
or personal gain for governor mofford collins said 
the investigation began after the associated press reported in 
april that mrs mofford had failed to list numerous land loan and 
partnership dealings in financial disclosure forms covering the 
past 10 years 
it was broadened in may after the ap reviewed five years of 
bills paid by the secretary of states office and found more than 
50000 spent on items that included a jokewriting service dolls 
and expensive watches the review also found mrs mofford had 
bought about 10000 worth of us and arizona flags from 
unauthorized vendors at higher prices than the flags could have 
cost if purchased from stateapproved vendors 
as secretary of state mrs mofford was in charge of ensuring 
that financial forms were easy to fill out she initially referred 
to the ap story as nitpicking but later filed amended reports 
saying that she had made an honest mistake 
mrs mofford elected as secretary of state became acting 
governor in february after the house impeached gov evan mecham on 
charges that he falsified his financial disclosure statements 
misused money from a state gift fund and obstructed an 
investigation by attorney general bob corbin 
she became governor april 4 when the senate convicted mecham of 
misusing state money and obstructing justice

city officials said friday that a lack 
of evidence may keep investigators from ever determining the cause 
of a tragic department store roof collapse 
feliz munoz a brownsville building official said the 
investigation will be difficult because the building is 
completely demolished and we have practically no evidence 
there 
the roof of the threestory building collapsed during a 
torrential rainstorm and the cavein took both interior floors 
with it leaving a massive pile of rubble and little else 
officials said 
there may not be much more evidence in city archives 
munoz said the city building department transferred its 
documents to a storage room at the airport a few years ago but 
that room was flooded earlier and the documents destroyed 
another building official tony yzaguirre said that although he 
wasnt a city employee when the structure was rebuilt im sure 
it was inspected its a normal procedure 
yzaguirre said inspectors check buildings only when they are 
first constructed and the only periodic inspections come from the 
fire department which makes sure there are enough fire exits and 
that they open 
a spokeswoman in the tax office iliana ramirez said the land 
and store including inventory were worth 282838 when appraised 
last year she said the building was valued at 210928 and the 
property was valued at 71910 
frutoso gomez an official with the cameron county appraisal 
district said friday the building was once called the miller hotel 
and that it had been damaged in 1967 and rebuilt in 1968 
he didnt know what the damage had been or if owner bernard 
levin was the owner who had it rebuilt his records only went back 
to 1982 he said 
hurricane beulah hit in 1967 dumping 10 to 20 inches of rain

deposed president eric arturo delvalle failed 
to attend his mothers funeral service here friday remaining 
instead in hiding as he has since his february ouster by gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
family members told reporters delvalle did not trust a 
government offer not to interfere in the service and to help 
facilitate the attendance of relatives 
the offer was published in thursdays editions of the 
progovernment estrella de panama newspaper 
a warrant for delvalles arrest has been outstanding since 
noriega the countrys de facto ruler and commander of the defense 
forces orchestrated his removal from office 
the united states still recognizes delvalle as panamas 
legitimate chief of state noriega under us indictments on drug 
trafficking charges replaced delvalle with manuel palma solis 
delvalles 71yearold mother abigail henriquez de delvalle 
died of a heart attack wednesday at mercy hospital in miami her 
body was flown to panama thursday 
us ambassador arthur davis attended fridays funeral service 
at a local synagogue he declined to comment to reporters 
afterwards 
government officials attended the service as did former vice 
president roderick esquivel making his first public appearance 
since he was ousted along with delvalle in february 
esquivel said the political crisis had created a tragic 
situation in panama 
i think that the country really has descended to levels where 
we are going to have to reconstruct it completely and make a new 
republic he said 
the reagan administration has applied a series of economic 
sanctions against panama in an effort to force noriega to resign 
the sanctions have produced a liquidity crisis in panama which 
uses the us dollar as its currency 
esquivel said the crisis was not limited to ousting gen 
noriega its a matter of constructing a country in whose 
government all panamanians can believe

independent counsel james mckay said friday 
the court order prohibiting any leak of his report on attorney 
general edwin meese iii has been violated and that he would 
investigate and seek sanctions against those responsible 
the new york times reported in saturdays editions that it had 
obtained portions of the report and revealed details from the 
830page document but did not identify its source 
executives of the times in new york and washington declined 
immediate comment 
one source said the times had acquired those portions of the 
report which were made available to meeses former lawyer and 
confidant e robert wallach 
both wallach and his attorney did not immediately return 
telephone calls 
mckay who did not identify the source of the leak said he 
regards this as an extremely serious development and intends to 
investigate this matter and seek sanctions against the person or 
persons responsible for this violation 
sources said mckay decided against seeking any criminal 
indictment of meese although matters discussed in the report might 
be reviewed by justice department ethics officers to see if 
administrative discipline is warranted 
the special threejudge court which appointed mckay authorized 
him to give out portions of his report to individuals who were 
mentioned in it so they could have an opportunity to submit 
rebuttal comments before the report is released publicly by the 
court they were given until july 14 to submit such comments 
mckays office said those portions were released under an order 
from the court requiring that the portions be kept confidential 
any violation of such an order would subject the violator to 
potential contempt of court penalties to be determined by the 
threejudge court mckays office said 
asked about the possibility of contemptofcourt proceedings 
appeals court judge george mackinnon head of the panel that 
appointed mckay said wed have to evaluate it when the 
situation developed obviously with the great number of people 
that are named in the report its not a great discovery to find 
that something might have leaked if the judges decided to 
proceed they would have to apply to a us attorneys office to 
make a determination on whether a contemptofcourt case would be 
pressed the judge said 
mackinnon said that the panel will proceed with its schedule 
which calls for comments to be submitted by people corporations or 
foundations named in the report by next thursday until at least 
that time the panel will not release the report publicly 
mackinnon said 
mckay also provided full copies to meeses attorneys and to 
solicitor general charles fried who for the purposes of this 
matter is acting attorney general 
james rocap one of meeses attorneys would not comment on 
mckays report despite the report that a portion of it has been 
leaked 
we agree with the independent counsel that it is reprehensible 
for anyone to violate the court order if in fact that has 
happened rocap said we intend to comply with the court order 
fully and to prepare our response on a timely basis 
mckay submitted his report to the court tuesday at the 
conclusion of a criminal investigation begun on may 11 1987 
mckay examined the involvement of meese at the request of 
wallach with scandalplagued wedtech corp in 1981 and 1982 when 
meese was white house counselor mckay also looked into meeses 
involvement again at wallachs initiative on behalf of a 1 
billion proposed iraqi oil pipeline project in 1985 
the independent counsel reviewed the attorney generals meetings 
with and decision on behalf of executives of the regional bell 
telephone companies at a time when he held 14000 in telephone 
stock 
mckay also looked into the fact that members of a washington 
real estate family through a foundation arranged to pay a 
40000ayear salary for meeses wife while leasing office space 
to the justice department 
wallach was involved with meese in both the phone stock and mrs 
meeses job

the odds of a catastrophic earthquake

higher than once believed and the san francisco bay area faces a 
similar threat a federal report says 
recent concern about the socalled big one on the san 
andreas fault has centered on the greater los angelessan 
bernardino area because so much strain on the faults north end was 
released by san franciscos great quake of 1906 which measured an

the army and air force have ordered 
commanding officers to tell soldiers or airmen who test positive 
for the aids virus that they face discharge or prosecution unless 
they inform all sex partners of their condition and use condoms 
the regulations and a similar navy policy spell out rules of 
behavior at issue in a number of cases in which military personnel 
who have tested positive for the aids virus have been charged with 
criminal offenses the charges have ranged from aggravated assault 
to having unsafe sex without warning partners of the test results 
in an aidsrelated courtmartial scheduled to start at arizonas 
fort huachuca this month defense lawyers have argued that the 
defendant was not ordered either to use condoms or to inform 
partners of his condition 
all members of the military must submit to aids blood screening 
tests which detect the presence of antibodies and indicate whether 
a person has been exposed to the virus

when oil was king in oklahoma all was well 
for geologists they had steady jobs and big salaries but the bust 
sent many to the unemployment lines 
now after eight months of night school some hardluck oil and 
gas workers are hoping they dont have to look so deep for success 
they have opted for careers in hydrogeology the study of 
groundwater 
and the drought in many parts of the country might even help 
them find work 
its been an endurance test said kurt lampi one of the 
students in the program that met three hours a night three days a 
week but it has helped me in getting employment 
lampi was a geophysicist for diamond shamrock in the gulf of 
mexico when he was laid off in november 1985 
he learned of the hydrogeology training program at metro tech in 
oklahoma city and was part of saturdays graduating class along 
with 62 others mostly unemployed or underemployed oil and gas 
workers 
lampi said he has received two job offers one from an oklahoma 
city company and the other from a company in south carolina 
we went into this because there is a need and the 
universitys role is to fill a need said wayne pettyjohn head 
of the department of geology at oklahoma state university i was 
aware of the market out there mainly people involved in 
groundwater are poorly trained 
pettyjohn said the idea of a crash course in hydrogeology 
surfaced when he received an increasing number of telephone calls 
from laidoff oil and gas workers looking for a way out of a 
depressed lifestyle 
at the time hydrogeology courses were offered at night at 
oklahoma state but that soon expanded to oneweek short courses in 
the summer 
the big boost came pettyjohn said when oilman jack taylor 
lobbied to get 600000 in funds from the department of labors 
dislocated workers program for the state deparment of vocational 
technical education 
an agreement was reached for oklahoma state in stillwater to 
supply faculty who would teach at metro tech in oklahoma city 
although its still too early to determine if the program will 
pay off in terms of jobs for the students pettyjohn said ive 
got several letters on my desk and also phone calls from people 
companies interested in seeing what we have to offer 
the drought in parts of the midwest and south could help he 
said if it continues i would suspect people will be looking 
more to groundwater as a source of supply therefore the drought 
would have a positive effect on job prospects 
some students have said hydrogeology companies dont want to 
take a chance on former geologists fearing they will jump ship if 
the oil industry should rebound 
pettyjohn doubts it these people put in eight months of 
intensive work several of them have lost their jobs theyve all 
had a bad experience they dont want to go through that again 
lampi is one who insists that hydrogeology is his new career 
noting that it will pay him 75 percent of his petroleum industry 
salary 
not everyone does so well pettyjohn said he knew of a former 
student whose oil and gas management position had paid him 
125000 if he a hydrogeology student starts out at 25000 
hell be lucky 
harvey vick decided to take the hydrogeology course even though 
he still works in the oil industry 
this is something to fall back on he said in case 
something does happen to my job

inquires cheerful host ann magnuson are we 
ready for something really avantgarde 
oh is it time for thirtysomething quips her companion 
shirley the newage goose 
but be assured the tip o the hat to that whiningyuppies show 
is as close as pbs variety show of the bizarre alive from off 
center will get to network television 
the anthologyvariety series a production of ktca in 
minneapolisst paul begins its fourth madcap season tonight with 
two segments a satirical look at the advertising industry by the 
producers of peewees playhouse and director julien temples 
bizarre and cynical visualization of verdis rigoletto from the 
anthology feature film aria 
avantgarde enough for ya 
if not tune in next week july 18 for alter image a 
collection of performanceart video selections by newwave british 
performers 
the first of these is a hilarious sendup love me 
gangster in highresolution blackandwhite against cartoon 
backdrops kind of a video comic strip a mob war ensues in 
nearly indecipherable cockney accents of course the violence has 
been precipitated by a typical love triangle in which a buxom babe 
inspires a lovestruck gangster to pant hysterically then rip off 
his clothes all his clothes in one big swoosh 
other segments include a music video rory mcleod the 
workingclass rapper and harmonica player who sings farewell 
welfare while walking through a cityscape and a punk 
choreography dancerumble with garbage cans dustbin dance 
next weeks installment is introduced by off center cohost 
photographer william wegman and his favorite subject his 
weimaraner fay ray 
tonights premiere starts off with bite and smile a clever 
little film that contains a lot of injokes about advertising 
lines like ok freelancer draw 
the original producers of peewees playhouse who obviously 
have spent plenty of time in the advertising milieu go wild with 
wacky characters and colorful crazy sets that change dimensions 
one character heads off in vain search of a washroom only to find 
the hallway shrinking until he comes to a dead end inside a 
miniature set on a soundstage where a television commercial is 
being filmed 
bite and smile is the name of a cookiesandcrackers 
product and the agency is trying to sell the uptight company 
president an ad campaign involving singing potatoes a concept he 
doesnt immediately grasp 
kids love talking potatoes insists the producer imagine 
potatoes begging kids to eat cookies and crackers 
the film by temple is from aria a feature movie made up of 
films by 10 directors set to different opera arias rigoletto 
is temples theme although his film has nothing to do with the 
plot of the opera buck henry and anita morris play an adulterous 
married couple who unbeknownst to each other steal off to the 
same motel for videotaped liaisons with their respective lovers 
temple shot the film at the madonna inn in san luis obispo 
calif a motel with more than 100 theme rooms including 
caveman suites with rock floors and walls 
future segments will include dance film video art and comedy 
so alive from off center will take viewers hungry for something

michael warren says he came up with the idea 
for a show called home free because his children were too young 
to watch him in the gritty police drama hill street blues 
i was on hill street for seven years he said playing 
officer bobby hill and my children never really got a chance to 
see it maybe its my ego but i wanted to do something they could 
see and enjoy 
i remember one day my sons class had career day they asked 
him what i did and he said actor but he didnt know what i did my 
daughters 11 and my sons 9 and hill street came on too late 
and was too real 
in home free which nbc will air wednesday warren plays a 
construction company executive who becomes the foster father of 
four boys a navy buddy played by trinidad silva takes over the 
cooking and looks after the boys a group of street kids black and 
white 
while he was filming the onehour pilot warren brought the 
dailies home for his daughter kao and son cash to watch 
i knew i was on to something when my daughter learned all the 
lines and wanted pictures of the boys he said my son with 
typical sibling rivalry was looking for some way to get even with 
her and put tacks in the pictures 
warren teams up again with mtm enterprises which produced hill 
street david milch a producer and writer on hill street is 
executive producer of home free and cowrote the script with 
john romano based on a concept by warren mark tinker directed 
the show was passed over as a series for the fall season but if 
it gets a high rating it may be picked up as a midseason 
replacement warren says he is enthusiastic about the shows 
chances 
this is a rare opportunity for the public to choose a show 
they can watch he said 
the idea for the show is that every family goes through 
change the kids i take in have been through a lot of change all 
negative in my household they experience the first stability 
loving and caring theyve had one of the older boys has reached an 
age when he has to leave and i have to make the younger kids 
understand its time for him to leave we present the idea of 
change being for the better 
warren says he sent a videocassette of the pilot to john wooden 
the retired ucla basketball coach warren had played for wooden in 
his years there 
john is the embodiment of what americas all about he said 
he loved the show hes not a big fan of television but he also 
understood the message of home free which is change and growth 
he was family to me so i want him to see things ive done and 
appreciate it i know he saw hill street blues once or twice 
because i was on it but it wasnt his kind of program 
warren at first considered a career in pro basketball i was 
drafted by the seattle supersonics he said they sent me a 
contract in the mail it was mimeographed with a place for me to 
write in my name i felt like it could have been addressed to 
occupant 
i felt id already proved myself as a basketball player they 
wanted me to try out and if i was accepted theyd pay me 10000 
i didnt know what id do with all that money so i declined 
warren began his acting career in commercials he had several 
stage roles and was in the movie butterflies are free he was a 
guest star in a number of series before becoming a regular in the 
1974 nbc series sierra as park service ranger pj lewis and 
in cbs 1979 show paris as officer willie miller

the sharp drop in official jobless figures 
inevitably will ignite a new flareup of inflation fears since 
inflation seems to be on everyones mind 
talk to car dealers and they say folks are buying because they 
feel prices are bargains relative to what they could be tomorrow 
ask real estate people and they say couples are buying to avoid 
higher interest rates later 
brokers give similar reasons for misgivings about the future of 
stock and bond markets economists cite inflation prospects as a 
reason for forecasting an end to expansion workers use it to win 
wage increases 
inflation is the allpurpose allamerican fear resurrected 
every time a new figure comes out of the washington numbers 
factories or oil prices rise or drought spreads through farmlands 
or consumer spending rises 
in part it is a legacy of the 1970s a time when inflation 
turned the ordinary persons economic world inside out and upside 
down making fortunes for borrowers while destroying savings 
accounts that had taken years to build 
but in spite of the fears devil inflation has not arisen from 
his den he has resisted the popular view time after time and 
there is a good chance he will continue to do so after examining 
the latest employment report 
when unemployment falls to what is thought of as the full 
employment level which is now estimated to be somewhere around 5 
percent pressure is expected on wage rates and rising wages are 
an indicator of inflation 
the latest report shows that civilian unemployment fell to 53 
percent in june from 56 percent in may a consequence mainly of a 
jump of 823000 in civilian employment an extreme and unexpected 
figure 
almost nobody foresaw anything of the sort especially since the 
jobless rate had risen in may by twotenths of a percentage point 
for it to fall one month later to the lowest figure in 14 years 
just didnt fit the pattern 
however a strong possibility exists that the pattern hasnt 
changed much if at all employment and jobless figures are subject 
to adjustments and these latest figures conceivably could be 
adjusted out of existence 
the big question mark concerns the methodology specifically the 
fact that the survey week occurred late in june when students high 
school and college graduates and seasonal workers were entering the 
labor market 
in some years this sort of influx could raise the jobless rates 
sharply for this reason if a person isnt actively seeking work 
he or she is not a member of the labor force they become members 
by actively looking for work 
in years of depressed economic activity therefore an influx of 
job seekers can raise the jobless rate but not this year sluggish 
as the economy is said to be business continues to expand create 
job openings and hire 
but of perhaps more importance is that opportunities abound 
these days for youngsters even those totally unskilled at retail 
outlets in some parts of the country in fact they are being 
offered wages well above the minimum 
many shopping centers are desperate for workers and reveal this 
urgency with helpwanted signs in display windows some must bus 
workers in from many miles away the international council of 
shopping centers estimates at least 100000 summer jobs are 
avilable most of them for teenagers 
could it be that the latest job survey occurred at the very time 
these jobs were being filled as the figures are analyzed it is 
likely that this factor will be considered not just possible but 
probable 
the labor department itself seems to suggest that much in 
pointing out that about threequarters of the increase in jobs came 
in the 16 to 24yearold age group 
another factor one that has occurred before could be involved 
in the may count civilian employment dropped by 518000 jobs 
in june employment rose by 823000 did such a extreme dip and 
rise actually occur or was there a bug in the methodology 
dont jump to conclusions about imminent inflation even if 
some of the socalled authorities do

three decades after jasper johns sent arts 
avantegarde spinning off in new directions the worlds most 
expensive living artist is winning new acclaim at the prestigious 
venice biennale 
but although the american captured this years grand prix an 
award previously won by such artists as henri matisse and max 
ernst some experts feel compelled to defend the choice 
there is an incredibly widespread assumption that johns is an 
old master and a pop artist assumptions that pigeonhole him that 
do not recognize he is an artist in his prime said philip ryland 
of the peggy guggenheim collection in venice reacting to what he 
called superficial criticism of the show 
since its beginning in 1895 the biennale has enhanced the 
reputations of artists generally not widely known outside their own 
countries 
henry moores international reputation was established by 
winning the grand prix for sculpture in 1948 said ryland 
johns doesnt need the biennale to reaffirm his role in 20th 
century art his importance is demonstrated by the price he 
commands his painting diver sold for 42 million the highest 
price paid for a work by a living artist 
about 300000 people are expected to visit the international 
exposition before it closes sept 25 many will see johns work for 
the first time some will come because he won the prize others 
because the domed pink brick us pavilion is the only one air 
conditioned among the 25 nestled in the biennale gardens which 
overlook the lagoon 
ryland said johns is seen in this show at his high point with 
his crosshatch paintings and his most explicitly autobiographical 
work 
what this show reveals not only for europeans is how far 
johns has developed from a few flags targets and numbers ryland 
said in an interview 
johns and others such as robert rauschenberg who won the 
biennales grand prix in 1964 created an alternative to abstract 
expressionism the dominant american style of the 1940s and 50s 
at his first show in january 1958 johns heralded the pop art 
movement of the 60s with his paintings of common objects american 
flags targets and numbers 
some said art had been thrown back into the world of common 
images ryland said but the theft was in the opposite 
direction it was a theft of popular images he dragged the flag 
into the world of art 
now 30 years after that dramatic opening at the castelli 
gallery in new york johns wins the golden lion in venice one 
of the worlds most influential exhibitions of modern art 
it was important to give the prize to jasper johns said 
adriano donaggio the spokesman for the biennale he has been a 
leader of his generation but he never got the prize 
both donaggio and ryland emphasized that his career was only one 
consideration made by the international jury and that the most 
important was the show at the biennale 
the show put together by the philadelphia museum of art is the 
first major exhibition for johns since the retrospective that 
opened at the whitney museum of american art in new york in 1977 
johns works and reworks his surfaces using oil and encaustic a 
mixture of colored pigment in hot wax he also evokes dreamlike 
images with ink on plastic 
his show is outstanding ryland said in pictorial terms 
it is much better than anything else in the biennale 
he added that other renowned artists such as cy twombly enzo 
cucchi and alberto burri were weakly represented at this biennale 
johns works demonstrate his progression over the last 15 years 
from the crosshatch and flagstone patterns of the 70s to the 
autobiographical paintings of the 1980s 
the works in the show also include scent the first devoted 
entirely to the crosshatch style the painting is done in oil and 
encaustic on three canvases in bright bold interlocking groups of 
strokes at various opposing angles 
racing thoughts and the seasons are johns most 
autobiographical presenting images closely linked to the artist 
such as a picture of leo castelli who gave him his first show 
pottery from his own collection the double flag and a printed 
image of the mona lisa that recalls his affection for both marcel 
duchamp and leonardo da vinci 
in the seasons four paintings done in 198586 johns also 
puts himself in his work for the first time by putting his shadow 
among the images 
in addition to the work of johns and other established artists 
from 44 countries are 86 young artists in the open section 
there are artists here that in 10 years will be household 
names said ryland 
one could be barbara bloom the american who won this years 
prize for the open section

the grass is green in liberal kan in amarillo texas a 
meteorologist says were in good shape folks in beaver 
okla were inundated last week by six inches of rain from a single 
storm 
as much of the nation is parched by drought much of the dust 
bowl the 97 millionacre confluence of new mexico texas 
oklahoma colorado and kansas that turned to desert a half century 
ago has been spared 
were above seasonal rainfall were in good shape very good 
shape said gary hartley of the national weather service in 
amarillo 
but blue skies and healthy crops give little comfort to gilbert 
steinkuehler 73 he was a teenager in the 1930s working on the 
family farm in goodwell okla when the region suffered an 
extended drought 
fertile soil dried to fine dust that was picked up by scouring 
winds creating black blizzards that rolled across the plains 
millions of tons of topsoil were simply lifted off the land 
and steinkuehler is certain that the same conditions could bring 
those days back again theres not much you can do when theres 
no water he said 
in 1932 and 1933 the annual rainfall in goodwell was nine 
inches below average for seven or eight years we had no 
crops steinkuehler said 
for much of the 1930s street lights illuminated the 
thoroughfares of the dust bowl at midday trains collided in dust 
clouds chickens roosted at noon 
the dawn came but no day wrote john steinbeck in the 
grapes of wrath the classic novel of the dust bowl 
homemakers in the dust bowl turned plates and cups upside down 
on the table until meals were served to keep them clean in 1935 
an enterprising carpet sweeper used his vacuum to clean attics he 
removed an average of two tons of dust from each of 227 attics in 
southwestern kansas 
all we could do was just sit in our dusty chairs and gaze at 
each other through the fog that filled the room and watch the fog 
settle slowly and silently covering everything said one woman 
from garden city kan 
shutting doors and windows tightly didnt help after the storm 
our faces were as dirty as if we had rolled in the dirt our hair 
was gray and stiff and we ground dirt between our teeth she said 
texas state senators wore surgical masks while debating 
legislation respiratory infections claimed scores of lives 
especially among the very old and very young others died a young 
boy walking home from school near hays kan lost his way he was 
found smothered by dust the next day 
we long for the garden and little chickens the trees and 
birds and wildflowers of the years gone by perhaps if we do our 
part these good things may return someday for others if not 
ourselves wrote caroline a henderson a 28yearold resident of 
alva okla in 1936 
some like steinbecks joad family couldnt wait in 1936 a 
survey found that one in four dwellings in 45 dust bowl counties 
had been vacated in the previous three years in six townships of 
oklahomas cimarron county all but three of the 40 farm families 
left for wetter parts 
the dust bowl lost people but it also lost soil at a rate of 
850000000 tons a year on april 12 1934 a storm removed 300 
million tons of soil within days that dust left a film on the 
presidents desk in washington on store shelves in new york city 
and on ships 500 miles out in the atlantic ocean 
r douglas hurt associate director of the missouri state 
historical society and author of the dust bowl an agricultural 
and social history says droughts in that area are cyclical and 
the local soil is of a type that tends to break down into tiny 
particles in the absence of moisture 
the big dust storms of the 1930s hurt says can be traced to 
world war i when wheat prices soared prices dropped during the 
early 1920s and farmers tried to recoup by planting more fields 
aided by new power machinery 
in so doing hurt says the farmers also were planting the seeds 
of their own destruction once the sod was broken and the soil was 
plowed repeatedly it was exposed to the wind the drought came 
the crops died and without roots to hold the soil it blew away 
in the best of times relatively few farmers practiced soil 
conservation measures such as terracing and strip cropping hurt 
says but then a bumper wheat crop in 1931 caused prices to drop 
and even good farmers put aside conservation measures to try to 
grow more wheat 
could it happen again 
i think its possible but i also think its unlikely if 
farmers have learned anything from the past and i think they have 
farmers today have the technical capabilities to handle their 
fields properly said hurt 
soil conservation has become a fact of life irrigation is more 
prevalent and landgrant universities have brought forth a 
different kind of farmer i think our farmers are too well 
educated to let it happen again said emma love 89 a oklahoma 
panhandle resident since 1905 
mrs love remembers days as black as night her father was 
in real estate and our real estate sure was blowing around 
she remembers the time her mother went to a jackrabbit roundup 
the creatures proliferated during the dirty 30s and was caught 
in a duster she told god that if she got out of it shed never 
go to another 
she looks around today and sees dust bowl survivors who stuck 
it out they and their children she says know enough to protect 
the land 
still she said if theres someone who isnt taking care of 
his land that place blows

controversy over the safety of the suzuki 
samurai has accentuated a deep rift among american opinion leaders 
and the general public over a basic question what is safe 
consumer reports says the jeeplike samurai is too tall narrow 
light and short and thus tips over too easily when the driver 
swerves back and forth at high speed 
supporters say that although the samurais high center of 
gravity makes it tippier than some other vehicles it is safe in 
the hands of a competent driver 
theres no easy definition of what safe or unsafe is its 
really a continuum jeffrey miller deputy administrator of the 
national highway traffic safety administration said in a recent 
interview 
the conflict between consumerists and auto enthusiasts runs 
through the public at large said john staudenmaier a professor of 
history and technology at the university of detroit 
one approach says the design ought to make it nearly 
impossible to have an accident staudenmaier said but auto 
buffs would tend to say were not idiots 
americans make decisions about safety every time they choose 
between a car and a motorcycle or between a big heavy car and a 
small light one 
unfortunately for suzuki consumers judgments about the samurai 
have been powerfully influenced by television news clips supplied 
by consumers union that show the samurai tipping over onto its 
outriggers 
for some people the visual impact tends to overwhelm american 
suzuki motor corps recitation of favorable accident statistics 
and its counterargument that nearly any vehicle can be made to tip 
over by extreme driving maneuvers 
the fourwheeldrive samurai became one of the hottest imports 
in 1986 and 1987 because of its emotional appeal as a fun jazzy 
and liberated little box on wheels 
the charm faded in june as sales of the samurai plunged 706 
percent from their levels of a year earlier it was mainly a 
reaction to the june 2 report by consumers union the mount vernon 
nybased publisher of consumer reports 
suzuki dealers are hoping sales will recover gradually in coming 
months but that will depend partly on how often the infamous 
videotape reappears on the evening news 
editors of auto magazines tend to say that the primary 
responsibility for car safety should fall on the driver rather than 
the automaker 
any car has design intent if the design intent is exceeded 
the car is going to do something weird and spooky said dennis 
simanaitis executive editor of road amp track 
the samurai had to be built high off the ground because it is 
used offroad simanaitis said a vehicle that can drive over 
boulders and logs is by nature tippier than a lowslung sports car 
if suzuki gave no warnings it would be different but they 
have disclaimers galore simanaitis said 
suzukis television ads quote a 1986 article by car and driver 
that said if you want a rugged fourwheeldrive for the minimum 
amount of money the samurai is the only game in town 
william jeanes the magazines editor said he stands behind 
that statement 
i think every car taken to extremes can do something 
dangerous jeanes said how high is too high for a center of 
gravity i dont know the answer to that 
road amp tracks own road test did not include the swerving 
maneuver in which consumers union got the samurai to tip over 
simanaitis said he found no fault with the consumers union test but 
added if i look around hard enough i can find a test that will 
embarrass almost any vehicle except an outandout race car 
consumers union is calling on the government to develop 
industrywide standards for for a national standard on resistance to 
rollovers but the national highway traffic safety administration 
has resisted that approach in the past 
a strict formula for height weight and other characteristics 
could have the effect of banning certain classes of vehicles and 
courts have ruled that the federal agency should go to great 
lengths to avoid that miller said 
miller said the national highway traffic safety administration 
is seeking ways aside from design rules that would lessen rollover 
problems such as improving brakes 
we recognize that there are a wide variety of vehicles and 
you dont want to deprive people of vehicles that they need or want 
to use whether its for work or for pleasure he said

the nations largest general retailers report that their sales 
improved in june following dismal performances in april and may 
but industry analysts say consumers still are spending cautiously 
as they have all year 
its a reprieve jeffrey edelman an analyst with drexel 
burnham lambert inc said thursday after reviewing the june 
numbers it does not say the consumer is going on a wild spending 
spree 
its not a great environment but things are better than they 
were said linda kristiansen an analyst with the investment firm 
dean witter reynolds inc 
industrywide sales were up between 35 percent and 4 percent 
last month and have risen about 25 percent so far this year ms 
kristiansen said 
in reaching those estimates she considered what retailers call 
samestore sales those from stores open at least a year analysts 
believe samestore sales give a more accurate picture of a 
retailers performance than totals that include figures from new 
stores 
analysts said the belated arrival of hot weather lured consumers 
into stores to buy summer clothing and seasonal items such as 
garden equipment and outdoor barbecues 
walter loeb who tracks retailers for morgan stanley amp co said 
sales were aided by the markdowns retailers continued to take to 
clear their inventories analysts were watching closely for any 
effect on sales from the midwestern drought monroe h greenstein 
an analyst with bear stearns amp co said sales volume was 
unaffected last month but could be in july 
retailers generally have been disappointed by 1988 sales which 
have not kept pace with inflation consumer prices rose at an 
annual rate of 44 percent through may according to labor 
department figures 
stores have been slumping for more than a year because of 
economic uncertainty and disappointment with current fashions 
sales worsened in april and may with cold and wet weather blamed 
for the deterioration 
edelman said the sales pickup so far was principally 
weatherrelated 
morgan stanleys loeb was more optimistic although sales were 
up only moderately last month it certainly points to a better 
fall season he said 
storeowners and investors watch sales figures for an indication 
of retailers earnings while economists monitor the results as a 
barometer of economic health consumer spending accounts for 
twothirds of the gross national product 
sears roebuck and co the nations largest retailer said its 
overall sales were up 98 percent in june from yearearlier levels 
and rose 5 percent for the first 22 weeks of the fiscal year 
sears samestore sales were up 51 percent last month and 2 
percent for the year so far 
k mart corp said its overall june sales rose 7 percent while 
yeartodate sales were up 53 percent samestore sales rose 29 
percent last month and 2 percent so far this year 
walmart stores inc said its overall sales rose 32 percent in 
both june and the year to date samestore sales were up 13 percent 
in june and 12 percent for the five months 
jc penney co inc reported its overall sales rose 34 percent 
last month and 26 percent for the 22 weeks samestore sales rose 
3 percent in june and 16 percent for the year so far 
dayton hudson corp said its overall june sales rose 196 
percent and its yeartodate sales were up 184 percent samestore 
sales increased 33 percent in june and 19 percent for the year to 
date 
may department stores co said its overall sales rose 223 
percent last month and 101 percent for the year so far its 
samestore sales were up 48 percent for june and 08 percent for 
the 22week period 
fw woolworth co reported sales increases of 117 in june and 
121 percent for the year to date 
montgomery ward amp co said its june sales were up 36 percent 
and yeartodate sales rose 31 percent 
the results reported thursday are from general and apparel 
retailers unlike the monthly retail sales report issued by the 
commerce department they do not include sales of car dealers 
supermarkets or restaurants

yoshiaki tsutsumi is a bit poorer than he was 
last year make that less wealthy but the japanese railroad 
magnate still ranks as the worlds richest person according to 
forbes magazine 
tsutsumi head of japans seibu railway group has a personal 
net worth of at least 189 billion making him the worlds richest 
person for the second straight year forbes said thursday 
the magazine in a report on the richest people outside the 
united states estimated tsutsumis fortune at approximately 20 
billion last fall in its first survey of the worlds richest people 
the story appears in the magazines july 25 issue 
the designation for tsutsumi again puts forbes at odds with 
fortune magazine in its compilation of the worlds billionaires 
last october fortune estimated tsutsumis holdings in railroads 
hotels and golf clubs were worth a far smaller but still 
substantial 25 billion 
the second richest person on forbes list is also japanese 
taikichiro mori a former economics professor who owns 68 office 
buildings in tokyo is worth 18 billion the magazine estimated 
in the previous survey moris fortune was put at 15 billion 
following the two japanese are the reichmann brothers of canada 
who have built a 9 billion fortune in real estate forbes said 
shin kyukho a south korean with interests in candy making 
hotels and real estate is ranked no 4 8 billionplus and 
kenneth cole irving a canadian with interests in oil distribution 
paper and land is no 5 8 billion 
the survey identifies 119 nonamerican individuals or families 
around the world whose personal net assets are worth more than 1 
billion up from 90 in the previous list 
the united states still accounts for more billionaires than any 
other country forbes noted the magazine said at least 47 american 
individuals and 20 us families are worth more than 1 billion 
compared with 32 individuals and families in secondplace japan and 
16 in thirdranked west germany 
the leading american billionaire is sam walton the head of 
major retailer walmart stores who ranks seventh worldwide with a 
net worth of 65 billion forbes estimates 
not all the fortunes listed in forbes list were amassed in a 
respectable way 
three of them belong to people the magazine identified as 
colombian drug dealers two individuals and one family who are all 
part of the notorious medellin cocaine cartel 
two of the colombian cocaine fortunes those of pablo escobar 
gaviria and the ochoa family are each more than 2 billion forbes 
said it estimated the third amassed by gonzalo rodriguez gacha 
at between 13 billion and 3 billion

after months of delay and makeshift changes 
aimed at preventing another stock crash the two leading us 
financial markets have devised a joint plan of reforms they hope 
will lure back frightened investors 
the proposal announced thursday by the new york stock exchange 
and chicago mercantile exchange included priority treatment for 
individuals in the marketplace and an experimental system of 
coordinated trading halts triggered by a 250point drop in the dow 
jones industrial average 
the boards of both exchanges also said they would develop a 
joint policy regarding frontrunning a controversial practice 
in which traders execute an order in one market based on prior 
knowledge of an order in another market 
frontrunning has been blamed for aggravating volatility in the 
stock market and has been criticized by many investors and some 
lawmakers as a form of insider trading because it is based on 
knowledge not available to all 
the joint announcement by the new york and chicago exchanges 
addressed many key issues raised by government studies on the 
causes of the october crash such as the brady commission appointed 
by president reagan particularly the need for intermarket 
cooperation 
previously the exchanges had undertaken limited steps largely 
on their own or argued that additional regulations would hamper 
their postcrash recovery 
the announcement also reflected a growing concern in the 
securities industry about the prolonged absence of individual 
investors who have remained reluctant to participate in markets 
since the record 508point plunge in the dow average on black 
monday oct 19 for fear they are unsafe and unfair 
markets have returned to more normal patterns but there is 
still a perception that individuals are at a disadvantage in 
todays highspeed markets nyse chairman john phelan said in a 
joint statement with cme chairman leo melamed the initiatives 
approved by the boards should overcome that concern 
we have developed a program of coordinated procedures which 
serve the current needs of financial markets melamed said 
these combined initiatives demonstrate our commitment to serving 
the needs of all investors and ensuring a level playing field for 
all market participants 
all the initiatives must be approved by the securities and 
exchange commission which oversees the nations stock markets and 
the commodities futures trading commission which regulates the 
futures markets 
the steps include a new express lane system for expediting 
orders of individual investors to the nyse floor on heavy trading 
days during the crash many individuals were unable to sell their 
stock quickly because the markets system was clogged with sell 
orders from large institutional investors 
both exchanges also proposed a oneyear experimental system of 
coordinated circuit breaker mechanisms to forestall panicky 
selling when the dow average is falling rapidly 
under this system which must be approved by other exchanges in 
addition to the federal regulators all trading on the nyse would 
be halted for an hour if the dow average falls 250 points and for 
an additional two hours if the average falls an additional 150 
points the same day 
at the cme the key standard amp poors 500 stockindex future 
could fall a maximum 30 points before trading was halted in that 
market a further twohour halt would be called if the sampp index 
future fell another 20 points the same day 
because a onepoint drop in the sampp index equals approximately 
an eightpoint fall in the dow average the practical effect will 
be coordinated halts in both exchanges market officials familiar 
with the proposal said the two exchanges jointly would manage the 
exact timing of such halts 
the experimental reforms are aimed at taming the wild price 
swings that some crash studies have attributed to a trading method 
called index arbitrage in which brokerages use computers to sell 
huge blocks of stocks and buy stockindex futures or vice versa 
to profit from momentary price discrepancies 
the reforms would supercede a temporary nyse measure implemented 
in february called the collar which banned use of the nyses 
computer system for index arbitrage when the dow average rose or 
fell 50 points from the previous close some critics said the 
collar actually worsened volatility by severing an important link 
between the new york and chicago markets 
wall street firms reacted favorably to the joint announcement 
with many welcoming any step aimed at improving investor confidence

the nations june unemployment rate fell to 53 percent its 
best level in nearly 14 years as youths flooded the job market 
and found a wealth of opportunity the government reported today 
the 03percentagepoint improvement from the previous month 
marked the first time the rate has dipped so strongly since 1986 
and sent it to its lowest since joblessness stood at 51 percent in 
may 1974 
the labor department said seasonally adjusted employment in june 
jumped by 820000 75 percent of it among youths 1624 years old 
to more than offset mays decline of 536000 
unemployment among teenagers fell 20 percentage points to 136 
percent its lowest since 1970 
analysts had anticipated a surge in youth employment in the 
tourism industry as unprecedented numbers of foreigners buoyed by 
the devalued dollar are vacationing in the united states this 
summer 
on thursday in the financial markets stock prices lost ground 
for the second straight session but finished well above their 
midday lows the dow jones average of 30 industrials down more 
than 20 points at one stage closed with a 747 loss at 212269 
analysts blamed the markets downturn partly on the recent rise 
of interest rates in the credit markets yields on longterm 
treasury bonds have climbed lately back above 9 percent driven 
largely by recurring worries about inflation 
those worries were refueled somewhat thursday when oil prices 
surged in erratic trading they later settled below their peaks as 
traders assessed the impact of a rig explosion in the north sea and 
the chances for an emergency opec meeting 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for august 
delivery of west texas intermediate the us benchmark crude oil 
settled 47 cents higher at 1583 a barrel the contract traded as 
high as 1635 per barrel during the volatile session 
however prices of key farm commodities plummeted as some 
private forecasters predicted rain this weekend in the 
droughtparched farm belt 
despite the june boost in retail sales industry analysts 
remained generally cautious about the outlook for consumer 
spending which accounts for about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity 
its not a great environment but things are better than they 
were said linda kristiansen an analyst with the investment firm 
dean witter reynolds inc 
walter loeb who tracks retailers for morgan stanley amp co 
said there was a modest increase in retail sales as hot 
weather gave consumers an impetus to buy summer clothing other 
seasonal items such as garden equipment and outdoor barbecues 
also sold well analysts said 
sales were aided by the markdowns retailers continued to take to 
clear their inventories loeb said 
the analysts were watching closely for any effect on sales from 
the midwestern drought

agriculture secretary richard lyng said today 
that congress has enough money available to provide generous and 
compassionate relief for doughtstricken farmers but that not 
all of those affected will survive 
lyng who said after a meeting with six farmstate governors 
that special droughtrelief legislation is needed urgently 
commented on the nbctv today show that the money still wont 
do the thing thats really needed and provide rain 
congressional committees are to start work next week on a 
drought relief package 
we will attempt to have legislation prepared and introduced 
if not monday then hopefully tuesday the house agriculture 
committee chairman rep e kika de la garza dtexas said 
thursday 
lyng said today that surplus feed is available to farmers in 
1800 counties with more counties to be added next week 
he said there is about 17 billion in the budget for farmers 
including money already committed to crop insurance programs 
i think there will be a sufficient amount to have a generous 
and compassionate program of assistance he said 
lyng said however that farmers who have no reserves and that 
those who were heavily in debt before the drought probably will not 
survive 
a situation like this comes along and it becomes very 
difficult to provide enough income to take care of the debt load 
they have and keep them going he said without estimating how 
many farms might fail as a result of the drought 
lyng had been saying lawmakers should monitor the drought but 
hold off on a relief bill until more was known about the extent of 
the damage but authorities are now forecasting serious reductions 
in corn yields unless the midwest gets substantial rain this week 
theres a need to do something it would probably take 
legislation to do that and theres a need to do it with some 
urgency lyng said he also said there is a good chance president 
reagan will give his approval to such a measure 
im confident that he has enough compassion that if we can get 
a bill that is reasonable and is compassionate and helpful to the 
farmers that the president will accept it lyng said 
north dakota gov george sinner chairman of the meeting said 
governors and lawmakers had reached tentative agreement with lyng 
on some basic outlines of legislation 
under the blueprint he said the legislation should be 
evenhanded toward farmers whose crops are covered by farm programs 
and growers of socalled nonprogram crops 
he said it also should not require farmers to refund any part of 
their socalled deficiency payments and should distribute among 
droughtstricken farmers the money that the government now expects 
to save because of the smaller size of the harvest 
deficiency payments are incomesupport payments that represent 
the difference between the prices that farmers get for their crops 
at market and target prices that are set by congress and adjusted 
annually by the secretary of agriculture 
the expected smaller harvest has driven up prices and thus 
narrowed the gap between the market and targetprice levels this 
translates into smaller deficiency payments and a resulting major 
savings for the government from the 17 billion it has budgeted for 
farm subsidies 
but the increase in market prices comes while some crops are 
being wiped out leaving farmers with nothing to take to market 
to complicate matters 40 percent of these deficiency payments 
have been sent to farmers in advance since the amount of the 
payment also is based on the projected size of the harvest some 
farmers might have to refund a portion of what they already have 
received 
i think it would be very difficult to collect advance 
deficiency payments from farmers who have no income lyng said 
sinner urged a bipartisan effort to speed work on the 
legislation 
we absolutely must avoid political bargaining over which party 
is going to grant the most help to farmers he said we are 
going to try desperately to get a consensus on legislation and not 
have a lot of bickering within the halls of congress whether we 
can do that is a tough question but we are going to try 
governors warned the drought is worsening 
its a critical time when the corn is tasseling and were in 
the pollinating stage said iowa gov terry branstad every day 
that goes by we see a substantial reduction in yields 
gov john ashcroft of missouri said farmers in his state will 
face real economic disaster unless relief is granted 
also on hand were govs george mikelson of south dakota rudolph 
perpich of minnesota and james martin of north carolina officials 
of seven other states also attended the session

a federal judge has refused a government request 
to appoint a watchdog for allegedly corrupt locals of the 
international brotherhood of teamsters 
but the judge allowed prosecutors an early trial date for the 
massive civil racketeering case 
us district judge david edelstein on thursday set feb 27 
1989 for the governments lawsuit to oust reputed mafiadominated 
members of the teamsters executive board 
edelstein also indefinitely continued a temporary restraining 
order he issued at the governments request last week and which had 
been due to expire friday the order barred the executive board 
from either making large expenditures of union funds or destroying 
union records 
federal prosecutors had sought a preliminary injunction that 
among other things would have created one or more courtappointed 
liaison officers to police corruption among the hundreds of locals 
in the 16 millionmember union 
us attorney rudolph giuliani however did not see the ruling 
as a setback 
the court has extended the temporary restraining order until 
the time of the trial and has set the trial schedule on the fast 
track that we asked for said giuliani whose office brought the 
lawsuit last week from our point of view this achieves almost 
everything we wanted to get 
losing the bid for the liaison officers was not problem said 
giuliani since we have a quick trial date 
there was no answer at teamsters headquarters in washington when 
called for comment 
the liaison officers also would have been empowered to appoint 
trustees to run corrupt teamsters locals and review expenditures 
and union constitution changes by the executive board 
but teamsters attorney john r climaco asked edelstein earlier 
this week to give the union more time to counter what we consider 
the false and shameful allegations by the government 
edelstein concluded that it would clearly be imprudent to 
grant the preliminary relief sought by the government without an 
evidentiary hearing 
but he added it is apparent that the legal and factual 
questions presented by this case require more time to prepare than 
the time within which a preliminary injunction hearing would 
typically be heard 
instead edelstein decided to combine the hearing with the trial 
on the governments lawsuit 
the massive lawsuit claimed mobsters wielding influence over 
the executive board have deprived union members of their rights 
through shootings bombings beatings and a campaign of fear 
bribes extortion and theft

encouraged by brisk economic activity and strong 
earnings growth corporate america has lately been increasing the 
dividends it pays at a steppedup pace 
but some wall street analysts argue that dividends have not been 
growing fast enough to provide much support for a continuing 
recovery in the stock market from last years crash 
the number of companies raising their dividends in june reached 
106 this year a 19 percent increase from 89 in the june 1987 
according to standard amp poors corp 
for the first six months of 1988 there were 893 increases 
compared with 863 in the like period last year and 829 in the first 
half of 1986 
furthermore says arnold kaufman editor of sampps investment 
advisory publication the outlook the increases this year are 
running larger than usual 
kaufman estimates that dividends paid by companies represented 
in sampps 500stock composite index will grow 10 percent in 1988 
for the largest increase in recent years 
thats all very nice say some skeptics about stockmarket 
prospects but it doesnt look so impressive when you consider the 
competition stocks face from interestbearing investments and the 
possibility that the inflation rate might be picking up 
as of early this month the 30 stocks in the dow jones 
industrial average had an aggregate yield of 35 percent 
that is substantially higher than the levels below 3 percent 
that prevailed last summer when the market was headed for big 
trouble but it is still low by historical standards 
a stockmarket bull might well argue that dividends are just one 
of many factors that influence stock prices and a relatively minor 
force at best certainly most stock investors are less 
yieldconscious than people who put their money in bonds 
a case can also be made that anticipation of future growth in 
earnings and dividends can justify a relatively low current yield 
still dividend yield has long been used as one primary 
yardstick to measure whether stocks are cheap fairly priced or 
overvalued 
and of course dividends are a component of the total return 
professional money managers look for from their portfolios 
in theory at least stocks must pay their holders a premium in 
their combined capital gains and dividends over the interest 
payments available on highgrade bonds otherwise why take the 
extra risk that comes with stock investments 
as reported in barrons magazine the interest yield on 
topgrade corporate bonds stood recently at 944 percent 594 
percentage points above the stock yield 
that left the socalled stockbond yield spread not very much 
narrower than the gap of 643 percentage points that existed a year 
ago 
no single indicator like comparative yields can provide any 
surefire answer to the future course of stock prices however the 
pessimists warn that current stock yields dont provide much of a 
cushion should inflation increase interest rates go higher or 
both 
the greater the stockbond yield spread they point out the 
more stocks would have to rise in price just to match the more 
certain return available from bond interest payments 
how to shrink the stockbond spread a decline in stock prices 
would be one way a lot of investors would prefer to see it 
accomplished less painfully perhaps by a combination of falling 
interest rates and a continued rise in dividends

financier marvin warner was stunned 
by a jury verdict requiring him to pay 226 million for 
fraudulently removing money from a failing securities dealer while 
his attorney challenged the jurys competence to decide the complex 
case 
but thomas tew bankruptcy trustee for the failed esm government 
securities hailed thursdays verdict in his civil suit against 
warner as a slam dunk 
the sixmember federal jury was asked to decide 22 questions as 
tew accused warner of fraudulently withdrawing money from esm when 
he knew the firm was in dire financial trouble tew also charged 
warner with profiting from insider information and loaning esm 
money in exchange for profits on bogus financial transactions 
we had to get 19 questions answered our way before we got a 
penny and they only had to get three questions answered their way 
to win across the board tew said but we got 22 out of 22 
right it was a slam dunk 
esm failed in 1985 with 315 million in losses warners 
cincinnatibased thrift home state savings bank was esms biggest 
customer and collapsed days later triggering a savings and loan 
panic in ohio 
warner 69 a former us ambassador to switzerland who now 
lives on an ocala horse ranch promised an appeal he was visibly 
upset when he heard the verdict and said im stunned terribly 
last year warner was acquitted of federal criminal charges but 
convicted of state charges in ohio and sentenced to three years in 
connection with home states collapse he is free while appealing 
that conviction 
warners attorney andrew hall said thursdays verdict was 
clearly a decision based on court passion clearly the jury did 
not understand what this case was about 
the lawsuit claimed warner violated securities racketeering and 
civil theft statutes to unjustly profit from esms failure 
warner won a strategic victory on the final day of testimony 
when us district judge jose gonzalez jr ruled the plaintiff had 
not proven warner was involved in securities fraud 
before the verdict warner said regardless of the financial 
outcome what that judge did vindicated me 
but the jury found that warner actually participated in the 
fraudulent purpose of esm 
he held a personal account at esm and encouraged home state to 
invest with the obscure fort lauderdale firm 
tews lawyers claimed warner was an insider at esm who demanded 
and was given special treatment because of home states huge 
investments 
but hall depicted warner as the largest single victim of esms 
fraud if you are a victim how can you be an insider 
tew has charged that warner who filed for reorganization under 
federal bankruptcy laws has placed his fortune in his familys 
name to protect his funds from courtordered penalties

coming down the rural road off pitcher 
mountain onto state route 10 into marlow population 551 pc 
connection is easy to find but hard to believe 
what is one of the nations fastestgrowing companies purveyor 
of mailorder computer software and accessories doing in a place 
like this 
the general store vics lunch and the statue of a soldier in 
the center of town are within walking distance employees can fish 
in season of course on their lunch hour in the ashuelot river 
running alongside the modest twostory frame building the worst 
traffic comes from mosquitoes and black flies 
far away are the glitzy hightech worlds of silicon valley in 
california and route 128 outside boston 
but to hear pat gallup talk rural new hampshire is the perfect 
setting for a company with a raccoon for a logo a historian on the 
staff and 18000 corporate accounts and why should anyone be 
surprised that at age 34 with a background in archeology she is 
president of a company that grossed 60 million in 1986 and an 
estimated 100 million in 1987 
gallup and david hall 39 cofounder and chief executive 
officer were in the right place at the right time with the right 
idea when they started pc connection in 1982 and grossed 233000 
we were the first to specialize in pc products and service 
gallup said 
receipts reached 8 million in 1983 and have kept growing 
last december inc magazine listed pc connection as the second 
fastestgrowing firm in the country in 1986 also last december a 
pc magazine survey of companies and individuals making mailorder 
purchases gave pc connection better ratings for service prices and 
reputation than any other mailorder company 
for example salespeople handling telephones are all college 
graduates working on salary no commission no pressure selling 
and all are trained to understand the products gallup says 
order a product from pc connection before 8 pm and it will 
arrive the next day the shipping charge is 3 regardless of 
destination 
and with every hard disk drive the customer gets a 90minute 
videotape with 15 minutes of instruction 75 minutes blank we 
tell them to erase the tape when theyre finished and use it for a 
movie gallup said 
peter haas director of customer affairs has been with the 
company for five years he says many of the companys ideas are 
based on bad experiences with other companies 
a lot of our competitors think price alone and sell short on 
service haas said 
the emphasis on detail is expensive he says but it pays off in 
reorders from satisfied customers 
the companys distinctive tastes extend to its physical plant 
in addition to expanding its 50000squarefoot headquarters at a 
cost of 500000 the company has undertaken a 1 million 
renovation of the historic 155yearold christmas tree inn across 
route 10 and has invested 15 million in a video studio in newport 
when it opens next year the inn will be a retail showroom and a 
training facility for businesses to acquaint themselves with pc 
connection products the studio will produce videos that can be 
transmitted by satellite directly to corporations for training 
neither studio nor inn are expected to produce revenue instead 
they are designed to enhance product support for pc connection 
customers 
with her interest in archeology gallup hired a historian to 
make certain that renovations to the 13000squarefoot victorian 
inn conform with the way the inn looked at the turn of the century 
all these unusual undertakings started with a chance meeting of 
two backpackers at bishbash falls on the appalachian trail in 1975 
gallup of mansfield conn was at the university of connecticut 
hall a chemical engineering major from the university of new 
hampshire whose family moved from new york to gilsum nh in the 
1960s was working in the family business making broadcasting and 
recording equipment 
gallup worked in archeology for a few years after college before 
hall persuaded her to come to gilsum to work in personnel public 
relations and advertising in the audio shop which was moved to 
marlow in 1980 
they got interested in personal computers but had difficulty 
getting uptodate information in the fastgrowing industry 
we saw the need to put all the information and the product in 
one place gallup said

inc in chicago

remained hot and dry and lespinasse wasnt making any predictions 
about the markets performance 
the market is perplexing he said its inexplicable why 
we went down so hard when there isnt that much rain around and the

oil futures retreated today in the wake of 
thursdays sharp advance that was sparked by confusion over a rig 
explosion in the north sea and speculation over the chances for an 
emergency opec meeting 
by midday on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for 
august delivery of west texas intermediate crude oil fell 27 cents 
to 1556 per 42gallon barrel after closing 47 cents higher on 
thursday the contract had traded as high as 1635 per barrel 
during that session 
among refined products traded on the exchange today unleaded 
gasoline was off 017 cent a gallon at 5295 cents after settling 
256 cents higher on thursday 
home heating oil which advanced 168 cents a gallon to 4429 
cents in the previous session slipped 059 cent to 4370 cents 
peter beutel an oil analyst with elders futures inc said 
todays price decline was the result of some profittaking and a 
general correction from thursdays overbought condition 
it may be a case of calmer heads prevailing today he said 
i think a lot of people felt it was overdone 
on thursday the news of an oil rig explosion off the coast of 
scotland was the beginning reason for hysteria in the oil 
futures markets said john oconnell senior energy analyst at 
refco inc 
prices rose sharply as traders reacted to reports that the 
explosion would affect about 12 percent of total north sea 
production or as much as 300000 barrels of oil per day 
that sounds very very impressive but its really 
insignificant its a very small amount of world production and 
crude contracts began to ease once traders put the incident into 
perspective oconnell said 
gasoline prices rose sharply following a report by the american 
petroleum institute late wednesday that us inventories of 
unleaded gasoline declined by 5 million barrels in the previous 
week 
bob baker senior energy analyst at prudentialbache securities 
inc attributed the decline to higher consumption coupled with 
refinery problems that have reduced production 
analysts also said the market had some leftover nervousness 
from wednesdays report that three members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries might request an emergency meeting of 
the cartel 
the kuwaiti news agency quoted unidentified sources as saying 
officials from venezuela algeria and ecuador wanted opec to 
consider ways of cutting production and propping up prices 
the report continued to be denied and by late afternoon 
thursday these hopes had faded and people were becoming more 
realistic oconnell said 
baker said the request for an opec meeting doesnt have broad 
sponsorship at all 
theyll only face the same issues they were unable to resolve 
at the last meeting he said referring to last months meeting 
of the 13nation cartel in vienna austria where oil ministers 
left the existing system of production quotas and prices intact 
most opec members are thought to be producing above their 
individual quotas or discounting their prices some estimates put 
opec production at 35 million barrels above the groups 
selfimposed overall ceiling of 1506 million barrels a day

youths finding a wealth of summertime jobs 
dropped the nations june civilian unemployment rate to 53 
percent its lowest since 1974 the government said today 
president reagan called the news solid evidence that his 
economic policies have succeeded 
seasonally adjusted employment in june jumped by 820000 75 
percent of it among youths 1624 years old to more than offset 
mays decline of 536000 
the 03 percentage point improvement in the unemployment rate 
marked the first time the rate has dipped so strongly since 1986 
and sent it to its lowest since joblessness stood at 51 percent in 
may 1974 
unemployment among teenagers fell 20 percentage points to 136 
percent its lowest since 1970 
among black teens the rate fell a whopping 60 percent to 284 
percent the lowest recorded since that statistic was first tracked 
in 1972 black teenage employment however was still more than 
double the 120 percent rate for white teens 
analysts had anticipated a surge in youth employment in the 
tourism industry as unprecedented numbers of foreigners buoyed by 
the devalued dollar are vacationing in the united states this 
summer 
reagan appeared before reporters at his spokesmans daily 
meeting with reporters to applaud the labor force report and to put 
in a thinly veiled plug for vice president george bush 
todays news is more solid evidence that the policies of this 
administration work that our philosophy works the president 
said i predict that 1988 will be a banner year for republicans 
because its a banner year for peace and prosperity in america 
more americans are working today than ever before in our 
history he said as they sit around their kitchen tables more 
americans are planning for their future not desperately searching 
the want ads for a job 
the labor department said the june job growth was affected in 
part by the fact that its monthly household survey was conducted 
late in june allowing extra time for students graduates and 
seasonal workers to find jobs 
the hiring boom meant that 623 percent of workingage americans 
had jobs a percentage achieved only in april 
unemployment dropped by 328000 to 65 million last month with 
teenagers and adult men accounting for all of the decline 
a separate survey of business payrolls showed that 345000 jobs 
were created in june compared with an average of 250000 a month 
from february through may the largest increases were in services 
and retail trade 160000 and 75000 respectively 
the labor department said there were also noteworthy gains 
of 25000 jobs each in transportation and wholesale trade 
reflecting increased factory output 
after slowing in may employment in the goodsproducing areas of 
the economy resumed its vigorous growth of the last year 
construction employment rose by 55000 jobs factory employment 
grew by 45000 
most of the factory gains were in the machinery and 
durablegoods areas 
the active housing market sent employment in the finance 
insurance and real estate industries up by a total of 15000 
compared with a gain of only 1000 in may employment in those 
industries was still 63000 below the level of a year ago four 
months before the october stock market crash 
meanwhile the number of socalled discouraged workers 
outofwork people who have given up the search for a job in the 
belief that none exists declined by 117000 to 910000 in the 
apriljune quarter 
the number of people working parttime because they could not 
find fulltime jobs jumped 470000 in june to 53 million however 
a separate unemployment calculation including the 17 million 
members of the armed services stationed in the united states also 
dropped by 03 percentage point to 52 percent 
unemployment dropped 03 percentage point to 46 percent among 
adult men but was unchanged at 49 percent for adult women and at 
90 percent for hispanics among whites joblessness fell from 47 
percent to 45 percent among blacks the rate fell from 124 
percent to 115 percent 
despite widespread fears that the tight job market might set off 
a wageprice spiral there was no indication of that happening last 
month the average hourly wage seasonally adjusted was unchanged 
at 927 after rising at an annual rate of 6 percent in april and 
may before the adjustment hourly earnings fell by 2 cents an hour

mississippi river and part of the ohio was closed 
thunderstorms dumped heavy rain overnight in western texas

27yearold attorney fresh from a workout in a downtown health 
club in the gym it wasnt so bad but just walking around during

authorities issued a yellow alert warning that 
concentrations of the airborne pollutant were so high that the very 
old the very young and those with respiratory ailments should 
stay indoors agency spokesman will flower said the high levels of 
ozone would continue today 
i dont want to breathe this air im not used to this said 
sylvia milosevic 33 who moved to chicago four months ago from los 
angeles 
temperatures hovered near 100 degrees thursday across much of 
indiana for the third consecutive day with no rain predicted 
through sunday officials said the week would likely close as the 
hottest and driest this year 
in ohio columbus akroncanton youngstown dayton findlay 
zanesville and mansfield were in the 100s while toledo posted 103 
records were set at seven of the states nine reporting cities 
forecasters said 
minneapolis reached 99 degrees and the temperature at the 
duluth airport hit 97 breaking a record of 93 for the date set in 
1980 
and for the fourth straight day thursday buffalo ny set a 
record high temperature the 94degree reading broke the record of 
93 degree set for the date in 1944 
in north dakota as many as 7000 farmers most of whom took up 
the trade in the last 10 years could be forced out of the business 
because of this years drought state agriculture commissioner kent 
jones said 
theres at least that many who are in real trouble jones 
said thursday a lot of them are young farmers who got started in 
the late 70s 
the estimate represents 22 percent of the states 31000 farmers 
the mississippi river remained closed to barge traffic at black 
hills miss about 20 miles south of natchez miss where water 
had been as low as five feet 
the ohio river was closed periodically today off mound city 
ill to allow crews to dredge sand and silt coast guard lt jg 
jim clifton said at paducah ky 
authorities planned to open the channel for six hours then 
close it for 12 hours for dredging for several days clifton said 
it will just alternate back and forth like that until they get 
it cleared through he said 
the drought has been deadly for many crops in illinois 
state agriculture director larry werries estimated that the 
average corn yield of 119 bushels per acre had been cut in half by 
the beginning of the week and was dropping at a rate of 5 percent 
a day 
at that rate a farmer with 500 acres of droughtstressed corn 
would lose about 10000 a day at current grain prices 
by the weekend we will have some farmers saying its all over 
and theyll be correct said university of illinois agronomist 
emerson nafziger i think its safe to say there are going to be 
fields with no yield at all

the freespending yuppies of today have been 
blamed for a number of lifes little economic inconveniences like 
driving up the prices of vacation homes or sportscars even 
hoarding imported pesto sauce and brie 
in the next five years they also may be partly responsible for 
a shortage of bonds that at least one noted economist is 
forecasting 
edward yardeni chief economist for prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york predicts that new demographic trends in this 
country will dampen the growth of credit demands and 
consequently the supply of bonds and notes 
todays yuppies he says are likely to become tomorrows 
couchpotato savers with a penchant for stashing away their 
cash possibly in fixedincome investments instead of borrowing to 
finance new homes expensive bmws and such 
what is transforming yuppie borrowers into couchpotato 
savers babies yardeni says in a recent report baby boomers 
who are expecting either their first or second baby tend to borrow 
a great deal of money to buy a house but once they settle down 
odds are theyll borrow less and save more 
yardeni predicts that those who do borrow either may be 
renovating an existing home or seeking a larger tradeup both of 
which probably would require less mortgage credit than a firsttime 
buyer 
he says that as a result popular mortgagebacked securities 
such as ginnie maes might shrink in supply and yields on such 
longterm bonds now in the 10percent range could fall to 6 
percent in about five years as demand outpaces supply a drop in 
yields will push up the price of existing bonds that carry higher 
rates 
but thats only part of yardenis theory he paints an equally 
rosy picture for the rest of the credit markets particularly 
treasury securities 
for one thing he says chances are the federal budget deficit 
will be declining lessening the supply of bonds 
also savings institutions are likely to increase their 
purchases of fixedincome instruments as a result of an anticipated 
greater deposit flow from these couchpotato savers yardeni 
says and government trust funds such as social security are 
expected to run a big surplus in the next few years which could 
swallow up the entire national debt by the year 2030 he says 
yardeni says the yield on the governments bellwether 30year 
bond could fall to 5 percent in five years 
we wouldnt be surprised if by the end of the decade 
investors complain about a shortage of bonds and nostagically 
recall the days when yields were above 9 percent he says 
but yardeni warns this is just one component of an overall 
view of the economy 
clearly the fatal blow to my theory would be a severe 
recession it would balloon the federal deficit and cause problems 
in the credit markets interest rates would fall but for the 
wrong reasons

the european parliament has urged 
quick action by european economic community executives to resolve 
what it called a worsening problem of flight delays and airliner 
nearmisses 
among the parliaments recommendations was that eurocontrol the 
10nation body which monitors flights in western europe be made 
part of the eec which currently has no formal authority in this 
area 
airline traffic in western europe has grown much faster than 
expected in recent years and a resolution adopted by the 
parliament late thursday said traffic growth is likely to 
accelerate as the eec deregulates the commercial airline industry 
in the next several years 
the resolution said overcongested airspace and limited airport 
capacity had led to delays not only causing major inconvenience 
to passengers but also reducing safety 
the parliamentarians sharply criticized both the eec executive 
commission and national civil aviation authorities for a lack of 
will to create a single system for air traffic control for the 
12nation trading bloc 
many of the flight delays result from the fact that 11 different 
air trafficcontrol centers in the eec are equipped with 
incompatible computers the resolution said 
george anastassopoulos chairman of the parliaments transport 
committee told a news conference that the skies cannot be 
divided in this way he noted that the eec planned to dismantle 
all barriers to the free movement of people goods services and 
capital by the end of 1992 
he blamed the problem on misplaced sensitivities about 
sovereignty citing britain and unspecified scandinavian 
countries as notable culprits

a security and exchange commission ruling that 
prevents the issuing of separate and more powerful classes of stock 
does not seriously deplete corporate americas defensive armory 
poison pills remain the no 1 repellant of hostile bidders 
far surpassing supervoting stock which carries greater weight 
than the average common share 
indeed only 359 public companies have unequal voting rights 
while at least half of the fortune 500 firms have adopted poison 
pills designed to make unwanted takeovers prohibitively expensive 
after nearly two years of debate the sec on thursday upheld the 
one share one vote rule with a trail of caveats in an 
effort to preserve the rights of existing shareholders 
experts expect the ruling to have little impact they note that 
despite its superior ability to shield a company from hostile 
bidders supervoting stock is difficult to issue 
for one thing it had been frowned upon by the new york stock 
exchange at times banning the issuing of dual classes of stock and 
threatening to delist companies that did so 
in addition it almost always requires a shareholder vote to 
adopt a second class and management typically shies from the risk 
of rejection said robert kohl a partner at the law firm of gaston 
amp snow 
its hard to advertise to shareholders that diluting their 
voting power ultimately is a benefit institutional investors also 
would be hard to sway because they want to be able to cash in on an 
attractive bid if one happens to come alongnoted stephen flood a 
partner with the law firm of willkie farr amp gallagher 
but far deeper is the ethic that appeals to our democratic 
education about one share one vote kohl said 
some 60 companies listed on the nyse have dual classes of stock 
and the sec left those established structures intact the 
commission also will allow companies that have registered to issue 
supervoting stock to proceed with their plans 
among the public companies that have dual classes are ford motor 
co hershey foods corp wm wrigley amp co general motors corp 
and a number of media companies including dow jones amp co new 
york times co washington post co and media general inc 
kohl said the dualclass structure is most common among 
companies that have longstanding family control or foundation 
control that they want to maintain 
for example media general chairman d tennant bryan and his 
family own 71 percent of the companys class b shares which 
control six of the nine seats on the companys board the bryan 
family had little trouble in quashing california investor burt 
sugarman in a recent proxy contest for three seats on media 
generals board 
and in the case of resorts international inc donald trump 
had about 7 or 9 percent of the equity but he controled 70 percent 
of the vote flood noted that is the best defense and in a 
way the cheapest one 
entertainer merv griffin paid trump 195 million for his class b 
resorts shares each of which carried 100 times the voting power of 
a class a share 
keeping control in the hands of a founding family can have 
certain benefits though theyre not readily apparent and have to 
overcome the presumption of being democratic kohl said 
for one thing continued founding family control can ensure 
stability especially if the family has a large financial stake in 
the company you can assume it will protect that stake and that 
will protect the rest of the shareholders kohl said 
also management can engage in longer term planning which may 
involve current financial sacrifice without fear of being thrown 
out he added 
the counter argument of course is that incompetent management 
can be protected 
it is the poison pill however that has been the mainstay of 
corporate defensive tactics pills not enacted during a tender 
offer generally have been upheld in the courts kohl said while 
there has been varying success when adopted during an offer 
part of their popularity with managers may be that the pills are 
easy to enact they generally do not require shareholder approval 
the sec ruling also does not preempt antitakeover legislation 
adopted by individual states thus a company could reincorporate 
in a state whose laws affect the voting rights of shareholders 
companies still will be allowed to issue new shares with diluted 
voting power and such shares can be issued during mergers 
companies going public will be able to issue both strong and 
weakervoting shares 
stocks of foreign companies traded in the united states are 
exempt as are the less actively traded issues of small companies 
listed in the national association of securities dealers pink

most grain and soybeans futures prices closed 
sharply lower for the second consecutive session friday on the 
chicago board of trade stumping many analysts who saw mostly 
bullish signs ahead 
some corn contracts and most oat contracts fell their 
15centsabushel limit for daily trading and the contract for 
november delivery of soybeans plunged nearly the 45cent limit for 
that market wheat futures were mixed 
some private forecasters said chances had improved for weekend 
showers in illinois and iowa but chances had fallen for rain in 
indiana and ohio on the belts parched eastern edge 
youd think one would offset the other but it didnt turn out 
that way said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
the selling was led by independent traders and hedgers and may 
simply have represented profittaking ahead of the weekend 
analysts said 
many private projections for 1988 corn and soybean production 
were released in advance of the agriculture departments official 
report which is due on tuesday but the estimates varied widely 
i dont know how to explain it lespinasse said of the sharp 
drop in prices im at a loss for words and so are most other 
people 
at the close wheat was 5 cents lower to 8 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 380 a bushel corn was 1 
cents to 15 cents lower with july at 309 a bushel oats were 8 
cents to 15 cents lower with july at 293 a bushel soybeans were 
42 cents lower to 7 cents higher with july at 924 a bushel

americans increased their installment 
borrowing at a modest annual rate of 46 percent in may as growth 
in consumer credit slowed from the rapid expansion of earlier this 
year the government said friday 
the federal reserve board said consumers took out 242 billion 
more in credit than they paid off in may compared with net growth 
of 385 billion in april 
the annual rate of growth in may was well below the 73 percent 
rate in april and less than half of the 107 percent rate for the 
first three months of the year consumer credit grew 72 percent 
last year 
slow expansion of automobile credit contributed to low overall 
growth in may borrowing for autos rose by 597 million an annual 
rate of 26 percent compared with 78 percent in april and 159 
percent in march 
economists had been expecting a drop in consumer credit in may 
although a less sharp one because of rising interest rates during 
the month and previously reported weak sales 
michael evans head of evans economics inc in washington said 
the may credit report represented a temporary lull from faster 
expansion rather than a trend 
may was a bad month for consumer spending my theory is first 
we had a rise in interest rates and secondly we had fewer tax 
refunds than usual often people use their tax refunds as a down 
payment for some big ticket item and that means more credit he 
said 
interest rates eased in june but a lot of people in may 
thought they were going a lot higher and lot of people who had 
variable rate mortages thought they were really going to get socked 
and took it easier on their other credit he said 
consumer spending rebounded in june major department stores 
thursday all reported gains auto sales for the month jumped from 
an annual rate of 102 million units to 106 million 
in may the category that included credit card debt continued a 
string of strong increases rising by 169 billion a 121 percent 
annual rate compared with rates of 124 percent in april and 160 
percent in march 
the credit report said the category that includes bank and 
credit union loans not secured by real estate grew by 196 million 
a 15 percent rise compared with a 22 percent increase in april 
borrowing for mobile homes fell 60 million 28 percent after 
a 15 percent rise in april 
the various changes left total consumer debt at 6318 billion 
at the end of may up 94 percent from a year ago

a restructuring plan that will increase usg 
corps debt fourfold the legacy of the companys costly victory 
in a takeover battle with desert partners lp was overwhelmingly 
approved friday by shareholders 
approval by 94 percent of the shareholders who cast votes 
indicates support for usgs continued existence as an independent 
company run by current management chairman robert day said after 
balloting was complete 
a total of 518 million shares 70 percent of the outstanding 
stock was represented in the vote 
the restructuring plan made necessary when the chicagobased 
building supply conglomerates management rebuffed a takeover bid 
by desert partners of midland texas will boost the companys debt 
load to 31 billion from 800 million 
under the plan shareholders of record by next tuesday will be 
entitled to 37 in cash 5 in securities and one new share of 
common stock for each common share they currently own 
usg has historically carried a modest level of debt and while 
that is our preference present circumstances require that we 
provide an immediate return to shareholders said day we 
intend to reduce our debt load as rapidly as possible and are in a 
strong position to do so 
virtually all of the 20minute comment period friday on motions 
affecting shareholders was devoted to the recapitalization 
many said theyd made a lot of money in the past and were 
happy with the way things were said thomas sleeter manager of 
investor relations they didnt wany anybody to tamper 
the companys stock price had doubled over the past five years 
and was trading above 50 per share before octobers market crash 
when desert partners launched its 42pershare offer in march usg 
was trading below 30 
in trading on the new york stock exchange usg was up 62 cents 
a share at 49 by late afternoon 
day and usgs current management won the bitter protracted 
takeover battle but he acknowledged in an interview thursday that 
the price was a recapitalization that will inhibit usgs growth and 
restrict its resources for several years 
there are no winners in this were going into very heavy 
leverage and that has its negatives day said thursday we 
dont feel we lost but the whole process isnt one that gives us a 
great deal of satisfaction either 
as a result of the restructuring an unspecified number of jobs 
will be lost already the work force has been cut 9 percent this 
year day said 
two companies will be sold reversing a trend that saw usg 
acquire five companies in 1987 
it will restrict our ability to pay dividends to commit 
capital to capital investments and reduce our research and 
development program and these latter two in particular are the 
things which provide growth for the future day said 
he said the recapitalization was the only why to satisfy usgs 
loyal longterm investors and the newcomers who moved in on the 
heels of desert partners 
but he admitted he regrets the restructuring was necessary 
im not bitter but i am sorry day said its been very 
costly disruptive and demoralizing so its pretty hard to find 
anything to feel good about

louisiana is becoming the first state to 
give sales tax rebates to foreign visitors a move designed to 
boost the tourism industry and create jobs in a state plagued by 
doubledigit unemployment 
the state will join 17 european countries that offer similar 
refunds under a bill gov buddy roemer signed into law friday 
i think it is a fantastic concept for us in that we are the 
first in the nation to do it said lt gov paul hardy who 
serves as the head of louisianas department of culture recreation 
and tourism 
the program which the state hopes to implement in early 1989 
will offer the rebates only for retail sales hotel bills rental 
cars and restaurant and bar tabs will not be affected 
while were rebating only the tax on shopping we will get 
more visitors paying the sales tax on everything else said 
eugene schrieber managing director of the world trade center in 
new orleans 
according to a world trade center study 301000 foreign 
tourists from countries other than mexico and canada visited 
louisiana in 1986 to take in such attractions as new orleans 
french quarter precivil war plantation mansions in southern 
louisiana and the cajun country 
during that year louisiana attracted 34 percent of overseas 
tourists who came to the united states ranking it 15th among the 
states 
i dont think louisiana is getting its fair share said 
hardy who campaigned last fall on the theme of building the 
states tourism industry 
schrieber said the state will make up for the lost sales tax 
revenue on retail purchases when tourism increases by 12 percent 
backers believe the program will boost tourism by 26 percent 
which would create 1200 new jobs hike payrolls by 12 million and 
give the state a 22 million revenue increase after the tax 
rebates schrieber said 
louisianas unemployment rate which was 106 percent in may 
has been in double digits since the collapse of oil and gas prices 
in the early 1980s 
schrieber said louisiana is moving at the right time to 
implement the program since the value of the dollar is low against 
other currencies making american goods cheaper for foreign 
tourists 
you have a tremendous influx of tourists coming into the 
united states he said this is the perfect time to do this 
durng 1986 california had 3 million foreign tourists not 
counting visitors from mexico florida had 18 million and new york 
courted 22 million schrieber said 
we could be getting a lot more foreign visitors he said 
the growth potential is tremendous 
under the new law retailers who opt to participate in the 
program will pay an annual 100 fee to be listed in a taxfree 
shopping guide given to foreign tourists 
a foreign tourist buying an item in a participating store will 
show a passport and a roundtrip airline ticket indicating his stay 
is less than three months and receive a refund form from the 
retailer the refund will be obtained at a louisiana airport or by 
mail 
during legislative debate some lawmakers questioned the wisdom 
of offering the rebate at the same time they were imposing a 2cent 
sales tax hike on food motor fuel and utilities in an effort to 
balance the state budget 
i havent been here for 40 years making these types of 
mistakes said state sen bb sixty rayburn dean of the 
legislature 
but state sen bill mcleod compared the rebate to loss 
leaders that grocery stores use to attract customers 
they tourists will save a pittance and leave a lot he 
said 
schrieber said that while foreigners will not flock to louisiana 
merely to take advantage of the refund the program will provide 
more visibility for the states tourist attractions 
it has a tremendous potential for publicity and promotion 
he said if its working for them over there why wouldnt it 
work now

the federal reserve board on friday gave the 
bank of new york co another 60day extension to persue its hostile 
bid for rival irving bank corp but the regulators also expressed 
uneasiness the takeover attempt has entered its 10th month 
the fed indicated it was concerned about the costs associated 
with the longstanding battle and urged both parties to bring it to 
a prompt conclusion 
it is the expressed desire of the board that the parties avoid 
further delay and take all steps necessary to bring the pending 
proceedings to a prompt conclusion the fed said in approving 
bank of new yorks request for an extension 
the feds extension until sept 7 was the second for the bank of 
new york since regulators gave the company conditional approval to 
proceed with its takeover plans in february the first extension 
was scheduled to run out saturday 
bank of new york first announced its merger proposal in 
september but all subsequent offers have been steadfastly turned 
down by irving 
irving management instead favors a friendly merger with the 
staterun banca commerciale italiana spa italys second largest 
bank 
bank of new york which owns a 49 percent stake in irving is 
offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its own stock for each of 
irvings 185 million common shares outstanding the offer is 
valued at around 68 a share or 12 billion 
the milanbased banca commerciale is offering 80 a share for 51 
percent of irvings outstanding shares and a special 10ashare 
dividend for the remaining 49 percent 
it recently sweetened the offer to include warrants entitling 
shareholders to buy newly issued irving stock at 65 a share over 
the next seven years stockholders would receive one warrant for 
every four shares they currently owned 
robert a falise said irving was disappointed with the feds 
decision 
the federal reserve boards action is contrary to the best 
interest of both banking institutions he said 
the feds decision came two days after a new york state judge 
struck down a provison of irvings antitakeover poison pill 
that was designed to thwart the bank of new york

a proposal that includes coordinated trading 
halts by the nations two leading financial centers won praise 
friday from big brokers and a key member of the presidential panel 
that investigated the october stock crash but others called the 
idea a publicrelations ploy that would have little practical value 
and could actually worsen any possible future panic in the stock 
and futures markets 
the reactions came a day after the new york stock exchange and 
chicago mercantile exchange announced a broad strategy aimed at 
raising investor confidence and averting more crashes like the one 
that shook the markets on oct 19 when the dow jones industrial 
average fell a record 508 points 
their proposal for joint circuit breakers marked the first 
time since the crash that the two biggest domestic financial 
exchanges displayed open cooperation and acknowledged they are both 
part of one market 
intermarket coordination was one of the most important 
recommendations made by the presidential task force on market 
mechanisms the white house panel that reviewed the causes of the 
crash 
i think cooperation among the exchanges is whats needed in a 
world of closely interrelated markets said robert glauber a 
harvard university professor and executive director of the 
presidential study 
im very encouraged he said i think the evidence of 
cooperation between the exchanges is a tremendous step forward 
major wall street firms also applauded the moves by the big 
board and the merc as the exchanges are known in the securities 
industry several said they approved of any reform that would 
encourage reinvestment in stocks by investors who have been 
frightened out of the postcrash market 
we are especially pleased that these two market centers have 
agreed to a coordinated approach to the complex issues confronting 
all of us merrill lynch amp co said in a statement kidder 
peabody amp co president max c chapman said we endorse all 
activity that leads to an improvement of investor confidence in the 
markets 
there was no reaction from the securities and exchange 
commission one of two federal agencies that must approve the 
reforms sec commissioner joseph grundfest said he was reading the 
proposals but could not comment further 
david gary spokesman for the commodities futures trading 
commission said we applaud the cooperative effort and we think 
its a good first step we remain ready to see the specifics of the 
program when they submit it to us 
others expressed skepticism about the proposed reforms 
particularly a coordinated onehour trading halt that could be 
triggered by a 250point drop in the dow jones industrial average 
in new york or a 30point fall in the standard amp poors 500 index 
futures contract traded in chicago under the proposal subsequent 
drops in these indicators could trigger longer halts 
i may be one of the few people on wall street who will tell 
you its wonderful pr work but its useless said jack barbanel 
a futures expert at gruntal amp co in new york it really shuts 
down the doors on selling orders and causes huge backups the 
people who cant get in get doubly nervous 
if that happened critics said people who otherwise might have 
held their positions could panic and join the queues of sellers 
waiting for the markets to reopen and causing a repeated pattern of 
declines and trading halts 
youre putting in safety valves that have some significant 
practical leaks barbanel said im not to crazy about it 
glauber disputed such criticisms the fact is there are going 
to be circuit breakers whether you want them or not he said 
the choice is whether theyll be preplanned or ad hoc having 
them preplanned will induce less panic than having them ad hoc 
like computer systems failing and telephone lines backing up 
thats what occurred in october 
some market experts had a mixed reaction a few were upset that 
as part of the proposal the nyse would drop its collar 
restraint on computerized trading of large blocks of stocks and 
stockindex futures a technique known as program trading that 
has been blamed for inciting sudden price swings 
i think the spirit of what theyre doing is ok and in the 
right direction said haskel benishay professor of managerial 
economics at northwestern universitys kellogg graduate business 
school but it gives more leeway to program traders now the 
bands of noninterference are much higher

guinness plc said friday it will join forces with 
a french luxury goods marketer to create a new company to hold a 
substantial stake in lvmh moethennessy louis vuitton maker of 
champagne and upscale luggage 
separately lvmh will acquire 10 percent of guinness a leading 
british brewer that also makes johnnie walker scotch whisky and 
gordons gin both transactions are subject to the approval of 
guinness shareholders 
guinness said it will invest a minimum 237 million british 
pounds or about 408 million for a 40 percent stake in a joint 
venture company to be formed along with financiere agache group of 
france the new company will control their joint lvmh holdings 
agache a holding company that controls the christian dior 
christian lacroix and celine fashion houses would retain 60 
percent of the joint venture company 
in a statement issued from its paris headquarters lvmh 
acknowledged that guinness and agache have amassed a 24 percent 
stake in the company on a fully diluted basis 
guinness said the agreement with lvmh represents a natural 
progression of their existing relationship last year the two 
companies agreed to set up a series of joint ventures to distribute 
their products in the united states japan and the far east 
anthony tennant guinnesss chief executive called the 
agreement a major longterm strategic move our new partnership 
with financiere agache group is based on our mutual and 
complementary interest in the wines spirits and luxury goods 
businesses of lvmh 
lvmh produces moet et chandon champagne and hennessy cognac as 
well as perfumes and luxury leather goods guinness did not 
indicate how large a stake the joint venture company hoped to build 
in lvmh 
lvmh recently purchased 725 million guinness shares in the open 
market and intends eventually to increase its holdings to 12 
percent to that end guinness has proposed issuing lvmh 908 
million guinness common shares or about 10 percent for about 390 
million pounds or 671 million 
lvmh said the crossshareholding will reinforce the commercial 
ties that already exist between the two groups and allow them the 
stability that is required for their development 
the move puts an end to a week of suspense about the identity of 
the purchasers who were behind a surge in lvmh shares in unusually 
heavy volume 
analysts had speculated that agache was one of the buyers in 
line with the plans of its chairman bernard arnault to 
consolidate his position in the luxury goods sector through an 
agreement with lvmh guinness was also thought to be a buyer 
some analysts speculated that both companies were able to 
acquire their stakes relatively unnoticed because of tension among 
senior lvmh officials 
lvmh hasnt commented on the reported tensions but bankers have 
indicated that conflict arose between alain chevalier who heads 
the moet interests and henry racamier who runs the vuitton 
operations 
lvmh was formed in 1987 by the merger of two prominent 
familycontrolled companies the baggage perfume and champagne 
distributor louis vuitton sa and the champagne spirits and perfume 
company moethennessy sa

the dollar jumped friday as its summer rally 
gained fresh support from a report of a biggerthanexpected 
decline in the us unemployment rate gold prices were mixed 
the dollar reached its highest point since last october against 
the british pound west german mark and swiss franc it reached its 
highest point since last august against the french franc and 
italian lira 
intervention by the bundesbank west germanys central bank 
failed to halt the dollars upward swing traders said the us 
federal reserve also sold dollars but it was not clear whether the 
fed did so for itself or on behalf of the west germans 
traders said the drop in the june civilian jobless rate to 53 
percent its lowest point since 1974 increased prospects that the 
federal reserve would push up interest rates to keep the economy 
from overheating that would make dollar securities more attractive 
to foreign investors 
in addition a big rise in manufacturing employment was seen as 
an indication that exports remained strong which could help shrink 
the trade deficit and support the dollar 
but several analysts said the dollar was primed for a rise 
anyway because its slight weakness in recent days was taken as a 
buying opportunity 
when people want to buy a currency they find good excuses for 
it said samuel kahan chief financial economist for kleinwort 
benson government securities inc in chicago 
once the dollar started upward traders who had been betting on 
its decline were forced to retreat and buy dollars to close out 
short positions said david lapin chief currency adviser for 
bankamerica international in new york 
its a snowballing effect a game of follow the leader 
lapin said 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar fell 033 yen to a closing 13197 yen later in 
london it was quoted higher at 13320 yen later in new york the 
dollar rose to 13329 yen from 13273 late thursday 
in london the dollar rose against the british pound it cost 
17015 to buy one pound cheaper than 17180 thursday the pound 
also fell against the dollar in new york to 16996 from 17134 
late thursday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late

florida steel corp said friday that its top 
executives are considering making an offer to take the company 
private in a leveraged buyout that would be worth about 270 
million or more 
the company said it had been advised that senior managers were 
considering making an offer that would give shareholders cash and 
securities with terms designed to have an aggregate value 
approximately in the midtohigh forties per share the company 
has about 6 million shares outstanding 
but the statement added that there can be no assurance that 
any proposal will be made or if made will be accepted and the 
company added that its board has not determined to sell the 
company 
in a leveraged buyout those making the acquisition usually 
borrow heavily against the target companys profits or assets 
alfred gres florida steel vice president and chief financial 
officer pointed out in an interview that an offer at 45 per share 
would make the value of the deal about 270 million 
in trading on the new york stock exchange florida steel rose 
362 a share to 47 
gres said he and five other executives including chairman 
edward l flom were in the group which is considering a buyout he 
said he did not know when they would decide on whether to make a

boswell vice president of steel mills jd haney vice president 
of fabricated reinforcing steel products and jc hogue vice

detectives from a special task force known as the serious fraud 
squad arrested max buteau 39 on wednesday the day before he was 
to go to his native haiti

court appearance on the grounds that he might attempt escape 
buteau who lives in west london resigned last month from the 
banks branch at victoria in central london 
during the sevenminute court session friday prosecutor robert 
wardle said buteau had been issuing false guarantees of payment on 
behalf of the banks london branch so that alleged coconspirator 
tina jeffe a french doctor turned financial consultant could 
attract domestic and foreign corporations into her investment 
business 
ms jeffe 40 has fled britain wardle said leaving behind a 
bank of boston account with a 300000 pound or 510000 deficit 
wardle told the court that buteau had no authority to issue 
those letters and concealed this from the bank 
defense lawyer stephanie nedas said her client vigorously 
denied the charge 
bank of boston spokesman wayne taylor said the us bank was 
cooperating with the investigation 
taylor denied reports that the bank had already begun making 
payments to parties allegedly affected in the case 
the spokesman said the bank does not expect significant earnings 
losses due to any possible payments associated with the case 
any loss should it occur is expected to be substantially 
less than the figure mentioned in the press reports out of 
london said taylor we also believe such payments would be 
covered by present reserves andor insurance 
buteaus trial is scheduled to begin wednesday

the government friday scrapped 
negotiations aimed at resuming payments on its 92 billion foreign 
debt attributing the decision to lack of money 
it is prudent to suspend renegotiations without setting a 
renewal date finance minister eduardo cabezas told a news 
conference 
he said falling prices for oil from accounts for about 60 
percent of ecuadors income and a shortage of foreign credit were 
important considerations in its decision 
the government of president leon febres cordero suspended 
payments on ecuadors debt in march 1987 after a series of 
earthquakes wreaked widespread destruction and severed a major oil 
pipeline paralyzing the oil export industry for six months 
cabezas said the the countrys economic situation has worsened 
this year and that recent presidential elections had caused a drop 
in foreign exchange remittances but he did not elaborate 
social democrat rodrigo borja replaces conservative febres 
cordero in august borja defeated populist abdala bucaram in may 
following a heated campaign that incited frequent rumors of a 
military coup 
cabezas said the government had based its budget on oil income 
at 1725 a barrel but has only been receiving 13 
a plan to receive 350 million in loans from foreign banks had 
also fallen through further crippling the countrys ability to 
pay he said

convicted insider trader dennis b levine cant 
pay his 122 million tax bill with the money he made through 
illegal activities a federal judge has ruled 
instead said us district judge richard owen in a ruling late 
thursday the money should go to compensate defrauded investors 
owen rejected motions by levine and convicted coconspirator 
robert wilkis to pay off their tax liabilities with disgorged 
profits now in the hands of the government 
owen also rejected the securities and exchange commissions 
proposed plan for distributing the 128 million disgorged by 
levine and the 34 million wilkis has relinquished 
the pair wanted their federa tax bills 122 million for 
levine and more than 28 million for wilkis to take precedence 
over investor claims 
the sec at first balked but later devised a compromise plan in 
which 42 percent of the levine money and 49 percent of the wilkis 
money would go toward federal and state tax claims 
owen refused to approve it 
it is almost an affront to suggest that those defrauded by 
levines insider trading activities have their recovery reduced by 
the amount of his fine said the judge calling the fine 
personal and punitive in nature and as such is not subject to 
payment out of levines illegal gains to the detriment of 
investors 
lawyers for both levine and wilkis said they would appeal the 
ruling 
levine a former wall street investment banker confessed in 
1986 to masterminding a massive insider trading scheme using his 
advance knowledge of impending takeover deals to profit by buying 
and selling stocks 
levines admissions implicated other wall street professionals 
including speculator ivan boesky who paid the sec a record 100 
million in penalties and disgorged profits to settle an insider 
trading claim 
levine pleaded guilty to four criminal counts and was sentenced 
to two years in prison earlier this week he was released to a 
halfway house for the remainder of his term 
wilkis another former investment banker pleaded guilty to 
insider trading charges in 1986 and was sentenced to a year in 
prison

the government has decided to lift its 
ban on beef imports and plans to order 15000 tons of foreign beef 
next week the yonhap news agency reported friday 
government officials declined to comment on the report but said 
an annoucement could be expected soon 
yonhap said no objections were raised on the floor of the 
national assembly to the proposed lifting of the ban when deputy 
prime minister rha woongbae told the legislature thursday that 
korea would suffer retaliation if it continued resisting us 
pressure to lift the ban 
rha noted the united states had complained to the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade that the korean beef import ban 
violates fair trade practice rha said gatt was certain to rule 
that korea should immediately lift the ban and if korea did not do 
so it would face legal retaliation from the united states and other 
gatt memebrs 
the government of president roh taewoo originally planned to 
lift the ban earlier this year but delayed action in the face of 
strong domestic resistance 
south korea plans to buy just 15000 tons of beef this year 
yonhap quoted officials as saying the tonnage to be ordered next 
week included 5000 tons of high quality beef to be imported from 
the united states for use at hotels 
the remaining 10000 tons of beef of ordinary quality will be 
for sales to the public and will be purchased through international 
bidding to be conducted by a governmentdesignated livestock 
product distribution agency yonhap said 
the officials were quoted as saying american and australian 
suppliers were expected to take part in the bidding next week

a restructuring plan that will increase usg 
corps debt fourfold the legacy of the companys costly victory 
in a takeover battle with desert partners lp was overwhelmingly 
approved friday by shareholders 
approval by 94 percent of the shareholders who cast votes 
indicates support for usgs continued existence as an independent 
company run by current management chairman robert day said after 
balloting was complete 
a total of 518 million shares 70 percent of the outstanding 
stock was represented in the vote 
the restructuring plan made necessary when the chicagobased 
building supply conglomerates management rebuffed a takeover bid 
by desert partners of midland texas will boost the companys debt 
load to 31 billion from 800 million 
under the plan shareholders of record by next tuesday will be 
entitled to 37 in cash 5 in securities and one new share of 
common stock for each common share they currently own 
usg has historically carried a modest level of debt and while 
that is our preference present circumstances require that we 
provide an immediate return to shareholders said day we 
intend to reduce our debt load as rapidly as possible and are in a 
strong position to do so 
virtually all of the 20minute comment period friday on motions 
affecting shareholders was devoted to the recapitalization 
many said theyd made a lot of money in the past and were 
happy with the way things were said thomas sleeter manager of 
investor relations they didnt wany anybody to tamper 
the companys stock price had doubled over the past five years 
and was trading above 50 per share before octobers market crash 
when desert partners launched its 42pershare offer in march usg 
was trading below 30 
in trading on the new york stock exchange usg rose 50 cents a 
share to close at 4887 
day and usgs current management won the bitter protracted 
takeover battle but he acknowledged in an interview thursday that 
the price was a recapitalization that will inhibit usgs growth and 
restrict its resources for several years 
there are no winners in this were going into very heavy 
leverage and that has its negatives day said thursday we 
dont feel we lost but the whole process isnt one that gives us a 
great deal of satisfaction either 
as a result of the restructuring an unspecified number of jobs 
will be lost already the work force has been cut 9 percent this 
year day said 
two companies will be sold reversing a trend that saw usg 
acquire five companies in 1987 
it will restrict our ability to pay dividends to commit 
capital to capital investments and reduce our research and 
development program and these latter two in particular are the 
things which provide growth for the future day said 
he said the recapitalization was the only why to satisfy usgs 
loyal longterm investors and the newcomers who moved in on the 
heels of desert partners 
but he admitted he regrets the restructuring was necessary 
im not bitter but i am sorry day said its been very 
costly disruptive and demoralizing so its pretty hard to find 
anything to feel good about
