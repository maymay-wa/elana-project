here is a transcript of a statement by john 
tower shortly after the senate rejected president bushs nomination 
of him to be defense secretary 
it is time for the bitterness rancor and anger to fade and for 
those elements of government who have been involved in the 
confirmation process to unite and to be about the peoples business 
i will be recorded as the first cabinet nominee in the history of 
the republic to be rejected in the first 90 days of a presidency and 
perhaps be harshly judged 
but i depart from this place at peace with myself knowing that i 
have given a full measure of devotion to my country 
no public figure in my memory has been subjected to such a 
farreaching and thorough investigation nor had his human foibles 
bared to such intensive and demeaning public scrutiny 
and yet there is no finding that i have ever breached 
established legal and ethical standards nor been derelict in my duty 
i am deeply grateful to our great president for his continuing 
confidence in me and his unflagging support in the most difficult of 
circumstances 
i am obliged to my old colleagues in the senate who rallied to me 
with fervor zeal and eloquence in the face of staggering political 
odds 
i shall always be in their debt 
i am thankful to the thousands of americans who have inundated me 
with messages of encouragement and support 
it is my intention to return to private life in my beloved texas 
but i shall speak out from time to time on national issues when 
my knowledge experience and insights may contribute to public 
debate 
i hope that my successor will be speedily and expeditiously 
confirmed and i wish him godspeed

one us embassy librarian remembers 
handing a copy of billboard magazine through an iron gate past a 
militiaman to a young pole interested in keeping up with the 
western pop music scene 
it was a time of martial law and authorities frowned on such 
things 
during that bitter winter of 198182 and for years before and 
after the library at the us embassy and ones run by british and 
french institutes have been virtually the only source of western 
news books and magazines for poles 
the official information lock has eased some 
authorities no longer bother to check luggage at airports video 
stores are opening in warsaw the jamming of foreign broadcasts has 
ended satellite dishes bring a world full of signals into the 
country an underground press publishes vigorously and the official 
media provide a broader range of views 
but still no western newspapers are on sale regularly in warsaw 
and newsweek magazine circulates a few hundred copies for a country 
of nearly 38 million 
at the us embassy library however anyone can come in for 
englishlanguage fiction magazines ranging from house amp garden to 
fortune college catalogues reference works or even american 
telephone books 
this library is very famous because books are here that you 
cannot get anywhere else said a woman researching her doctoral 
thesis on martin luther king jr 
the us information agency pays for embassy libraries worldwide 
spending about 15000 annually to stock the warsaw branch 
in poland the agency also supports smaller reading rooms at us 
consulates in krakow and poznan and a scholarly study center at 
warsaw university 
the embassy library has about 8000 volumes of fiction and 
nonfiction and 136 magazines covering wide spectrum of political 
thought from national review to new republic said alice 
lemaistre the us cultural officer 
she describes the library as a way of filling in the gaps in 
poles understanding of the united states 
she said it is important for example that poles considering 
emigrating to the united states understand how much housing costs 
the british institute which operates independently of the 
british embassy runs a 28000volume library in warsaw and branches 
in four cities 
planes carrying books were among the first to arrive in the 
postworld war ii relief operation said the institutes director 
richard alford 
it was a much more risky proposition for poles to come here 
during the stalinist 1950s said alford now nobody thinks 
twice about it 
one patron during the relatively relaxed 1970s recalls the 
american library as the in place to be seen for high school 
students studying english 
the british library has a computer link to a western database for 
research that had been running for only a few days in 1981 before 
martial law was declared and communications links cut 
the reestablished system serves polish scholars whose libraries 
do not have the money to buy specialized books and journals from the 
west 
militia officers posted outside the us embassy discouraged 
library use during martiallaw and the government press reported 
falsely that it was closed 
still poles came testimony to their determination is the worn 
copy of herman wouks the caine mutiny with the library card 
recording a due date of jan 4 1982 three weeks after martial law 
was imposed 
now about 4300 people have library cards at the us libary and 
up to 150 people pass through the embassy metal detector to use it 
daily 
newsweek time and the international herald tribune which is 
published in paris are read to death said ms lamaistre 
one day recently a polish music writer was catching up on 
rolling stone magazine and a student was checking out trouble 
spots of english grammar 
art theater and film both libraries show movies in english 
are favorite topics and computer magazines are newly popular 
also wellthumbed are copies of such decorating magazines as 
metropolitan home and doityourself guides a result of the 
improvisation that takes over when the store shelves are empty 
there is a voracious appetite for anything in the way of 
western literature said runnall davis head of the british 
council library where about 90 percent of the 7000 fiction titles 
are on loan at any time 
we are a window to the west he said this is one place 
where poles can come and see things from a different point of view

in northern irelands endless cycle of killing 
and revenge the combined weight of statistics and rhetoric often 
eclipses the human tragedy here is a report from an ap 
correspondent who studied the poignant details behind the latest 
killing 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on an unseasonably warm and sunny 
day this week the official death toll in the northern ireland 
conflict went up by one stock car racer one violinmaker and one 
nearly blind oldage pensioner 
leslie dallas austin nelson and ernie rankin were chatting in 
the forecourt of dallass garage in coagh on tuesday when an irish 
republican army squad drove up in a red car and shot them dead 
why because 40yearold dallas was running the garage as a front 
for a protestant murder squad said the ira because the ira are 
sectarian killers said the police because of unavenged previous 
slayings said the analysts 
three protestants killed in an obscure county tyrone village may 
be mere statistical blips in the larger picture of the iras 
68yearfight for a united ireland and the protestants equally 
dogged struggle to remain part of britain 
but to coagh they were local heroes dallas as a driving champ 
nelson as a violinmaker who had just been featured on network tv 
and rankin as the jovial old codger who played the role of village 
character 
the garage stands on a corner of hanover square where generations 
of villagers have stopped to shoot the breeze and the ira admits 
that nelson 68 and rankin 71 were innocent bystanders who were 
killed in the general confusion 
on the morning after the killings coagh pronounced coke was 
wrapped in an overpowering sense of lives abruptly cut down 
the raw shell of an unfinished violin lay on nelsons work table 
two doors down in dallas garage an uncompleted worksheet was 
spread on a desk and his racing trophies lined the windowsill 
a red carnation was jammed in the garage padlock bunches of 
daffodils lay on the asphalt by the bulletpocked garage wall 
such random death is depressingly common in northern ireland 
ordinary people die in the crossfire or because they happened by 
just as a bomb exploded they may die simply because of their 
religion or because they have a brother in the ira or because of 
mistaken identity 
its the ordinary people who suffer and no two ways about 
it snapped nan duff a neighbor who saw the bodies lying by the 
garage 
she could just as well have been referring to phelim mcnally or 
tony fusco barney lavery or ian catney or 13yearold emma 
donnelly just some of the people who have been killed by 
mistake in recent months 
phelim mcnally loved children at 28 he already had five and 
playing the accordion his brother francis is a proira politician 
but phelim was never involved in anything that might single him out 
for murder 
in november he delivered his pregnant wife pauline to the 
hospital and went to francis house to give his 10yearold nephew 
an accordion lesson someone knocked at the door francis went to 
the window phelim less schooled in the art of survival opened the 
door and was shot dead 
four hours later pauline gave birth to their sixth child death 
can have a grisly way of becoming a family event in northern 
ireland dallas for instance died in front of his children they 
had just gotten off their school bus 
then there was barney lavery 67 driving home with his 
13yearold granddaughter emma donnelly when an ira bomb went off 
outside a police station in benburb and killed them 
emma was junior camogie womens hurling player of the year 
lavery had been the numbercaller at the bingo evening to raise 
funds for the ancient order of hibernians the ira apologized for 
the mistake 
on jan 18 ian catney 26 was shot dead by protestant gunmen 
behind the counter of his mothers gift shop in belfast on feb 9 
tony fusco was gunned down while waiting for his daily ride to his 
job at a glass factory 
both were catholics neither had any known political links the 
ulster volunteer force a protestant paramilitary group claimed 
responsibility as the priest said at fuscos funeral it was 
guilt by association guilt by family name guilt by unfounded 
suspicion collective and community guilt guilt by religion 
austin nelson was a retired truck driver who had turned to making 
violins in the shed behind his house the television documentary 
about him was aired the night before he died 
the film was the talk of the town on tuesday dad was so 
proud said his son michael 26 two ladies came by theyd 
seen the film and asked to him to play them a tune one of the 
ladies told him that even though she met him only for a short time 
shed remember him for the rest of her life 
ernie rankin was a lifelong bachelor and soccer fanatic who 
stood out by his white shoulderlength hair being nearly blind he 
would sit inches from the tv screen to watch the games 
he liked having the local youngsters over for big matches and 
would make them tea while they watched the soccer among the 
qualities the villagers remember was his extraordinary ability to 
loop his leg around his neck 
on tuesday ernie dropped in on austin then he ambled over to 
the garage to see who was around for a chat a few minutes later 
austin put down the violin he was working on and headed off to join 
him the stolen car carrying the three ira attackers was already on 
its way to coagh 
the killings in coagh pushed the death toll since 1969 to 2727 
sixtynine percent of the dead were civilians

jack obrien often performs before an 
empty house but hes virtually guaranteed an encore 
alone beneath the crystal chandeliers and solemn portraits of the 
state house chamber obrien sometimes drones on for hours at a time 
in the early days of a legislative session addressing 118 empty 
chairs and occasionally a doorman 
as house clerk its his lonely job to fulfill an obscure 
constitutional requirement that the title of every bill be read 
aloud before it is considered by lawmakers 
its a mechanical thing of really just going through reading 
and turning papers as fast as you can said obrien a 20year 
veteran of the job its just a constitutional requirement 
the requirement was meant to ensure that lawmakers and other 
interested parties know what measures are under consideration but 
the mandate appears merely quaint in an informationsaturated age 
when bills are dissected by staff analysts touted by lobbyists 
trumpeted in press releases or preserved on computer disks 
so house rules authorize socalled perfunctory sessions that 
spare lawmakers the torture of sitting through the litany of 
legislation 4298 house bills in the 198788 session alone 
probably the longest day weve had was the 1975 deadline for 
filing bills when there was 1021 of them he said it was a 
long long day 
on designated days obrien walks into the deserted chamber 
turns on the public address system and functioning as speaker 
chaplain and clerk calls the house to order says a prayer and 
reads bills 
maybe its a waste of effort said emery koehler head 
doorkeeper of the house and a faithful member of obriens audience 
thats not my personal opinion but a lot of people might draw 
that conclusion 
obrien said there are times when hes tempted to liven things up 
a bit but because the sound system carries his words to various 
state offices and to tape recorders that preserve the sessions 
for posterity he said hes cautious when encouraged to break from 
the script 
theres a little horseplay around the chamber he said 
when theres pages in the chamber theyve tried their best to 
break me up im an attraction there that they cant resist 
though it often seems that no one is paying attention obrien 
said he knows thats not the case 
all i have to do is one thing wrong whatever it might be 
mispronunciation or some other side remark and i find out in a 
hurry how many people who do hear me and do listen he said

a nigerian medical student charged with 
child abuse who says he was only disciplining his daughter in a way 
acceptable in his culture has been suspended by the university of 
florida for one year 
the decision by art sandeen vice president for student affairs 
means fons amayeobu is suspended from classes until after the 
spring semester of 1990 the students attorney horace moore said 
wednesday 
moore is appealing the decision to university provost bob bryan 
who is to become acting president later this month 
amayeobu 34 faces criminal charges of aggravated child abuse 
since his 15yearold daughter accused him of beating her in august 
at their campus apartment 
amayeobu saying the university has no right to intervene in 
family affairs appealed his case to sandeen after the student 
conduct committee recommended expulsion 
under the suspension amayeobu could graduate after returning in 
the summer of next year a fourthyear student he lacks only two 
months of school and a medical internship before completing his 
medical education 
amayeobu separated from the girls mother said he struck his 
daughter after she shouted at him when he asked her to put dinner on 
the table the police report says the girls eyelids and lips were 
swollen and she had a bruised nose which amayeobu denies 
moore said he showed sandeen that the daughter had good grades 
when she was living with her father but has not done as well in 
school since moving out last fall 
it appears as though weve totally disregarded his daughters 
welfare and need for strong parental guidance moore said

his adversaries even a few subordinates used 
to call him the littlest caesar in washington a nickname as 
prophetic as it was derisive in the end just shy of the ides of 
march john tower was done in by his fellow patricians in the senate 
he wanted so badly to crown his public career as secretary of 
defense he even swore abstinence sort of from the nectar of grape 
and grain a texas friend george bush continued to swear by him 
but those oaths were not enough to win tower the oath of office 
the senates 5347 vote late thursday sealed the first rejection 
in history of a cabinet nominee of a newly elected president more 
astonishing to some is that the senate turned against one of its 
own a fourtermer who once headed the very committee armed 
services that dealt the cruelest blow by declaring him on a 
largely partyline vote unfit 
tower 63 surely is among the least surprised that knives were 
drawn by his former colleagues in the oncefabled selfprotective 
society of the senate which never before had rejected a former 
senator for an executive post 
twentytwo years ago tower waged a lonely battle against the 
censure of democratic sen thomas dodd the late father of current 
sen christopher dodd of connecticut he recalled then that sen 
prescott bush another connecticut senator and the late father of 
the president had once been asked by a young woman if senators 
really were courteous and deferential to each other regardless of 
political belief 
he replied yes young lady it is true but when one of us 
breaks a leg we eat him 
broken leg or not tower may have been particularly vulnerable to 
those carnivorous instincts he left the senate in 1985 with an 
especially low reservoir of good will for a departing committee 
chairman 
he had monumental confrontations with leaders of his own party 
much less the democrats who watched him ram ronald reagans massive 
defense budgets through the senate he waged jurisdictional wars 
with other republican chairmen and few members were spared his acid 
tongue in floor debates 
indeed the only senate club that john tower seemed to care about 
was the one he figuratively carried on his shoulder compromise was 
not his cup of tea he once refused even to shake hands with the 
democratic congressman robert krueger who dared run against him in 
1978 
john tower is a former member of the senate but it is probably 
also the case that he doesnt have a lot of intimate friends here or 
any aura of popularity or good will said republican sen richard 
luger of indiana he is not necessarily a person who ingratiates 
himself with anybody 
still he fared well with the electorate of texas which put him 
into the senate in 1961 when the republican party could have held 
its state conventions in a phone booth he won three more terms 
before retiring from the senate in 1985 
he didnt lack for cockiness at a 1979 costume party in dallas 
the 5foot6 tower turned up in a superman suit a rare departure 
from his tailored pinstriped suits and saville row cotton shirts 
i was born to play superman he said im a man who stands for 
truth justice and the american way 
to him that meant bashing liberal democrats for creeping 
socialism supporting a greater war effort in vietnam he still 
believes the united states should have won and striving for 
military superiority not just parity against the soviet union 
twice divorced he was long the subject of rumors about his 
personal life his second wife lilla divorced him in 1987 after 
charging him with marital misconduct last week he acknowledged 
only that he had broken his wedding vows 
but stories about his drinking were the most damaging tower at 
first denied that hed had a problem with alcohol later he admitted 
that he was a pretty good scotch drinker in the 1970s but said 
he drank only moderately in recent years mainly wine 
others didnt see it that way the fbi according to sen ernest 
f hollings dsc turned up corroborated facts with words 
crocked bombed excessive drinking sloshing stoned 
comatose 
many of those accounts came from sources with little or no 
credibility but several came from americans with no apparent ax to 
grind with tower even former aides and defense industry executives 
though his confirmation hearings opened with a tide of good will 
many senators became disturbed by towers dodginess and pattern of 
denial over the alcohol issue he admitted to excessive 
drinking but steadfastly asserted he had not abused alcohol 
he claimed his switch from scotch to wine was evidence of 
moderation a refrain often heard from problem drinkers who fail to 
acknowledge that average servings of wine beer or liquor all have 
the same alcoholic content he took a pledge of abstinence but 
conditioned it on confirmation he continued to drink wine he 
said in the meantime to some that too smacked of the problem 
drinkers claim that he or she can quit any time but not just now 
then too there were concerns about towers coziness with the 
defense industry especially in light of his milliondollarplus 
earnings as a consultant for the likes of martin marietta ltv 
rockwell and textron between those jobs he took on two key 
assignments from reagan first as a strategic arms negotiator then 
as head of the presidential panel that investigated the irancontra 
scandal 
even his severest critics gave him high marks for his irancontra 
report but the reviews were mixed about his stint in geneva where 
tower apparently was bored as a negotiator with the soviets more 
troubling according to democrats was towers own testimony that he 
later counseled defense contractors on their sales prospects in 
light of his perception of the likely outcome of those confidential 
talks tower denied that he shared any secrets or that any conflict 
of interest was involved

band director william p foster thought hed 
done it all from macys thanksgiving day parades to more than 200 
football halftimes but now he was lifting his baton for the 
challenge of a lifetime 
with help from a global tv hookup foster conducted what 
promoters billed as the worlds largest concert he led no fewer 
than 7 million school kids in a songfest thursday that spanned the 
united states and reached from tunisia to the philippines 
but foster is an old pro and he didnt flinch 
natty in a highcollared white uniform with gold buttons he 
mounted the podium in the kennedy centers grand foyer to conduct 
400 local school children in a halfhour choral program performed 
simultaneously by millions of other youngsters via television 
among them were the singing bears of coral park elementary 
school who sang along at a shopping mall in fort lauderdale fla in 
ohio the columbus symphony youth orchestra played host for 2800 
local school children and more than 4000 youngsters from across 
colorado gathered at three sites in the denver area to join the 
singing 
one hundred children from 20 countries who attend an american 
school in tunis sang under fosters televised baton at the us 
embassy in the tunisian capital others chimed in from west germany 
guam and american samoa 
although it was midday thursday in washington it was nighttime 
when 170 singers and band members performed from schools in the 
marshall islands 2400 miles southwest of hawaii nearly 600 pupils 
chimed in from an elementary school at the us naval base at subic 
bay in the philippines 
they all followed fosters conducting cues on seven selections 
including woody guthries this land is your land and irving 
berlins god bless america the same music had been performed by 
2400 children in a performance taped last november in the brooklyn 
academy of music 
the concert was broadcast thursday by 315 public broadcasting 
stations nationwide and by the armed forces radio and television 
network to american schools at military bases and us embassies 
overseas 
its an incredible experience said foster director of bands 
at florida aampm university at tallahassee for the past 42 years 
even though his own marching band and its precisiondrill 
exploits have been seen by millions of people at football halftimes 
including the 1969 super bowl nationally televised parades and 
tv soft drink commercials foster said this was a big deal 
this press agents dream is produced annually by the music 
educators national conference a nonprofit association of 58000 
music teachers and administrators to dramatize the importance of 
music studies in the schools the mass singalong which began in 
1985 was underwritten this year by mcdonalds corp 
opera soprano susan dunn who began her singing career in school 
and church choirs in her hometown of bauxite ark told the kennedy 
center singers that she hoped their part in the worldwide concert 
would encourage other youngsters to study music 
i know first hand that music is more than singing and learning 
rhythm said miss dunn who is starring this week in a washington 
opera production 
music is intrinsically valuable and is a crucial element in 
the school curriculum because it helps our children develop their 
creativity and selfdiscipline she said

opposition leaders praised a government 
agreement to create a new national legislature with freely elected 
members but they say open elections on the local level must be the 
next step toward true democracy 
government and opposition negotiators in a breakthrough that 
could give poland the first democratic national elections in the 
communist bloc agreed thursday to add a second chamber of 
parliament open to all candidates 
the agreement also calls for 35 percent of the seats in the 
existing parliament the seijm to be open to opposition candidates 
additionally the sides agreed in principle to establish a post 
of president who would be elected by a majority of both chambers of 
parliament which would form the national assembly 
opposition figures cautioned that the tentaive reforms only are a 
first step toward substantive democratic reform 
if the process of the democratization is to work it must 
include solutions of such problems as local governments which would 
be elected in completely free elections said bronislaw geremek 
head of the opposition group negotiating with the government on 
political reform 
he also called for opposition access to mass media and freedom to 
create associations 
such reform cannot begin and end at the top authorities 
opposition negotiator zbigniew bujak told state television late 
thursday it must also be made from the bottom 
authorities have insisted on elections in june leaving the 
independents little time to mount effective campaigns 
candidates for the new parliamentary chamber provisionally 
called the senate can be nominated by an existing group or 
gather 5000 signatures to run said janusz reykowski a government 
negotiator 
reykowski is the leader of the government side on the working 
group dealing with political reforms part of the broader talks 
between opposition and the government on polands future 
opposition negotiators said the number of members in the future 
sentate still remained to be negotiated 
they also said the agreement on free elections to the senate was 
part of a tradeoff for conceding that poland would have a strong 
presidency which likely would remain in communist party control 
the powers of the president still are to be debated but the idea 
is to combine in the presidency powers now held by the council of 
state such as appointing the head of the army and names 
ambassadors the president also would be able to dissolve parliament 
and call new elections 
there has been wide speculation that if a presidency is 
established the post would be filled by communist party first 
secretary gen wojciech jaruzelski 
reykowski said the proposed new election law would be submitted 
to the sejm as early as next week the communist party now has an 
absolute majority in the sejm and any laws proposed by the party are 
assured passage 
the electoral changes are part of a package of political and 
economic reforms being negotiated since feb 6 at the talks between 
the authorities and opposition 
the talks also have resulted in tentative agreement to restore 
the banned trade union solidarity the farmers union rural 
solidarity and the independent students association 
solidarity under the leadership of lech walesa had refused to 
come to the negotiating table until the communist party agreed in 
principle to restore its legal status stripped away after the 
december 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
both sides must agree to the entire package for the reforms to 
take effect after a meeting with government officials on tuesday 
walesa said the two sides hope to complete work and sign a new 
national accord april 3 
geremek said entering free elections poses risks for both sides 
the communist authorities for the first time face a test of the 
basis of the ruling coaliton but the opposition is at risk 
because it is completely unprepared for competition at the polls

president bushs defeat on the nomination of 
john tower demonstrates that a congress dominated by democrats is 
not afraid of him and stands ready to trade blows with the white 
house in other tests of power 
for bush the best thing about the long and messy ordeal over 
tower was that it finally came to an end after a bitter sixday 
debate the senate killed towers hopes of running the pentagon on a 
5347 vote 
for weeks the struggle over tower had sapped the energy of 
bushs new white house requiring countless telephone calls and 
trips to capitol hill by chief of staff john sununu 
allegations against tower of excessive drinking womanizing and 
conflict of interest with defense contractors diverted attention 
from subjects bush wanted to highlight and the whole episode 
provoked charges of white house bungling 
even though bush insisted the allegations against tower were 
groundless the nomination reinforced the notion that bush sometimes 
has a blind spot when it comes to picking the right people 
the white house version of events made it sound as if towers 
defeat wasnt such a bad thing after all 
out of this struggle has come a good unity with the republican 
party said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater we 
brought the administration team together and we feel that its been 
a tempering affair that should serve us well as we move forward 
bush did show that even though the odds were against him he 
didnt back down and yank towers nomination he made a stand for 
loyalty and the right of a president to pick his own men 
but the bottom line of course was that bush was defeated in his 
first showdown with congress 
in the first three months to six months a new president develops 
an image that becomes a stereotype this is beginning to shape 
that image in the wrong way for bush said norm ornstein a 
specialist in the presidency at the american enterprise institute 
its not fully formed yet but a few more things like this and 
hell have a very bad image hell have to overcome 
moreover ornstein said the degree of respect and fear that 
every president wants in his relationship with congress is not going 
to be there as much after towers defeat 
for world leaders bushs loss could be a source of uneasiness 
it tells them theyre dealing with a weaker president than 
ronald reagan said william schneider a political analyst at aei 
if you reach a deal with this man will it stick can he sell it 
to congress 
richard brody a stanford university political science professor 
said towers defeat may make bush more cautious on other 
nominations particularly in choosing supreme court candidates if 
vacancies arise 
with the democrats cutting across ideological lines willing 
to hang together on this one it may signal that supreme court 
nominees are not going to get a free ride brody said 
mindful that the democrats run congress and that hell have to 
deal with them again bush carefully refrained from doing anything 
that would drive a wedge between the white house and congress 
he held back on some weapons that are available to the president 
for instance there were no televised addresses from the oval office 
on towers behalf no direct challenge to any of towers critics 
bush seems eager to close the book on the whole affair we owe 
it to the american people to come together and move forward bush 
said after the vote 
senate democrats said they too did not want the tower fight to 
ruin relations with bush senate armed services committee chairman 
sam nunn and senate majority leader george mitchell made a hurried 
telephone call to bush after the vote pledging to work in a 
cooperative and productive spirit 
this doesnt represent an effort to be harmful to the 
president mitchell told reporters i hope and believe we can 
work together on important matters the tension of this issue will 
have no longlasting effect on the relationship 
no one suggests that towers defeat has crippled bush the public 
didnt seem much interested and bushs popularity remains high in 
public opinion polls 
raymond wolfinger a political scientist at the university of 
california at berkeley said tower may have been merely teething 
troubles for bush lots of presidents learn from mistakes early 
in their administration

tchaikovskys eugene onegin not heard at 
the metropolitan opera since the 198485 season returned with a 
cast that assures a satisfying evening 
all the principals were announced as singing their roles for the 
first time at the met but soprano mirella freni had the flu so 
tatyana was sung by makvala kasrashvili a native of the soviet 
union who made her met debut as tatyana in 1979 
her voice is splendidly suited to the part her soft notes and 
high notes are especially lovely 
sandra walker of richmond as her sister olga has a 
mezzosoprano so rich she sounds more matronly than girlish but yet 
its a beautiful voice 
both acted well miss kasrashvili conveyed a young woman not 
sought out by men who suddenly awakens into love with the 
welldressed stranger onegin miss walkers acting also was 
effective in the act 2 party when onegin dances with olga because 
hes bored shes a bit excited about flirting with him 
jorma hynninen of finland sang onegin pleasingly and jerry hadley 
of princeton ill was excellent as olgas jealous fiance hadleys 
singing sounded italian sometimes in the first act but he was clear 
forthright and ringing in act 2 which ends with him shot by onegin 
in a duel 
other notable singers who added to the evenings enjoyment were 
bass nicolai ghiaurov of bulgaria who appears in act 3 as tatyanas 
husband gweneth bean of battle creek mich as tatyanas nurse in 
act 1 and michel senechal of paris who has one aria in french as 
tatyanas tutor 
andrew litton of new york principal conductor of the 
bournemouth england symphony was making his met debut instead of 
trying for the rousing he drew out and savored orchestral 
interludes he held the orchestra quiet while singers held final 
notes as long as they wished he conducted some of the arias so 
slowly one wondered whether the singers had difficulty 
the scenery for eugene onegin dates back to 1957 the 
production was revised in 1977 with new staging costumes and 
choreography for six couples at act 2 and 3 parties the revised 
production changed the language of presentation from english to the 
original russian

a us military team returned home today 
after the laotian government angered by us charges it encouraged 
narcotics trafficking delayed a joint project to search for remains 
of missing american soldiers 
the 14 specialists returned from bangkok to honolulu after laos 
failed to give them clearance to enter for the project that was to 
begin saturday said ross petzing spokesman of the us embassy in 
bangkok 
petzing said the united states appreciated laos past cooperation 
in accounting for americans missing from the indochina war and 
added we hope this mission can be rescheduled 
it was to have been the fifth joint excavation of a us warplane 
crash site to account for 547 americans listed as missing in action 
from the war that ended in 1975 the us experts on the excavations 
are from the us joint casualty resolution center and the army 
central identification laboratory both based in honolulu 
state department spokesman charles redman said on monday he 
understood the delay was related to an annual us government report 
the previous week critical of laos performance in international 
efforts to curb drug production and trafficking 
the report listed a handful of countries that it declared 
ineligible for us aid because of their support for drug 
trafficking in the report president bush recommended that burma 
and laos be added to that list 
opium production is expanding in laos the report said evidence 
of extensive involvement in the narcotics trade by laotian military 
and civilian officials suggests that this is a matter of de facto 
government policy it said 
a march 4 broadcast over official laotian radio denied the 
government encouraged anyone in the drug trade and said it was 
actually cracking down on it 
the us act of linking laos to a narcotics issue and 
announcing the suspension of its aid to laos is unreasonable and 
unconstructive it said 
nevertheless laos will continue to fulfill our pledge of 
giving cooperation to the united states in the search for the 
remains of us mias it said

japan is investing billions of dollars in 
semiconductor manufacturing and support for advanced video systems 
according to congressional witnesses who say the united states may 
face a defeat similar to those it suffered in tv and vcr 
manufacturing 10 years ago 
us electronics companies are unlikely to try to enter the 
highdefinition tv arena unless they get protection from foreign 
manufacturers witnesses told a hearing thursday of the house energy 
and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance 
robert cohen senior economist at the new york state urban 
development corp said the japanese in december committed another 
700 million for a total of 14 billion to speed development of 
highresolution display technology 
the japanese and koreans have invested 6 billion for 
construction of new semiconductor fabrication plants he said with 
the governments making capital available at preferential rates 
those interest rates are from zero to 2 percent in japan and from 
2 percent to 4 percent in europe he said us companies 
meanwhile pay doubledigit rates for capital 
the bush adminstration is considering tax breaks and possible 
changes in antitrust laws to spur a us hdtv industry 
us makers of tv sets and vcrs were driven from the business in 
the 1960s and 1970s primarily because of collusion among japanese 
electronics companies dumping of belowcost japanese tv sets in 
this country and kickbacks to us importers witnesses told the 
panel 
in the face of such market assaults us companies will be 
reluctant to enter the potentially lucrative but enormously 
expensive hdtv manufacturing arena the panel was told 
the american television industry was forced out by predatory 
and vicious attacks here in this market said pat choate a vice 
president at trw inc 
it involved in effect a cartel that was sanctioned by the 
japanese government choate said it involved massive dumping 
there was a massive kickback scheme that was involved 
choate said that for the united states to get back into the world 
market in consumer electronics the government must defend us 
manufacturers from predatory attacks something that was not done 
in the past 
choate said the japanese see hdtv as an essential element of the 
nations future wellbeing like building highways like 
developing other things that are absolute necessities 
the committee completed two days of hearings on what the 
government role should be in the face of the revolutionary changes 
that hdtv with its motionpicture clarity and largescreen 
displays promises not only in entertainment but in education 
medicine automated manufacturing communications and defense 
kenneth flamm of the brookings institute said he wasnt sure that 
there should be so much focus on hdtv rather that the government 
needed to help restructure the technical policy to support a new 
commercial technological base 
he said hdtv was less important than establishing networks of 
cable fiber optics to link homes and businesses 
hdtv is peripheral to that network flamm said 
other witnesses disputed that saying hdtv with its heavy use of 
semiconductors and memory chips could be the driving force behind 
a rejuvenated us electronics industry the subcommittee heard 
testimony that there could be 140 billion in sales of hdtv 
receivers and vcrs by the year 2010 
fred branfman director of the group rebuild america said the 
united states needs all the new technologies and must find a way to 
coordinate what flamm termed the piecemeal approach to 
electronics development 
subcommitee chairman edward j markey dmass said that was 
just what his subcommittee intended to do but he said other 
governments were out to protect their own interests and when push 
comes to shove they will act 
clyde prestowitz a senior associate at the carnegie endowment 
for international peace also cautioned that the us government 
must tread carefully in any effort to protect the us electronics 
industry because us companies also are trying to enter foreign 
markets 
the defense department is seeking companies to share 30 million 
in hdtv research funds and we might consider some reciprocity 
requirement conditioning foreign participation in us efforts to 
develop hdtv on the possibility of us participation overseas 
prestowitz said 
markey said the subcommittee planned to move very fast to 
make recommendations on the government role in hdtv development

an influential education group is trying to 
convince president bush that he can bring about dramatic school 
improvements with little or no extra spending if he adopts its 
prescriptions for change 
first go for quality second reward success in producing 
quality third let the people on the firing line figure out how 
to get the job done and get rid of as much of the bureacracy as 
possible says the blueprint released thursday by the national 
center on education and the economy 
the report calls on bush to set ambitious national math and 
science performance goals that match or exceed those of students 
anywhere in the world 
it also recommends letting some school districts use federal 
money more freely waiving the usual red tape and regulations in 
favor of innovative local plans for as long as students continue to 
progress the successful projects would serve as models to reform 
basic federal programs later on 
new emphasis and cooperation among all levels of government in 
the areas of day care early childhood education and workforce 
literacy are also envisioned in the report called to secure our 
future the federal role in education 
apple computer chairman john sculley chairman of the center 
board said the report has been presented to bush white house chief 
of staff john sununu and education secretary lauro cavazos 
speaking by telephone hookup to a news conference sculley said 
he did not know whether any of the proposals would be included in an 
omnibus education bill now being drafted at the white house 
but sculley said bush was extremely interested in what we had 
to say when he was given a draft last december we do believe we 
have the presidents ear in terms of how important it is for him to 
come out early in his term for massive education reform 
the report comes three years after the center then known as the 
carnegie forum on education and economy released a highly respected 
plan to upgrade the teaching profession among the members of its 
highpowered board are former north carolina gov jim hunt former 
labor secretary ray marshall and pollster lou harris the honorary 
chairman is new york gov mario cuomo 
the two major teacher unions responded positively to the groups 
latest effort 
while respecting the need for certain regulations the report 
suggests we unhandcuff the system for greater creativity said 
albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers 
mary futrell president of the national education association 
said the report correctly stresses the need for federal 
encouragement of restructuring 
we also agree that proposed changes in distribution of federal 
monies and programs must first be thoroughly tested on an 
experimental pilot basis before existing regulatory and legislative 
processes are modified she said 
the cornerstone of the report is its proposal to let school 
districts design initiatives to improve student performance ease 
the transition from school to work for potential dropouts and 
coordinate social services for disadvantaged students the money 
would come from existing programs in the labor education justice 
and health and human services departments 
local communities if their proposals were approved by the state 
and federal governments would be free to combine the available 
state and federal funds as they wish they would continue to be 
free of the prevailing rules and regulations as long as they were 
meeting the performance targets they had set 
the other major recommendations 
bush should identify the best math and science performance 
anywhere in the world and resolve as a nation to meet it or beat 
it said center president marc tucker the report suggests several 
strategies including a revamped curriculum and a national center to 
teach teachers technology 
state federal and local agencies should combine resources for 
highquality fulltime day care preschool child development centers 
and before and after school care programs poor kids should not be 
permitted to enter kindergarten as damaged goods already marked 
for failure 
the country must stop treating adult illiteracy as a personal 
misfortune rather than the threat to the nations standard of 
living that it really is the problem cant be solved by 
volunteers nor can employers be expected to foot the whole bill

soviet treatment of human rights probably 
will never be tested before the world court and moscows willingness 
to obey court rulings carries more symbolism than substance un 
and state department legal experts say 
pieter kooijmans un special investigator on human rights said 
soviet acceptance of the courts authority in six major human rights 
treaties is the shattering of a 40yearold taboo 
interviewed in leiden the netherlands kooijmans added it 
would be a real breakthrough for human rights if the soviet union 
would recognize the right of individuals to file complaints of 
rights abuses 
the world court does not hear complaints from individuals only 
governments 
a state department legal expert noted that the world court has 
never handled a human rights dispute and said privately that the 
soviet acceptance of jurisdiction may amount to nothing more than 
a meaningless gesture 
it would be unlikely that a human rights dispute would ever 
wind its way to the world court he said 
state department spokesman charles redman said thursday that the 
united states welcomes any step in the submission of disputes of 
this kind to binding decisions by neutral bodies such as the 
international court of justice the courts formal name 
the soviet union had ratified the six treaties and pledged to 
honor them but withheld recognition of the authority of the world 
court to judge its compliance 
on wednesday moscow announced it would accept the courts 
jurisdiction in the human rights treaties putting into practice a 
policy president mikhail s gorbachev advocated in december before 
the general assembly 
the soviets agreed to the courts authority on treaties 
condemning genocide banning slavery guaranteeing political rights 
for women prohibiting racism and outlawing torture 
gorbachev also has spoken recently in favor of a larger un role 
in such international areas as arms control and space exploration 
traditionally the domain of the soviet union and united states 
the soviet acceptance of the courts authority will aid the 
soviet campaign to hold a human rights conference in moscow in 1991 
as one of several followup meetings to the 1975 helsinki agreements 
on european security and cooperation 
in january washington changed its position and said it would 
accept a moscow conference citing the soviet release of political 
prisoners the easing of emigration and more tolerant views on free 
speech and freedom of religion 
only governments can take cases before the court which has 15 
judges and sits in the hague in the netherlands it has no authority 
to deal with complaints of individuals or private organizations 
under the optional protocol to the international covenant on 
civil and political rights individual citizens can complain of 
rights abuses to an international body of legal experts with the 
power to order compensation hungary ratified the protocol last year 
the united states has ratified only one of the six human rights 
treaties the soviets have accepted all six 
last year the senate finally ratified the 1948 convention on the 
prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide but it rejected 
world court authority over its interpretation the united states has 
signed the five other treaties but the senate has not ratified them 
we have accepted world court jurisdiction over many more 
treaties than the soviet union has bilateral and multilateral 
the state department legal expert said 
the united states rejects world courts jurisdiction in national 
security cases in 1986 nicaragua asked the court to rule on the 
mining of its harbors and covert us support for contra rebels the 
court ruled in nicaraguas favor but the united states which did 
not participate in the case refused to accept the decision

the 45day deadline that president bush gave 
congress for enacting his 90 billion savings and loan rescue 
package is slipping and by months rather than days 
despite losses mounting at an estimated 33 million a day it has 
been more than a month since bush asked for action by april 1 and 
none of the appropriate congressional committees has even begun 
writing a bill 
while the administration outlined the basic aspects of bushs 
proposals just prior to his budget address feb 9 the details were 
not delivered to congress until two weeks later 
both the house and senate banking committees which have the 
primary jurisdiction are not scheduled to begin drafting 
legislation until after congress returns april 3 from an easter 
recess 
but because bushs package calls for taxpayers to pick up 50 
billion of the tab at an estimated cost four to six times that 
amount over the next 30 years since the money will be borrowed at 
least half a dozen other committees are demanding a say once the 
banking panels are through 
the taxwriting house ways and means and senate finance 
committees are both claiming jurisdiction and the right to amend 
whatever the banking committees do as are the appropriations and 
budget committees on both sides of capitol hill 
sen alan cranston dcalif a member of the senate banking 
committee said thursday that a bill ready for final action by 
congress will not be ready until june at the earliest 
asked if august might be a more reachable target cranston said 
my hope is that it will be before then but you never know 
the committees chairman sen don riegle dmich wants to have 
a draft bill ready by march 23 when congress recesses for easter so 
that members can review it over the holiday 
he recalled that it took congress a full year to write 
legislation for the 15 billion in federal loan guarantees to bail 
out the chrysler corp in 1980 he added that the financial 
complexities of the chrysler package were far fewer than those in 
bushs far bigger sampl plan 
unlike chrysler which repaid all the money once it became 
profitable again no one expects the government to ever regain the 
billions of dollars bush is asking taxpayers to shell out for 
depositors who sought federally guaranteed high interest rates at 
deregulated and now insolvent sampls 
riegle and other democrats have criticized bushs proposed 
creation of a new government corporation to issue 30year bonds for 
financing the taxpayer portion of the bailout as a way of preventing 
the costs from showing up in the federal deficit 
the congressional budget office estimated thursday that the 
fiscal 1990 budget deficit will be 40 billion higher than the 911 
billion predicted by the administration attributing 22 billion of 
the difference to the cost of the sampl rescues 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the taxwriting ways 
and means committee said thursday he expects whatever legislation 
is written by the house banking committee to be referred to his 
panel for amendment 
i do not intend to delay or otherwise hamper the passage of 
this important legislation he said adding that his committee 
will only delve into the revenue and federal debt aspects of the 
package 
only in this way can the congress be assured that the american 
taxpayer will have a full understanding of the total costs of the 
savings and loan assistance program he said 
meanwhile the federal deposit insurance corp took control of 
another 45 failed savings and loans with 136 billion in assets in 
eight states thursday 
that brings to 118 in 24 states the total number of institutions 
that the agency has taken control of since bush announced his sampl 
rescue package in early february 
bush instructed the fdic which regulates commercial banks to 
take over the sickest sampls with the idea of minimizing their losses 
while the institutions await rescue or closure the agency plans to 
take control of about another 100 institutions within the next month

a sunny mild winter with no rain has 
inspired italian designers to rethink their coldweather wardrobes 
for the fallwinter ready to wear collections which ended here 
thursday there are practically none of the usual rainccats heavy 
shearlings and sumptuous furs that usually mark the coming of winter 
italian style 
instead designers played heavily on lighter wool coats capes 
shawls and every possible shape of jacket from the blazer to the 
blouson 
fake furs and fur lookalike fabrics served the double purpose 
of placating conservationists and offering cheaper cooler 
alternatives to the traditional wraps 
the biggest champion for the ecological cause was milans 
numero uno giorgio armani who showed stoles jackets and even 
floor length coats in synthetic substitutes of leopard tiger 
panther among others as the fake furs were paraded down the runway 
a voice speaking for the animal world announced thank you armani 
for saving our skins 
fendi famous for their extravagant furs also nodded in the 
direction of the conservationists with a collection of inside out 
furs the leather side of pelts from sable to skunk is in fact 
treated to look like polished cotton so that the coat stripped of 
its lining is reversible 
the new milanese coat is very big soft and cozy with ample 
dropped sleeve and wide shawl collar sometimes it is belted at the 
waist at others it flows freely to the ankle 
after several seasons where the skirt dominated the fashion scene 
from the daring 1980s minis skirt to the feminine mid calflength 
alternative pants are firmly back on the milan runway often 
mantailored and cuffed they also come superwide especially for 
evening or as skinfitting as tights 
at the beginning of a new decade the milanese designers have 
opted to to let women make their own fashion decisions in color and 
style thus there is not one strong message for next season but a 
lot of fashionable suggestions from gianfranco ferres dramatic 
silhouette of stiffcollared gold cufflinked white silk blouse 
draped with a lavish fox scarf and worn over simple gray flannel 
pants to giorgio armanis tailored art student look to byblos 
leisurely weekend collection 
as to the color scheme there were the usual staple black and 
white and milan smog shades fall shades were also popular with 
aubergine or eggplant and mustard the newest hues for those who 
want a more cheerful winter the designers also offered lots of 
bright blue yellow and tangerine along with festive red 
hairstyles for next winter are generally longer than in recent 
seasons with some designers calling for a return to the wild and 
wooly looks of the 1960s 
there is however one point on which all the milanese designers 
insist high heels even for evening are no longer chic instead 
fashionable women will warm their winter feet in elflike suede 
booties

democrats say legislation awaiting house 
approval would edge eastern airlines and its striking machinists a 
step closer to labor peace one way or another but republicans 
are scoffing at the bills value 
on a voice vote the house public works committee on thursday 
sent a measure to the full house that would force president bush to 
name an emergency board to recommend a way to end the 7dayold work 
stoppage passage by the democraticcontrolled chamber is expected 
next week 
bush opposes such a step arguing that direct talks between the 
ailing carrier and the striking international association of 
machinists are the only way to end the 17monthold impasse eastern 
sought protection from its creditors in us bankruptcy court in new 
york on thursday 
even though the unionsought bill faces an uncertain fate in the 
senate and the likelihood of a bush veto democrats say the 
measure focuses public attention on the walkout puts pressure on 
the two sides to reach an agreement and might even produce a formula 
that would end the dispute 
some of them also say it could embarrass the president into 
taking action 
it focuses a very bright light on inexcusable presidential 
inaction said rep pat williams dmont who is active on labor 
issues for the house dmocratic leadership 
the boards suggested solution would be only a recommendation 
but lawmakers say it could ultimately be imposed on the airline and 
its workers in later separate legislation 
if they dont accept it congress can act on it and i would 
have no hesitation on bringing an offer to the committee rep 
james oberstar dminn chairman of the public works aviation 
subcommittee told the committee before the vote 
republicans however said they believe the bill has little 
chance of becoming law even if it does they said the board would 
do little to bridge the animosity that has been festering between 
the two sides for years 
this is mainly political windowdressing to make it look like 
congress is doing something rep john paul hammerschmidt rark 
ranking republican on the panel told reporters after the vote it 
accomplishes absolutely nothing 
the bill also would provide for a coolingoff period of up to 26 
days while the special board studies the dispute during that time 
rehired workers would receive their prestrike salaries while 
employees who are laid off would be entitled to unemployment 
benefits 
an earlier version of the bill would have allowed a coolingoff 
period of up to 60 days but the panel shortened the time frame 
heeding easterns arguments that it lacks enough cash to survive a 
twomonth delay 
the basic dispute which is over wages and benefits is between 
eastern and the 8500member international association of 
machinists but most of the carriers pilots and flight attendants 
have refused to cross picket lines 
the measure would require the emergency board to recommend 
solutions to contract disputes between eastern and its pilots and 
flight attendants unions which both have expired contracts 
the measures fate is uncertain in the senate where a solitary 
opponent can often use procedural delays to kill legislation sen 
phil gramm rtexas said wednesday he would oppose any effort 
to pass the bill

the pentagon faces paralysis even if george 
bush quickly finds a replacement nominee for john tower as defense 
secretary officials say 
some of the officials argue president bush will have to elevate 
the authority of acting defense secretary william h taft iv a 
reagan holdover or the departments attempt to project a 
businessasusual posture will crumble 
the routine stuff is getting done thanks to will taft said 
one official but were running out of time now you cant just 
focus on the routine stuff 
said another senior official who is also a reagan holdover 
were getting close to the deadline for budget decisions over 
here 
that same official said it would take several weeks before a 
replacement for tower can be installed at the pentagon 
the senate voted 5347 thursday to reject towers nomination 
after questions were raised about his alleged alcohol abuse 
indiscreet behavior toward women and ties to defense contractors 
in the meantime say pentagon officials the pentagons internal 
budget deliberations are coming to a head and that the department 
will have to submit a plan to the white house by the end of the 
month for slashing almost 64 billion from its fiscal 1990 request 
what worries some officials even more is that without a secretary 
of defense the selection and confirmation of key deputies 
throughout the department remains at an absolute standstill 
bush has submitted only one other pentagon nomination that of 
former gm executive donald j atwood to become deputy defense 
secretary to the senate but that nomination now likely goes on 
hold pending selection of a new defense chief and the dozens of 
under secretaries and assistant secretaries that help run the 
department are still not on board the officials said 
we dont have any kind of new team in the top bureucratic 
positions said one source and that means months of delays down 
the road in having people geared up to deal with budget and policy 
matters 
moreover the pentagon has missed congressional deadlines for 
three reports on important military issues and does not have a 
secretary representing it during a special 90day strategic military 
policy review ordered by bush 
were still in the staffwork phase of that review but if you 
dont have a secretary by april then you begin to have problems 
said one official 
the administration is talking about deciding things like the 
shape of our nuclear arsenal and theres no secretary of defense 
said another source at least tower had been working on that 
pending confirmation

building a new indian museum in washington and 
moving the existing one in new york city will cost more than 100 
million not to mention annual operating costs of about 25 million 
a year the secretary of the smithsonian institution told a 
congressional panel 
we are in the process of developing detailed cost estimates for 
this undertaking but recognize already that they will not be 
inconsequential secretary robert adams told the house interior 
committee 
adams appeared with representatives of the museum of the american 
indian and the city and state of new york to detail a tentative 
agreement reached in january transferring ownership of the heye 
foundations collection of indian artifacts to the smithsonian 
the pact which must be approved by the smithsonians executive 
board and new york state courts would solve the problem of 
preserving the collection of 1 million artifacts a fraction of 
which are on display in the new york museum most are stored in a 
bronx warehouse 
adams also estimated onetime costs in the tens of millions of 
dollars for taking over the collection of the museum of the 
american indian and building additional storage space at the 
smithsonians museum support center in suitland md 
these costs of course must be weighed in the light of an 
extraordinary opportunity indeed an obligation to preserve a 
collection of monumental significance make it more accessible to 
the public than it ever has been and to share it fully with those 
whose ancestors created the obejcts within it adams said

when the moment came nancy landon kassebaum 
sat alone at her desk on the crowded silent floor of the united 
states senate 
when her name was called she rose alone among her republican 
colleagues and said what none of them had said or would say about 
the nomination of john tower to be secretary of defense 
no said kassebaum with nearly all of the 100 senators 
sitting quietly in their armchairs listening as she became the only 
republican senator to join democrats in defeating towers nomination 
it was the latest display of independence by the junior senator 
from kansas who serves her state with bob dole the senior senator 
republican leader and prime fighter on behalf of tower 
kassebaum is independent yet loyal 
had her vote been needed she said she would have swallowed her 
objections to tower and voted for his confirmation as she later 
explained to reporters i would not have wanted to be the 
defeating vote if it was that important to the president 
twice before in recent years the 56yearold kassebaum has broken 
ranks with her party on hot highlypartisan issues 
its very tough when you go against the president of your own 
party and against my senior senator who is the republican leader 
but i really didnt have a lot of armtwisting she said 
i think people whether they were disappointed or not and im 
sure some were respected the independent judgment that you bring to 
bear on these issues kassebaum added 
such was the case twice in 1986 in the summer when she voted 
against the nomination of dan manion to be a federal judge and in 
the fall when she voted with democrats to override president 
reagans veto of limited economic sanctions against south africa 
in the manion case she also showed party loyalty while 
dissenting told during the roll call that a fellow republican who 
wanted to vote in favor of manion couldnt be located she agreed to 
pair her vote with the missing senator in effect canceling out 
each others vote 
kassebaum who served as head of a congressional military reform 
caucus said her chief concerns about tower involved his work for 
defense contractors 
the next secretary of defense is going to have to counter the 
debilitating impact that the defense procurement scandal has had on 
public confidence in our defense establishment she said 
she said did not believe that tower could provide the 
leadership that is necessary to forge a consensus on the critical 
national security issues confronting us today 
one of only two women serving in the senate democrat barbara 
mikulski of maryland is the other kassebaum also took note of 
towers alleged attitudes about and treatment of women 
she noted a pentagon study that found harassment and promotion 
problems facing women in the military and said i am not confident 
that senator tower would give these issues the priority they demand 
or would demonstrate the necessary sensitivity to their 
seriousness 
but kassebaum made no mention of towers drinking habits subject 
of much of the weeks debate 
it was not immaterial she said but its hard to judge 
someone on moral standards 
kassebaum daughter of alf landon the 1936 gop presidential 
nominee who was buried by a roosevelt election landslide said she 
thought of her late father during the tower debate 
i couldnt help but think of my dad who im sure would have 
said nancy you should vote with the president he would have 
felt strongly that way but as with most who have an appreciation of 
government he would have respected the judgment i brought to bear 
the senator faces another judgment call in the nottoodistant 
future 
she came to the senate in 1978 promising if elected to serve no 
more than two terms her current one expires in 1990 and she is 
under gop pressure to run for another sixyear term 
at a meeting in doles office recently president bush posed for 
pictures with kassebaum the president wore a campaign button 
saying run nancy run

public life i dont blame the presidential campaign for my 
being an alcoholic she said 
mrs dukakis 52 spoke at a news conference two days after 
completing a monthlong rehabilitation program in rhode island 
she said her drinking became a serious problem in the three 
terribly painful and lonely months after her husbands defeat 
any crisis could have led to the drinking she said the 
campaign was a very positive experience the only problem is that we 
lost

new estimates by the agriculture department 
suggest that american soybean farmers will continue to hear the 
approaching samba sound of brazilian footsteps in the world oilseed 
market 
not that south american production is taking over the soybean 
lead enjoyed by the united states for many years but world trade 
and domestic prices are sensitive to the slightest movement in 
production and demand 
the usda said thursday that improved prospects for soybeans in 
brazil have helped boost the forecast slightly for 198889 global 
oilseed production to 1986 million metric tons 
officials said the total increased less than 1 percent from 
indications last month and still was 4 percent below last years 
record 
soybeans forecast at 934 million tons accounted for most of 
the increase from february the us share of world output was 419 
million tons 
in 198788 when world soybean output was 1032 million tons the 
us harvest was 523 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of soybeans or wheat or 397 bushels of corn 
brazils crop estimate was raised by 1 million tons to 21 
million tons reflecting larger area indications and highly 
favorable growing conditions over the past month the report said 
at 21 million tons the crop would be a record for brazil and 
about 11 percent more than the harvest of 18 million tons in 198788 
brazil and argentina are the leading foreign competitors of us 
farmers in the world soybean market along with other southern 
hemisphere countries they are watched closely for signs of changes 
in soybean and grain production patterns 
for example the improved outlook for brazils soybeans has been 
an important factor this week in commodity futures trading on the 
chicago board of trade along with weather conditions that could 
affect spring planting kin the united states 
argentinas soybean prospects deteriorated further in february 
although the improvement in moisture and temperature trends late in 
the month probably aided soybeans the report said 
the forecast for argentina soybeans was reduced by 500000 tons 
to 85 million tons in 198889 compared with 99 million tons last 
season 
looking at grain the report said global prospects for 198889 
are little changed from last month argentinas new corn crop 
continued to deteriorate but south africas crop showed further 
improvement 
world grain trade for 198889 was forecast to be up slightly from 
february indications with larger imports expected for china and the 
soviet union the us grain supply and use estimates were largely 
unchanged

the agriculture department has scrapped a plan 
which would have held farmers and others in the marketing chain 
financially accountable for selling livestock found to contain 
illegally high traces of drugs at time of slaughter 
the billback proposal was announced may 24 1988 and was 
subjected to public review during formal rulemaking procedure 
nearly 300 comments were received 
bh bill jones administrator of the departments packers 
and stockyards administration said thursday the billback plan was 
designed to shift economic responsibility for violative drug 
residues from the meat packer to the person causing the violation 
the proposal involved illegally high residues of sulfa and 
antibiotic drugs found in carcasses of young calves culled dairy 
cows and swine 
jones said 87 percent of the comments opposed the concept of 
billback with most questioning the ability to trace and accurately 
identify the source of the illegal drug residues 
although the proposal has been withdrawn jones said that would 
not preclude anyone suffering financial hardship because of an 
illegal drug residue from seeking restitution 
buyers are entitled to know the identity of the seller including 
a consignor when an animal carcass is condemned as a result of a 
drug violation he said

young children with ironpoor diets may risk 
problems in mental and physical performance that will continue as 
they enter school a researcher says 
new research findings underline the importance of preventing iron 
deficiencies from birth said betsy lozoff of the case western 
reserve university school of medicine in cleveland 
a study of 191 outwardly healthy oneyearolds in costa rica 
found that those with anemia caused by iron deficiency scored lower 
than other children in mental and physical performance 
preliminary results of a followup study suggest the score 
deficits persisted in those children through age 5 even though the 
anemia had long since been corrected lozoff said thursday 
the children scored within normal ranges for mental and physical 
abilities but the deficits might be enough to affect performance in 
school lozoff said 
speaking at a symposium on nutrition children and health 
sponsored by the new york academy of medicine and the new york state 
department of health she cautioned that the study does not prove 
iron deficiencies cause the poor scores 
myron winick a professor of nutrition and pediatrics at the 
columbia university college of physicians and surgeons in new york 
agreed with that caution perhaps other circumstances that tend to 
occur in homes of children with iron deficiencies are really 
responsible he said 
in any case iron deficiencies in young children can be prevented 
by breast feeding using ironfortified formula and cereal and 
keeping iron in mind when solid foods are introduced lozoff said 
among american children such steps have cut the prevalence of 
irondeficiency anemia from about 25 percent of infants to about 3 
percent to 8 percent lozoff said 
in the costa rican study anemic oneyearolds showed deficits in 
both mental measures and in performance on such tasks as walking by 
themselves climbing stairs and walking along a board 
results of efforts to eliminate such deficits by correcting the 
anemia have been discouraging raising the question of whether the 
iron deficiency is truly to blame lozoff said 
researchers have also found that if very young rats are given too 
little iron a deficiency of the mineral in their brains will 
persist into adulthood even if the ironpoor diet is corrected in 
later life she said 
such studies have not been done in humans because they require 
removing brain tissue lozoff said

budget talks between the white house and 
congress are off to a lessthansmooth start as early political 
squabbling dampened otherwise optimistic talk 
president bushs budget director richard darman and treasury 
secretary nicholas brady met with the democratic chairmen and senior 
republicans from the house and senate budget committees thursday 
afternoon to launch an initial twoweek search for agreement 
the participants said they hoped to draw a map on how to reach 
compromise on a fiscal 1990 budget although they might not reach 
that destination themselves 
their goal they said is a general plan to balance competing 
interests of defense and domestic programs taxes and reducing the 
deficit but without the detail of a congressional budget resolution 
darman characterized the first meeting as deciding on a 
framework for analysis and the talks broke off until next 
tuesday so that budget technicians could put things in order for 
getting down to the hard part 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said the discussions would not necessarily be limited to 
fiscal 1990 bush has proposed a 116 trillion spending plan for 
the year beginning oct 1 
the chairman of the senate budget committee jim sasser dtenn 
told reporters before thursdays meeting that he saw the white house 
agenda as adopting a minimalist approach this year and then 
opening the door to tax increases later 
sasser who repeatedly has said that a tax boost was needed to 
reduce the deficit told reporters that darman was privately 
agreeing with him 
darman however denied he had strayed even privately from 
president bushs promise of no new taxes and said he hoped the 
talks would produce a strong deficitreduction plan 
i cant imagine he would have said that darman said asked 
whether he was more favorable to a tax increase than his public 
statements have indicated darman said maybe thats what he would 
like to believe 
the white house contends enacting its budget would reduce the 
deficit below the 100 billion target of the grammrudman law 
a report by the congressional budget office released thursday 
estimated the deficit at 131 billion 40 billion higher than the 
administration projection most of the difference was due to an 
accounting difference over bushs plan to bail out the savings and 
loan industry

drug policy director william j bennett needs 
to just say no to overeager lawmakers who might make him 
squander time in endless hearings senators said after confirming 
the former education secretary in his new post 
i have pledged to dr bennett that the judiciary committee will 
not call him up to testify in the next six months as long as he 
follows the statutes requirement judiciary chairman joseph 
biden ddel said thursday as the senate voted 972 for 
confirmation 
biden urged other lawmakers to do the same saying the last thing 
bennett needs as the nations new drug czar is to shuttle back 
and forth to capitol hill to field questions 
sen alan simpson rwyo said congressional procedures must be 
streamlined to remove the temptation to summon bennett for 
sevencamera hearings on the drug issue always a convenient way 
to seize the limelight 
bennetts confirmation was smooth even though sparks at times 
flew over his strongly worded views as president reagans secretary 
of education 
only sens paul simon dill and jeff bingaman dnm voted 
against the nominee while sen john warner rva did not vote 
simon a longtime ally of teacher groups said he feared that 
bennett would produce a blizzard of press releases but not much 
action 
he was the lone dissenter hours earlier when the judiciary 
committee voted 131 to send the nomination to the floor he said 
bennett had sought a cut in the education departments drug 
education budget and was not strong as an administrator 
bennetts new post gives him 180 days to draft a strategy for 
fighting the drug war and requires him to study the spending plans 
of cabinet officers and prod them to increase outlays for narcotics 
control if he deems it necessary the president becomes the referee 
if the two officials cannot agree 
sen patrick leahy dvt said thursday that bennett has a 
difficult job but it shouldnt be considered mission impossible 
biden told lawmakers the real issue was whether president bush 
has a strategy whether he is going to enunciate that strategy and 
whether he is going to put that strategy into effect 
sen strom thurmond of south carolina the top republican on the 
committee replied there was no question that bush was focusing hard 
on the drug problem 
i have been in the white house several times recently and i 
assure you that he is vitally interested thurmond said 
biden said he believed bush was interested but it remained to be 
seen if that would be matched by overwhelming commitment of 
resources and action

the american system of handling grain exports 
has so many problems with quality control that the united states 
could lose its leading role in the world market says a report 
requested by congress 
the report released thursday by the office of technology 
assessment said us policy on grain lacks even have one definition 
of quality 
in grain the word quality has a variety of meanings being 
free of foreign material not cracked or spoiled or having the 
proper characteristic for a particular use the report said 
the problems with american grain have led to an increase in 
foreign complaints the report said 
in the 1970s onethird of the worlds countries supplied grain 
to twothirds of the world today the reverse is true the report 
said this highly competitive environment has made foreign buyers 
increasingly sensitive about the quality of grain they import 
the report was prepared at the request of the house committee on 
agriculture and the joint economic committee 
at a news conference on the report sen kent conrad dnd 
said he did not agree with everything it in but that it was 
important in determining how the united states can improve its 
competitive edge 
its a starting point for further debate he said 
both he and sens thomas daschle dnd and charles grassley 
riowa mentioned that they were troubled by reports of cement chips 
in us grain that had been shipped to foreign ports 
my farmers tell me their grain is clean when it is brought to 
the elevator said daschle 
conrad said the secretary of agriculture has been asked to 
investigate further 
michael phillips who headed the ota study said the problem is 
with the whole system of marketing grain to foreign countries 
compared with other grainexporting countries the us system is 
more complex phillips said 
he said other countries address the quality problems as part of 
an integrated agricultural policy with more controls at the first 
point of sale 
most other exporters clean grain at the first point of receipt 
while no economic incentive to do so exists in the united states he 
said 
he also said foreign buyers complain about the way the united 
states blends a wide range of different quality grains in an attempt 
to create a uniform product but this causes differences in 
shipments 
rep dan glickman dkan said enhancing grain quality must 
begin with the design of commodity programs research at 
universities and seed breeders on new grain varieties and the 
standardization of testing procedures 
phillips said however the united states still has many 
advantages over its biggest competitors argentina brazil canada 
and australia 
we can meet almost any demand he said we can produce any 
type of grain a buyer wants we can supply it at any time of the 
year and we can move it from terminal to overseas buyer faster thany 
anyone else

for east germany and the soviet union did it mainly for the money a 
psychiatrist testified before the officer was sentenced to 40 years 
in prison and fined 50000 
warrant officer james w hall iii 30 of sharon springs ny

courtmartial also gave hall a dishonorable discharge and ordered 
him to forfeit all future pay and allowances 
hall who will be eligible for parole after serving a minimum of 
10 years was facing the prospect of a death sentence before he 
entered into a pretrial agreement with the government that set his 
maximum punishment at 45 years confinment 
eggers was not allowed to see the punishment agreement before 
passing sentence 
army prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed during the 
courtmartial that hall had received payments totaling 100000 to 
200000 between 1983 and 1988 when he admitted passing classified 
information to representatives of east germany and the soviet union 
the annual 30000 retainer from east germany was in effect part of 
that fiveyear period 
col david armitage chief of the armys forensic psychiatry 
division at walter reed army hospital testified thursday that his 
examinations of hall suggested that hall was motivated primarily by 
money 
most of the governments case against hall including the details 
of his espionage activities was outlined for eggers during closed 
sessions of the courtmartial that were conducted in a secured 
courtroom

authorities the pretrial agreement required that he submit to 
unlimited debriefings and polygraph examinations about his spy 
activities 
he also agreed to testify if called against huseyin yildirim a 
turkishborn naturalized citizen to whom hall allegedly passed the 
intelligence information

for etelvina ticas the road to the 
promised land was paved with open palms and demands for payoffs as 
she traveled north to the united states the question was always the 
same 
do you want to go further then hand over money the young 
salvadoran refugee said crying a bit as she cuddled her 5yearold 
daughter 
central americans such as ms ticas refugees fleeing embattled 
homelands say much of what they saved for their long dangerous 
trip north was slowly sapped by an assortment of smugglers bus 
drivers and corrupt officials 
it happens at all the checkpoints there are said a 
27yearold honduran woman who gave her name only as margarita 
they ask for papers on the bus and the ones who dont have papers 
they tell to give them money 
beginning soon after they enter mexico from guatemala the 
central americans say people who identify themselves as authorities 
demand money to allow them to continue 
some also complained of robberies by people they said identified 
themselves as police and of extortion by others including bus 
drivers 
spokesmen for the attorney generals office and the interior 
department said they knew of no formal complaints of abuses by 
people in their departments 
central americans have been flooding north through mexico but 
they no longer can legally enter the united states and apply for 
political asylum without being detained 
many have searched for smugglers to help them across the rio 
grande from this border town but others say they have run out of 
money 
the refugees many of them in mexico illegally gave only general 
locations for checkpoints and were unfamiliar with the multiple 
government agencies making it unlikely they could file a complaint 
even if they were willing to go to authorities 
ms ticas sat in a border patrol station in mcallen texas as 
she recalled the arduous costly journey from eastern el salvador 
that ended with her detention this week shortly after entering the 
united states 
she said those who stopped the buses at about five different 
points from when we entered mexico until we left mexico took a 
total of between 215 and 260 in mexican pesos part of the 700 
she had when she entered the country 
at one stop men were forced to strip to prove they werent 
hiding money she said she had to shake her clothes and jacket 
she managed to hide a roll of bills but left behind a small 
suitcase of clothing as part payment she said 
there are many scoundrels who commit abuses who pass 
themselves off as police officers rene hernandez of the attorney 
generals office said 
both he and hector rivera of the interior departments 
immigration services office said central americans must file formal 
complaints saying who demanded the money and where the incidents 
occurred 
they said they could refer to any of at least four different 
police forces as well as customs and immigration agents all under 
separate government departments 
a few said they reached the border without having to pay but 
extortion was the first aspect of the trip mentioned by many and one 
of the main reasons they gave for having little or no money left 
cirse amador 22 a nicaraguan said the routine is common among 
authorities and others 
they say youre not from here if you want to get to mexico 
city youre going to have to give some dough she said 
she said about six people paid the bus driver 65 down from his 
asking price of 86 to get them by the checkpoints 
the bus drivers took my last 73 luis alonso avalos a 
salvadoran said they said we had passed two checkpoints and that 
was what it was worth

warsaw pact and nato negotiators 
emphasized their areas of agreement rather than their sharp 
differences as they began new talks on cutting conventional weapons 
and building mutual trust 
the separate sets of talks opened thursday in viennas majestic 
hofburg palace the new arms negotiations replace 15 years of failed 
talks also held here 
the new sessions on reducing conventional weapons bring together 
the 16 nato countries and the seven sovietled warsaw pact nations 
the negotiations on closer eastwest relations involve 35 nations 
including the soviet union and united states that signed the 1975 
helsinki accords on human rights 
the chief soviet negotiator oleg grinevsky said the differences 
between the sides were not insurmountable and he held out hope of 
an initial agreement by the early 1990s 
chief us negotiator steven j ledogar said the negotiations 
were off to a good start but that nato did not want to set a time 
frame for possible agreements we are not really that far apart 
ledogar said 
despite the optimistic words arms reduction proposals presented 
by each military bloc at the negotiations underlined the 
differences particularly over air and naval forces and tactical 
nuclear weapons 
outlining the warsaw pacts stance on conventional arms 
grinevsky proposed deep cuts by 1994 in troop numbers tanks 
artillery and other land weapons and combat aircraft 
he gave no numbers but said both blocs should eliminate any 
imbalances and then trim to 10 percent to 15 percent below their 
present lowest levels 
in a second phase from 199497 both sides should trim troop 
numbers by 25 percent or about 500000 men he said in a third 
phase by the year 2000 the alliances should move to strictly 
defensive forces 
by contrast nato wants specific overall ceilings under its 
proposal each side should be limited to 20000 tanks 165000 
artillery pieces and 23000 armored personnel carriers 
nato says the proposal would eliminate the danger of a surprise 
attack and a 21 warsaw pact edge in those weapons 
as outlined in a paper given to reporters the warsaw pact 
proposal at the closeddoor negotiations made no specific mention of 
tactical nuclear weapons 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze drew criticism 
from the west on monday for including nuclear rockets in proposals 
for the talks whose mandate specifically excludes the weapons 
western officials saw shevardnadzes proposal as targeted at west 
germany where there appears to be little political support for us 
efforts to modernize aging tactical nuclear weapons 
grinevsky said at a news conference that the east was seriously 
concerned about such efforts 
nuclear weapons are not on the agenda but they exist all 
around us its impossible to close our eyes to that im just 
warning about that nothing more he said 
he also said the west should not expect onesided concessions in 
light of unilateral troop and spending reductions already made by 
the warsaw pact 
good will has its limits grinevsky said let none cherish 
the hope that our profound internal changes will be making us more 
malleable and agreeable to unreasonable demands or inflated bids

the nations immigration chief says hell use 
county jails and military facilities to detain central american 
refugees if they continue to stream across the texas border but a 
house panel chairman says the policy is an impending disaster 
alan c nelson commissioner of the immigration and 
naturalization service told a house panel thursday that theres no 
alternative to detaining the refugees while their claims for asylum 
are processed because theyll never be found if given freedom to 
travel 
it looks like an impending disaster said rep bruce a 
morrison chairman of the house judiciary immigration subcommittee 
he said the ins detention facility at port isabel texas now with 
1700 refugees would soon reach its capacity of 5000 
the commissioner said the key to slowing down the stream of 
immigrants depends on whether the word gets down the line that 
theres no free ride any more for those crossing the us border 
illegally 
nelson said the refugees coming for economic reasons are 
abusing the asylum process by contending they meet the test of a 
wellfounded fear of persecution in their native countries 
we have other detention facilities if the port isabel 
facility is filled up nelson said including arrangements with 
county governments for use of their jails and for use of military 
facilities 
morrison dconn and rep john bryant dtexas also contended 
that the crush of refugees has caused the bush administration to 
reverse the reagan administrations policy of favoritism toward 
asylum requests of nicaraguans fleeing the communist sandinista 
government 
something extraordinary is going on morrison said citing a 
drastic decline in approvals for nicaraguan asylum requests since 
the latest influx of refugees began straining the resources of the 
ins 
nelson insisted theres been no change in policy asserting 
that the nicaraguans coming now were doing so for economic reasons 
while more of their predecessors came because of political 
persecution 
ive got to call them as i see them nelson said contending 
each case is reviewed on its own merits 
but morrison said he suspected a deliberate policy change because 
asylum approvals for nicaraguans dropped from 53 percent from 
198388 to as low as 2 percent on one day sampled last month 
i dont know theres a discrepancy nelson said to a round of 
laughter in the hearing room 
bryant asked is everything okay in nicaragua has the book 
changed so youre saying things are not so bad 
nelson and paula dobriansky deputy assistant secretary of state 
for human rights assured the panel they still believed nicaraguas 
communist government was persecuting its people 
bryant said that former attorney general edwin meese iii invited 
nicaraguans to flee in a july 8 1987 news release announcing a 
liberalization of immigration standards for 200000 nicaraguan 
exiles then in the united states the administration strongly 
indicated that none of the nicaraguans would be deported 
bryant said there was a shocking discrepancy between the 531 
percent approval rate for nicaraguans from 198388 and the 27 
percent approval for those fleeing the usbacked government in el 
salvador i have serious doubt about that much disproportion he 
said 
morrison asked ms dobriansky do you have confidence that if 
we go and look at a sampling of cases we will find no 
ideological or political basis for asylum decisions 
i have not reviewed the cases she said we follow the 
criteria

the house armed services committee will pass 
judgment next week on an independent commissions proposal to close 
86 military bases nationwide and partially close or realign 59 
others 
the action slated for tuesday follows a 131 vote by the 
subcommittee on military installations to oppose a resolution 
disapproving the base closings the full committees action will be 
only advisory however and the resolution will ultimately go before 
the full house 
the lone supporter of the resolution in thursdays vote was rep 
jim courter rnj who opposes the recommended closing of fort dix 
in his state and who has said he believes the commissions 
costbenefit analyses are flawed 
the pentagon has sought for years to close a number of bases it 
views as obsolete duplicative or otherwise wasteful but has been 
consistently thwarted by members of congress who protected 
installations in their home districts 
last year an independent 12member commission on base 
realignment and closure was set up to take a look at the issue and 
recommend a list of bases for closing it issued its report last 
dec 29 and thendefense secretary frank carlucci forwarded the 
recommendations to congress in january 
under the law which established the commission congress must act 
to accept or reject the recommendations in their entirety within 45 
working days after march 1 
the base closing commission reviewed more than 4200 military 
properties focusing primarily on their military value but also 
weighing environmental and socioeconomic considerations 
the commission said its recommendations would save 6936 million 
annually

the dollar lost ground against the japanese yen in 
tokyo on friday while share prices rebounded on the tokyo stock 
exchange after losing ground earlier in the day 
the dollar closed at 12888 yen down 035 yen from thursdays 
12923yen finish the currency opened at 12885 yen and was traded 
in a range between 12882 yen and 12908 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which shed 
18121 points the previous day recouped 4533 points or 014 
percent to finish trading at 3170178 
the markets main index recovered from its 11633 pointdecline 
in the morning session and gained ground in the afternoon 
exchange dealers said the market has been bearish since the end 
of february because of unwillingness by fund managers to risk their 
portfolios as the end of the accounting period for their mutual and 
trust funds approaches japans fiscal year ends march 31 
most fund managers appear to have won reasonable profits 
thanks to the bullish market throughout the year said keiichi 
nishida a dealer at kidder peabody securities in tokyo but most 
of them have already cashed in and the market doesnt seem to have 
much incentive for buying at this point 
he said the trend is likely to continue until the end of the 
month 
but market environment is not so bad either nishida added 
so if share prices go down even further investors may turn to 
buying again 
the nikkei tokyos main economic barometer has plunged more 
than 700 points since monday 
in currency dealings dealers said the dollars weakness was 
prompted by comments from us budget director richard darman on 
thursday in which he discounted a tax increase his statement 
contradicted that of michael boskin chairman of the council of 
economic advisers who said wednesday that taxes may rise 
market anxiety over the us unemployment figure for february to 
be released friday in washington sidelined many players added a 
dealer at a major commercial bank speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the report will provide one of the first indications of how the 
american economy has responded to rising interest rates the us 
federal reserve board has been pursuing a restrictive monetary 
policy to help slow growth and relieve inflationary pressures on the 
economy

single mother of two daughters but ill still be right out here 
picketing and protesting i want my paycheck ive got rent food 
clothing to buy 
betsie romano a 20year flight attendant was on the picket line 
thursday pushing her 2yearold daughter beige in a stroller as news 
of the chapter 11 reorganization circulated i was mentally 
prepared but financially no ms romano said my husband is 
unemployed my familys busted 
yurbano mayorquin a 21year electronics technician said hell 
be looking for a new job at age 55 im going to try to start over 
again mayorquin said 
the machinists union urged all workers to file for unemployment 
compensation though it was doubtful strikers would qualify 
striking members also were urged to seek financial counseling and 
loans from the eastern employees credit union 
the company indicated that this weeks paychecks were frozen like 
other eastern liabilities because of the chapter 11 filing union 
attorneys are likely to ask the bankruptcy court to order the checks 
released 
wally haber a machinists district general chairman said 100 
weekly strikefund payments wont begin for two more weeks under 
union rules 
the pilots national union will make emergency payments to 
eastern pilots if no resolution occurs by march 15 when the pilots 
next check is due union leaders said flight attendants were 
uncertain whether they could obtain any such special benefits 
earlier thursday workers jammed around television sets in the 
machinists union hall shouting at lorenzo and eastern president 
phil bakes as they announced the bankruptcy filing in new york they 
cheered for the live telecast that followed of machinists district 
100 president charles bryans news conference in miami 
it certainly is a sad day for eastern said bryan the 
combative union leader who heads 8500 mechanics baggage handlers 
and other ground workers who struck the airline saturday after talks 
broke down in their 17month contract dispute 
the strike virtually shut down eastern when pilots and flight 
attendants refused to cross machinists picket lines 
bryan said his union will fight lorenzo in bankruptcy court and 
in washington and will picket everything touched by texas air 
including a fuel tanker in corpus christi texas and eastern 
sister airline continental where lorenzo got labor contracts 
abrogated in 1983 bankruptcy reorganization 
the pilots whose action was blamed by lorenzo for forcing the 
bankruptcy reorganization also pledged to continue fighting any 
sales of assets and to do battle in bankruptcy proceedings 
chapter 11 means theres still a patient and its undergoing 
surgery and its coming back said john bavis head of the eastern 
pilots thats better than the continued slow dismantling of 
eastern under texas air 
bavis said lorenzos statement blaming the pilots was 
amazing and that the chairman had sought the strike so he can 
break the unions and get rid of us once and for all 
bryan said poor management not easterns unions was to blame 
for the strike and he repeated charges hes made for three years 
that lorenzo intended from the start to try to break the unions and 
carve up eastern 
the union is urging a nationwide boycott of continental which 
bryan says is lorenzos war machine to take advantage of 
easterns shutdown by expanding its lowcost services on eastern 
routes

relations between the superpowers may seem as warm 
as a mcdonalds hamburger in moscow but a new flood of 
antiamerican attacks is showing the flip side of glasnost 
while soviets themselves are reading more good things about the 
united states their government is providing foreigners with 
antius material that harkens back to the cold war 
many of the assertions have been heard before from the soviets 
the fbi murdered the rev martin luther king jr the cia massacred 
jim jones and 900 of his peoples temple followers in guyana 
but now they are part of glasnost president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of greater openness according to an editor at 
the soviet press agency novosti 
hundreds of such antiamerican charges are contained in booklets 
published recently by novosti whose motto is information for 
peace and international friendship 
the deputy editorinchief of novostis north american 
department yevgeny a posdnyakov says the slick publications are 
not just recycled cold war propaganda but part of the campaign for 
greater frankness 
there is a need to write about everything so people will make 
up their own mind and understand things posdnyakov said the 
demand that some zones be free from inquiry by journalists would be 
an attack on glasnost 
the view from washington is far different at least one of the 
novosti books once again about the cia is full of falsehoods 
and innuendo designed to smear the reputation of the united states 
us officials charge 
we have discussed this book with the soviets as a particularly 
egregious example of what we call disinformation said us 
embassy spokesman richard gilbert 
nevertheless once again about the cia whose cover shows 
bloody corpses imposed on the central intelligence agencys seal is 
being distributed in special waiting rooms of moscow airports 
reserved for foreigners according to posdnyakov 10000 copies were 
printed in english 
novosti publications also are available in intourist hotels 
whose clientele is largely foreign from aeroflot the soviet 
airline and from soviet embassies and other institutions abroad 
paradoxically the publication of the books largely intended for 
foreign markets comes as official media whose audience is mostly 
soviet are finding much about the united states to praise 
ogonyok magazine recently asked whether a usstyle jury system 
could be instituted and on thursday the communist party daily 
pravda lauded the taste of hamburgers from mcdonalds which has a 
franchise in moscow 
the novosti books strike a far different note among recent 
releases 
silent terror billed as the book us censors dont want 
americans to read written by former us cancer researcher arnold 
lockshin and his wife lauren who obtained political asylum in the 
soviet union in 1986 the book recounts the silent campaign of 
harassment and terror which the fbi the us political police 
organized to force them to conform politically or be sorry 
the former houston couple members of the communist party usa 
who came to moscow with their three children accuse the fbi of 
waging an intimidation campaign that included the bugging of their 
home 
the lockshins also say it was an inescapable conclusion 
that the fbi murdered king the late civil rights leader 
their book was printed in 10000 copies in english posdnyakov 
said 
once again about the cia in 117 pages accuses the us 
intelligence service of committing the monstrous crime of 
killing the rev jim jones and more than 900 of his followers at 
jonestown guyana in 1978 and of assassinating foreign leaders like 
panamas omar torrijos and the congos patrice lumumba 
the booklet suggests that cia made an unsuccessful attempt on the 
popes life in 1981 which an italian state prosecutor linked 
instead to the secret service of bulgaria a soviet ally

one out of every three eighth and 10thgraders 
surveyed in 20 states said they have seriously considered killing 
themselves and many have poor health habits that include drinking 
smoking and ignorance of safe sex 
thirtyfour percent of the 11000 students 25 percent of the 
boys and 42 percent of the girls reported that they had thought 
seriously about ending their lives and 15 percent had gone so far 
as to attempt potentially fatal injuries the national centers for 
disease control reported thursday 
dr lloyd kolbe director of the cdcs division of adolescent and 
school health said the suicide figures were surprising we just 
didnt think it would be that high he said 
he said it was the first time the suicide question had been asked 
in the national adolescent student health survey so researchers 
lacked a bench mark for comparison 
many schools in the nation are teaching more about suicide 
about how to identify friends who may be suicidal and many school 
faculty are being trained in how to deal with suicides should they 
occur kolbe noted 
he thought the findings added urgency to such activities i 
think what it means is that we need to begin exploring this a little 
more and looking at what we can do kolbe said 
the 1987 survey addressed questions about alcohol drugs 
violence suicide and sex to eighth and 10thgrade students in 
randomly selected classrooms chosen from a national sample of 217 
schools in 20 states 
in the eighth grade 51 percent had tried smoking and 77 percent 
had tried alcohol by 10th grade the numbers rose to 63 percent for 
smoking and 89 percent for liquor 
overall 22 percent reported smoking in the previous month and 
about 32 percent reporting having five or more drinks at one time in 
the previous two weeks 
drinking and drug use contributes very substantially to 
homicide and suicide kolbe said 
the survey also measured students knowledge about healthrelated 
topics 
fortyseven percent believed wrongly that donating blood 
increases the risk of aids 
fiftyone percent thought incorrectly that washing after sex 
could decrease the likelihood of getting aids 
only 43 percent were able to figure out from a cereal box which 
was the chief ingredient and only 42 percent knew what the date on 
a milk carton means 
one bright spot was that more than 90 percent knew that having 
sex with a person infected with aids or sharing drug needles 
increases the chance of transmitting the virus according to cdc 
researchers 
kolbe said education and awareness could prevent many needless 
deaths among young people 
in the 1to24yearold age group there are only really four 
predominant causes of death he said referring to car crashes 
other injuries homicide and suicide 
those causes of death would be drastically reduced if we could 
give young people the skills they need to avoid engaging in the 
behavior that results in those causes he said 
other survey findings 
fiftysix percent of the students said they didnt wear their 
seat belt the last time they rode in a car and 44 percent of the 
10th graders and 32 percent of the 8th graders reported riding in 
the last month with someone who was drinking or on drugs 
thirtyfour percent of the students reported theyd been 
threatened with violence in the preceding year and 14 percent had 
been robbed 
twentythree percent of the boys said theyd carried a knife in 
the past year and nearly one in 10 packed a knife every day 
the margin of error for the survey was plus or minus 35 
percentage points for each sex or grade category

britains stiff upper lip broke into a big grin 
today as millions of people put on red plastic noses wallowed in 
baked beans donned gnome suits and pretty much turned the day into 
a big laughing matter 
despite the outbreak of mass silliness organizers of some worthy 
causes will be laughing all the way to the bank if todays red 
nose day 2 is as successful as last years inaugural charity 
drive which raised 27 million 
the idea behind the fundraising effort which was organized by a 
group of british comedians and run by a coalition of groups called 
comic relief is to get britons to loosen their pursestrings while 
they laugh 
twothirds of this years cash will go to third world projects 
and to princess annes save the children fund and the rest to 
programs in britain to help young people and the elderly 
britain has been gearing up for today all week cars trucks and 
taxis have been sporting big red plastic noses on their hoods and 
radiators 
on thursday health secretary kenneth clarke and two government 
colleagues wore red plastic noses and posed for press photographers 
and soldiers paraded with guns and red noses at the yeomanry 
barracks in york in northern england 
most britons however saved their red noses for today the goofy 
89 cent props are purchased from the sponsoring charities a 
national store chain and in many pubs a chain of gas stations is 
selling the car schnozzes for 172 
all proceeds go to comic relief 
as of thursday night more than 45 million red noses for people 
and 2 million for autos had been sold with a big surge in sales 
expected today 
rowan atkinson billy connolly and other top british comedians 
predicted that 7 million britons would don red noses today 
tied in with red nose day 2 are 50000 fundraising stunts 
registered with comic relief 
the stunts range from ian hunts 10hour wallow in a bathtub full 
of cold baked beans at the sutton arms pub in london for which his 
supporters have pledged 1720 dollars to customers at a pub near 
swansea who will hold a candlelit supper atop eight tons of cow dung 
several of the staff at the historic tower of london one of the 
capitals top tourist attractions planned to spend their working 
day clanking round in suits of armor 
officers at leytonstone police station in east london will direct 
evening traffic dressed as garden gnomes 
as last year the british broadcasting corp plans a sevenhour 
comedy extravaganza on television to mark red nose day 2 starring 
comic relief stalwart lenny henry atkinson rhys jones phil 
collins and more than 100 other show business personalities 
the french nobleman the duc de sully said 359 years ago that the 
english take their pleasures sadly even today not everyone is 
enamored with red noses 
there is a lot to be said for having no sense of humor life 
is a vale of tears columnist geoffrey wheatcroft wrote today in 
the london newspaper the daily telegraph on friday 
what is more objectionable about todays stunt than its 
childishness is its forced merriment our own postchristian 
christmas is bad enough with its relentless mandatory mirth it is 
not hard to understand why the week around dec 25 has the highest 
suicide rate of the year

a growing political feud between two 
of yugoslavias republics has prompted many serbians to mount an 
unprecedented boycott of slovenian goods according to news reports 
belgrade newspapers said thursday that many businesses and 
shoppers in serbia the largest of six republics are shunning 
products from slovenia to protest support there for ethnic albanians 
who went on strike last month in the southern serbian province of 
kosovo 
on feb 27 prominent slovenian intellectuals and politicians 
came together in the republics capital of ljubljana to express 
support for about 1300 striking miners at the trepca leadzinc mine 
in kosovo 
the federal government sent troop and tank reinforcements into 
the province but three provincial leaders viewed as proserbian 
resigned and the striking kosovo miners ended their eightday sitin 
tensions between serbs and ethnic albanians in kosovo have led to 
mass protests through much of the past year 
new reports of labor unrest in the province were still emerging 
the official tanjug news agency said about 400 ethnic albanian 
miners at a nearby mine went on strike thursday 
tanjug said the miners at the goles magnesite mine about 140 
miles south of belgrade rallied at the companys head office and 
demanded to talk to kosovo officials 
the reasons for strike were not immediately clear but it 
appeared to be politically motivated said a journalist in the 
provincial capital of pristina 
a day after the earlier strike ended more than 500000 angry 
serbs claiming insult to their national pride protested in 
belgrade against slovenia 
they also called for ending political pluralism in slovenia the 
countrys most liberal and industrial republic several independent 
political groups have been established there in recent months 
after the rally hundreds of serbians ran on the belgrade branch 
of the slovenian bank of ljubljana closing their accounts and 
transferring the equivalent of at least 15 million to serbian 
banks the belgrade daily newspaper borba said thursday 
several serbian businesses have threatened to break off business 
with slovenian firms if the companies refuse to condemn slovenian 
leadership for its support for albanian separatists in kosovo 
the newspaper said 
the vulkan rubber plant in southern serbia a subsidiary of a 
slovenian tire manufacturer served notice that it was severing its 
ties with its mother company the report said 
it also said workers at a pig farm near belgrade refused to allow 
hogs that had already been paid for to be loaded on trucks for 
transport to slovenia 
shoppers throughout serbia meanwhile have been boycotting 
slovenian goods which are generally considered superior to local 
products the vecernje novosti newspaper reported thursday 
it is true that our customers are choosing slovenian goods less 
and less frequently milos slijepcevic chairman of yugoslavias 
largest department store chain beograd was quoted as saying 
shoppers are now disgusted and often loudly complain when 
they see such goods on display slijepcevic was quoted as saying 
serbia has been trying to impose more central control on kosovo 
which is administratively part of the republic but enjoys wide 
autonomy under the present yugoslav constitution 
serbian leaders claim that the minority slav population is being 
harassed by the albanian majority there

umm elfahm israel ap moslem fundamentalists who won control 
of this city say bad roads and big debts not an islamic revolution 
helped propel them to power 
nevertheless some israeli jews say they are worried by the 
outcome of the election in this northern town of 27000 people 
government officials scholars and editorial writers have warned 
of a fundamentalist trend and some even suggest ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini the iranian patriarch has become a revolutionary model 
for israeli moslems 
israel has 810000 arab citizens 18 percent of the population 
and 80 percent of them are moslems 
sheik raed salah mahajneh a moslem preacher and new mayor of umm 
elfahm said his party won because the town is in disrepair and has 
a debt of 39 million he blamed that on skimpy government funding 
and a poor job by the previous local administration which the 
communists supported 
we are short of drainage roads and schoolrooms said the 
30yearold mayor a policemans son anywhere you put your 
finger there is something to be done we are not in iran we are 
here we have been here since before the iranian revolution 
alex bligh a government adviser on arab affairs said complaints 
of discrimination against israeli arabs were not totally 
baseless despite improvements he said the ratio of government 
funds devoted to jewish and arab towns is 41 
mahajneh has the full beard of a moslem fundamentalist but he 
greeted reporters this week in a stylish sweater slacks and loafers 
the islamic movements use of mosque donations to build roads and 
kindergartens in arab areas is cited by many observers as a major 
reason for its election success 
a combination mosque clinic and social center now being built in 
umm elfahm was financed with local donations and 45000 from cat 
stevens the american folk singer who changed his name to yusef 
islam after becoming a moslem mahajneh said 
the fivestory complex sits on a hill overlooking the town 35 
miles northeast of tel aviv 
such efforts by the party have not arrested decades of neglect 
however open sewage drains and rutted dirt roads are common in 
arab towns and villages 
the islamic movement which is challenging communist domination 
among israeli arabs won leadership in umm elfahm and two large 
villages and could win three more villages in runoff elections 
six of the 19 council posts in the biblical city of nazareth went to 
islamic candidates 
bligh who spoke at a government forum on the elections called 
the victories a very disturbing development that could have 
national implications if the islamic movement runs for parliament 
where arabs occupy a halfdozen of the 120 seats 
rafi israel an expert on islamic affairs at hebrew university 
tied growing fundamentalism among israels moslems to the islamic 
fervor of khomeini and libyan leader moammar gadhafi i can see 
very alarming signs that things might get out of hand he said 
he noted that the concept of islam as a system of government and 
society as well as a religion were incompatible with the idea of a 
jewish state and declared it nonsense to believe arabs were 
loyal citizens of israel 
leaders of the islamic movement and newly elected moslem 
officials insist such fears are unfounded 
we will not do anything outside the law mahajneh said the 
law will be here as it is in tel aviv

scientists reported today that the next best thing 
to a cure for the common cold a way to prevent it may have 
become possible at last by using a kind of cellular illusion to 
trick the relentless virus 
two teams working separately have deciphered the chemical 
hitching post that about half of all cold viruses use when they 
latch onto cells in the nose and infect them 
this seemingly arcane discovery may be an important key to 
defeating one of humanitys most universal miseries 
it is clearly feasible to develop a treatment based on what we 
have learned said dr timothy a springer of the center for blood 
research in boston 
their anticold strategy is simple fool the virus 
the scientists have developed a detailed picture of the 
rhinovirus receptor on the cells that make up the lining of the 
nose a cold occurs when a virus attaches itself to one these 
receptors and infiltrates the cell 
researchers have isolated the gene responsible for making the 
receptor and as a result they can produce it in limitless 
quantities 
they believe they can keep people healthy by flooding their noses 
with copies of the receptor if a cold virus wanders by it will 
harmlessly attack a dummy receptor and never find a susceptible nose 
cell 
no one knows for sure whether this ploy will work although it 
looks promising in a test tube a similar scheme is being tested 
against aids 
if it works it would be very exciting commented dr richard 
crowell a virus researcher at hahnemann university school of 
medicine in philadelphia 
even if the scientific hunch is right it will be several years 
before such treatment is available there will also be drawbacks 
the therapy will only work against rhinoviruses which causes about 
half of all colds but it will be powerless against other cold 
germs and it probably will not stop colds once they start 
this is not a cure it is a scientific step said dr michael 
e kamarck of molecular therapeutics in west haven conn 
reports on the two teams conclusions were published in the 
journal cell one study was conducted at the center for blood 
research the danafarber cancer institute in boston and boehringer 
ingelheim pharmaceuticals in ridgefield conn and the other at 
molecular therapeutics part of miles inc a pharmaceutical firm 
springer said his group has already produced a soluble form of 
the virus receptor but they are attempting to develop a version 
that will be even more effective as a virusfooling drug 
experts predicted that such a treatment would probably be used as 
a nose spray or drops since it would be impractical and probably 
expensive to use the drops daily people might take the medicine 
when they are especially worried about getting colds 
for instance parents might take the treatment to protect 
themselves when their child brings home a cold or an athlete might 
use it to keep from catching a cold before an important game 
scientists said the discovery resulted from combining two lines 
of separate research 
springer has worked for several years on a structure on the 
surface of cells called intercellular adhesion molecule1 or 
icam1 this protein is the receptor that white blood cells use to 
hook themselves onto the bodys tissues one step in coordinating 
the response to infection and triggering inflammation 
meanwhile dr richard colonno of the drug firm merk sharp amp 
dohme discovered three years ago that 90 percent of all rhinoviruses 
attach themselves to just one receptor when they attack the body 
in the latest work the scientists found that icam1 is the 
portal for both blood cells and cold viruses 
the big thing has been the identification of the two proteins 
that we worked on separately being one and the same colonno said

a wild african bird that leads the way to 
hidden beehives cuts by nearly twothirds the time tribesmen must 
spend beating around the bush for honey according to research 
proving a unique form of cooperation between species 
in a study published today in the journal science scientists 
from kenya and west germany say they repeatedly observed a bird 
called the greater honeyguide direct people from the boran tribe in 
africa to the hidden hives of wild honey bees 
the cooperation between human and honeyguide is the only known 
instance in which nondomesticated animals willfully and freely work 
with humans to find food in the wild said frank gill a bird expert 
in philadelphia who was not part of the research 
the people gather the honey and the birds feed on larvae and wax 
left behind the report says 
such a bird had been the subject of myth part of which calls for 
punishment for honey gatherers who refuse to share with the birds 
when that happens the bird leads the people to a lion or leopard 
the next time 
h a isack of the national museum of kenya and h u reyer of 
max planck institute in west germany reported in the article that 
they spent three years watching the bird guide people to 186 honey 
bee nests 
the mutual hunt begins they report when members of the boran 
tribe create a whistle by blowing through clasped fists or through 
hollow shells or nuts 
attracted by the whistle the bird flies to where the people wait 
the greater honeyguide draws the attention of a human by flying 
close to him moving restlessly between perches around him and 
emitting a doublenoted persistent call which sounds like 
tirrtirrtirrtirr the study says 
moments later the bird will fly away for a minute or more an 
event called the first disappearance 
when the bird returns it perches near the humans and gives a 
call when approached to within 15 feet the bird flies a short 
distance away displaying white tail feathers and continues to call 
to the people 
as the borans follow they whistle bang on wood and talk 
loudly to the bird to keep it interested in the guiding the 
report said this pattern of leading and following is repeated 
until the bee colony is reached 
isack and reyer said they proved that the birds actions were no 
accident by repeatedly allowing birds to lead them back to an 
untouched beehive 
from different compass points the bird led us via different 
but again fairly direct routes the authors reported 
the study said borans claim that the birds actions are based on 
the distance to the hive those actions included the length of the 
first disappearance the distance between perches as the bird 
guides and the height of the tree limbs the bird picks as perches 
during the guiding 
we found all three boran statements to be true the authors 
said 
upon arrival at the bees hive isack and reyer said the 
honeyguide bird perches close to the nest and sings a new song one 
that differs from the guiding call the bird may also fly around the 
hive to indicate its location 
the authors said they staked out some previouslydiscovered bee 
hives and learned that the honeyguide bird would regularly visit 
untouched bee nests sometimes even flying to the hives entrance 
and peering into it 
the information gathered during such visits enables the bird to 
engage in its goaloriented guiding behavior the authors said 
borans who rely on honey as an important part of their diet 
also hunt for honey when no greater honeyguides are around 
the authors said that in an unfamiliar area the borans need about 
89 hours to find a honey hive but only 32 hours when guided by 
the bird

between 100 percent and 200 percent of the poverty line had no 
health insurance in 1986 
the report warned many children not covered by private

adequate coverage under the federalstate medicaid program and other 
health assistance programs 
when the savings and loan industry has a crisis political 
leaders find at least 60 billion to bail them out said 
childrens defense fund president marian wright edelman when our 
children are dying and being disabled from preventable causes our

revised government figures show americans 
borrowed 44 billion more than they repaid in january edging the 
annual rate of consumer debt to 79 percent 
the federal reserve board said thursday the january increase 
followed a revised increase of 43 billion in december and a gain 
of 47 billion in november 
januarys increase in the seasonally adjusted rate of credit 
growth was up slightly from a 78 percent in december but well below 
the 85 percent rate in november 
the fed said a slower growth in auto loans and the category of 
debt that includes credit cards helped keep the increase from being 
greater while loans for mobile homes increased after falling 
sharply in december

the federal government is infusing efforts to 
rid americas streets of drug addicts and reduce the spread of aids 
through expanded drug treatment services with 75 million in grants 
frederick k goodwin head of the alcohol drug abuse and mental 
health administration said the money would be targeted for public 
and private nonprofit organizations that are providing outpatient 
or residential drug treatment services 
the agency was most concerned with helping reduce and eliminate 
the waiting lists of programs where applicants have been waiting 
more than a month to be admitted goodwin said in some cities the 
current wait to enter programs can be six months and longer 
given the fact that approximately onethird of all new aids 
cases are contracted through use of contaminated intravenous 
needles it is especially critical that the nations ability to 
provide treatment to drug abusers be expanded goodwin said 
thursday as he announced the program 
in addition to the new grant program fredericks agency part of 
the department of health and human services is providing 518 
million this fiscal year in block grants to states for substance 
abuse treatment and prevention programs a spokeswoman said

a polish historian studying a world war ii 
massacre of more than 4000 polish army officers said he is 
convinced the soviets are to blame for the executions 
historian and parliament deputy jarema maciszewski made the 
remarks in an interview thursday in the official communist party 
newspaper trybuna ludu he serves as chairman of the polish side of 
a joint polishsoviet commission studying what are called historical 
blank spots 
the historian was quoted as saying he believes a tentative 
conclusion blaming the soviet union for the killings at katyn forest 
will stand 
the expertise unequivocally indicates that all goes to show the 
nkvd bodies soviet secret police committed the crimes he was 
quoted as saying 
the soviet side on the commission however drew attention to 
the fact that the data presented by us does not contain because 
it cannot contain direct evidence of guilt he said in the 
interview 
maciszewskis interview followed similar remarks tuesday by 
government spokesman jerzy urban at his weekly news conference he 
announced two weeks ago that a warsaw monument to the katyn victims 
calling them victims of hitlers fascism will be changed 
the polish officers were shot through the back of the head and 
buried in mass graves uncovered by the germans at katyn near the 
soviet city of smolensk in 1943 the victims later were identified 
as having been imprisoned in the soviet union shortly after the 
september 1939 outbreak of world war ii 
the nazis invaded poland from the west and the soviets followed 
with an attack from the east when the war began germany and the 
soviet union then signed a nonaggression pact which hitler broke in 
1941 sending invasion forces into the soviet union 
since assuming power at the end of world war ii communist 
authorities in poland had supported the soviet version of the 
massacre asserting that the crime was committed by the nazis in 
1941 after their invasion of the soviet union 
most poles and historians in the west had long ago concluded that 
the killings were carried out on the orders of stalin in 1940 when 
nazi germany and the soviet union were still allied 
the katyn episode has come to constitute one of the most 
emotional issues in polishsoviet relations for many poles it is a 
symbol of a long series of soviet crimes against their country 
in 1987 polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev agreed to appoint the joint commission to study 
katyn and other painful blank spots in history 
last month after a parliament deputy complained that the soviet 
side was dragging its feet maciszewski unveiled a wartime polish 
red cross document found in british archives he said it gave 
incontrovertible evidence that the killings took place in 1940 
before the nazis occupied the katyn area

the desire to leave china was the major cause of 
the most serious corruption cases in shanghai an official daily 
said today 
the china youth news said in six of 15 cases now before shanghai 
courts young people either embezzled money or took bribes in order 
to finance a life abroad 
one 26yearold accountant in a shanghai embezzeled nearly 
19000 so he could study in australia a businessman in a textile 
company obtained 13500 by embezzlement and bribery after he got a 
passport and visa 
an 23yearold accountant in a bank embezzled 5670 by making 
false receipts to pay for her way out of china 
the report said next most common were cases of people taking 
bribes in connection with construction contracts 
one deputy general manager of a construction company received 
more than 27000 in bribes for subcontracting work for a chinese 
academy of sciences building 
another man named a construction hero for his good deeds for 
shanghai was charged with taking 35100 in bribes 
china is now waging a nationwide campaign against corruption 
which has become increasingly serious in recent years because of

here is a rundown on how eastern airlines chapter 11 bankruptcy 
filing will affect the carriers operations 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
under federal bankruptcy law eastern can continue flying and 
reorganize its finances while protected from creditors any 
reorganization plan is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
and creditors 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
eastern may have a difficult time imposing lower wages on 
striking employees since federal law requires bankrupt companies to 
negotiate with unions and prove economic necessity before abrogating 
their contracts 
eastern president phil bakes said the carrier is prepared to hire 
nonunion pilots if pilots honoring the machinists strike do not 
return to work 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the bankruptcy court must approve ticket refunds said eastern 
spokeswoman karen ceremsak adding that she did not know how the 
process would work in the eyes of the court ticketholders are 
considered unsecured creditors trailing secured creditors in 
priority 
but passengers who bought tickets with a major credit card 
probably wont have to stand in line at the courthouse since federal 
law protects consumers who make credit card purchases but fail to 
receive goods or services at visa usa inc for example 
requests for credit must be submitted no more than 120 days after 
the flight date said spokesman david brancoli 
eastern meanwhile will try to get as many planes back in the 
air as possible in order to make old tickets good bakes said 
the company also plans to renegotiate agreements with other 
carriers to honor eastern tickets passengers have had mixed success 
trying to swap eastern tickets for seats on other carriers 
continental airlines is accepting eastern tickets but other 
airlines have different policies 
chances remained good that if the passengers destination were a 
popular one another carrier would honor the ticket although 
possibly at a higher price

britains stiff upper lip broke into a big grin 
today as millions of people put on red plastic noses wallowed in 
baked beans donned gnome suits and pretty much turned the day into 
a big laughing matter 
despite the outbreak of mass silliness organizers of some worthy 
causes will be laughing all the way to the bank if todays red 
nose day 2 is as successful as last years inaugural charity 
drive which raised 27 million 
the idea behind the fundraising effort which was organized by a 
group of british comedians and run by a coalition of groups called 
comic relief is to get britons to loosen their pursestrings while 
they laugh 
twothirds of this years cash will go to third world projects 
and to princess annes save the children fund and the rest to 
programs in britain to help young people and the elderly 
britain has been gearing up for today all week cars trucks and 
taxis have been sporting big red plastic noses on their hoods and 
radiators 
on thursday health secretary kenneth clarke and two government 
colleagues wore red plastic noses and posed for press photographers 
and soldiers paraded with guns and red noses at the yeomanry 
barracks in york in northern england 
most britons however saved their red noses for today the goofy 
89 cent props are purchased from the sponsoring charities a 
national store chain and in many pubs a chain of gas stations is 
selling the car schnozzes for 172 
all proceeds go to comic relief 
as of thursday night more than 45 million red noses for people 
and 2 million for autos had been sold with a big surge in sales 
expected today 
rowan atkinson billy connolly and other top british comedians 
predicted that 7 million britons would don red noses today 
tied in with red nose day 2 are 50000 fundraising stunts 
registered with comic relief 
the stunts range from ian hunts 10hour wallow in a bathtub full 
of cold baked beans at the sutton arms pub in london for which his 
supporters have pledged 1720 dollars to customers at a pub near 
swansea who will hold a candlelit supper atop eight tons of cow dung 
several of the staff at the historic tower of london one of the 
capitals top tourist attractions planned to spend their working 
day clanking round in suits of armor 
officers at leytonstone police station in east london will direct 
evening traffic dressed as garden gnomes 
as last year the british broadcasting corp plans a sevenhour 
comedy extravaganza on television to mark red nose day 2 starring 
comic relief stalwart lenny henry atkinson rhys jones phil 
collins and more than 100 other show business personalities 
the french nobleman the duc de sully said 359 years ago that the 
english take their pleasures sadly even today not everyone is 
enamored with red noses 
there is a lot to be said for having no sense of humor life 
is a vale of tears columnist geoffrey wheatcroft wrote today in 
the london newspaper the daily telegraph on friday 
what is more objectionable about todays stunt than its 
childishness is its forced merriment our own postchristian 
christmas is bad enough with its relentless mandatory mirth it is 
not hard to understand why the week around dec 25 has the highest 
suicide rate of the year

who have been on mount mckinley for two weeks 
the men were described as experienced climbers with excellent 
gear and a radio although contact has not been made 
the ingredients for survival are there if they can put it 
together ranger bob seibert said thursday its been a long

encountered turbulence 
crews planned to try again today 
the climbers were seen by an austrian team on feb 22 the 
austrians were descending and the apanese who set out feb 16 were 
ascending the 20320foot peak 
it took the austrians a few days to get down nobody has heard 
from the japanese since said john quinley a park service

a young soldier killed by an ira land mine 
left behind a sealed envelope with a simple poem that urged his 
family not to cry at his grave 
stephen cummins 24 was one of two british soldiers killed when 
their convoy struck a mine near the northern ireland city of 
londonderry on wednesday 
his parents sheila and geoff cummins had been keeping an 
envelope that their son told them not to open unless something 
happened to him on thursday they opened the envelope and found 
solace from the person they mourned 
stephen has never done anything like this before we assume he 
copied the poem from somewhere but it has made us realize what a 
wonderful son we had said geoff cummins 
but debbie turley 26 who was engaged to marry cummins in 
august said he was always writing poems 
geoff cummins described his son as a committed and responsible 
professional soldier but he would not want to be called a hero 
there is nothing heroic about dying like that the father said 
the poem reads 
to all my loved ones 
do not stand at my grave and weep i am not there i do not 
sleep 
i am a thousand winds that blow 
i am the diamond glints on snow 
i am the sunlight on ripened grain 
i am the gentle autumn rain 
when you awaken in the mornings hush 
i am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight 
i am the soft stars that shine at night 
do not stand at my grave and cry 
i am not there i did not die 
he signed the poem anonymous and added thank you 
forever always and a day stephen jeffrey cummins

doctors today delivered a haymaker to the us 
militarys boxing program saying the sport used to maintain fitness 
for decades has killed at least one soldier and hospitalized 401 
others over a sixyear period 
army soldiers spent 2056 days in the hospital and logged 3581 
sick days because of boxing injuries from 1980 through 1985 
military doctors said in todays issue of the journal of the 
american medical association 
head injuries accounted for 68 percent of all boxingrelated 
hospitalizations and 81 percent of boxingrelated injuries to us 
military academy cadets said the doctors led by maj robert w 
enzenauer an eye doctor at fitzsimons army medical center in 
aurora colo 
but a former military boxing coach disagreed with the study 
saying the sport provides excellent mental and physical training and 
probably produces fewer serious injuries than college football or 
wrestling 
in football you have the kids that are paralyzed the kids 
that die said emerson smith head boxing coach at the us naval 
academy for 27 years and chairman of the usa amateur boxing 
federations safety committee 
i dont believe theres any high school or college where 
you have contact sports where youll eliminate all serious injury 
he said 
instructional boxing is mandatory at us service academies 
military graduates known for their boxing prowess as undergraduates 
include former navy secretary james webb and retired marine col 
oliver north 
enzenauer who boxed when he attended the us military academy 
said sports like the martial arts or fencing would provide the same 
benefits without the risks of injury to the central nervous system 
its inconsistent to train a soldier to spend money on him to 
teach him how to fly a helicopter to repair a jeep to drive a 
tank and then to have him participate in a sport that could 
conceivably make him unfit for duty enzenauer said in a telephone 
interview thursday 
there is other military training that can teach a soldier 
how to deal with fear how to improve his selfconfidence his 
selfesteem without offering such a risk he said 
unlike football or wrestling the objective in boxing is to 
achieve a knockout which by definition is an injury to the brain 
enzenauer said 
the study found that 401 soldiers had been hospitalized in the 
sixyear period and one died after complications from bleeding 
inside the skull caused by boxing another was blinded in one eye 
evidence that boxing produces irreversible brain damage is now 
as indisputable as the link between cigarette smoking and lung 
cancer the doctors wrote 
concussions bruising of brain tissue bleeding inside the skull 
broken facial bones and eye injuries were among the types of head 
trauma recorded 
the study did not examine the price tag for hospital care and 
lost productivity due to boxing but said the cost is certainly 
considerable 
military boxing has served as a springboard to some spectacular 
careers leon spinks a marine when he won a gold medal at the 1976 
montreal olympics eventually defeated muhammad ali for the world 
heavyweight title 
three gold medalists at the 1988 olympics were us army boxers

carlos salinas de gortari today marks the 
100th day of his presidency as a more powerful leader whose 
political skills have earned respect even from critics 
the bald mustachioed 40yearold economist won the slimmest 
victory in the history of his party which has controlled mexican 
politics for most of this century he then struggled through rocky 
early days when his opponents claimed the election was rigged 
since then however he has widened his support with measures 
aimed at restoring economic confidence and political stability in 
advance of vital negotiations over mexicos foreign debt 
he has gained credibility said pablo emilio madero former 
presidential candidate and a leader of the conservative national 
action party the party is the countrys second largest behind the 
governments institutional revolutionary party 
salinas took office after a fraudmarred election in which he 
polled barely more than 50 percent the governing party ended up 
with a 260240 margin in congress its lowest ever and a vocal 
leftist coalition that predicted salinas wouldnt last 
but infighting has weakened the leftist coalition put together by 
salinas main opponent in the election said opposition leader 
cuauhtemoc cardenas 
and on the right salinas undercut conservatives by moving to 
weed out corruption install a freer economy and improve government 
relations with the roman catholic church 
salinas has more political strength now than he did at the 
start of his administration said jorge arrambide director of an 
association of business groups in the northern state of nuevo leon 
he has struck some spectacular blows with the purpose of getting 
massive popular support he did not have in the elections 
in january salinas popularity soared when he cracked down on 
corrupt oil union leaders once considered invulnerable he showed an 
even hand by also jailing top businessmen accused of shady dealings 
during the 1987 stock market crash 
salinas appeased the left by firing a hardline police official 
and releasing political prisoners acknowledging their existence for 
the first time 
he also pledged to wean his party from its chronic use of state 
resources in election campaigns and of voterigging pledges still 
questioned by the opposition 
he is making decisions said jesus cantu director of the 
independent newspaper el porvenir the question is whether the 
decisions will result in something good or turn out to be just a 
little makeup 
the governments most immediate problem is the foreign debt 
estimated by the world bank at 1074 billion salinas wants to cut 
in half annual payments which totaled 14 billion last year to 
free funds for economic growth 
the economy has been stagnant for six years and salinas is under 
pressure from a growing population whose standard of living has 
dropped steadily an estimated 1 million new jobs are needed a year 
political parties and business groups have rallied to salinas 
efforts to stem the cash flow resulting from the debt nationwide 
riots last week in venezuela also may help salinas cause by 
alarming creditors 
some say the toughness salinas displayed against the oil union 
could just as easily be turned on creditors 
creditors need to believe that mexico will resort to a 
suspension of payments said jonathan heath chief economic 
analyst for the macro asesoria consulting firm salinas has proven 
he could provide a credible threat

the soviets today protested the us expulsion of 
one of their diplomats and claimed he was arrested while taking out 
the garbage at his home not while receiving secret papers 
obviously the longawaited thaw in relations between the 
superpowers doesnt suit everyone in the usa the official tass 
news agency said in its lengthy dispatch today 
it called the expulsion of lt col yuri n pakhtusov a 
provocative action 
however there was no immediate word on any soviet retaliation 
pakhtusov a military attache at the soviet embassy in 
washington was ordered to leave the united states on thursday after 
a sixmonth fbi investigation culminated in his arrest wednesday 
night 
a us source identified the 35yearold soviet as a member of 
gru the soviet militarys intelligence arm 
us officials said he was ordered home after the fbi caught him 
receiving sensitive information on how the us government protects 
computer secrets 
tass mocked those charges and expressed outrage at the fbis 
treatment of pakhtusov following the arrest outside his virginia 
home 
fbi agents seized pakhtusov late wednesday evening when 
before going to sleep he left his apartment to put garbage in the 
garbage chute he went out in house slippers sweatpants and a 
tshirt tass said youll agree that people dont go out into 
the cold to receive secret documents dressed like that 
tass said the fbi agents handcuffed pakhtusov and put him in a 
car the agency said they offered him money to defect but the 
diplomat refused 
it also said he was not allowed to return to his apartment to 
tell his wife what happened or to dress in warmer clothes and he 
was not allowed to call the soviet embassy right away 
even a murderer in the usa is given the right when arrested 
to make one telephone call tass said 
the news agency said it is sad that the arrest came at a time 
when more americans are developing sympathetic and unconcealed 
interest in the soviet union 
it said however that some americans are able to benefit by 
portraying soviet diplomats as spies and supplying nonexistent proof

nancy reagans triumph over breast cancer and a 
publicity campaign about the disease may have sent thousands of 
women to their doctors for potentially lifesaving mammograms 
federal health officials reported 
a survey of health behavior in 33 states by the centers for 
disease control found that 38 percent of women age 50 and older 
questioned in november and december 1987 said they had received a 
mammogram for breast cancer within a year 
those findings shortly after the then first ladys october 
diagnosis marked an increase of nearly 50 percent over the 26 
percent the survey found in the first two months of that year 
medical centers in the united states reported after mrs reagans 
diagnosis that the demand for mammograms had gone up she was later 
honored with an american cancer society award for her efforts to 
encourage women to check for breast cancer 
a springtime media campaign by the cancer society promoted 
screening for breast cancer and data from the survey suggest that 
the media events and educational activities were accompanied by 
increases in screening mammograms the cdc said 
the increases in mammograms may be related to enhanced public 
awareness during the acs spring campaign and after mrs reagans 
diagnosis the cdc said although the agency added that the data 
cannot directly prove such a connection statistically 
the cancer society recommends that all women 50 or older have a 
mammogram each year 
overall in the cdcs 1987 behavioral risk factor survey 29 
percent of the women 50 and up said they had been screened for 
breast cancer in the preceding 12 months 
the survey excluded women who had mammograms because of a 
specific health problem or history or those who hadnt seen a 
doctor for a routine examination at all 
other studies also have found that most american women 50 or 
older have never had a mammogram despite recommendations that they 
should cancer specialists at the cdc and elsewhere say increased 
use of mammograms would increase early detection of breast cancer 
raising survival rates for patients 
aside from annual mammograms for women 50 and up the american 
cancer society recommends that women between 35 and 40 have one 
initial mammogram and that women 4049 have one each year or two 
breast cancer second to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths 
among women kills about 40000 us women each year

the active ingredient in some commercial 
sunscreens can break down into a substance that causes cancer 
according to a study that has prompted further testing to determine 
whether there is any risk to users 
in tests by the us food and drug administration 14 of 17 
sunscreens containing the sunblocking agent padimate o itself used 
to prevent skin cancer from overexposure were found to contain a 
newly discovered nitrosamine the st louis postdispatch reported 
thursday 
nitrosamines are a class of compounds notorious for their 
cancercausing ability roughly 90 percent of the 300 nitrosamines 
tested so far have been shown to cause cancer in animals 
we have a saying in this field guilty until proven 
innocent said stephen s hecht director of research at the 
american health foundation in valhalla ny 
you just never know he told the postdispatch basically 
any nitrosamine is cause for concern 
but representatives of major health organizations and the 
sunscreen industry said people who want to protect themselves from 
suncaused skin cancers should continue to use commercially 
available sunscreens until more testing is done 
scientists said testing so far has not established whether the 
newly discovered nitrosamine is a strong enough carcinogen to 
present any substantial risk to people who use sunscreens 
william lijinsky an authority on nitrosamines at the federally 
owned frederick cancer research facility in frederick md said the 
nitrosamine which goes by the initials npabao probably was a 
very weak carcinogen 
compounds of this structure would have a very low activity or 
are inactive lijinsky said 
representatives of the american dermatological academy and the 
american cancer society said they were unaware of the nitrosamine in 
sunscreens they said that until officials reviewed any information 
that sunscreens were harmful the groups would continue to recommend 
the use of sunscreens to protect against damage from the sun 
if you want to scare people into not using sunscreens the 
public health implications are super said gerald mcewen vice 
president of science for the washingtonbased cosmetics toiletries 
and fragrance association 
padimate o the sunblocking agent is found in some but not 
all sunscreen products he noted the association collaborated with 
the food and drug administration to discover npabao in sunscreens 
then communicated information about it industrywide 
mcewen stressed that nitrosamines were a large class of chemicals 
found widely in the natural environment and that most human exposure 
occurred naturally such as by eating vegetables and other foods 
but three other experts said that because npabao is probably 
carcinogenic the three are hecht of the private nonprofit 
american health foundation richard n loeppky a professor of 
chemistry at the university of missouri at columbia and john s 
wishnok a biochemist at the massachusetts institute of technology 
in cambridge mass 
nitrosamines first gained widespread notice in the 1970s they 
were found in tobacco smoke and snuff vegetables and processed 
meats alcoholic beverages cosmetics pesticides babybottle 
nipples synthetic grinding fluids tire manufacturing plants and 
even new cars 
the fda has yet to determine the origin of the npabao or whether 
it is easily absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream as 
some other nitrosamines are 
officials of the fda have declined to identify the sunscreen 
brands in the tests results of the tests were first reported in may 
at the eppley institute for research in cancer in omaha neb

the third world challenging industrial nations on 
yet another environmental issue is slowing efforts to eliminate 
chemicals that are eating away the earths crucial ozone layer 
prodded by increasing scientific evidence that 
chlorofluorocarbons are destroying the ozone shield protecting earth 
from cancercausing ultraviolet rays the west has promised to ban 
or significantly reduce their use by the end of the century 
third world countries do not dispute the facts and figures but 
they are just embarking on largescale expansion of refrigeration 
air conditioning plastics and electronics industries most of which 
depend on chlorofluorocarbons 
australias science minister speaking an an international 
conference in london this week wondered aloud if it is fair to ask 
for equal measures in both kinds of countries 
this raises a major moral problem in the west said the 
minister barry jones 
the dispute recalls the 1960s debate over the insecticide ddt 
the west discovered it was harmful to both plants and animals and 
imposed bans or restrictions in 197071 against the wishes of 
developing nations which feared a resurgence of diseasecarrying 
insects 
another environmental issue dividing the west from the third 
world is the dumping of toxic waste 
president daniel arap moi of kenya told the london conference 
that recent dumpings in africa of toxic chemicals from industrial 
countries were unfriendly actions equivalent to declaring war 
on the earths ecosystem 
on the ozone issue developing countries demand western help in 
financing any switch from chlorofluorocarbons to safe substitutes 
the chemicals developed in the united states more than 50 years 
ago as the working fluid for refrigerators also are used in 
aerosols fastfood packaging and computer solvents about 12 
million tons are produced annually more than 76 percent in the 
united states and european economic community 
when chlorofluorocarbons reach the stratosphere 1525 miles up 
as much as 100 years after emission they break apart and their 
chlorine atoms deplete the ozone chlorofluorocarbons also trap 
heat increasing earths temperature in a process known as the 
greenhouse effect 
washington now says it will ban all chlorofluorocarbons by 1999 
if safe substitutes become available the 12nation eec has agreed 
to a similar timetable but its environment commissioner carlo ripa 
di meana wants an earlier target 
thirtyone countries have ratified the 1987 montreal protocol 
requiring the amount of chlorofluorocarbons to be cut in half by 
1999 
another 20 countries have agreed to sign up but china india and 
brazil with rapidly growing populations are not among them they 
have urged western nations to create a fund to help them acquire 
technology to replace chlorofluorocarbons but insist the money not 
be deducted from existing aid 
any reduction in these resources for whatever reasons would 
mean that the poor of these countries will have to wait longer for 
the promised freedom from hunger and poverty said zr ansari 
indias environment minister the poor are no more prepared to 
wait and there will be social upheaval if they are asked to wait 
any longer 
chinas environment commissioner liu ming pu told the london 
conference his nation of 11 billion people uses less than 2 percent 
of the worlds chlorofluorocarbons 
western nations say the potential for chlorofluorocarbons use in 
the developing world is enormous and could wipe out any cuts made by 
industrial countries

parochial schools may have a friend in new us 
education secretary lauro cavazos but he has made it clear that 
probably wont sway him into recommending federal tuition tax breaks 
cavazos on thursday visited st augustine school of the arts the 
roman catholic grade school proclaimed as an educational oasis in 
economically depressed south bronx on cbss 60 minutes last 
december 
the school has been praised for its highly unusual curriculum 
blending fine arts especially music with academic basics but fame 
has not brought fortune and finances are so tight that at times 
teachers have been asked not to cash their paychecks said father 
robert jeffers pastor of st augustines 
st augustines the only parochial school in the new york 
archdiocese specializing in fine arts admits all comers regardless 
of potential talent unlike most such schools 
the schools 320 children in kindergarten through eighth grade 
are required to study piano through at least fourth grade and at 
least another musical instrument thereafter 
cavazos lavished praise on st augustine and its mostly black 
children but he stopped short of holding out any promise of 
financial relief 
i think that any school that is well run that is orderly that 
is free of drugs all schools should be like that cavazos said 
but he said im not really pushing for tuition tax credits or 
vouchers 
i still am very optimistic said principal tom pilecki im 
hopeful his visit here will help him see the strength of catholic 
schools we dont have any money at all we dont have a cent 
tuition at st augustines is only 1100 a year teacher 
salaries average just 17000 half what new york city public school 
teachers earn pilecki said the 11 professional musicians and 
artists who teach the schools special arts program average 13000 
the arts program is supported by about 350000 a year in 
foundation and corporate grants 
william j bennett cavazos predecessor championed the cause of 
parochial education he pressed often though unsuccessfully for 
federal tax breaks for parents paying private school tuition and he 
argued repeatedly that urban public schools could learn a lesson or 
two from catholic educators in preserving orderly schools 
from the 1970s through 1984 enrollment at st augustine dropped 
from about 500 to fewer than 200 the new york archdiocese was 
considering shutting down st augustines 
but the school saved itself by devising an unusual curriculum 
built around fine arts in the fall of 1984 enrollment has since 
rebounded to 320 
the arts program has paid off father jeffers said because it 
gives children a constant sense of accomplishment 
i would hope cavazos would see some model here that could be 
duplicated in other urban situations said jeffers 
cavazos also visited the brooklyn campus of long island 
university to help that school launch a new national institute for 
hispanic leadership the institutes goal is to help hispanic 
youngsters gain leadership positions in the education field and 
eventually in other fields as well 
universities around this country must i repeat must recruit 
more minority students he said and provide more scholarships for 
such students

parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani of 
iran said today that the only way to quiet moslem furor over the 
novel the satanic verses is to burn all copies of the book and 
ban it forever 
in the malaysian city of kota bahru an estimated 10000 moslems 
burned us flags and pictures of the books author salman rushdie 
during a protest against the novel 
in montreal about 100 artists and writers gathered to criticize 
the canadian government for not reacting strongly enough to the 
threats against rushdie 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
said rafsanjani made his latest remarks about the book at the weekly 
mass prayer sermon at tehran university 
if it stays it will remain forever a source of rebellion and 
it would be impossible that peace would come between real moslems 
and the supporters of this book the news agency quoted him as 
saying 
the only solution that exists is to issue a strict order to 
seize all copies in the world and burn it rafsanjani said 
he said that stopping production of the book would be a retreat 
from the wests claim that it was defending freedom of expression 
but rafsanjani said if those who ignited this flame do not 
find a suitable solution no one knows where it will lead to 
the parliament speaker said the issue had become the strangest 
and rarest crisis in history 
moslems say rushdies book blasphemes islam by insinuating 
mohammed wrote the koran himself rather than receiving it from god 
and by portraying mohammeds wives as prostitutes 
iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini issued a death 
sentence against the author last month and has used the issue to 
staunch the attempt lead by rafsanjani to open iran to more contacts 
with the west 
fourteen western nations summoned home their top diplomats from 
tehran to protest khomeinis execution order 
the author a british citizen who was born into a moslem family 
has been in hiding since feb 14 when iranian clerics offered a 
52 million reward for rushdies death

in this florida resort community into a 10story pink flamingo has 
laid an egg

project pink and a motion to send the plan back to a committee 
that endorsed it last week failed no further action was taken 
some local merchants had hatched the proposal to create a local 
landmark that could bring attention and tourists to the area but 
authority members said it would only make pensacola beach a 
laughingstock 
were afraid publicity we could get would be publicity we dont 
want said david mcdonald president of the pensacola beach 
chamber of commerce 
the authority received a petition signed by 63 residents who were 
opposed to this monstrosity 
i really thought it was an early april fools joke said 
eloise gann who presented the petition

four senior scottish police officials are visiting 
some families of the 259 victims of the lockerbie plane disaster to 
clear up what they consider a misunderstanding about victims 
belongings 
the officers from the dumfries and galloway police forces will 
visit several us cities and talk to relatives who have complained 
that the police have been slow in releasing the personal effects of 
those who died in the december terrorist bomb blast aboard the pan 
am jet 
i lost a 16yearold daughter and she had four suitcases with 
her almost everything she owned said paul hudson an albany 
ny lawyer who formed the 300member relatives support group 
victims of pan am 103 she had her christmas presents with her 
many of our memories of her were with her on that plane 
only five or six relatives of the victims have received any 
possessions hudson said 
its the last thing they have to remember their sons and 
daughters said north adams mayor jim barrett who represented 
several western massachusetts families after the crash rings 
bracelets it would mean so much to them to get them back 
the british policemen arrived in boston wednesday night and flew 
to washington thursday to meet with us state department officials 
we feel that to try to ease the frustrations of the relatives 
here we should come personally and explain to various groups of 
relatives exactly what the position is assistant chief constable 
paul newell told british television before he left for the united 
states 
a letter of concern from the families that was sent to prime 
minister margaret thatcher last month may have resulted in the 
officers visit said hudson 
its a very emotional time said joe horgan whose 
brotherinlaw was on flight 103 the additional trauma of not 
having things returned means that the healing process cannot hit 
full stride 
but horgan a member of the relatives group in charge of property 
return said the families are not angry with scottish officials 
horgan who has visited police in lockerbie said scottish law 
differs from american law and authorities there did not want to 
release what they consider evidence into a criminal investigation 
he said the families became upset after receiving a letter from a 
us state department official last month that hinted that some of 
the victims luggage and clothing might be destroyed 
horgan said all sorts of rumors and innuendo started after 
that but it was found later to be false scottish authorities 
have been very sensitive to our needs he said 
the scottish police met with state department officials thursday 
to work out details of the visits said department spokeswoman 
frances jones 
we will be accompanying them and making ourselves available to 
family members for any questions they might have of us she said 
the scottish policemen will meet with families in new york on 
saturday and in boston on sunday travel to detroit on monday and 
see families in canton ohio tuesday 
police recovered more than 11000 items of property scattered 
over an area of 845 square miles

a festival that was supposed to show this citys 
latin community at its partygiving best has erupted into a bitter 
dispute over a ban on three singers who once performed in cuba 
on thursday the miami herald announced it was pulling out of the 
calle ocho festival because the events sponsors the little havana 
kiwanis club canceled the scheduled appearance of the 
espanolisimos a spanish singing duo 
reflecting the citys fervently anticommunist cuban community 
the kiwanis club has banned whoever has performed in cuba since 
fidel castros government took over the island in 1959 
the singing duo initially hired by the kiwanis club had been 
scheduled to sing on a heraldsponsored stage during the weekend 
festival which is expected to attract a million visitors 
but earlier this week the club discovered that one of the 
espanolisimos singers de raymond performed in a cuban festival in 
1970 
everybodys in a very tough situation and we are in a position 
that we cannot change our policy said architect willy bermello a 
former kiwanis president we are sorry that a political issue has 
made a musical event into a political event 
in the past two weeks the club has also barred puerto rican salsa 
singer andy montanez because he sang in cuba in 1980 and 
mexicobased brazilian singer denise de kalafe who accepted an 
invitation from her own government to perform in cuba in 1981 
all three singers have declared their opposition to cubas 
communist government but the kiwanis club has refused to budge 
roberto suarez associate publisher of the herald said the club 
rule made it impossible for the newspaper to continue its 
sponsorship of the festival 
the newspaper should not be part of something where there is 
censorship which goes against the first amendment suarez said 
even within miamis cuban community there are sharp differences 
over the policy 
tomas garcia fuste executive news director of wqbaam and one of 
miamis bestknown commentators as well as a vociferous 
anticommunist has criticized the kiwanis policy 
just because they went to cuba is not a reason to not let them 
perform fuste said if they make any procastro statements 
then they should be banned but not just because they went there 
for de raymond the ban is particularly painful he was barred 
from spains socialist partyrun television for six years he said 
because of his strong anticommunist views he even received death 
threats from leftists he said 
not only should i not be banned but and ive never said this 
i deserve a tribute not a ban de raymond said 
calle ocho or eighth street in spanish referring to the main 
street of miamis little havana has grown more popular each year 
since it began in 1978 it now attracts sponsors and acts from all 
over the latin world as well as tens of thousands of tourists

chinese troops rounded up suspected separatists 
and kept a tight lid on tibet today as the embattled region marked 
the 30th anniversary of a failed attempt to cast off chinese rule 
police and the military already had detained many tibetans in 
housetohouse searches and planned to move swiftly to crush any 
demonstrations to commemorate the anniversary according to tibetan 
and foreign sources 
a tibetan woman contacted by telephone today said the capital 
was calm and that the army occupied all roads 
there are new arrests there are many but we dont know how 
many she said 
a man came on the line 
dont talk a long time he said there are a lot of police 
we cant talk long 
china imposed martial law in lhasa on tuesday to quell three days 
of antichinese riots that took 16 lives according to official 
count western travelers say most tibetans put the death toll at 
between 20 and 30 some estimates ranged much higher 
all foreign tourists were ordered to leave lhasa by thursday it 
was believed the last group departed this morning 
another tibetan woman reached by telephone thursday evening from 
beijing said chinese troops began rounding up large numbers of 
tibetans after most foreigners left 
chinas national radio today said large groups of protesters 
turned themselves in and that police said those who gave themselves 
up would be treated with leniency 
it said some shops had reopened in the mountaintop city of 
70000 and the barkhor the central marketplace was returning to 
life 
during the riots that began sunday mobs of tibetans demanding 
independence from china and chanting loyalty to their exiled 
spiritual leader the dalai lama threw stones ransacked 
chineseowned shops set fire to chinese property and attacked 
government office buildings 
the dalai lama spoke today to about 5000 ethnic tibetans in 
dharmsala india who gathered to mark the 1959 uprising he urged 
tibetans to demonstrate against chinese rule but avoid violence 
the nonviolent struggle is the best because of the recent 
events he said have faith in the struggle and continue 
demonstrations so that the world will know tibet is suffering under 
chinese rule 
he called on chinese leader deng xiaoping to end violence in the 
tibetan capital according to a statement issued by his headquarters 
in new delhi 
i urge your personal intervention for bringing an immediate end 
to the repressive measures against innocent tibetans and lifting of 
the martial law in lhasa the statement said 
thousands of tibtetans also demonstrated in new delhi and the 
indian city of madras today 
chinas leading newspaper today issued a plea for calm and said 
that without stability economic reforms would fail 
the riots in lhasa show how precious stability is to the 
economic modernization and how important it is for the peace and 
happiness of the people without stability nothing will be 
accomplished said the frontpage editorial in the peoples daily 
for the chinese the march 10 anniversary marked the beginning of 
democratic reform in tibet the institution of communist 
political and economic systems in the remote himalayan region 
tibetans remember the day in 1959 when tens of thousands 
converged on the dalai lamas palace to prevent what they thought 
was a chinese military attempt to kidnap their godking 
a week later the chinese allegedly fired two mortar shells into 
the palace ground and the dalai lama and his family fled secretly 
that night eventually reaching india the dalai lama and about 
100000 followers now reside in exile in northern india 
following the dalai lamas flight the chinese army moved in to 
destroy the tibetan resistance killing hundreds perhaps thousands 
before order was restored 
china says tibet has been part of its territory for seven 
centuries many tibetans say their land was independent before the 
red army moved into it in 1950 and they seek a sovereign state 
under the dalai lama 
the 53yearold dalai lama worshiped as a reincarnation of past 
dalai lamas has offered to accept chinese control over tibets 
defense and foreign policy in exchange for greater autonomy 
china rejects the proposal but says it is willing to talk to the 
buddhist leader

a 36yearold woman who claims penthouse 
publisher bob guccione ruined her acting career by putting her in a 
pornographic film is asking a court to award her 10 million in 
damages 
the former model anneka dilorenzo says guccione reneged on a 
verbal contract to help her career 
but guccione defended himself in state supreme court thursday by 
arguing that ms dilorenzo got the exposure she needed but ruined 
her own career by rejecting three movie offers and disappearing with 
a boyfriend 
she simply turned her back on us and went off to florida in a 
drunken spree in 1978 guccione said he testified he urged ms 
dilorenzo to sign a management contract with penthouse in 1973 and 
to let him guide her career 
ms dilorenzo said in court papers that guccione was a sadistic 
evil person who ruined her career by putting her in caligula 
a film loosely based on the life of the mad roman emperor 
the twohour 23minute movie which features bloody tortures and 
hardcore sex of almost every variety includes an explicit sex 
scene involving ms dilorenzo and another woman 
the movie was shown to justice elliott wilk who is hearing the 
trial without a jury does this movie ever end he asked at one 
point 
it kind of makes you appreciate pee wee herman doesnt it 
wilk said 
when the sex scene featuring ms dilorenzo appeared on the 
screen she fled the courtroom in tears and remained in the womens 
restroom for more than 30 minutes 
ms dilorenzo said guccione fired her in 1980 when she refused to 
accompany him to japan on a promotional tour for the movie she said 
he had promised her that in return for her years of cooperation with 
the magazine she would always be part of his penthouse family 
penthouses lawyer jeffrey daichman said ms lorenzo admits she 
has no proof that guccione ever made such a promise 
in her deposition ms dilorenzo said i dont have any written 
contracts with guccione he and i had verbal agreements we were 
partners in life

a federal appeals court has cleared the way 
for native alaskans to sue the government in their bid to stop the 
offshore oil drilling they contend is destroying traditional hunting 
grounds 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals on thursday ruled that the 
aboriginal rights the natives held in the submerged land part 
of the bering sea were not destroyed by the 1971 alaska native 
claims settlement act which provided money to resolve all natives 
prestatehood claims of rights in alaska land 
the 30 ruling means several hundred natives from the villages of 
gambell and stebbins can try to prove that drilling in the federally 
approved lease sale 57 made up of 24 million acres off norton 
sound off alaskas western coast would hurt their ability to fish 
and hunt for survival needs 
however the judges left open the question of whether a 1953 
federal law that authorized offshore oil and gas leases had affected 
the natives offshore claims that issue was returned to a lower 
court 
the natives have sued the interior department contending that 
its sale of leases violated their legal rights of subsistence 
hunting and fishing on undersea federal land between alaskas 
threemile offshore boundary and the 200mile federal limit 
carol daniel of alaska legal services corp said the natives have 
hunted and fished on the ice since time immemorial building 
roads and making camps on the ice several miles offshore to catch 
fish walrus and whales 
the drilling is so dangerous to resources and my clients are so 
dependent on the resources said daniel attorney for the 
villagers they dont have access to the same grocery stores most 
people do the sea is their market 
e edward bruce attorney for five oil companies that hold leases 
in the area said no decision has been made on whether to appeal the 
ruling 
he said oil companies paid over 300 million for leases in march 
1983 and completed exploratory drilling several years ago but had 
not done any drilling for oil production 
bruce said he had not been told the results of the exploratory 
drilling but he observed that the results were not sufficiently 
promising to cause further exploratory drilling in the area 
the federal government in other cases has recognized native 
americans aboriginal rights to follow ageold practices of hunting 
and fishing for necessities on government land

the countdown began early today for a 
monday launch of space shuttle discovery on a flight its commander 
says will demonstrate were a spacefaring nation again 
the launch will be the third for the shuttle program since the 
challenger disaster more than three years ago and the first of 
seven flights scheduled this year as nasa moves toward its target of 
safe routine onceamonth missions by 1992 
the countdown started right on time said nasa spokeswoman 
lisa malone the ambitious 1989 schedule is getting a late start 
with discoverys flight delayed nearly four weeks so faulty or 
suspect engine parts could be replaced 
the countdown clock began ticking at 1201 am after test 
conductor jerry crute issued the traditional call to stations that 
summoned members of the launch team to their posts the initial task 
was to electrically activate the spaceships systems 
charles henschel chief of test operations at the kennedy space 
center told reporters today the early hours of the count had 
progressed well and that some checks were running ahead of schedule 
he reported gusty winds at launch pad 39b were delaying some 
engine closeout and other work but that this should have no impact 
on the countdown he said the weather forecast for a monday launch 
was looking good 
liftoff is set for 807 am monday 
the five astronauts for the fiveday mission were to arrive this 
afternoon from their training base in houston to make final flight 
preparations 
the commander navy capt michael l coats said in a recent 
interview that the first two postchallenger missions flown 
successfully last september and december were important to show 
that we could fly the space shuttle again after the catastrophe 
the next step he said is to prove that we can do it on a 
regular basis that were back in the business of space to show 
were a spacefaring nation again 
it was very frustrating for us in the space program the last 
three years to watch the russians set new flight time records and do 
all the things in space with their shuttle while weve been 
grounded coats said 
flying with coats will be air force col john e blaha the 
pilot marine cols james f buchli and robert c springer and dr 
james m bagian a medical doctor 
bagian and springer are to release a 100 million tracking and 
data relay satellite six hours after liftoff the satellite is to 
join two identical satellites to form a global network for 
transmitting communications among ground stations the shuttle and 
several other satellites 
once the new satellite is operational nasa will begin closing 
down six of its shuttle ground stations 
following deployment of the satellite the astronauts will settle 
into four days of science and medical experiments 
the discovery is scheduled to touch down march 18 at edwards air

sen sam nunn fresh from the bitter debate 
over the nomination of john tower to head the pentagon called today 
for a cooling of the passions that are now bubbling in 
washington 
we cannot prevail as a great power if either our allies or our 
adversaries look to washington and see endless division and rancor 
instead of a principled unified american policy said nunn 
as chairman of the senate armed services committee the georgia 
democrat led the successful fight to defeat the tower nomination 
he struck a conciliatory note in a speech opening the annual 
conference of the democratic leadership council an organization of 
centrist democrats who banded together four years ago to halt what 
they saw as a leftward drift of their national party 
the current chairman of the dlc nunn opened the meeting with a 
grim message in presidential elections the republicans are now 
the de facto majority party 
nunn cited what he called the successes of the dlc and said 
our progress has been overshadowed by a larger failure the 
collective failure of democrats to reverse our partys dismal record 
in national presidential elections 
the democrats have lost five of the last six presidential 
elections 
he went on to say that when legislative seats are realigned in 
1991 to reflect populations shifts the situation can only get 
worse for democrats 
census projections indicate a continued shift of house seats from 
northern industrial states to the sunbelt from traditionally 
democratic strongholds to areas of emerging republican strength 
nunn came to the conference following the 5347 senate vote 
rejecting president bushs nomination of tower it was the first 
time the senate had turned down a nominee for a presidents initial 
cabinet and it came after a bitter often highly partisan debate 
i hope the passions that are now bubbling in washington will 
soon cool said nunn and we can get on with thr business of 
forging a defense and foreign policy that is supported by the main 
elements of both political parties 
nunn went on to say that our nation cannot afford a separate 
dempcratic and republican foreign policy on issues as important as 
arms control relations with the soviet union and the future of 
latin america

army officials said without eleaborating that the redeployment 
was aimed at reducing casualties in the 15month palestinian 
uprising 
the total number of soldiers in the occupied gaza strip will not 
be cut but many combat soldiers will be replaced by border police 
trained in riot control an army spokesman said on condition of 
anonymity 
the military moves came as foreign minister moshe arens left for 
the united states on a 10day visit he is to meet with president 
bush and secretary of state james baker 
arens is expected to seek us support for peace efforts that 
focus on an interim solution for the occupied territories us 
officials are expected to urge israel to reduce the violence used in 
suppressing the 15month palestinian uprising 
at least 393 arabs and 17 israelis have died since the 
palestinian rebellion against israeli occupation began in december 
1987 the israelis seized the lands from arab neighbors in the 1967 
middle east war 
the lastest death came thursday when a 16yearold palestinian 
was shot to death and 10 arabs were wounded in clashes with israeli 
troops 
military officials believe removing permanently stationed units 
from the camps will lower tension 
the policy is now to reduce the hold to reduce the friction 
between israeli forces and the local population southern 
commander maj gen yitzhak mordechai was quoted as saying in 
independent haaretz newspaper 
he added however that the new mobile army units will be ready 
to move to every place and at every moment to disperse 
disturbances 
the army plan also calls for border police to relieve infantry 
units in densely populated gaza city and the refugee camps of 
nusserat and bureij 
army spokesman maj moshe fogel said the deployment of 
highlytrained border police will reduce the high number of 
casualties in demonstrations 
elsewhere in gaza today the army destroyed rooms in the homes of 
three palestinians from the khan yunis refugee camp who were 
suspected of throwing firebombs at arab collaborators an army 
spokesman said 
palestinians shuttered their stores and transportation halted 
around the strip on the second day of commercial strikes 
a palestinian human rights activist was freed from military 
detention in israel one day before amnesty international usa named 
him a prisoner of conscience 
zahi jaradat of saaer a village in the west bank was released

the rev jerry falwell today told the 2000 
employees of his religious empire that they will be required to be 
members of his church and donate 10 percent of their income to it 
were not changing anything were just reinforcing what has 
been a policy for two decades the independent baptist preacher 
told workers for liberty university oldtime gospel hour lynchburg 
christian academy liberty godparent home liberty broadcasting 
network and thomas road baptist church 
the purpose of this is not numbers and money but coordination 
of vision and teamwork falwell said 
falwell spokesman mark demoss did not immediately return a 
telephone inquiry about the timing of falwells statements but the 
action was announced shortly after falwell unveiled more detailed 
plans for a new 30 million 10000seat church near the liberty 
univerty campus the new facility wont be ready until at least 
1991 falwell said 
falwell said all fulltime workers at his ministry will be 
subjected to the tithing policy as of july 1 the policy falls 
within the limits of the law as interpreted by the us supreme 
court in a mormon case falwell said 
but he said the workers should be motivated by faith into tithing 
if this is something you in your heart cant do it would be 
better for you to not be a member of this team rather than be 
forced to serve god here falwell said 
falwell said some exceptions will be approved for example some 
teachers at his schools are pastors of their own churches they have 
been exempt from the church membership and tithing policies in the 
past 
were not talking about gestapo methods falwell said but 
we cannot move ahead without getting our camps together and this is 
the year were doing it i felt the need to once again verbalize the 
vision 
if all falwell employees tithe 10 percent it will balance the 
books of thomas road baptist church he said 
the 33yearold ministry has a 35 million payroll and a church 
budget of 35 million exactly 10 percent of the payroll falwell 
said 
before todays meeting ministry officials said tithing and 
church membership were required of employees of liberty university 
and liberty christian academy

the judge in fawaz younis hijacking trial 
today gave the jury stern instructions that seemed to undercut the 
defendants argument that he was justified in taking over an 
airliner in beirut in 1985 because he was under orders from a 
lebanese militia 
orders to hijack a plane are illegal orders us 
district judge aubrey e robinson jr told the jury of seven women 
and five men obedience to illegal orders is no defense 
the judge said younis should be acquitted only if he did not know 
that hijacking was illegal 
younis has testified that he knew that hijacking was illegal in 
peacetime and that the amal militia to which he belonged was not at 
war with royal jordanian airlines the government of jordan the two 
americans aboard the aircraft or any of the other 70 passengers and 
crew members 
younis 30 has pleaded innocent in the case which is a test of 
a 1984 statute asserting longarm us jurisdiction in cases 
involving american hostages taken overseas 
federal prosecutors sought to convince jurors that younis knew he 
was committing an illegal act against innocent civilians by seizing 
control of royal jordanian flight 402 on june 11 1985 
in his closing argument thursday defense attorney francis d 
carter urged the jurors to put aside their preconceptions of 
hijacking as they decide the fate of younis a member of lebanons 
amal militia a shiite moslem group 
its not the bogyman that you thought the word hijacking 
carter said 
if convicted of the six counts against him younis could face 
life in prison plus more than 410000 in fines which he does not 
have money to pay he has been held in isolation since his arrest 
september 1987 and is represented by courtappointed counsel 
carter in his final presentation recounted the civil war that 
has engulfed lebanon since 1975 and tried to convince the jury that 
younis felt compelled to obey the orders from amal virtually the 
only authority in west beirut where the lived 
the difficulty that you have is to take american law and 
put that on top of the facts in lebanon carter said you have 
to understand what this man had been through carter said 
federal prosecutors j ramsey johnson and karen morrissette in 
their closing arguments reminded they jury of testimony by younis 
that amal was not at war with the american jordanian and lebanese 
passengers aboard the aircraft nor against the government of 
jordan which owns the airline 
hijacking said morrissette is a violation of international 
law 
the defendant cannot hijack an airplane then come into a 
courtroom in this country and say well someone told me to do it 
and its all right she said 
the prosecution also reminded the jury of testimony from five 
eyewitnesses who identified younis in the court room and recounted 
how the hijackers stormed aboard the plane armed with ak47 assault 
rifles and hand grenades and tortured nine jordanian sky marshals

fbi director william sessions today said 
semiautomatic assault rifles have a very destructive impact on 
society but declined to say whether they should be banned 
during a meeting with reporters sessions said the question of 
whether to ban assault weapons like the ak47 sovietstyle rifle 
that was used by a gunman to kill five california school children 
required a political judgment he wouldnt make 
its not my responsibility to make that kind of decision 
sessions said 
but the fbi director said the presence of these weapons does 
have a very destructive impact on american society and the people 
tragedy after tragedy flows from it sessions said people 
and law enforcement officers are victims of these crimes 
i am sorry we are outgunned and outmanned in that respect 
the director said echoing sentiments of many local law enforcement 
officials who have asked congress to ban semiautomatic assault 
weapons such as the soviet ak47 
president bush has resisted calls to ban the weapons that were 
made in the wake of the jan 17 shooting at a stockton calif 
elementary school where five children died when a gunman sparyed 
them with more than 100 rounds from a sovietstyle ak47 rifle 
but bush a lifelong member of the national rifle association 
said earlier this week that he wants to find a way to prevent the 
criminal use of these weapons while doing whats right by the 
legitimate sportsman 
bush said he has directed drugczardesignate william bennett to 
study the proliferation of the semiautomatic weapons 
critics say the guns can be easily altered to make them automatic 
despite legal prohibitions on such weapons 
sessions meanwhile defended the fbis background investigation 
of former texas sen john tower whose nomination as defense 
secretary was rejected thursday by the senate 
the bureau carried out its function in this case as im sure it 
did in hundreds of other cases sessions said adding he saw no 
need to change at all the fbis procedures for conducting 
background checks on cabinet nominees 
some senators have criticized the bureau as helping spread 
innuendo and rumors in its investigation of tower whose drinking 
habits relationships with women and financial ties to the defense 
industry came under fire 
floyd clarke the bureaus director of investigations said the 
fbi is careful to verify derogatory allegations made about a 
nominee including questioning the individual about the charges 
sessions who personally removed himself from the tower case 
because of his past political ties with the former senator said the 
white house had not criticized the fbis handling of the 
investigation 
sessions said he intended to serve out his 10year term as fbi 
director the director said reports that attorney general dick 
thornburgh was trying to remove him were as much a surprise to me 
as anyone 
i intend to serve out my full term sessions said 
but sessions acknowledged that he had stopped meeting informally 
with members of congress at fbi headquarters a practice which 
reportedly drew objections from thornburgh 
i see the attorney general of the united states as the person 
for whom i work at the department of justice sessions said i 
agree fully with his onevoice concept he said referring to 
thornburghs repeated injunction that the department speak with 
one voice

straight term in office but the opposition broke the governing 
partys virtual monopoly of the 17seat parliament by winning two 
seats officials said today

losing one seat from antigua to the opposition united national 
democratic party

of our democratic process and must be congratulated for their 
efforts said lester bird son of the prime minister and chairman

1967

a fight erupted at a rally for republican mayoral 
nominee edward vrdolyak after a handful of hecklers booed the 
candidate and his supporters responded by throwing punches 
vrdolyak blamed his democratic challenger richard m daley but 
daley supporters suggested thursday nights fight was a setup 
crafted by vrdolyak himself 
the fight was over in about a minute and there were no arrests 
we knew daley would resort to this vrdolyak told the crowd 
at a northwest side hall we must be winning they want to throw 
the place up for grabs 
countered daley spokesman avis lavelle if vrdolyak thinks 
these people were hired by the daley campaign it is more likely 
that he or someone in his campaign hired them so they could blame it 
on the daley campaign 
mayor eugene sawyer who was defeated by daley the cook county 
states attorney in the feb 28 mayoral primary was courted 
privately earlier this week by both daley and alderman timothy 
evans who bypassed the primary to run as an independent in the 
april 4 special election 
sawyer delayed an announcement on an endorsement until next week 
but said he probably will remain neutral 
the april 4 election will choose a successor to serve out the

president bush today announced he will propose 
legislation to halt exports of hazardous waste unless there is an 
agreement that the receiving country will handle the material in an 
approved safe manner 
the presidents proposal would involve waste that us industry 
ships for disposal in other countries concerns have been raised by 
environmentalists that some countries particularly in the 
developing world do not regulate disposal and handling of such 
wastes in an environmentally safe manner 
bush in remarks at the swearingin cermony for health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan said he would send legislation to 
congress to empower the united states to block exports by us 
companies unless safety can be ensured through a bilateral pact 
the legislation will give the us government the authority to 
ban all exports of hazardous waste except where we have an agreement 
with the receivng country providing for the safe handling and 
management of those wastes he said 
were determined to work with other concerned governments to 
exercise wide stewardship over our environment particularly where 
matters of health are concerned bush said 
the legislation bush proposes would affect any us companies 
that export hazardous waste rather than dispose of it in the 
approved domestic sites said linda fisher assistant environemental 
protection agency director for policy 
she said most us exports go to canda and mexico where other 
companies that deal in waste receive it in mexico some handlers 
use the waste in recycling efforts she said 
most of the countries that have caused concern are third world 
nations she said 
under current law the united states has to notify another 
country that hazardous waste is being shipped to them we dont have 
any mechanism to make sure it is being handled properly in other 
country she said 
bushs proposed bill would ensure that companies only ship to 
countries that have a bilateral agreement with the united states to 
make sure it is handled in a manner that does not endanger health 
and the environment

as many as 115 coastal homes and 
structures along the outer banks island chain have been destroyed or 
damaged by three days of high waves spawned by a storm drifting 
slowly out to sea 
i got to laugh to keep from crying said kitty hawk resident 
joseph verscharen as he and his wife janet surveyed the damage to 
their oceanfront lot thursday this was our castle 
about 10 feet of their cottage hung over a 6foot cliff where the 
ocean had eroded more than 75 feet of beach and a protective dune 
the verscharens built after storm damage last april 
thursday night officials opened a shelter at kitty hawk 
elementary school for oceanfront residents fearing the abnormally 
high tides and 15foot waves 
meanwhile five traffic fatalities and two deaths from 
hypothermia were linked to slick roads and cold weather over the 
past three days 
in addition to buildings damaged or destroyed scores more are 
threatened from sandbridge in virginia beach south through the outer 
banks chain of barrier islands off the north carolina coast 
on hatteras island three neighboring motels in buxton were 
endangered when the mornings high tide breached a protective dune 
residents fighting 45 mph wind and a sleet storm pitched in to fill 
sandbags by hand while bulldozers pushed up sand to rebuild the 
dune line 
whatever we do have left it will be because the people of 
hatteras came to help its something ill never forget said 
carol dawson coowner of the 43unit cape hatteras motel the 
only thing we can hope for now is the weather were at the mercy of 
the weather 
outside the old us coast guard station at oregon inlet waves 
battered the concrete pilings of the bridge over the inlet from 
hatteras to bodie island it is as bad as it can be short of a 
hurricane said lt martin l phillips commander of the us 
coast guard cape hatteras group 
he said erosion toppled a 125foot us navy electronics tower on 
the inlet thursday morning 
the storm will probably alter oregon inlet a passage to the sea 
for fishing boats he said 
you cant depend on the aids to navigation out there now 
phillips said the storm is pushing a lot of sand around 
at kitty hawk a dozen people watched thursday while a cottage 
shook against the waves until its support pilings broke sliding the 
home into the surf in one piece as it went into the ocean a new 
water heater kitchen appliances and new decking went with it the 
house made a quarter turn in the waves and bounced off five more 
homes to its south before breaking up 
armand and betty muller owners of the claydon motor lodge in 
kill devil hills lost one unit wednesday and watched thursday when 
another section of the motel they have managed for 23 years slipped 
into the sea 
it didnt go all at once it has been coming down for three 
high tides mrs muller said but yesterday when we saw the 
floor fall out of the bottom unit and the furniture go floating

they descend at night death on the wing for the 
skittering rats who populate city parks 
who 
barn owls thats who the citys latest weapon in its endless 
battle against the unwanted denizens of the parks 
the parks and recreation department said thursday it would start 
putting owl boxes in four parks to encourage more ratdevouring 
birds to take up residence 
its called operation owl prowl and its considered a 
potential alternative to rat poison which is becoming less toxic to 
new generations of rodents and often kills animals other than their 
intended targets 
were getting some recruits in the war against rats said 
parks commissioner henry stern who calls the park rodents very 
visible and increasingly bold 
officials hope the plywood honeymoon cottages will encourage the 
hundreds of owls that already live in the city to reproduce faster 
an owl box imitates the natural habitat said marc matsil 
director of the departments natural resources group they 
actually prefer boxes to trees because theyre larger more 
symmetrical better protected 
similar programs have worked in mount rainier national park in 
washington and mesa verde national park in colorado matsil said 
actually barn owls dont give a hoot they make a loud hiss 
and sometimes a clicking sound when frightened the snap their 
bills theyre mediumsize as owls go with a white heartshaped 
face ringed with tan and a tan breast 
a barn owl can kill three rats in a nights work matsil said 
and not just for food theyll do it for fun those feathery 
fiends if a pair of owls is raising owlets usually four to six per 
brood theyll kill even more 
the nightly labor of these owls will more than justify the 
modest expense of the housing we are providing stern said 
the program will start in the coming weeks with 25 owl boxes 
scattered through four parks including central park they cost 3 
to 7 apiece 
in a couple of years the park folks will know if its working 
in the meantime the city will keep using pesticides stern said 
while trying to keep the poison away from owl habitats

the quick trip secretary of state james a 
baker iii took to vienna this week could mark a turning point in the 
development of the bush administrations foreign policy 
baker made tentative arrangements to visit moscow in may where he 
will discuss a summit meeting for president bush with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
by the time baker gets his first look at the soviet union a 
slowmoving review of us arms control policy will be completed as 
well as a review of the way the united states deploys its strategic 
nuclear forces 
that would free baker to set a date for the resumption of 
negotiations with the soviets in geneva to sharply reduce us and 
soviet longrange bombers missiles and nuclear submarines 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze wanted baker to 
agree to resume in april or may but baker demurred bush and baker 
want to finish the us internal reviews first 
when the talks were suspended in december the two sides agreed to 
pick up again in midfebruary but bush ordered a delay to review 
the bidding 
the treaty the two sides were working on is not ready of course 
verifying compliance which is a diplomatic way of saying making 
sure the other side cant cheat is unresolved there are other 
problems as well 
still the negotiators had come a long way since president reagan 
put aside his visceral distrust of moscow and approved the search 
for ways to lower tensions by destroying some of the worlds most 
powerful weapons 
the review ordered by bush implies some backtracking on the us 
side 
but baker told reporters as he flew home on monday that the 
administrations intention was not to start over but to build on 
the existing foundation 
he wants to make sure the treaty that finally emerges in geneva 
can be ratified by the senate the 1979 strategic arms limitation 
treaty was yanked by president carter before a ratification vote 
because it faced defeat and treaties in 1972 and 1974 to limit 
underground nuclear tests were not submitted by president ford 
because he feared defeat at the hands of conservative republicans 
all three treaties are being observed more or less but bush and 
baker want formal approval of any accord with the soviets to reduce 
longrange nuclear weapons 
baker seemed to get along well enough with shevardnadze who met 
so frequently more than 30 times with bakers predecessor 
george p shultz that ussoviet relations benefited from their 
ease with each other 
at the same time baker did not spare the criticism he felt the 
soviets had earned by their diplomatic overture to iran 
he called it posturing and suggested the soviets were 
interfering with a us effort to isolate iran over the death 
threats leveled by the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini against salman 
rushdie for writing a book khomeini considers heretical to islam 
the soviets have their own interests of course in trying to 
mend fences with a fundamentalist government that used to denounce 
moscow and washington with equal venom as the great satans 
one is to try to influence the afghan rebel leaders who are in 
iran to support the establishment of a new government in kabul that 
is not hostile to moscow 
after all the united states under reagan tried its own hand at 
iranian diplomacy by surreptitiously shipping loads of missiles to 
tehran to try to secure the freedom of american hostages in lebanon 
and encourage moderation in iran 
the result was the irancontra scandal 
baker also expressed displeasure over the help the soviets have 
been giving nicaragua as the central american country builds up its 
armed forces he complained that the arsenal is a threat to 
nicaraguas neighbors 
shevardnadzes response was to call for a halt in us support to 
honduras el salvador and other friendly governments which baker 
turned down 
on the middle east the disagreement was more nuanced 
baker said he welcomed soviet help in trying to resolve the 
arabisraeli conflict given the fact the united states tried for 
years to keep moscow out of the picture bakers statement was not a 
platitude 
but he didnt bite at the continuing soviet call for an 
international peace conference baker wants more time before he 
begins an inevitable us campaign to try to push israel to the 
bargaining table under terms prime minister yitzhak shamir considers 
dangerous

soviet inspectors friday checked an air 
base where us cruise missiles were based until their elimination 
under a 1987 treaty and they also examined a missile repair 
facility the foreign ministry said 
the two inspection teams will return to the soviet union on 
saturday said foreign ministry spokesman alexis brouhns 
the inspectors visited florennes air base 65 miles south of 
brussels where 16 groundlaunched cruise missiles and four spares 
were kept inspectors also went to gosselies near florennes to 
check the european repair facility where unarmed missiles are still 
repaired brouhns said 
the missiles arrived in belgium in 1985 and were removed in 
december 1988 one year after former president reagan and soviet

police on friday detained dozens of moslem 
fundamentalists who protested a ruling that prevents women at 
universities from covering their heads in accordance with islamic 
tradition 
about 500 protesters chanting islamic slogans faced a police 
barricade when they began marching after the friday sermon from the 
hacibayram mosque in the center of ankara a police official said 15 
people were detained 
two female students were detained in a separate incident at the 
downtown post office where a demonstration began after hundreds of 
moslem fundamentalists tried to send telegrams to the president 
premier and members of parliament 
at least 15 moslem fundemantalists were detained in istanbul at a 
similar demonstration in the neighborhood of the istanbul 
university the anatolia news agency reported 
anatolia said police detained 10 protesters in the western 
province of bursa and 20 others in the southern province of adana in 
demonstrations after the friday sermons 
protesters in each incident also denounced salman rushdie author 
of the satanic verses they chanted slogans such as down with 
europe america and israel and death to salman rushdie 
according to news agency reports 
the protests grew after a constitutional court on tuesday called 
unconstitutional a parliamentary decision in december that permitted 
islamicstyle head covering at the universities 
turbaned women say their islamic beliefs require them to cover 
their heads while in mixed company their defenders contend the ban 
is a restriction of democratic freedoms 
defenders of secularism say the headcovering is an ideological 
symbol of moslem fundamentalism and thus a threat to turkeys 
modernization efforts in the past 60 years 
kemal ataturk founder of modern turkey reduced the role of 
religion in this overwhelmingly moslem nation he abolished the 
caliphate adopted laws from western europe replaced arabic with 
latin script and extended full civil and political rights to women 
premier turgut ozal a devout moslem who has been sympathetic to 
protesting students on thursday criticized the courts decision 
we want to be a western country ozal said we want to be a 
community in which freedoms are broad and people dont become angry 
because of religious beliefs three or four girls wearing turbans 
are neither going to drag turkey backwards or help it to advance

the vaticans senior official on families 
today accused planned parenthood of encouraging promiscuity and 
criticized feminism in a speech to the us roman catholic hierarchy 
cardinal edouard gagnon president of the pontifical council for 
the family applauded catholics who fight against the roe vs wade 
decision of the us supreme court allowing abortion 
but he charged that in the united states some forms of ministry 
to divorced catholics had degenerated into dating services he 
urged caution in granting annulments saying that in allowing women 
to help decide such cases we have to be careful that their tender 
hearts do not play tricks on them 
in chicago the acting president of the planned parenthood 
federation of america david j andrews said gagnon is absolutely 
right in suggesting that the group opposes the churchs position 
on birth control 
andrews said gagnons speech reflects the desperation of a 
church trying to come to grips with the issue of sexuality and with 
the fact that people the world over rely on effective methods of 
birth control and want to keep abortion services safe and legal 
gagnon spoke on the third day of an extraordinary fourday 
meeting on the 52 millionmember catholic church in the united 
states pope john paul ii summoned 35 american prelates to the 
vatican to discuss how bishops should defend catholic teaching in 
the face of dissent and secularism 
while gagnons speech repeated wellknown vatican positions on 
sexual issues it was strongly worded and unusually specific 
reflecting the churchs concern about the high number of american 
catholics going their own way on matters like birth control and 
divorce 
gagnon told the prelates that planned parenthood was challenging 
the vaticans ban on artificial contraception by trying to set up 
schoolbased birth control clinics 
planned parenthood programs of sex education in no way resolve 
the problem of teenage pregnancies but rather increase it by 
encouraging promiscuity he said according to a text of his 
speech that was released by the vatican 
the canadian cardinal also accused planned parenthood of trying 
to undermine the only form of birth control the catholic church 
allows which is known as natural family planning it involves 
having a couple abstain from sex during the wifes fertile period 
an estimated 70 percent of american catholics use artificial 
birth control and us catholic bishops suggested in a draft 
pastoral letter in april that the church should be more responsive 
toward them however pope john paul ii has declared there are no 
exceptions to church teaching on the issue 
in his speech gagnon called on bishops to do something about 
subtle pornography that is the degrading of moral values vehicled 
by cinema and tv shows which pretend to depict normal american 
life 
he said americans had to realize how much influence their 
television programs have worldwide mentioning the tv series 
dallas known for its potrayal of sexual affairs and an affluent 
society gagnon said bishops in other countries would like us to 
reflect on what we export can do to the conscience of their people 
the cardinal said that the church should work for the promotion 
of women but that ideological feminism has a deterious influence 
on the family he did not elaborate 
in the other major speech given at the session archbishop john 
quinn of san francisco said the american church had successfully 
promoted family life but that poverty drug use and mobility 
presented major challenges 
in an apparent response to vatican criticism of the high number 
of marriage annulments granted quinn said diocesan tribunals take 
great care in reaching decisions 
in discussion at todays session a vatican cardinal expressed 
concern at the large number of annulments granted in the united 
states achille silvestrini supplied figures showing that of 46632 
annulments granted in the world in 1985 36180 of them were in the 
united states

the good news from the milan winter runway 
which kicks off a new fashion decade is that women can wear what 
they like and still be in style 
no single trend or style emerged in this weeks showings of the 
italian readytowear collections for the fallwinter 198990 
rather it was a mixed fashion bag full of goodlooking clothes 
which dont require a perfect body 
hemlines range from the thigh to the floor skirts come in tight 
and loose versions jackets tend to be short but can also be 
threequarter there are trousers for every taste and configuration 
solid colors abound but so do plaid floral and paisley prints 
in general the designers stay away from the sexy aggressiveness 
epitomized by the miniskirt the italian rage several seasons ago 
to present a quieter more casual style dropped shoulders long 
languid lines and completely flat footwear 
the color scheme draws inspiration from the shades of an autumn 
forest brown moss green burnt yellow and berry blues and reds 
orange and fuchsia are the favorite shocking shades gray and black 
show up in every collection 
as always with italian readytowear these outfits are based on 
the good tailoring and beautiful fabrics which have become the 
trademark of the moda milanese milan fashion 
some say the designers put their pocket books before their 
creative talents in this latest round of collections 
but according to marjorie deane a us consultant who puts out 
her own fashion report this is not necessarily a sin 
luxury italian readytowear is our bestseller she said 
there might not be big news here but it will be a very popular 
season women will feel good in these clothes and why shouldnt 
they 
the hottest item on the milan winter runway is the coat as big 
and cozy as possible with broad shawl collar and ample dropped 
sleeve and a hemline which often grazes the floor some coats have 
hoods others are worn with long wool or fur scarves 
capes and threequarter jackets also play heavily in the 
collections 
for the animallover the designers offer fake furs made out of 
wooly synthetic fabrics to look like everything from sable to 
leopard fabric printed with animal spots and stripes is another 
ecologically minded option 
some of the winter offerings of italys top readytowear 
designers 
armani the curved hem tulipshaped skirt floral printed silk 
quilted jackets and a whole zoo of fun fake furs 
basile chic tweedy daytime suits and beautiful white silk 
evening blouses 
biagiotti dresses in luxurious bunched and ruffled cashmere 
fendi reversible furs where the leather side of the pelt 
treated to look like polished cotton becomes the outside of a sable 
coat as well as its lining 
ferre huge wraparoundtheneck scarves in fox fur printed to 
look like leopard and zebra and the most chic pants on the runway 
in simple gray flannel 
krizia languid cashmere tunic dresses and hiplength sweaters 
featuring prints of her animal of the year the tiger 
missoni beautiful floral printed jackets worthy of the best 
years of the famous knitting family 
mario valentino leather at its best in coats and jackets some 
with punchedout suede collars to look like lace 
versace the shortest skirt in milan and perhaps the world 
less than a foot of fabric between the waist and the hemline

a us research plane left a norwegian air 
base friday to test the air over the vast whiteness of the north 
pole where scientists say pollution rivals that of smogridden 
american cities 
the modified p3 orion surveillance aircraft will make 10 
highaltitude flights from bodoe air force base to trace the sources 
and types of pollutants blamed for the greenhouse effect the 
gradual warming of the atmosphere 
from the ground the arctic may seem pristine in its frozen 
isolation but from high altitudes it is not 
sometimes visibility is reduced to a couple of kilometers 
said russell schnell a university of colorado atmospheric scientist 
arctic air pollution is as bad as youd find in any american 
city its as bad as the denver brown cloud or the smog of la 
he is one of 40 american scientists stationed at bodoe 540 miles 
north of oslo until april 20 to chart gases chemicals visibility 
and temperatures for the coordinated eastern arctic experiment a 2 
million study of polar pollution sponsored by the national 
oceanographic and atmospheric survey 
schnell said his team also flew the orion a hurricane stalker in 
summer from canada and greenland but came to norway to get as 
close as possible to the source of pollution for the projects 
most comprehensive phase 
he said more pollution drifts over the pole from norway than from 
the arctic regions of north america because more people live in the 
far north of europe where ground temperatures are moderated by the 
warmth of the gulf stream 
in a telephone interview from the air base schnell said look 
at bodoe its at about the same latitude as barrow alaska here 
they grow potatoes in barrow its too cold to grow anything the 
arctic is 1000 times more polluted than the antarctic because 
people live in it 
twenty scientists and crew were aboard the orion when it left 
friday for its mission over the pole and svalbard an arctic island 
off the northwestern norway 
norwegian and canadian scientists are assisting the us study 
with ground measurements to compare with figures recorded by the 
orions instruments as the plane passes six miles above the ice 
pack schnell said 
this is the winters second americanfinanced study of polar 
conditions form norway in a project sponsored by the national 
aeronautics and space administration a modifed u2 spy plane flew 
arctic missions to measure the ozone layer which shields the earth 
from the suns harmful ultraviolet rays 
schnell said the orion would measure such ozonedepleting gases 
as halon and chlorofluorocarbons known as cfcs he added that we 
also want data on carbon dioxide levels produced by burning fossil 
fuels and on partical pollution such as dust and soot 
increasing scientific evidence shows that cfcs are destroying the 
ozone shield when cfcs reach the stratosphere 1525 miles up as 
much as 100 years after emission they break apart and their 
chlorine atoms deplete the fragile ozone layer cfcs also trap heat 
increasing earths temperature 
scientists have said the phenomenon could cause dramatic climate 
changes within decades that would increase the fury of tropical 
storms and raise the level of the seas threatening coastal floods 
rough estimates of the arctics condition probably will be 
released next month schnell said with more precise figures to 
follow in a year 
a sevenfoot section of the orions wingtip was removed to house 
a radiometer for measuring the suns rays he said and highly 
sensitive radar will gauge cloud and particle density 
we also will look for polar lows small but fierce storms 
similar to hurricanes the scientist said 
long ago whole arctic island villages would sometimes 
disappear and no one knew why polar lows probably swept them 
clean

former national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane told a jury today that top reagan administration officials 
discussed whether arranging thirdcountry aid to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels was an illegal act for which the president could be 
impeached 
testifying at oliver norths irancontra trial mcfarlane said 
thenwhite house chief of staff james a baker iii took the position 
at the june 25 1984 meeting of the national security planning group 
that it was illegal to solicit thirdcountry aid 
i took it to mean that if the president were to authorize 
money from third countries that would be a violation of law and 
he could therefore be so charged and impeached removed from 
office said mcfarlane members of the planning group included the 
president vice president and secretaries of state and defense 
mcfarlane recalled that bakers view was strongly countered 
and that the consensus from the meeting was that bakers opinion was 
not true 
saudi arabia that year began giving the contras 1 million a 
month 
prosecutor john keker asked mcfarlane whether top administration 
officials were being asked to lie to congress about the secret 
thirdcountry aid mcfarlane said the intent was just not to 
have the matter become public 
mcfarlane said the reagan administration decided to seek help for 
the rebrels from other countries because it did not wish to become 
involved in a messy political fight with congress by seeking 
additional contra aid in an election year 
the american people dont like violence mcfarlane said in 
regard to the war the contras were waging against the leftist 
nicaraguan government 
earlier today a public relations consultant who moved money to 
the contras testified at the us district court trial that north 
approved taking a 10 percent cut from private donations to the rebel 
cause 
richard miller said north told him at the end of 1985 that most 
of the people involved in the fundraising network were getting 
20 to 30 percent 
miller also told how he asked the former white house aide for 
lists of bigticket items the contras needed that would be 
comprehensible to potential contributors 
miller said that in july 1985 north suggested c4 plastic 
explosives and m79 grenades but he said the two men agreed that 
it was just not appropriate to be raising money for weapons 
through a taxexempt organization headed by carl spitz channell 
a conservative fundraiser with whom miller was working to support 
the contras 
however miller said north in october 1985 suggested a list of 
items that included 50 shoulderheld antiaircraft missiles at a 
cost of 20000 to shoot down soviet hind helicopters in nicaragua 
miller recalled that north raised the cost to 22100 when miller 
asked about shipping charges the list was used to solicit a 
contribution from wealthy connecticut widow barbara newington who 
asked north whether he knew where to get the missiles 
he said yes we know where to get them miller recalled 
mrs newington ended up giving 12 million in stock 
in the spring of 1986 miller said he asked north about the 
missiles because soviet helicopters were still plaguing the contras 
north responded that they really didnt need the missiles and 
what they needed instead were secure communication devices the 
witness said 
during a meeting at the end of 1985 in norths office i asked 
to take 10 percent out of the stream of money miller recalled 
and north responded that that seemed reasonable 
miller used a cayman islands corporation ic inc to move 
taxexempt contributions raised by channells organization 
he said i would notify colonel north that i had the money 
and would await instruction from colonel north on where to send 
it 
frequently he said north told him to move funds to a swiss bank 
account controlled by arms dealers richard secord and albert hakim 
norths codefendants in the irancontra affair 
miller said his 10 percent cut would be automatically 
deducted from the funds 
miller agreed with prosecutor david zornow that despite norths 
refusal to be in the room when money was being solicited by channell 
and others north in one instance had contacted miller requesting 
30000 on short notice which miller helped to get he also agreed 
that north was told how much money was going to be solicited from 
donors and how much had been obtained 
another figure involved in the private contra fundraising 
network daniel l conrad said thursday that north angrily 
complained about having to answer asinine congressional 
questions 
conrad the liaison between north and channell said north made 
the comment in the fall of 1985 and then told conrad the two had to 
stop meeting at norths office

the vatican on friday made a major 
reorganization of the church in lithuania and hailed it as a 
breakthrough for roman catholics in the soviet republic 
the steps included the naming of three heads of dioceses by pope 
john paul ii the first residential bishops appointed in lithuania 
since the end of world war ii 
the changes are believed to have needed at least the tacit 
approval of the soviet government 
lithuania an independent country before the war was occupied by 
the soviet union in 1940 about 80 percent of its 35 million people 
are said to be roman catholics 
the holy see is pleased that we could arrive at a 
reorganization that was desired by catholics in lithuania said 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
under the reorganization cardinal vincentas sladkevicius was 
named archbishop of kaunas and monsignor julijonas steponavicius was 
appointed archbishop of vilnius 
sladkevicius had been serving in kaisiadorys and steponavicius in 
vilnius but each with the title apostolic administrator this meant 
they were not fully empowered as residential bishops 
while in practice the functions are similar the naming of a full 
residential bishop has considerable importance for the church as a 
sign of a more normal climate 
oly in december the soviet government allowed steponavicius to 
resume his official duties after 28 years in internal exile he was 
exiled to northern lithuania in 1961 for refusing to collaborate 
with soviet authorities 
in a third appointment friday the pope named monsignor antanas 
vaicius bishop of telsiai where he had been serving as apostolic 
administrator 
john paul also named apostolic administrators for kaisiadorys and 
vilkaviskis 
in response to a question navarro said he didnt believe the 
steps meant the way was open for a possible papal visit to 
lithuania john paul has said that he has been refused permission to 
visit lithuania on at least two occasions 
i wouldnt make any connection to such a visit navarro said 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is scheduled to visit italy 
in november and was recently reported to have expressed interest in 
meeting with the pope the vatican says john paul would welcome such 
a meeting which would be the first between a roman catholic pontiff 
and a soviet leader

a severe sandstorm struck the northern and 
central persian gulf on friday reducing visibility to a few hundred 
yards and disrupting airline flights in kuwait and bahrain 
civil aviation officials said two flights from sri lanka and 
bangladsh bound for kuwait were diverted to manama because of the 
storm when the storm hit bahrain at least two departing flights 
were delayed for an hour or more 
visibility on bahrains coastal highway was reduced to less than 
600 yards as the huge cloud of yellow dust darkened skies and 
covered everything with a coat of silt 
temperatures fell to about 46 degrees seas were running 3 to 7 
feet in deeper waters 
thick dust was generated by strong winds flowing around a low 
pressure system which moved eastward across the region in the 
northern gulf said an official from the bahrain meteorological 
section 
sandstorms are common in the gulf but residents said fridays was 
the most severe in years 
small amounts of rain are normal in the arid region this time of 
year but this season has been unusually dry

president bush cast a wide net today for a 
replacement for rejected nominee john tower as defense secretary and 
was expected to move swiftly on his choice his spokesman said today 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush was 
considering multiple candidates for the post and that phone calls 
are being made 
fitzwater would not characterize the list and said that while the 
president had no timetable on his announcement one was expected 
relatively soon he even held out the possibility that a decision 
could come later today 
bush is being encouraged by everyone to do it in spokesman said 
presidential aides began looking at various candidates 
immediately after ta hurry the 
he senate voted 5347 thursday to reject tower 
bushs first choice for the post 
the president was meeting with advisers on the issue throughout 
the day and both he and top aides were making phone calls to 
prospective candidates fitzwater said 
a lot of names have been suggested he said adding that some 
of them were among those passed over the first time around when 
tower was selected 
its not starting from scratch basically theres a large 
r tower and suggested that 
some senators made up their minds based on groundless rumor 
now however we owe it to the american people to come together 
and move forward he said 
a new nomination may could come before weeks end a senior 
administration official said thursday the official speaking on the 
condition of anonymity said a long informal list of candidates had 
been compiled even before the tower vote 
the official noted that some of the names had been compiled late 
last year before tower was finally selected in december were 
not starting from scratch the official said 
fitzwater however insisted that bush himself had not given 
serious thought to a replacement as long as towers nomination was 
before the senate 
hes had discussions with the chief of staff john sununu and 
brent scowcroft in terms of what kind of candidates hes interested 
in but i would hasten to point out theres some difference 
between that and actually having a list of candidates fitzwater 
said 
scowcroft himself has been the subject of much speculation for 
the defense post some members of congress have even suggested a job 
switch with tower since the national security advisers post does 
not require senate confirmation 
scowcroft said thursday he was not in line for the job but that 
hasnt stopped the talk 
among the other contenders edwards is popular among lawmakers of 
both parties he is former senior republican on the house defense 
appropriations subcommittee and his expertise on military matters is 
widely respected 
lewis chairman of union pacific corp was transportation 
secretary under former president ford and cochairman of the 
recently disbanded national economic commission he would bring to 
the job considerable management experience 
rumsfeld served as defense secretary under ford 
of the three senators being mentioned warner a former navy 
secretary might be the most easily confirmed but his nomination 
would rob republicans of one senate seat since governors fill 
senate vacancies and virginias governor is a democrat 
that would not be a problem for rudman from new hampshire or 
cohen from maine since both states have gop governors 
administration sources have said that bush not wanting to 
subject another candidate to the grueling experience tower went 
through seemed likely to pick someone either currently or recently 
in government who had been through the confirmation process or a 
member of congress 
however the names of some business executives have also cropped 
up including donald rice of the rand corp and frank borman 
former astronautturnedexecutive 
and two who served in the administration of former president 
jimmy carter are also being mentioned as darkhorse possibilities 
zbigniew brzezinski who was carters national security adviser and 
james schlesinger who was his energy secretary after serving as 
fords first defense secretary 
bush planned to spend the weekend in camp david and invited 
members of the joint chiefs of staff and their wives but fitzwater 
said the gettogether was mainly social and had nothing to do with 
finding a replacement for tower

diesel fuel us and argentine officials said 
the authorities interviewed this week said little more could be 
done with the halfsunken ship the bahia paraiso before the 
antarctic winter sets in 
the mission is practically completed said capt heberto 
rubatino head of the argentine navys antipollution office we 
are sure we have checked out cleaned up and controlled all of the 
bahia paraisos tanks 
rubatino in a meeting with us authorities aboard an argentine 
navy cargo ship anchored near the site said some of the bahia 
paraisos fuel storage tanks could not be reached safely by divers 
to pump them out he said they had been sealed 
a us navy salvage expert william walker said the ship still 
held about 63000 gallons of diesel fuel he agreed the fuel was 
unreachable 
he said the vessel had been carrying about 265000 gallons of 
diesel fuel when it ran aground jan 28 on shoals about two miles 
from palmer station a us research base on the antarctic peninsula 
about 600 miles from the tip of south america 
the bahia paraiso rolled over and partially sank three days after 
it ran aground it is on its side and part of its gashed orange 
hull and its deck remain above the water line the waters 
immediately around the wreck are discolored and smell of fuel 
the united states chile and argentina sent teams and equipment 
to the site walker said about 16400 gallons of fuel was pumped out 
of the wreck after hundreds of thousands of gallons leaked out 
walker also said any effort to salvage the vessel or to cut it 
up and remove it from the site would take three years and cost as 
much as 60 million far more than the ships value any decision 
on whether to salvage the vessel would have to be made by argentine 
authorities he said 
peter wilkniss polar programs director for the national science 
foundation said cleanup efforts by argentine and us experts 
would conclude about march 15 he said scientists from the united 
states argentina and chile was being sent to palmer station to 
study the spills effects on the areas wildlife the foundation 
supervises all us activities in antarctica 
he said the diesel still in the ships tanks was expected to 
continue to leak maybe for as long as a year some floating 
containment booms would be placed to try to control the leakage 
theres little more we can do before winter sets in he said 
the best thing that could happen as cruel as it sounds is for 
it the ship to break up and spill its guts all at once he said 
this would bring contamination to a quicker end and allow the 
wildlife to recuperate he said 
wilkniss said however that experts were unable to predict 
whether the ship would break up in a big storm or slowly rust 
through 
the palmer station area abounds with wildlife including penguins 
and seals scientists say they have found many dead seabirds 
including skuas and cormorants and a few dead penguins but are 
unable to say for certain if pollution was to blame 
pollution experts say diesel fuel because of its high 
volatility evaporates quickly and is less damaging to wildlife than 
thicker petroleum products 
on feb 26 a peruvian research ship the humboldt ran aground 
in antarctica near king george island 300 miles from palmer 
station authorities said the humboldt spilled a small amount of 
fuel that was treated by the chilean navy with chemical dispersants 
the ship was refloated march 6

candidates on friday ended campaigning for municipal 
elections that are largely dominated by local issues but could test 
the health of frances socialist government 
political observers gave the socialists the edge in the voting in 
the more than 36500 communities choosing mayors and city council 
members in sundays first round of voting the second round takes 
place march 19 in towns where no party wins an absolute majority 
television and radio coverage of the campaigns was forbidden as 
of midnight friday all polls were banned at the start of the week 
in keeping with french electoral rules 
the extreme right national front made lastminute calls to the 
conservative right to join in secondround alliances 
if there can be no such accord too bad for them national 
front leader jeanmarie le pen said thursday night 
le pen is running in paris 20th district a workingclass 
quarter dominated by asian and north african immigrants 
it remained unclear to what extent conservatives would need the 
national front which stunned the nation when le pen gained a 
crucial 14 percent of the vote in the first round of may 
presidential elections 
any sizable socialist loss would be seen as a judgment on the 
government of socialist premier michel rocard but that seemed 
unlikely to happen because recent popularity polls give high ratings 
to rocard and president francois mitterrand 
the socialists expect to gain control of as many as 20 additional 
cities with more than 30000 people 
however jeanmarie le guen first secretary of the socialist 
federation of paris conceded friday he was worried voters might not 
go to the polls he accused conservative mayor jacques chirac of 
refusing to call parisians to their civic duties 
chirac who has campaigned on issues such as traffic environment 
and housing was in no danger of losing his job in the city he has 
held since 1977 his socialist opponent interior minister pierre 
joxe has all but conceded defeat 
joxe has indicated he would be satisfied if the conservatives 
lost several of paris 20 districts where they now have a total 
monopoly 
a loss of even one paris district would be a setback for chirac 
the head of the rally for the republic chirac has been trying to 
rebuild his power base which eroded after his defeat in the may 
presidential election to mitterrand 
in lyon the age factor has become an issue with 78yearold 
incumbant mayor francisque collomb a centrist facing michel noir 
of chiracs rpr who at 45 is considered the favorite 
in the socialist bastion of marseille mayor robert vigouroux 
favored to win reelection was ousted from the socialist party when 
he refused to step aside in favor of the official socialist 
candidate michel pezet 
centerright candidate jeanclaude gaudin also is a candidate

the soviet union lodged a resolute protest 
over the expulsion of a military attache allegedly involved in a spy 
operation aimed at learning how the us government protects 
computer secrets 
lt col yuriy nikolayevich pakhtusov 35 was told to leave 
thursday an fbi investigation had led to his arrest wednesday 
night just a day after the bush administration opened a highlevel 
dialogue with the soviet union 
pakhtusov was described by a us source as a significant catch 
because he is a member of the red armys gru intelligence arm one 
official said pakhtusov was caught redhanded 
but the soviet embassy issued a statement saying the expulsion 
order could be only qualified as a deliberate provocation against 
a soviet diplomatic official 
it denied that pakhtusov engaged in any wrongdoing and said the 
embassy has lodged a resolute protest with the state department 
asked about the soviet allegations today department spokesman 
charles redman said the reason for our actions is very simple he 
was caught redhanded with the goods and no amount of verbiage can 
change that 
redman added that the soviets have informed the united states 
that pakhtusov will be leaving as requested 
he said there is no reaosn to believe the incident will affect 
ussoviet relations the soviets are aware that the united states 
will protect its national security interests whenever its 
threatened he said 
state department press officer dennis harter said the soviet 
embassy was informed that pakhtusov was being expelled for 
activities incompatible with his diplomatic status 
according to one government source pakhtusov was asked to leave 
by saturday 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov called the 
expulsion a gross provocation at a regularly scheduled news 
briefing today in moscow but he did not announce any retaliatory 
soviet action 
he said the us side is assuming all the responsibilities of 
the decision to expel pakhtusov 
repeatedly asked by reporters whether pakhtusov was engaged in 
spying gerasimov responded he did not violate diplomatic status 
with whatever he did 
violating diplomatic status is an oftused diplomatic euphemism 
for spying 
in vienna on tuesday secretary of state james a baker iii met 
for the first time with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and announced plans for a visit to moscow in may 
the fbi probe was set in motion in august two months after 
pakhtusovs arrival when he approached an american employee of a 
company that deals in classified information 
the american who was not identified reported the contact to the 
fbi which began monitoring contacts between the two 
there is growing evidence that the soviets are placing high 
priority on gaining access to western computers with sensitive 
military nuclear and space research information stored inside them 
a week ago west german authorities charged a computer hacker 
with espionage and said a total of eight people were suspected of 
selling sensitive computer data from the united states and allied 
countries to the soviets from 1986 through last year 
the german action was described by officials as the first 
confirmed case of soviet computer espionage a state department 
official who asked not to be identified said there was no 
connection between the german and pakhtusov cases 
from moscow the official soviet news agency tass today expressed 
outrage at the expulsion and reported that pakhtusov was arrested 
while taking out the garbage at his home in virginia 
neither tass nor other soviet media said whether there would be 
any retaliatory action taken against americans in the soviet union 
soviet interest in penetrating western computer banks has added a 
new dimension to the ongoing effort to make stored data secure 
without making it inaccessible to those with a legitimate need for 
it 
previously the problem had been limited to hackers who try to 
penetrate computers as a hobby 
pakhtusov is the first publicly acknowledged case of a soviet 
envoy being expelled by the united states since december 1987 when 
mikhail kathov second secretary at the soviet mission to the united 
nations was ordered home for trying to obtain information on 
military technology 
in september 1986 the reagan administration alleging widespread 
spying activities ordered the expulsion in stages of 105 soviets 
from moscows un mission the soviets retaliated by expelling a 
number of american diplomats from moscow

the united states will be responsible for any 
consequences arising from the expulsion of a washingtonbased soviet 
diplomat accused of spying on us computer operations soviet 
officials said friday 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov called the 
expulsion of lt col yuri n pakhtusov a gross provocation 
in washington the soviet embassy lodged a resolute protest 
with the state department 
the soviets did not announce any retaliatory action but 
gerasimov said in taking the decision to expel pakhtusov the 
us is assuming all responsibilities 
what we have here is an intentional preplanned action against 
a soviet diplomatic employee who did not carry out any actions 
incompatible with his diplomatic status he said at a news 
briefing 
pakhtusov a military attache at the soviet embassy in 
washington was ordered home thursday after the fbi said it caught 
him receiving sensitive information wednesday night on how the us 
government protects computer secrets 
a us source identified the 35yearold soviet as a member of 
gru the soviet militarys intelligence arm 
repeatedly asked by reporters whether pakhtusov was a spy 
gerasimov said he did not violate diplomatic status with whatever 
he did 
violating diplomatic status is a euphemism for spying 
us ambassador jack matlock called gerasimovs remarks 
nonsense 
matlock later met with the soviet deputy foreign ministry 
vladimir f petrovsky a senior us official who spoke on 
condition he not be identified further said the meeting was 
arranged before the expulsion 
the soviet news agency tass said the men discussed questions on 
global problems and on the activity of international organizations 
embassy spokesman richard gilbert said the us mission in moscow 
had received no notice of any soviet retaliation for the expulsion 
nor do we expect any 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
the reason for our actions is very simple he was caught 
redhanded with the goods and no amount of verbiage can change 
that 
redman added the soviets have informed the united states that 
pakhtusov will be leaving as requested a diplomatic source in 
washington who spoke on condition of anonymity said pakhtusov had 
been told to leave by saturday 
he said there is no reason to believe the incident will affect 
ussoviet relations the soviets are aware that the united states 
will protect its national security interests whenever its 
threatened he said 
tass and gerasimov gave different versions of pakhtusovs arrest 
tass said he was taking out the garbage at his virginia home and 
was in slippers at the time 
gerasimov said he was arrested while visiting a neighbor in an 
upstairs apartment and indicated he was the victim of entrapment 
he went to visit one of his neighbors and as is being 
asserted he was offered some financial aid gerasimov said 
perhaps they wanted to hand him some sum of money what i can see 
in this is an habitual fbi tactic 
gerasimov and tass blamed the expulsion on us opponents of 
better superpower relations 
over the years when one superpower expelled a diplomat on spying 
charges the other nation has responded in kind 
in october 1986 after 25 soviet diplomats were ordered out of 
the soviet un mission in new york the kremlin expelled five 
american diplomats

the internal revenue service said friday that 
its telephone assistors are giving even more wrong answers than 
last year and the agency promised to waive penalties for taxpayers 
who can document the erroneous information 
so far this year calls to the irs tollfree numbers are 
producing answers that would lead to errors on taxpayer returns 308 
percent of the time the agency said at this time last year the 
error rate was about 28 percent 
we are not pleased with our performance with respect to 
accuracy robert lebaube irs director of taxpayer services told 
reporters it is our every intention to see this error rate go 
down as quickly as possible 
lebaube said the agency will not penalize a taxpayer for an error 
caused by faulty advice from an irs employee if the taxpayer can 
provide the name of the employee the question asked and the date of 
the wrong answer the irs took a similar stance last year 
we are not out to cause pain and suffering of people in any 
way lebaube said 
he said the massive changes included in the 1986 tax overhaul 
which was hailed by congressional backers and thenpresident reagan 
as simplification and the sheer number of tax bills enacted must 
carry a lot of the blame for the confusion among irs employees 
since 1976 there have been 138 public laws modifying the 
internal revenue code lebaube said since the tax reform act of 
1986 there have been 13 public laws changing the code and in 1988 
alone there were seven public laws affecting the code 
as an example lebaube explained there was a time when it was 
simple to answer a taxpayers question about his or her personal 
exemption under the new law he said a simple question on the 
dependency exemption can require as many as 42 probing followup 
questions to get the correct answer for a particular taxpayer in a 
particular set of circumstances 
the general accounting office an arm of congress did its own 
testing of irs employees during the 1988 returnfiling season and 
found the agency provided wrong answers to 36 percent of test 
questions one of the main problems gao found was the failure of 
irs employees known as assistors to probe callers for additional 
information 
the irs has 5000 assistors many of them parttime employees 
answering taxpayers tollfree telephone calls this filing season 
about 1500 of that number are new to the job these workers who 
earn from 650 to 1170 an hour must have at least a high school 
education and undergo a minimum of five weeks training 
they are not accountants or tax lawyers lebaube noted i 
dont think the economy could support giving us 5000 tax 
accountants to answer calls 
through last weekend the telephone system had received 155 
million calls since jan 1 compared with 169 million for the same 
period a year ago about 45 percent of the calls are seeking answers 
to specific questions about filling out a return about 84 percent 
of callers get through to the irs on the first or second try 
lebaube said 
although fewer people are calling with questions this year the 
irs teletax system which provides taped answers on more than 150 
specific tax subjects has received 78 million calls more than 
triple the figure at this time last year 
in an effort to improve the tollfree system an irs team is 
making about 20000 calls with test questions this filing season 
the 62 questions used are tailored to approximate those that typical 
taxpayers would pose 
the test system has been enhanced this year to seek out and 
correct areas of tax law that are producing the most errors by 
assistors the biggest problems this year are questions dealing with 
capital gains and losses and with pensions lebaube said

the government friday 
threatened to crack down on antiapartheid activists allegedly 
trying to revive a mass hunger strike by detainees 
law and order minister adriaan vlok cited six organziations that 
he said were planning to restart a protest fast next week in durban 
port elizabeth and other cities 
should unrest flare up again or should a single person die as a 
result of the hunger strike the organizations and persons fomenting 
these campaigns will have to bear the responsibility for their 
devilish deeds vlok said 
the organizations named by vlok included the recently formed 
hunger strikers support committee and the congress of south african 
trade unions the countrys largest black labor federation 
detainees in johannesburg began the hunger strike jan 23 to 
demand that they be freed or put on trial the strike spread to 
other cities but was suspended in most prisons after vlok told 
church leaders feb 16 that he would release a substantial 
number of detainees 
the government says it has freed 279 detainees since then while 
about 500 people remain held without charge antiapartheid groups 
say fewer people have been released and contend about 700 still are 
in detention 
on friday the association of democratic journalists announced 
the release of freelance journalist brian sokutu who had been held 
for the entire 33 months of the emergency like many of those 
released sokutu is under restriction orders he is not allowed to 
attend any meetings that criticize the government 
antiapartheid leaders accuse vlok of not keeping his promises 
saying he had given the impression he would release at least half of 
those held without charge 
our hopes for a new attitude on the part of the police and the 
government have not been realized said anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu and stephen naidoo the roman catholic archbishop of 
cape town 
the crisis precipitated by the governments 
detentionwithouttrial laws is intensifying their statement 
added 
as many as 500 detainees have participated in the hunger strike 
but only about 20 in the port city of durban currently are fasting 
neither the detainees nor any antiapartheid organization have 
publicly called for a new mass hunger strike but they have warned 
it could resume if the government does not release most of those in 
detention 
an estimated 30000 people almost all black have been detained 
without charge for varying lengths of time during the 33month state 
of emergency

fourth and fifthgraders whose junk food 
favorites have jumped in price by 100 percent say desperate times 
call for desperate measures 
indignant at prices hiked from 25 cents to 50 cents for cafeteria 
snacks such as ice cream or potato chips the youngsters are staging 
a boycott 
if everyone stops buying for a week it will take them a while 
to recover said jacob berlin a fourthgrader at claypit hill 
school 
students at the school in the boston suburb began their protest 
last month with a petition drive 
that failed and the 9 through 11yearolds decided to get tough 
its not noticeable enough a protest to say wow prices are 
going up jacobs said 
students feel some increase would be reasonable but 100 percent 
was too much he said 
the food service annual budget of 350000 for four schools 
relies on cafeteria revenues and the price hike was necessary to 
make up for losses suffered because of a shrinking number of 
students in the upper grades to patronize the high school snack bar 
said lillian mills who runs food services for the wayland school 
system 
early accounts show snack sales at claypit hill are down ms 
mills said 
while teachers have tried not to interfere fourthgrade teacher 
rick colpitts said he used the protest for classroom discussions on 
economics and the uses of petitions and boycotts 
as a teacher im proud that they were able to take an issue 
and mobilize around it colpitts said thursday i think it was 
good that they were able to stand up and try to change things 
peacefully

jessica hahn whose 1980 tryst with 
television evangelist jim bakker brought down the ptl ministry says 
her childhood dream was to be a preacher not a playboy centerfold 
i never thought about modeling hahn a former church 
secretary said of her early ambitions i thought my whole life 
was being in the church 
i eventually saw myself preaching but not the way you see 
preachers preach the people i always wanted to reach were 
teenagers said hahn now seeking work as a disc jockey after a 
brief stint at a phoenix radio station she was in western lower 
michigan wednesday for a radio station promotion 
hahn 29 said she is bothered by criticism of her appearances in 
playboy and a suggestive music video with screaming comic sam 
kinison 
what really disturbs me is when people criticize me for taking 
chances or taking advantage of opportunities she said 
when people are given a chance in life i believe god is opening the 
door and you have to walk through it

robert h bork the rejected supreme 
court nominee and arthur schlesinger jr the pulitzer 
prizewinning author reached a consensus only once during their 
appearance at pacific university 
schlesinger drew chuckles during thursday nights debate when he 
observed that he and bork had thus far agreed only on the importance 
of dry martini a subject they discussed in private earlier in the 
evening 
bork 62 who resigned from his bench on the us court of 
appeals last year and is now a resident scholar at the american 
enterprise institute in washington dc was adamant that the court 
was growing dangerously powerful 
what i object to are judges who are making up moral principles 
that have no foundation in the constitution whatsoever he said 
schlesinger 71 former special assistant to president john f 
kennedy and currently the albert schweitzer professor of humanities 
at city university of new york argued that the original 
understanding of the framers of the us constitution included the 
implicit power for supreme court justices to adapt general 
principles to changing circumstances

hurricaneforce winds that have hampered 
the search for three missing japanese climbers on mount mckinley 
abated somewhat friday and an air force pilot saw a flash of red or 
orange as he flew near the continents tallest peak 
maj neal sharra radioed however that he saw no movement in the 
area along the missing mens likely route and officials cautioned 
the color might be a box of emergency provisions left for climbers 
in trouble 
the three climbers who were last seen feb 22 while attempting a 
rare wintertime ascent of the 20320mountain are equipped with 
orange tents and were wearing identical red climbing suits 
rescuers were waiting friday for the wind to die down hoping 
they could fly helicopters near the mountain for a more extensive 
search the air force observation plane that saw the color had been 
sent up primarily to monitor visibility and turbulence 
bob seibert a mountaineering ranger with the national park 
service said the search once winds allow it to begin would first 
concentrate on the place where the color was spotted 
rescuers were ready to board aircraft early thursday but they 
remained in talkeetna hour after hour as winds that at times topped 
90 mph persisted around mount mckinley 65 miles to the northwest 
by friday morning seibert said the weather looks different 
than it has for the past week and a half i feel better about it 
than i did yesterday 
chief warrant officer myron babcock leader of the army rescue 
team agreed that the winds were not as bad but theyre still 
twice as high as wed like them to be 
the climbers rations probably ran out days ago but the park 
service has a cache of food fuel and water at 17200 feet along 
with a semipermanent ice cave officials said 
if they stayed put at 17200 camp theyd be fine said 
roger robinson a park service mountaineering ranger the 
resources there are phenomenal 
it was that brightly colored box of provisions that might have 
caught the eye of the pilot seibert said 
the japanese last were seen by a threeman austrian climbing 
team the austrians were descending the mountain and the japanese 
were climbing there have been six successful winter ascents since 
1967 with four climber deaths during that period the park service 
says 
although the japanese are equipped with a radio its use and 
range is limited they have a little fm radio robinson said 
its pretty restrictive as to who you can talk to 
members of the japanese party are leader noboru yamada 39 teruo 
saegusa 31 and kozo komatsu 34 all of tokyo

former defense secretary frank c carlucci said 
friday that the pentagon had not sold out us economic interests in 
agreeing to transfer to japan technology for building an advanced 
version of the f16 fighter 
it is my judgment that the fsx represents a good deal for 
japan a good deal for the united states and an excellent deal for 
the usjapan security and industrial relationship carlucci told 
a senate armed services subcommittee 
he asserted that in the end much of the criticism of the fsx 
deal reflects an irrational fear of japans technological prowess 
under the deal st louisbased general dynamics would join 
forces with japans mitsubishi heavy industries to codevelop and 
coproduce a nextgeneration fighter called the fsx for deployment 
by japan in the late 1990s 
proponents argue that the agreement represents the best deal the 
united states could negotiate in the face of japanese opposition to 
buying f16s directly from the united states they say the deal will 
serve to promote beneficial technology transfer in both directions 
while generating income and jobs for us industry 
critics however contend that the arrangement amounts to a 
giveaway of advanced technology that japan may use to help propel 
its civilian aircraft industry into headtohead competition with 
the united states in the world market they say tokyo should 
purchase americanmade planes to help offset the 50 billion us 
trade deficit with japan 
in the face of congressional criticism the bush administration 
has been conducting an interagency review of the fsx deal prior to 
sending the agreement to capitol hill 
at the white house officials said the national security council 
expected to receive friday the results of the review handled mainly 
by the pentagon and the commerce department 
we expect the review will be completed and we wont have a 
presidential decision for some time said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater he said president bush would examine the issue 
next week 
sen jeff bingaman dnm chairman of the defense industry and 
technology subcommittee told the hearing i believe that the 
process whereby this agreement was reached was flawed in that the 
departments of state and defense systematically excluded from the 
negotiations the agencies which deal with our economic and trade 
policies 
the fundamental decision at the start of these negotiations was 
not to link our defense and trade relations that decision was 
unsustainable he said 
bingaman is among 21 senators cosponsoring a senseofthesenate 
resolution that expresses strong reservations about the fsx 
deal also a group of 24 house members has sent a letter to bush 
saying they intend to fight the agreement when it goes to capitol 
hill 
carlucci told the panel that the fsx deal is not an agreement 
which sells out us economic interests for the sake of purely 
military or strategic interests 
in fact our defense and state negotiators were well aware 
of the economic equities at stake and proceeded from the view that 
economic security is a cornerstone of our future national 
security he testified 
he added that officials conducting the interagency review also 
will not find that our negotiators lost their shirts or gave 
away the store on technology transfer as has been alleged by 
some

irans parliament speaker said friday 
the satanic verses had created historys strangest crisis and 
he offered a simple solution burn all existing copies of the book 
and ban it forever 
a dispatch from the official iranian news agency did not say 
whether hashemi rafsanjani commented on ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis order of feb 14 that his followers kill the author 
salman rushdie for blaspheming islam 
unless the novel is destroyed and banned rafsanjani said during 
friday prayers at tehran university it will remain forever a 
source of rebellion and it would be impossible that peace would come 
between real moslems and the supporters of this book 
he said the solution to the strangest and rarest crisis in 
history is to issue a strict order to seize all copies in the entire 
world and burn them the islamic republic news agency reported 
rushdie a naturalized citizen of britain was born to moslem 
parents in bombay india but has said he no longer practices 
religion the 41yearold author went into hiding after the khomeini 
pronounced the death sentence and iranian religious leaders added a 
reward of 52 million 
moslems say a scene in the satanic verses in which 
prostitutes take the names of mohammeds wives and suggestions that 
the prophet wrote the holy koran rather than receiving it from 
allah blaspheme mohammed and islam 
most nations in the middle east have banned the book as have 
asian countries with large moslem populations at least 19 people 
were killed in riots about it in india and pakistan 
iran broke diplomatic relations with britain on tuesday because 
prime minister margaret thatchers government refused to suppress 
the novel 
she and her foreign minister sir geoffrey howe said they 
realized rushdies book offends moslems but insisted khomeinis 
execution order be revoked and freedom of expression respected 
the dispute opened a new rift between iran and the west to which 
more moderate elements in tehran had looked for trade and assistance 
in rebuilding from the eightyear war with iraq 
britains 11 partners in the european economic community joined 
by canada norway and sweden recalled their ambassadors from 
tehran britain says it will deport nine former iranian embassy 
employees if they do not leave the country within 10 days 
rafsanjani was a leader in openings to the west and has been 
considered the irans most powerful figure after khomeini the 
88yearold revolutionary patriarch 
he castigated britain in his speech friday they didnt have 
the guts to say we also did wrong we supported rushdie we too 
are guilty he declared 
their pride didnt allow them to say the truth if those who 
ignited this flame do not find a suitable solution who knows where 
it will lead 
a tehran radio commentary said outrage over the satanic 
verses would not abate and warned of retaliatory action if 
britain deported the iranians 
there are currently present in iran persons who are engaged 
in spying for britain and undoubtedly it is britain who will be the 
loser as the result of retaliatory measures the radio said 
it mentioned british businessmen roger cooper 52 a longtime 
resident of iran jailed in tehran two years ago on espionage 
charges the radio said cooper had made revelations about 
undercover activities in islamic countries that can greatly 
disgrace britain 
in turkey a secular moslem state police detained dozens of 
demonstrators friday after protests to denounce rushdie and his 
novel protesters chanted down with europe america and israel 
and death to salman rushdie

an organization that set out to help needy 
farmers through sales of a calendar featuring young bachelor 
farmers is folding a state official said 
food incs debts far outweigh the meager assets that they 
have and it is unable to pay its bills james vukelic north 
dakotas solicitor general said thursday 
food inc which stands for farmers of ongoing determination 
produced a calendar called dakota men which pictured a young 
man for each month the 1988 calendar featured north dakota farmers 
the 89 issue contains farmers from both dakotas 
the venture was launched in 1987 but ran into serious trouble 
last year when an audit revealed that some of the 175508 raised 
from the sale of the first calendars in 1988 had been spent on 
questionable expenses including parties and none went to charities 
the state attorney generals office filed suit against the 
organization charging it with mismanagement and misrepresentation a 
settlement was reached last december whereby food inc could 
continue operating under certain restrictions and close supervision 
by the state 
however the matter severely damaged sales of the 1989 calendar 
roger jaeger an esmond farmer who is executive director of food 
inc said 1989 sales were not what the organization expected 
vukelic said the state was concerned now about the liquidation of 
the organization 
when we were informed by representatives of food inc that they 
intended to shut down their operation we were primarily concerned 
in seeing that the assets of the corporation were liquidated and we 
want to oversee that process he said 
the state has not been provided with all the specifics on food 
incs assets vukelic said 
jaeger said he hoped to have more details about the 
organizations shut down later this month

president bush plunged anew into the search for 
a defense secretary friday reviewing names and asking about 
candidates less than 24 hours after the senate killed his nomination 
of john tower 
in sharp contrast to bushs lowkeyed reaction to his first 
legislative defeat vice president dan quayle turned up the heat and 
accused senate democrats of engaging in a mccarthyite mudslinging 
campaign against tower and waging an assault on the powers of 
the presidency 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater acknowledged there 
is some difference in tone between bush and quayle bush had said 
we owe it to the american people to come together and move 
forward 
white house officials said bush would pick a replacement quickly 
he sought advice on the nomination in telephone calls and in 
meetings with people he trusts said fitzwater 
many potential candidates were mentioned including former rep 
jack edwards rala sens william cohen rmaine and ted stevens 
ralaska former defense secretaries donald rumsfeld and james 
schlesinger former cia deputy director bobby inman paul oneill 
chairman and chief executive officer of alcoa and norman augustine 
chairman and chief executive officer of martin marietta aerospace 
corp 
edwards law office said he wasnt interested in the job and 
augustine let it be known that neither was he 
cohen said the talk about him was just unfounded rumors 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser said 
thursday he wouldnt get the job but his name was still being 
mentioned 
cohen speculated that the next nominee would be someone whos 
gone through a recent fbi check the nominee must be 
wellrespected and able to work in a constructive way with 
congress 
fitzwater at a latemorning briefing said the president is 
reviewing candidates both in terms of receiving names from any 
number of people and sources in the government in the white house 
and outside the government as well 
he has asked that several of them be checked out in one fashion 
or another in terms of availability or interest as well as 
background 
fitzwater refused to say how far the field had been narrowed but 
said you may be assured the search is intense and is being 
carried by a number of people as rapidly as possible 
the main reason the search was expected to go quickly was because 
bush went through the same drill before choosing tower last december 
its not like were starting from scratch fitzwater said 
basically theres a large group of people to consider off that bat 
that theyve gone through in quite detail before he said other 
names were being added he said 
bush will meet over the weekend at camp david with the joint 
chiefs of staff for previously scheduled talks on defense issues 
but fitzwater said the president did not have to talk with them 
before making a decision 
meanwhile quayle flew to indianapolis and in a prepared speech 
harshly criticized senate democrats and warned there will be a 
lingering bitterness over the tower fight 
never in all my years in the senate have i encountered anything 
like the feeling of outrage that exists today among my former 
republican senate colleagues he said never have i encountered 
such anger and bitterness in the senate chamber 
quayle said the harmful consequences of the tower affair will 
not soon pass im afraid that the misguided democratic assault on 
the powers of the presidency will continue 
he said the democrats losers in five of the last six 
presidential elections have set out to undermine the presidency 
by encroaching on its powers 
at the white house fitzwater said quayle had given a copy of the 
speech to the white house on thursday but that he did not have to 
have his remarks cleared in advance 
fitzwater said he did not think bush had read the speech 
however bush and quayle talked over lunch on thursday the 
president is aware of the vice presidents views 
commenting on different tactics adopted by bush and quayle 
fitzwater said i think the senate understands these positions 
i think everyone understands where theyre both coming from 
in another development sen sam nunn dga the leader of the 
fight to defeat towers nomination struck a conciliatory note 
saying i hope the passions that are now bubbling in washington 
will soon cool 
nunn chairman of the armed services committee said we cannot 
prevail as a great power if either our allies or our adversaries 
look to washington and see endless division and rancor instead of a 
principled unified american policy

the israeli army removed some troops from gaza 
strip refugee camps friday in a bid to reduce tension and fatal 
clashes in the teeming palestinian communities the military said 
the moves came as foreign minister moshe arens left for a 10day 
visit to the united states where officials are expected to press 
for less violence in israels effort to halt the 15month 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
arens is to meet monday with president bush and secretary of 
state james baker he is expected to seek us support for efforts 
to bring peace to the occupied lands 
in clashes friday in the gaza strip refugee camp of rafah troops 
shot and killed 22yearold suher lutfi al hams arab reports said 
arab reporters and hospital officials said at least 15 
palestinians were wounded in clashes in the occupied lands an army 
official confirmed the death and seven wounded and said he was 
checking the other injury reports 
the death brought to 394 the number of palestinians killed since 
the start of the uprising against israeli rule of the occupied 
lands seventeen israelis including six soldiers also have died 
israel has controlled the territories since it captured them from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
by removing some troops from refugee camps the government is 
shifting the emphasis on its policy from a widespread army presence 
in the lands to fewer but bettertrained antiriot units 
maj gen yitzhak mordechai commander of the gaza region told 
the daily hebrew haaretz the changes are meant to ease friction 
between soldiers and palestinians 
the occupied territories are home to more than 17 million 
palestinians 
gaza strip reporters said the army on friday moved troops out of 
the jabaliya refugee camp soldiers also continued for a second day 
to move out of the shati refugee camp to posts near the entrance 
gates arab reporters said 
residents of gaza city said they saw fewer army patrols despite 
a general strike called by the underground leadership of the 
uprising 
jabaliya where the uprising began is the gazas largest refugee 
camp with nearly 54000 residents according to figures from the 
united nations it is just northeast of gaza city 
shati has more than 42000 refugee residents according to the 
un figures it is on the mediterranean sea inside gaza city 
a military source who insisted on anonymity said more troops 
would be moved next week in the gaza strip and in a few trouble 
spots in the west bank including the town of qalqilya 
as part of the moves fewer reserve army troops will be sent to 
the territories instead increased paramilitary border police units 
and specially trained mechanized infantry battalions will be more 
widely used 
the ultimate goal will be fewer fatalities which is something 
everybody wants an army official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said in an interview 
he said border police officers are trained in riot control and 
that they have caused far fewer fatalities per incident than the 
army 
the officers twothird of whom are israeli arabs have a 
reputation for relying on wooden batons and teargas to scatter 
demonstrators rather than guns they seem to get their message 
across without opening fire the army official said 
he said more border police have been recruited to deal with the 
uprising but declined to give figures the mechanized infantry 
units which will operate as mobile strike forces will not be ready 
until april he said 
elsewhere in gaza on friday the army destroyed rooms in the 
homes of three palestinians from the khan yunis refugee camp who 
were suspected of throwing firebombs at arab collaborators an army 
commander told army radio 
i hope tomorrow when the local population gets up and sees the 
destroyed rooms it will serve as a warning and there will be less 
violence said the commander who was not identified by name in 
keeping with military policy 
the radio broadcast the sounds of bulldozers smashing into 
concrete amid protest whistling and jeering by palestinians

college students businessmen and bargain hunters 
piled aboard the eastern airlines shuttle friday many saying that 
while they felt guilty about crossing a picket line the 12 fare 
down from 99 was too good to miss 
i feel like a scab said john brousseau of worcester a 
wastewater treatment plant worker i belong to two unions but for 
the price i just bite my tongue 
others aboard the noreservation link between boston new york 
and washington said they were admirers of frank lorenzo owner of 
eastern parent texas air the striking machinists union and pilots 
supporting the strike blame lorenzo for easterns problems 
i think the unions are wrong anyways theyre crippling the 
airlines said peter rogina 33 of salem a sales manager who 
prefers to fly pan am some baggage handlers are getting paid 40 
an hour to unload planes thats ridiculous 
the eastern employees staffing the planes rolled out the red 
carpet extending more than the usual welcome to the first crowd of 
passengers since the weekold strike began shuttle flights earlier 
in the week had been mostly empty 
im glad we have a good crowd even though were giving it 
away the pilot joked over the intercom 
the pilot a 26year eastern veteran said 12 was the price of 
easterns very first shuttle in 1961 the offer is good through 
sunday the airline announced it will cut regular weekday fares to 
49 next week 
early flights were less than halffilled despite fares cheaper 
than a taxi to the airport in two of the nations costliest cities 
the 8 am shuttle from boston to new york carried 140 people in a 
plane that holds 250 
the 10 am return trip to boston with the same plane and crew 
carried 73 passengers pilots on both sides of the picket lines said 
those numbers were roughly average for the airline before the strike 
traffic on latemorning flights was heavier 
eastern managers said they hoped for more passengers as word 
spread that the shuttles were flying despite the companys 
declaration of bankruptcy thursday 
roger howlett an art dealer in boston and new york said the 
uncertainty almost kept him away he told a flight attendant the 
airline would have more takers if it ran radio updates on the 
shuttles status 
you dont know if theyre flying or not he said i tried 
to call 50 times before i left but the line was busy 
pickets outside the eastern terminal at bostons logan airport 
urged travelers to resist the low fares and hospitality 
its just another one of frank lorenzos tactics so he can say 
the shuttles full said norma henson a 20year eastern flight 
attendant

guidance components for the air forces cruise missile the 
government alleged in joining a 63 million lawsuit brought by 
whistleblowing exemployees 
the lawsuit unsealed thursday in us district court accuses 
northrop corp of falsifying test results on parts for nearly 1800 
of the nucleartipped missiles which are launched from bombers and 
skim the earth toward their targets 
these are critical guidance and flight control systems parts 
for the airlaunched cruise missile said mary mcmenimen 
spokeswoman for the us attorneys office here these units are 
on b52 and b1 bombers stationed both in the us and overseas 
the cruise missile is a subsonic jetpowered missile with small 
wings it is designed to fly close to terrain to avoid radar 
detection and can carry conventional or nuclear warheads it has a 
range of up to 1500 miles 
when the government entered the case feb 15 the company asked 
the judge to keep the lawsuit sealed after hearing arguments on the 
motion thursday judge david kenyon ruled against the company 
an attorney for the whistleblowers herbert hafif said northrop 
sought to keep the lawsuit closed to protect its corporate image 
northrop spokesman tony cantafio cited a november 1987 general 
accounting office report stating the guidance system was reliable 
and will perform its intended mission 
the corporation fired a plant manager and three employees after 
the aerospace firm discovered irregularities in the tests 
cantafio added 
the lawsuit was filed in 1987 under the false claims act which 
allows whistleblowers to share damage awards with the government it 
was joined by the justice department last month a move the 
government makes if it determines the allegations have merit 
the air force is evaluating the evidence in order to determine 
whether corrective action needs to be taken to assure their 
reliability mcmenimen said 
an attorney for the private plaintiffs fired northrop workers 
leocadio barajas and patricia meyer said the workers were told to 
falsify test results the attorney rob kilbourne alleged the faked 
tests mean the performance of the parts called flight data 
recorders is suspect 
northrop has delivered a guidance system for a nuclear weapons 
system that very well may not work if used that is the bottom 
line kilbourne said 
the lawsuit alleges that northrop falsely certified it had 
performed critical stress tests on flight data transmitters for 
1764 missiles between 1981 and 1986 los angelesbased northrop 
supplies the transmitters to boeing corp of seattle which makes 
the missiles 
production of the 9000permissile guidance systems started in 
el monte and moved later to pomona 20 miles east of downtown los 
angeles 
a federal grand jury in los angeles is conducting a separate 
criminal investigation of the alleged fake tests the los angeles 
times reported 
northrop vice chairman frank lynch admitted during a 1987 
congressional hearing that the stress tests designed to expose them 
to heat and cold to screen out defective units were falsified and 
that employees reported it to superiors 
unfortunately the manager of the plant was involved in the 
falsification of tests lynch testified 
the us attorneys office entering the lawsuit accused 
northrop with breach of contract and fraud the act allows the 
government to seek 60 million three times the actual damages and 
3 million in civil penalties ms mcmenimen said 
in the civil lawsuit filed nov 2 1987 barajas said he was 
instructed on what steps to take to make it appear the parts passed 
certain tests 
ms meyer a quality control inspector for northrop said she was 
fired after rejecting parts and materials that didnt conform to 
guidelines or were defective

wedding postponed due to strike 
eastern airlines flight attendant janet thollander and mechanic 
albert eskridge had set their wedding for april 15 
but after his machinists union went on strike and she and other 
attendants and pilots honored the picket lines they called their 
families and friends to say the date had been postponed indefinitely 
i had not had the photographer or the flowers because that you 
have to put a deposit on said ms thollander a 10year eastern 
veteran the restaurant where i was going to have the reception 
all i have to do is tell them to cancel my dress still sits in 
my closet 
she mailed job applications this week to three other airlines 
and eskridge a 12year eastern employee submitted about 25 
applications to other carriers engine manufacturers and nasa 
weve been eating hot dogs and hamburgers a lot said ms 
thollander wearing her eastern uniform at a picketduty desk at the 
machinists union hall hot dogs here and hamburgers at home 
attendants honoring the machinists picket line cannot collect any 
strike benefits because the transport workers union representing 
5900 eastern attendants including 2000 in miami is not 
technically on strike those who refuse to cross picket lines are 
ineligible for unemployment benefits 
about 1500 eastern employees are still being paid but paychecks 
for striking workers have been tied up in bankruptcy court with the 
carriers petition thursday for chapter 11 financial reorganization 
robert ziller a university of florida psychology professor 
worried about the strikes potential for isolating and alienating 
people cut off from their support system in the workplace 
ill bet they have some nice explanations that serve as a 
support in this i dont get the sense that theyre throwing up 
their hands at all yet he said there is a sense theyre 
fighting the good fight 
financial consequences of the strike are blunted in twoincome 
families ziller noted 
that curiously enough is a sort of economic parachute that 
families have today theyre a little more independent with two 
people working he said im sure they have looked at this hard 
and theyre prepared to eat oatmeal for a year if necessary 
many veteran attendants retired or took other jobs with the 
strike looming and many of those hit by the strike quickly went 
jobhunting 
attendants have gone to work as a nurse a dental hygienist 
waitresses and with companies offering temporary secretarial 
services ms thollander said a law school student is now 
concentrating on her studies fulltime 
they always had a lot going for them said ms thollander 
im sure people will be landing on their feet in different jobs 
she hopes to remain in florida but will relocate if necessary 
she lists a chicago condominium and her car as her primary assets 
adding most flight attendants dont have a lot of money saved

tensions are high at the overcrowded 
immigration detention center where central americans except 
nicaraguans are being deported under strict new political asylum 
measures officials said 
more than 2000 undocumented aliens were crammed into dormitories 
and tents friday at the immigration and naturalization services 
minimumsecurity port isabel service processing center 20 miles 
northeast of the border city of brownsville 
i think there is an increase in tension said ins spokeswoman 
virginia kice our detainee population has increased fivefold in 
the past two weeks 
mark schneider an immigration attorney said evidence of the 
tension includes fistfights and ethnic slurs among the detainees 
earlier this week ins officials stopped allowing reporters and 
photographers into the 315acre compound to avoid increasing the 
level of excitement ms kice said 
our population is high and our first responsiblity is the 
welfare of our detainees and personnel the ins spokeswoman said 
but added there had not been any violence at the center 
the detainee population for months remained below 450 at the 
rural facility before the crackdown on asylum applicants took 
effect on feb 21 the ins started a speededup procedure in which 
asylumseekers applications are processed quickly and those denied 
refugee status are arrested and detained unless they appeal their 
denial of asylum detainees face quick deportation 
schneider who visited clients at the center thursday night 
said the atmosphere is tense people are vocally demanding more 
food and medicine 
the overcrowding and the lack of information are making people 
nervous he said 
seventy central americans who were rejected for asylum here under 
the new measures and did not appeal have been flown back to el 
salvador guatemala and honduras since sunday when the deportations 
began ms kice said 
we have not deported any nicaraguans she said the meese 
directive still stands 
former us attorney general edwin meese in july 1987 issued a 
directive calling for special treatment of nicaraguan political 
asylum cases and for ins officials to encourage and expedite 
their applications for work authorization under the directive few 
nicaraguans have been deported unless they had criminal records 
because the ins considers marxistruled nicaragua a totalitarian 
nation 
the ins harlingen district at texas southern tip is referring 
cases of nicaraguans denied asylum to the justice department in 
washington 
of 473 asylum applications processed here since feb 21 only 36 
had been approved as of friday morning and 35 of the 36 people were 
nicaraguans the other was a salvadoran 
the ins began the gettough measures in southern texas to 
discourage frivolous asylum applicants from traveling to the 
united states ins officials said 
political asylum is granted to those able to convince the federal 
government that they are fleeing persecution the ins maintains most 
central americans come here for economic reasons and do not merit 
politicalrefugee status though critics say that the agency is too 
quick to deny asylum from politically torn nations such as el 
salvador whose governments unlike nicaragua are friendly to the 
united states 
more than 40000 central americans have initiated asylum cases in 
southern texas after crossing the rio grande illegally since last 
spring before feb 21 the ins allowed applicants not previously 
apprehended by the border patrol to travel to their us 
destinations to pursue asylum claims 
in addition to the more than 2000 adults in detention at 
bayview including nearly 400 in tents the justice department had 
more than 900 other people in custody at a brownsville american red 
cross shelter for family groups

european interior ministers agreed friday 
on the need to create an intelligence exchange service to combat 
problems arising from the planned elimination in four years of 
borders in the 12nation trade bloc 
the officials did not discuss the scope or future evolution of 
the service said spanish interior minister jose luis corcuera 
he said his fellow ministers asked spain to prepare a document 
outlining the service in time for a may 1213 meeting of the trevi 
group of interior ministers created in 1976 to coordinate 
antiterrorist operations in the european economic community 
interiors ministers from greece spain and france will review the 
document before the may meeting 
british home secretary douglas hurd said earlier that he did not 
believe an eec police force would be established in the forseeable 
future 
what will emerge is a greater cooperation between police 
forces hurd said 
corcuera admitted there was caution on the part of several 
countries about the scope of the service but added agreement on its 
importance was a step forward in the fight against new eec security 
problems 
the least important thing is what it might become in the 
future he said we have to assure that the elimination of 
internal borders is neither good for criminals nor generates greater 
insecurity for citizens 
corcuera said the ministers differed over what types of border 
controls should exist among eec countries after dec 31 1992 when 
the single european act is set to take effect eliminating barriers 
to the movement of capital goods and labor within the trading bloc 
spain advocates the elimination of all controls between eec 
countries while other countries including britain favor border 
checks for noneec nationals a move that would effectively leave 
the current system intact 
problems in a borderfree eec could include increased mobility 
for terrorists transnational currency frauds and the difficulty of 
hot pursuit of criminals across national borders corcuera said 
in addition to the intelligence exchange service and internal 
borders corcuera said the ministers discussed the problems of 
defining crimes common to all eec countries 
these are problems that can affect the legislative domain and 
sovereignty of some countries he said adding that progress was 
very difficult 
spain holds the sixmonth rotating presidency of the eec

a high school principal whose 
disciplinary methods are the focus of a new movie said his recent 
suspension was the work of puritanical demagogues 
joe clark subject of the recent warner bros inc movie lean 
on me said he is not questioning his suspension for arranging an 
assembly at his new jersery school at which four strippers performed 
but for them to get sanctimonious on me they were going to 
suspend somebody so i said you want to suspend somebody suspend 
me i need a rest im tired and youre going to pay me clark 
told the pittsburgh postgazette before speaking at slippery rock 
university on thursday evening 
the suspension was ordered by patersons superintendent of 
schools dr frank napier according to robert g rosenberg 
attorney for the board of education the fiveday suspension is due 
to begin monday 
the assembly at eastside high school included an act by dancer 
wanda dee in which she stripped four male dancers down to their 
gstrings clark was not at the school the day of the assembly last 
month and has said he never expected the dance group he hired to 
lapse into lasciviousness 
clark said controversy over his actions has followed him since he 
became principal of eastside in 1982 
im seriously thinking about getting out of education clark 
told the pittsburgh press 
although clarks speech was applauded often his remarks drew a 
small group of protesters 
one of the groups leaders shawn williams a senior at the 
university of pittsburgh criticized clark for kicking out hundreds 
of students who had poor grades williams said that although 
eastside students had achieved higher test scores this 
improvement is due to the principals purging the school of hundreds 
of its weakest students

president saddam hussein has sent 100000 
workers and heavy equipment to transform this ancient southern port 
shattered by eight years of war into the pearl of the gulf 
officials report 
workers were moved to basra from other parts of iraq with 40000 
trucks mechanical diggers and other heavy machinery after saddam 
visited the city in february and said he wanted reconstruction 
completed in three months 
iraqis see basra founded 1400 years ago and once called the 
venice of the east as the symbol of their resistance to repeated 
iranian offensives during the persian gulf war iranian troops 
fought to within six miles of basra last spring 
we will sweat as much blood as we spilled defending basra to 
make it the pearl of the gulf gov anwar saeed hadithi said in 
an interview thursday 
he said the government in baghdad had opened its purse to 
make funds available in addition to the 5 billion originally 
alloted for rebuilding 
the new basra will be an industrial trade and tourist center 
and will attract more people to work here the governor said 
hadithi said more than 3000 damaged houses would be bulldozed 
and their owners given grants of up to 32000 to build new homes 
before the war basra was iraqs second largest city and had a 
population of 15 million about half the people fled during the 
war but hadithi said most had returned since the ceasefire took 
effect aug 20 
he said the remnants of some public buildings would be left 
standing as monuments and statues of army commanders killed 
defending the city would be erected 
the buildings will stand witness to the savage iranian shelling 
of the city hadithi said the arms of the statues will point 
eastward to warn future generations of iranian ambitions in our 
country 
officials predicted the 500 million international airport 
reopened the day of the truce would become a major transit point 
between europe and the far east the civil aviation authority is 
offering cutprice fuel catering discounts and waived landing fees 
as incentives to airlines 
last week the iraqi ports authority began clearing a stretch of 
the muddy shattalarab waterway the confluence of the tigris and 
euphrates rivers which connects basra with the gulf and represents 
the southern frontier with iran 
whether the border runs in the middle of the shatt or on the east 
bank which would give iraq full control is a major obstacle 
unsponsored peace talks iran also is resisting iraqi demands 
that the waterway be cleared of wrecked ships unexploded bombs and 
eight years of silt deposits 
the iraqi clearing operations are being carried out north of the 
point at which the shatt iraqs only outlet to the sea becomes the 
boundary 
officials said at least 10 sunken vessels had been raised in a 
ninemile stretch running south from maqal the basra port

a tape played in court friday 
covered the tense moments when a us navy diver was shot aboard a 
hijacked twa jetliner but no gunfire could be heard in the 
staticfilled recording 
the recording was heard as the trial of confessed twa hijacker 
mohammed ali hamadi resumed in a highsecurity compound at 
frankfurts preungesheim prison 
however it failed to shed more light on which of the hijackers 
shot and killed us navy diver robert stethem during the june 1985 
hijacking 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is charged with murder and air 
piracy in the hijacking of twa flight 847 during which 39 americans 
were held hostage for 17 days 
hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking but has denied 
killing stethem of waldorf md 
the airliner was comandeered on a flight from athens to rome and 
forced to land in beirut lebanon three times and twice in algiers 
algeria 
the tape covers 49 minutes of conversations between the plane and 
the tower during the second landing at beirut airport on june 15 
when stethem was shot and tossed onto the tarmac to die 
when the aircraft landed one of the hijackers told the control 
tower to send out a representative of the amal 
the amal a shiite moslem faction in lebanon controlled the 
beirut airport at the time of the hijacking 
after repeating their demands one of the hijackers is heard 
giving a fiveminute deadline or you can take the prettiest 
marine to your hospital 
witnesses have testified that stethem had been beaten before he 
was shot the hijackers apparently mistook him for a marine 
a translator who interpreted the arablanguage segments of the 
tape to the court said he could not determine whether hamadi or his 
accomplice was speaking in the tape hamadis accomplice has been 
identified in court papers as hassan ezzeddine who is still at 
large 
hamadi claims his accomplice had talked with the tower and killed 
stethem 
after a warning from the hijacker that time was running out the 
planes copilot philip maresca is heard shouting theyre 
killing a passenger theyre killing a passenger 
stethems parents richard and patricia stethem who have 
attended the trial regularly since its start july 5 leaned toward 
each other in their chairs anticipating the sound of the shot that 
killed their son 
but no shot could be heard 
did you hear the noise of the shot one of hijackers is then 
heard asking 
the hijacker warned that a second person would be killed in five 
minutes 
one body is already on the runway if no one is here there 
will be a second the hijacker is heard saying 
the hijacker later repeats the warning saying an american will 
be killed every five minutes if an amal representative fails to show 
up 
witnesses have told the court that about a dozen amal militiamen 
then boarded the plane 
hamadi listened closely interrupting often to correct the 
arablanguage translator 
fbi agent gary noesner who also testified friday told the court 
that copilot maresca believes hamadi was the hijacker talking with 
the control tower maresca has been asked to return march 22 to 
testify about the tape 
the trial was adjourned until wednesday

rooftop rooters are a tradition among chicago cubs 
fans but the team and its neighbors are up in arms over a proposal 
for a private club atop a building across from wrigley field that 
would sell seats for baseball games 
they are clearly stealing our product cubs president donald 
c grenesko said 
we strenuously object to it if they can do it then the people 
next door can do it and the people next door to them and the people 
next door to them he told the chicago suntimes in an interview 
published friday 
grenesko was attending a team owners meeting friday in florida 
and could not be reached for additional comment said spokesman ned 
coletti 
but mike quigley vice president of a neighborhood group that 
battled unsuccesfully to block night baseball at wrigley field said 
his group will fight on the teams side this time 
we feel the neighborhood is already past the saturation point 
in ability to deal with parking and traffic and liquorrelated 
problems in association with the ballpark said quigley speaking 
for citizens united for baseball in sunshine 
the last thing we need is 30 or 40 private clubs just adding to 
that he said 
the neighborhood around wrigley field is a closepacked mostly 
residential area on the north side 
unlike the fans who relax in lawn chairs with a beer and a 
television set on other rooftops to watch cubs games members of the 
planned club would pay thousands of dollars for their privilege the 
cubs 65 new skyboxes in the stadium already are sold out for this 
season at prices ranging from 45000 to 65000 the suntimes 
reported in fridays editions 
north side lawyer gilbert liss a partner in the club project 
declined to comment on it friday but he told the suntimes it would 
be private 
they are saying that 50 people added to the 40000 who are 
already there are going to cause an undue burden to the 
neighborhood liss said well thats ridiculous 
mr grenesko is not pleased on the other hand mr grenesko 
features the rooftops in tv advertising for the chicago cubs and 
the happy fans 
alderman bernard j hansen whose ward encompasses wrigley field 
said friday he intends to file an amendment to a zoning ordinance he 
has introduced in the city council to prohibit such a club 
the amendment would make it illegal for a private club to operate 
within 500 feet of an openair stadium hansen said 
theyre pirating the use of the chicago cubs he said 
alderman helen shiller whose ward includes the threestory 
building on which construction of the club already has begun also 
opposes it saying she doubts the project is legal 
she said work evidently was done on the building without proper 
permits 
we started receiving complaints in january from neighbors 
very upset because construction was going on she told the 
suntimes 
liss told the newspaper the club is allowed under zoning 
regulations and what we are doing is whats permitted by the law 
but shiller disagreed 
the law i think is clear she said in order to exist 
this club needs a zoning change and in order to apply for it they 
are going to have to come before the community

the soviet union has reduced the size of its 
pacific battle fleet by 40 ships since 1984 as a unilateral step to 
move soviet forces to a more defensive posture a senior soviet 
military analyst told the house armed services committee on friday 
the appearance of andrei a kokoshin deputy director of the 
institute of the usa and canada represented only the second time a 
representative of the soviet government has appeared before a 
committee of congress chairman les aspin dwis said it was the 
first of a series 
kokoshin testifying against the backdrop of massed display of 
us military banners topped with clusters of battle streamers gave 
details of other unilateral soviet military reductions ordered by 
president mikhail s gorbachev declaring that moscow would be 
gratified if similar reductions were ordered by western military 
forces in return 
he said the reduction of military forces in eastern europe 
announced by gorbachev in a speech before the united nations general 
assembly last december will be conducted in two phases and will be 
completed by the end of next year 
the soviet leadership also has determined not to modernize 
shortrange tactical nuclear weapons in eastern europe and will 
destroy the existing soviet stockpile of chemical weapons kokoshin 
said he did not say whether the soviets have stopped production of 
such weapons 
kokoshin said that in addition to removing 40 ships from the 
pacific fleet between 1984 and 1988 his government has changed the 
nature of fleet maneuvers keeping exercises closer to soviet shores 
to protect assets on the coastline 
a wellplaced congressional source said the committee was briefed 
by representatives of the central intelligence agency earlier this 
week and given information not inconsistent with the details of 
kokoshins testimony on soviet unilateral reductions 
the agency agrees said the source who asked not to be 
identified by name 
kokoshin said the cuts ordered by gorbachev in soviet and warsaw 
pact forces will be made in two stages 
this year he said two tank divisions and all their equipment 
will be pulled out of east germany 
in 1990 he added an additional two tank divisions and assault 
landing brigade will be withdrawn 
two other tank divisions will be withdrawn one from 
czechoslovakia and one from hungary on a time schedule to be 
announced the soviet witness said 
additionally remaining motor rifle divisions will have 40 
percent fewer tanks than at present and remaining tank divisions 
will have 20 percent fewer he said 
overall 10000 tanks are to be removed 5000 to be crushed and 
destroyed and 5000 to be refitted for training purposes or 
converted to civilian purposes such as removing train wrecks he 
said 
he said the remaining soviet units in eastern europe will be 
provided with additional antitank and shortrange antiaircraft 
weapons and mining equipment together with engineering forces for 
defensive purposes 
twentyfour missile launchers also will be removed from east 
germany he said 
kokoshin said senior soviet military commanders especially in 
the red army initially opposed the reductions but were persuaded by 
wellprepared analytical studies 
military establishments tend to be pretty conservative he 
said but they started catching up and they are catching up pretty 
quickly 
he said the nuclear parity his country has reached with the 
united states was a factor in convincing soviet commanders that 
reductions in western europe were an acceptable risk 
with a frankness that would have been highly unlikely in an 
earlier era of soviet history especially in such a setting 
kokoshin said excessive military spending drained the soviet 
economy contributed to a lower living standard than that in the 
west and prevented the kremlin from addressing such pressing issues 
as fighting damage to the environment 
we spent excessively he said there is a lot of fatwe 
frightened the western side by doing a little more than we needed 
now is the time to go in the other direction 
kokoshin said soviet officials initially regarded former 
president reagans strategic defense initiative as an american 
attempt to achieve nuclear superiority and waged an excessive 
propaganda war against it 
it was less the fault of the specialists than it was of the 
propaganda machine the media people he said 
now we are more confident about our capability to cope with 
this threat he said ticking off a list of countermeasures such 
as the massive use of decoys the deployment of many more missiles 
and the use of radio and electronic warfare 
but he said that even though soviet officials believe they can 
cope with a fully deployed american sdi system the strategic 
balance in such an event would be less stable than it is now

president bush today named house republican 
whip richard cheney of wyoming as secretary of defense to replace 
john tower whose nomination was rejected thursday by the senate 
bush hailed the sixtermn congressman as a widely respected man 
of principle who has served the country with distinction 
cheney 48 was chief of the white house staff during the 
administration of president ford and has served in the house since 
1978 he is the no 2 republican in the chamber 
tower was an acknowledged expert in defense matters cheney by 
contrast said he was versant in many important areas but had much 
to learn obviously there are areas ill have to work hard to 
master but i feel i have a depth of understanding now 
bush made no direct reference to the tower saga which ended on 
the senate floor 24 hours before todays announcement as he 
presented his choice but he said look thats history when 
asked later about it 
as of today dick cheney is the best and proper choice to 
head the pentagon the president said 
cheney made a reference of his own to towers defeast 
obviously things have moved very quickly in the last 24 
hours cheney said in referring to bushs swift overnight search 
for a replacement candidate 
cheney said he underwent heart bypass surgery last august but 
returned to work three weeks later he also sustained a mild heart 
attack in 1978 
he said he had checked with his doctor before accepting bushs 
offer of the appointment and was assured his health posed no 
barrier 
bush thus moved to put the tower defat behind him swiftly 
the tower vote was a major defeat for the new republican 
president and left bitterness in its wake 
never in all my years in the senate have i encountered anything 
like the feeling of outrage that exists today among my former 
republican senate colleagues vice president dan quayle said in a 
speech today in indianapolis never have i encountered such anger 
and bitterness in the senate chamber 
quayle accused towers critics of engaging in a mccarthyite 
mudslinging campaign that he said had degraded the senate 
the naming of a new candidate for defense secretary gains added 
urgency in light of evidence the pentagon is close to bureaucratic 
paralysis because of the time lost in the bruising battle over tower 
decisions need to be made across the pentagon including the 
staffing of key positions bushs plan to cut almost 64 billion 
from the pentagon budget and on a special 90day strategic military 
policy review the president has set in motion 
in a statement he read minutes after the senate vote tower said 
i will be recorded as the first cabinet nominee in the history of 
the republic to be rejected in the first 90 days of a presidency and 
perhaps be harshly judged 
but i depart from this place at peace with myself knowing that 
i have given a full measure of devotion to my country he 
continued no public figure in my memory has been subjected to 
such a farreaching and thorough investigation nor had his human 
foibles bared to such intensive and demeaning public scrutiny 
in the senate democratic leaders turned to damage control to 
limit the impact of towers rejection on the bipartisan spirit that 
seemed about to bloom in the days immediately after bushs 
inauguration 
but many republicans said the bitterness would linger 
dole had much to say condemning a confirmation process he said 
had become a hotbed of character assassination and a pitched 
partisan battle 
the partisan taste of this debate is going to linger said 
sen robert kasten rwis this is going to make it damn tough for 
us to act in much of a bipartisan manner in the months ahead 
bipartisanship is not going to be automatically restored unless 
the majority wants it restored said sen ted stevens ralaska 
but senate majority leader george mitchell of maine voiced the 
optimistic view of many senior democrats when he said there will 
be no longterm adverse effects within the senate 
we must work together in the future because the national 
interest compels us to do so he said i know it is difficult 
now in the heat and anger of the moment but that is precisely what 
i ask of my colleagues 
sen john danforth rmo who said he feared the scrap over 
tower might mark the first battle in an allout war between 
congress and the president said he had been reassured by 
mitchells words 
but words are cheap and the continuing effect of the vote 
remains to be seen he said 
some republicans disagreed with their angry gop colleagues 
i feel a spirit of reconciliation already coming over the 
senate said sen john warner of virginia the ranking gop member 
of the senate armed services committee 
quayle who had stood ready to break a tie in towers favor as 
the vote was taken was also more conciliatory than many republicans 
we have a job ahead of us quayle said we have an agenda 
ahead of us and were going to need the help and cooperation of the 
democratic congress 
many democrats echoed mitchells attempts to get the 
congressional train back on track 
the importance of this vote has been exaggerated out of all 
proportion said sen david boren dokla it is important that 
we now put the tower controversy behind us and get back to work 
sen carl levin dmich added this was one vote on one 
person on one job under one set of circumstances 
the senates most senior democrat robert c byrd of west 
virginia said he believes the senate fulfilled its role under the 
constitution to refuse to be a rubber stamp for any president new 
or otherwise 
these things come and go like storms which sweep out to sea 
and then the sun comes out again he said

the soviets have said their planned military cuts 
include the reduction of up to 20000 troops based in the leningrad 
military district which includes the kola peninsula norways 
ambassador said friday 
ambassador olav buchertjohannessen said soviet defense ministry 
officials disclosed the plans in a meeting with a norwegian 
parliamentary delegation visiting moscow the cuts are part of a 
500000man cut in soviet armed forces announced by president 
mikhail s gorbachev in december 
buchertjohannessen said the norwegian officials were told up 
to 20000 troops would be cut in the leningrad military district 
which equals 15 percent to 20 percent of the forces 
such a unilateral step as this we consider very positive 
buchertjohannessen said norway is a us ally and member of the 
north atlantci treaty organization 
the leningrad military district is part of what the soviets refer 
to as the northwestern theater of military operations 
the pentagons 1988 assessment of soviet military might says the 
soviets have 12 divisions 1350 tanks 3750 armored personnel 
carriers and infantry fighting vehicles 2100 artillery units 90 
tactical submarines and 160 tactical aircraft in the northwestern 
theater 
buchertjohannessen said the soviet military officials told the 
norwegian lawmakers that they were still considering exactly how 
many troops will be cut and from which divisions 
gorbachev has said his country will cut its armed forces by a 
half million men over the next two years 240000 of them from the 
european theater

the b2 stealth bomber unveiled last fall 
after more than a decade of secret work will not fly for the first 
time before late spring or summer the air force said friday 
acknowledging recent reports that the schedule for the first 
flight was in jeopardy the service said that because of an 
aggregation of minor system checkout problems the b2s first 
flight is now expected to be in the late spring or early summer time 
frame 
routine systems checkout of the first b2 advanced technology 
bomber is continuing the air force added after first 
flight the b2 will undergo extensive testing at edwards air force 
base calif 
when the air force made its first announcement last summer about 
an unveiling for the unusual flying wing plane it confidently 
predicted the aircraft would be ready for its first flight in the 
fall of 1988 
the plane was ultimately shown to the public for the first time 
nov 22 at an air force plant in palmdale calif 
air force and pentagon officials said at the time they were not 
going to rush the initial checkouts of the sophisticated flight 
systems but that they still expected the plane to fly before the 
end of the year 
maj pat mullaney an air force spokesman said friday the 
problems encountered by technicians all had been relatively minor 
but that it took time to prepare a plane for its first flight 
we have said all along that were going to fly this airplane 
when its ready and not according to some calendar schedule said 
mullaney 
the spokesman added the air force decided to release fridays 
statement after encountering a problem with the bombers 
environmental control or air conditioning system within the 
past week or so 
a component of that system failed during a highpressure test 
mullaney said even though the system was purposely overloaded 50 
percent beyond its design limit at the time the air force decided 
to fix the component to ensure an extra margin of safety 
the fix for that is straightforward and corrective action is 
underway he said 
the disclosure of checkout problems comes three months after the 
air force announced the b2 would carry a price tag including 
research and development costs of 516 million per plane that 
will make it the most expensive airplane ever 
according to the latest air force estimate the design 
development and construction of 132 planes will cost 681 billion 
by the time production ends in mid1995 even if research and 
development expenses are excluded each plane still will cost 305 
million to produce on the assembly line 
the b2 built primarily by northrop corp resembles a huge 
tailless manta ray with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into 
rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side 
the stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be almost 
invisible to enemy radar due to the extensive use of exotic 
composite materials some of which absorb rather than reflect radar 
waves its lack of sharp surface angles and a crosssection that 
offers a very small profile to radar 
the plane is a flying wing a design resurrected from the 
1940s that steers with flaps on the rear of the wings rather than 
with a tail the b2 is described as an allaltitude penetration 
bomber as opposed to the b1 bomber which is designed to penetrate 
enemy air defenses at low altitudes 
the air force says the plane is 69 feet long about the length of 
an f16 fighter plane its wingspan at 172 feet is almost as wide 
as the aging b52

green he said it looked like a picture of hell the ground 
itself was covered by a rolling black smoke i was told the area 
would be destroyed but i didnt know the meaning of an atomic 
bomb

the rev jerry falwell told the 2000 
employees of his religious empire friday that they are expected to 
join his church and donate 10 percent of their salaries to it 
if this is something you in your heart cant do it would be 
better for you to not be a member of this team rather than be 
forced to serve god here falwell told employees of liberty 
university oldtime gospel hour lynchburg christian academy 
liberty godparent home liberty broadcasting network and thomas road 
baptist church 
about 400 of the workers are employed by liberty university and 
liberty christian academy where they sign contracts calling for 
church membership and tithing falwell spokesman mark demoss said 
other workers have for years been expected to comply by the rules of 
a policy book that also calls for church attendance and tithing he 
said 
falwell asked employees who do not comply by the rules to quit by 
july 1 but demoss said the ministry will trust workers to comply on 
their own 
were not talking about gestapo methods said falwell but 
we cannot move ahead without getting our camps together i felt 
the need to once again verbalize the vision 
some workers will be exempted from the requirements demoss said 
exempted workers would include for example teachers who are 
pastors of their own churches or longtime lynchburg residents who 
have been members of other churches the spokesman said 
workers leaving the 45minute meeting at thomas road baptist 
church were divided in their opinions on falwells stand 
oldtime gospel hour employee dana williams told wsettv she 
would quit this is morally and spiritually wrong im just as 
good of a christian as anyone here and i tithe to my regular 
church 
thomas road baptist church employee glenn reese countered i 
think jerry falwell was only reemphasizing his vision and the 
vision of the bible in bringing church workers together 
the ministrys payroll is 35 million and if each worker paid 10 
percent that would equal the thomas road churchs annual budget of 
35 million falwell said 
demoss said there was no significance to the timing of falwells 
meeting which came shortly falwell firmed up plans for a 30 
million 10000seat church to be built near the liberty university 
campus by 1991 
when our fiscal year ends on june 30 the total revenue will 
exceed last years receipts by nearly 40 million for a total of 
about 129 million compared with under 88 million a year ago 
demoss said 
falwells meeting with the local employees also was part of his 
longterm plan to get out of the national spotlight and concentrate 
more on his local ministry demoss said after falwell assumed 
control of ptl and then left it a short time later in 1987 he said 
he would try to spend more time working as a local preacher

a commission appointed by president bush to 
study government ethics friday proposed banning all honoraria and 
limiting income that lawmakers and senior officials earn outside 
their jobs 
malcolm r wilkey chairman of the commission on federal ethics 
law reform urged president bush to incorporate as many of the 
panels recommendations as possible into an executive order that 
would apply to senior government officials 
laws alone of course wont do the job what is needed is a 
spirit of ethics and morality in the government said wilkey a 
former federal appellate judge who has served since 1985 as us 
ambassador to uruguay 
there must be a will to form maintain and operate an ethical 
government that leadership must come from the top in each branch 
wilkey added 
the president the cabinet officers the heads of independent 
agencies wilkey said must emphasize ethics and lead by 
example 
the eightmember commission issued a 150page report detailing 27 
recommendations for changes in ethics laws and regulations as they 
apply to senior government officials members of congress and their 
staffs as well as judges 
the commission which adopted its findings in public sessions 
over the last month recommended 
an outright ban on fees that government officials lawmakers 
and judges are paid to give speeches 
limiting the outside income an official could earn but not 
setting amy specific percentage the commission recommended the 
limit be toward the lower end of a range between the 15 percent cap 
that now applies to executive branch employees and the 40 percent 
limit on the income of us senators 
the president would have the right to exempt certain types of 
income such as royalties for writing books or any activity that 
doesnt conflict with government service 
giving people entering government a chance to defer paying the 
capital gains tax on stock divestitures made to avoid conflicts of 
interest before assuming office 
extending the law that bars officials from taking action that 
conflicts with their financial interest to judges and congressional 
staffers but not lawmakers 
putting lawmakers and judges under the same oneyear ban that 
now prohibits former senior government officials from contacting 
their former agency about particular issues they were involved in 
that the congress create a twoyear bar on former officials 
disclosing certain proprietary or strategic information gained 
during government service to private clients this would include 
strategy on international trade and arms negotiations as well as 
certain financial data 
change the reporting rules to require that officials disclose 
all assets worth more than 1 million and income of more than 
250000 a year wilkey these changes in categories would be more 
meaningful the report also will require officials to disclose 
mortgages and private debts to relatives 
we feel that debts and liabilities pose more danger of 
influencing the employee than small amounts of stock wilkey said 
the recommendations were immediately criticized in a statement by 
fred wertheimer the president of common cause the ethics 
commissions principal failure comes with regard to the executive 
branch where its recommendations for the most part represent a 
combination of preserving the status quo backtracking on existing 
requirements or ducking 
former attorney general griffin bell the panels vice chairman 
disagreed saying i think its very tough the test of it will be 
how much of it is adopted 
other members of the panel were jan baron judith h bellow 
lloyd cutler fred fielding former sen harrison schmitt dnm

the government is losing millions of dollars on 
federal land sales because it hasnt modernized a 115yearold law 
that allows real estate speculators to buy federal property at less 
than bargainbasement rates says a new general accounting office 
report 
rep nick rahall dwva said loopholes in the mining law of 
1872 have enabled developers to purchase federal land near gambling 
casinos and ski resorts at fire sale prices 
rahall chairman of the house subcommittee on mining said he 
plans to offer legislation to modernize the law so that it will do 
what it is supposed to do promote mineral exploration 
the gao report released this week and requested by rahall shows 
that the government received less that 4500 for land estimated to 
be worth up to 48 million 
the report also said the gao reviewed 12 pending applications for 
public land appraised at about 47 million that would be sold for 
only 16000 
the intent of the mining law is to facilitate mineral 
extraction not to serve as a vehicle for land speculation and 
profiteering at the publics expense said rahall 
under the law enacted when ulysses s grant was president 
claims to valuable deposits of minerals such as gold and silver on 
public lands could be patented for 250 an acre 
the patent transfers title to the land from the federal 
government to the private claim holder about 32 million acres of 
public land have been sold in this way the gao report said 
land covered by the act and near resort areas expanding 
communities and tourist attractions has been particularly 
attractive to developers who have no plans for mining 
interior secretary manuel lujan said wednesday he believes the 
law should be changed to bring the prices for the land into line 
with modern times he said that as long as the law mandates 250 an 
acre thats what the interior department must use as the cost 
these federal lands are owned by all of the people and should 
be held as a public trust said rahall we are being done a 
grave injustice by these giveaways and this law must be changed 
land covered by the mining law is in 12 states montana wyoming 
colorado new mexico arizona nevada utah idaho washington 
oregon california and alaska 
the gao gave several examples of valuable land going for cheap 
prices 
a 160acre claim near the keystone colo ski resort that was 
sold for 400 by the government in 1983 under the mining act was 
never mined the buyer offered 44 acres of the claim for sale last 
year at 484000 
an application was filed in 1987 for 1280 acres near lake mead 
within three miles of nine gambling casinos in laughlin nev if 
patented at the 250 an acre rate the land will produce 3200 for 
the government while according to a local real estate agent 
private interests could get between 256 million and 32 million

a senior vatican theologian condemned divorce 
and contraceptive practices in the united states in a speech friday 
that targeted planned parenthood feminism and the entertainment 
industry especially the tv series dallas 
cardinal eduard gagnon president of the pontifical council for 
the family told us roman catholic bishops it was crucial that 
americans follow church teaching on sexuality since they influenced 
europe and the developing world 
during the meeting with the us catholic hierarchy italian 
cardinal achille silvestrini also criticized us marriage 
tribunals saying their methods apparently were not fully in 
conformity with church law 
the vatican officials spoke on the third day of an extraordinary 
fourday meeting called by pope john paul ii to discuss the 52 
million american catholics one of his largest wealthiest and most 
powerful flocks 
fridays discussion reflected concern in the vatican about the 
many us catholics who dissent from church teachings on birth 
control divorce and other issues 
gagnon told the 35 american prelates gathered in the underground 
stone old synod hall that the vatican also was concerned about 
homosexuality the use of sterilization by american catholicsm and 
feminism which he said has a deleterious influence on the 
family 
he said theologians were increasingly recognizing the social 
and moral disaster a contraceptive mentality can lead to 
a particular challenge he said was presented by planned 
parenthoods efforts to set up schoolbased birth control clinics 
planned parenthood programs of sex education in no way resolve 
the problem of teenage pregnancies but rather increase it by 
encouraging promiscuity he declared 
he also accused the organization of trying to undermine catholic 
teaching that the only permissible birth control method is natural 
family planning in which a couple abstains from sex during the 
womans fertile period 
in chicago the acting president of the planned parenthood 
federation of america david j andrews said gagnon is absolutely 
right in suggesting that the group opposes the churchs position 
on birth control 
andrews said gagnons speech reflects the desperation of a 
church trying to come to grips with the issue of sexuality and with 
the fact that people the world over rely on effective methods of 
birth control and want to keep abortion services safe and legal 
archbishop john quinn of san francisco made no mention of 
artificial birth control in a companion speech to the family 
but talking to journalists later cardinal john oconnor of new 
york said it is time for us to teach all over again the churchs 
position on contraception i find catholics sick of 
contraception 
an estimated 70 percent of american catholics use artificial 
birth control and us catholic bishops suggested in a draft 
pastoral letter in april that the church should be more responsive 
toward them 
the rev john lynch secretary of the us national conference of 
bishops said no us bishop criticized vatican policies during 
discussions friday 
he said several of them noted a high level of acceptance of 
catholic social teaching but not the same level for the churchs 
moral teachings 
gagnon also urged the bishops to increase their vigilance over 
catholic marriage tribunals and said some forms of us ministry to 
divorced catholics had degenerated into dating services 
he warned too many annulments could support the prevalent 
divorce mentality that conflicted with catholic belief in lifelong 
commitment 
speaking after gagnon silvestrini said that of 45632 annulments 
granted worldwide in 1985 36180 were in the united states 
several us bishops defended their tribunals as careful and 
hardworking archbishop roger mahony of los angeles also said that 
vatican statistics did not include the many annulment cases which 
courts refused to hear 
he said that in his diocese last year the courts accepted 1000 
cases but refused to consider 13000 
gagnon told the us prelates that catholics around the world 
looked to their leadership in the fight against abortion and the 
spread of pornography 
specifically he said the bishops should do something about 
more subtle pornography that is the degrading of moral values 
vehicled by cinema and tv shows which pretend to depict normal 
american life 
singling out the tv series dallas known for its potrayal 
of adultery greed and cruelty gagnon said bishops in other 
countries would like us to reflect on what we export can do to the 
conscience of their people

the global warming trend known as the 
greenhouse effect is not yet a confirmed scientific fact but us 
energy policy ought to proceed as if it is an energy department 
official said friday 
i dont think we ought to get bogged down too much right now in 
a public discussion of scientific aspects of the greenhouse 
effect said donna fitzpatrick undersecretary of energy it 
seems to me there is plenty of room for public money and public 
energy to put into things we should be doing anyway 
ms fitzpatrick appeared on a panel on environmental problems at 
a convention sponsored by the consumer federation of america she 
argued there is no undisputed and settled consensus in the 
scientific community about whether the greenhouse effect is 
occuring which she called an open question 
the greenhouse effect is the predicted warming of the earth by 
increasing amounts of heat trapped by manmade gases like carbon 
dioxide which are produced by the burning of fossil fuels 
scientists generally agree the earth has warmed about 09 degrees 
fahrenheit over the last century which most of them attribute to 
the buildup of these gases 
ms fitzpatrick said the temperature buildup doesnt match what 
we should have seen because of the greenhouse effect since there 
was a pronounced cooling trend in the 1950s 1960s and 1970s 
in any case she sketched some policy priorities which she said 
the most fervent environmentalists and believers in the greenhouse 
effect could agree with energy efficiency switching to 
technologies which dont require the use of fossil fuels such as 
renewable technologies which are now just beginning to have the 
reliability and economy we need and one that environmentalists 
generally oppose improved nuclear power 
we need to do these things anyway we should do them we should 
not be wasting energy being inefficient in its use even if we 
didnt think we have a greenhouse effect and because use of fossil 
fuels has other environmental hazards besides the greenhouse 
effect she said 
among those hazards which she did not spell out can be the 
pollutants that form acid rain 
her companion on the panel was james mackenzie a researcher at 
the world resources institute an environmental policy research 
organization that has argued vigorously that the greenhouse effect 
is in progress 
according to the national academy of sciences which reported 
to president bush as soon as he took over the greenhouse effect is 
the bestunderstood problem in atmospheric science mackenzie said 
the uncertainties are timing and the impact of when these 
effects are going to happen there is no uncertainty these gases are 
building up in the atmosphere and that they trap radiative heat 
mackenzie endorsed an efficiencyfirst strategy 
the fact is the most readily available source now is 
efficiency which we could tap in our buildings we are not doing 
that he said 
there are several major studies being completed which show 
electricity growth could be held to zero for several decades through 
the use of more efficent lighting and motors at far less than the 
cost of producing new power plants the problem is in our 
institutions its not in our technology the stuff is available 
he said 
academy panels have predicted an average warming of three to 
eight degrees sometime in the middle of the next century some 
computer models say this warming could occur as early as 2030 
others say as late as 2080 
ms fitzpatrick was assistant secretary for conservation and 
renewable energy sources before last august when she became 
undersecretary the no 3 position in the department

once again the white house summoned at a moment 
of stress and once again dick cheney answered the call 
first it was president ford who needed all the help he could get 
to manage his accidental presidency he brought the softspoken 
scholarly but aggressive cheney to his side as white house chief of 
staff in 1974 
on friday it was president bushs turn burned by the senates 
rejection of john g tower as defense secretary bush summoned 
cheney as his nominee to head the pentagon 
in picking the sixterm congressman bush selected someone with a 
reputation as a republican with a future someone it was said who 
was bound if he stayed in the house eventually to become the house 
republican leader and if the gop gained control to become speaker 
cheney 48 served ford first as a deputy assistant than as 
chief of staff he went back to his native wyoming after ford 
narrowly lost his bid for a full term in the presidency he ran for 
congress in 1978 against a tough republican challenger in the 
primary and easily won election as the states congressman at large 
he has been reelected ever since by healthy margins 
cheney suffered a mild heart attack in that first race for the 
house last august he underwent heart bypass surgery 
the first question put to cheney when bush introduced him friday 
as his nominee was whether his health was up to the strain of 
running the huge pentagon bureaucracy he said it was 
he said he had been back at work three weeks after the bypass 
operation and that he had skiied at vail colo last christmas he 
said he checked with his cardiologist before accepting bushs offer 
and his doctor said there was no medical reason why he couldnt take 
the job 
bush praised cheney as someone who had struggled with a budget 
become familiar with defense issues as a member of the house 
intelligence committee knew the topics of arms control strategic

the european community commission on friday 
urged the united states to adopt the european production standard 
for highdefinition television saying the ecs approach would be 
better for consumers and the tv industry than a competing us 
proposal 
the commissions washington delegation sent a letter outlining 
the ecs approach and criteria for a worldwide hdtv production 
standard to the state and commerce departments 
the commission said the european standard has been shown to be 
feasible and the best for producers broadcasters the tv industry 
and the consumer in this regard the commission seeks the support 
and cooperation of the united states government 
the europeans are proposing that the next generation of 
television which promises wallsized tv screens with the clarity 
of 35 mm film use a world production standard of 1250 
sequentially scanned lines and 50 frames per second the united 
states in 1984 proposed a 1125 line60 frame standard and since 
that time has received the backing of japan canada and mexico 
the stakes are high for the united states which fears that 
multiple standards would jeopardize overseas sales of us movies 
and tv programs 
a commerce department official said the department thinks the 
1125 line60 frame standard should in fact be reviewed 
jim spurlock spokesman for the national telecommunications and 
information administration noted that his agency recently asked the 
film and television industry to comment on the us standard

federal procedures to screen petitions for 
political asylum may be inadequate in addressing nonfrivolous 
claims filed by central american refugees in south texas according 
to a senate study 
the study also recommended more asylum petitions be granted and 
procedures be developed to help those truly deserving refugee status 
make their case as some worthy applicants it said are going 
underground because of the risks of detention and deportation 
senate staff members who visited the rio grande valley in 
february after the immigration and naturalization service began 
detaining refugeeseekers while their asylum cases were pending 
said most applications appear frivolous 
the study mission said the ins procedures in general are 
adequate but it was not convinced the small percentage of 
borderline cases known as intent to deny applicants because 
they must provide additional information or risk denial was given 
adequate opportunity to present a claim 
one important question not answered to the delegations 
satisfaction is whether these intent to deny applicants are 
informed of the specific areas of weakness or incompleteness in 
their cases the study said 
the study suggested strenthening procedures for the borderline 
cases such as outlining the reasons denial was being considered for 
applicants so they could then more meaningfully rebut their case 
in the twoweek period currently allowed 
some of the intent to deny cases reviewed by the study 
mission should have been approved the report said in urging that 
asylum officers be given wider latitude to approve cases to err 
always in favor of the applicant 
it also found a handful of central americans with promising 
asylum claims but who had no intention of risking detention and 
deportation by applying for asylum

the washington state apple industry friday 
reported an increase in sales indicating their product is popular 
despite concerns over use of a possibly hazardous chemical 
but officials for the natural resources defense council whose 
report last week said there was an increased risk of cancer for 
children who eat apples treated with alar a chemical which 
regulates the fruits growth questioned the sales figures 
i dont think you can believe those figures said janet 
hathaway an nrdc attorney and coauthor of the report intolerable 
risk pesticides in our childrens food 
ms hathaway said virtually every parent she has talked to 
recently is looking for organic sources of apples and that she has 
received phone calls from growers saying they cannot sell 
alartreated apples 
the washington apple industry which supplies about twothirds of 
the nations supermarket apples this time of year reported shipping 
a record 156 million 42pound boxes between march 2 and march 9 
said bill dewitt of the wenatchee valley traffic association 
that was up from 151 million boxes the week before and 14 
million boxes for the same period last year dewitt said 
its indicating to us that people still like apples and theyre 
still buying them said dewitt manager of the industry trade 
group that compiles shipment figures from warehouses in the state 
the apple market has not suffered nearly what we thought when 
the bad publicity came out dewitt said in a telephone interview 
alar trade name for the chemical daminozide is sprayed on apple 
trees to help the apples stay on longer improving color and 
crispness and giving farmers more time to harvest the environmental 
protection agency has said it intends to ban alar by 1990 based on 
preliminary cancer tests on mice and rats but it is still legal to 
use 
last weeks nrdc report drew widespread attention and resulted in 
some cancelled shipments new york schools stopped selling apples in 
cafeterias and a taiwan exporter cancelled an order for 5000 boxes 
of washington apples 
but the nations 20000 growers have responded with a 1 million 
public relations campaign pointing out that only a small portion of 
the crop is treated with alar and that eating apples is still safe 
the washington apple commission has said about 5 percent of the 
crop is treated with alar the nrdc disputes that putting the 
figure at over 10 percent ms hathaway said 
the shipment figures show apples that are purchased by all 
outofstate retailers exporters and other apple users dewitt said 
theyre buying them because they know they can sell them 
dewitt said 
many major retail chains and apple juice processors accept only 
alarfree apples and to the best of my knowledge thats exactly 
what we are shipping dewitt said

one of three young men charged with killing 
a convenience store clerk while they were teenagers killed himself 
friday four hours before a jury was to resume deliberating his 
guilt or innocence 
scott davis 21 on trial at guntersville on a capital murder 
charge in the 1985 killing of missy macon shot himself at his 
familys home in ragland without leaving a suicide note coroner 
charles forman said he had been free on bond since shortly after 
the killing 
his two codefendants are serving life prison terms 
davis had claimed the three honor students were playing a fantasy 
game when mrs macon was shot 
davis attorney louis wilkinson told the jury at guntersville 
where the trial was moved because of publicity in st clair county 
that davis thought his companions cayce moore and chris white were 
going to pretend to rob the store where mrs macon worked 
davis had said he did not realize it was not a game until he 
heard the shot that killed mrs macon and saw moore leave the store 
with a bottle of wine 
when i saw the wine i knew right then that something bad had 
happened because when youre 17 you cant buy wine davis said 
he really honest to god thought it was going to be something 
harmless wilkinson said 
moore was convicted in september 1987 of capital murder and 
sentenced to life without parole white later pleaded guilty to 
murder and also received a life sentence with the possibility of 
parole 
davis and moore were 17 at the time of the killing while white 
was 14 
white has testified there was no discussion of playing any 
fantasy game before he and the two other went to the store 
earlier this week davis had testified that the night of mrs 
macons killing moore asked him if he had a death wish davis said 
that in the game top secret that meant a character had gone as 
far as he could and would go against something he could not beat 
davis said he told moore he did have a death wish 
i guess i meant i wanted to play he said 
on thursday the prosecution introduced two suicide notes written 
by davis to his parents the day after mrs macons death 
mom i wish a million times that i hadnt done it davis read 
from one of the notes 
we all thought it was a dream but that dream turned into a 
nightmare killing the lady didnt bother me but being without you 
is like a living hell 
mom i knew it was wrong for us to do it it started out as a 
game 
district attorney van davis said davis knew of the plan to rob 
the store and helped plan it 
this game stuff was fabricated for one reason defense of 
murder the prosecutor said the real issue is missy macon lying 
on the floor of that convenience store in a pool of blood and that 
cash register cleaned out 
there is no reason on earth why missy macon has to be dead 
nowhere is it written that defense for a murder is that you were 
playing a game 
the prosecutor said he thought they robbed a store in ragland 
rather than somewhere they were not known because they were so 
taken in by how smart they were and by how good they were at these 
games they thought they could rob and kill anywhere and get away 
with it 
after the shooting the three drove to florida where davis said 
he and moore planned to kill themselves 
we decided we couldnt live anymore davis said they later 
decided against committing suicide and were arrested at a rest stop

president bush in a move sought by 
environmentalists moved friday to prevent the export of hazardous 
waste unless the united states has assurances the receiving country 
will handle it in an environmentally safe manner 
the president said he will seek legislation empowering the 
government to block such exports 
were determined to work with other concerned governments to 
exercise wide stewardship over our environment particularly where 
matters of health are concerned bush said in remarks at the 
swearingin ceremony for health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan 
in the case of us firms the most frequently used countries for 
hazardous waste disposal are canada and mexico an environmental 
protection agency official said the united states has agreements 
with both nations for safe handling of the material said epa 
assistant director for policy linda fisher 
ninety percent of such wastes goes to canada she said besides 
mexico the other recipient nations are brazil japan and several in 
western europe no agreements for safe disposal exist with those 
countries she said 
however all of those nations recycle the wastes so there have 
been no serious health or environment situations created by the 
disposal there she said 
the concerns addressed in bushs proposal are mostly 
futuristic to provide a preventative mechanism she said 
environmentalists have raised concerns that some countries 
particularly in the developing world do not regulate disposal and 
handling of such wastes in an environmentally safe manner 
bush said the legislation he will send to congress will give 
the us government the authority to ban all exports of hazardous 
waste except where we have an agreement with the receiving country 
providing for the safe handling and management of those wastes

a southern illinois university student 
placed racist jokes in the universitys computer system using 
another students access code and the list later turned up in a 
kindergarten class school officials said friday 
although the university per se did not have any direct 
involvement the individuals represent the university and we simply 
cannot condone this matter siu president john guyon said 
he did not identify the students involved but said the university 
was considering disciplinary action the jokes were directed 
primarily at blacks 
the president of the local naacp chapter nathaniel felder who 
also is director of planning and computing for the university 
system said he was pleased that siu took the matter seriously 
blacks make up about 10 percent of the 24227member student body at 
siucarbondale 
other than that felder said i cant comment on the 
university report 
siu learned of the problem in december when a 5yearold black 
boy took home used university computer printouts that had been given 
to his kindergarten class for use as scratch paper 
one month later the same child took home another siu printout 
that was part of the same joke list his mother then contacted the 
naacp which urged the university to investigate 
guyon appointed a committee jan 16 to investigate and its 
report released friday concluded that an undergraduate student put 
the joke file about 30 pages long into the universitys computer 
system sometime last fall 
the file was printed in november in the campus central computer 
facility and the printout apparently was discarded the report said 
a graduate student working at glendale school where the child is 
enrolled delivered the computer paper to the school to be used as 
scratch paper university officials said 
the committee finds no intentional connection between the use 
of the universitys computing system and the childs receipt of the 
paper on which the offensive material was printed the report said 
but it said the student who placed the file in the universitys 
system used another students access code and later demonstrated 
little remorse or concern 
the report recommended that guyon review procedures for obtaining 
access to university computers and decide whether the students 
involved should be disciplined 
the committee sincerely regrets that a child and his family 
were subjected to offensive materials that were reproduced on 
university facilities the report said

fbi director william sessions said friday that 
semiautomatic assault weapons have a very destructive impact on 
american society and the people but declined to say whether they 
should be outlawed 
in the strongest statement yet from a bush administration 
official about the weapons sessions echoed concerns expressed by 
state and local law enforcement following the jan 17 fatal 
shootings of five california children with a sovietstyle ak47 
rifle 
the presence of these weapons does have a very destructive 
impact on american society and the people sessions told reporters 
tragedy after tragedy flows from it sessions said people 
and law enforcement officers are victims of these crimes 
i am sorry we are outgunned and outmanned in that respect 
the director said 
but sessions would not say whether he agreed with other law 
enforcement officials who are calling for a ban on the weapons 
its not my responsiblity to make that kind of decision 
sessions said thats a political debate i will not participate 
in 
president bush has resisted calls for outlawing the weapons many 
of which can be altered to become automatic rifles such as the 
weapon a man used to spray more than 100 rounds of ammunition 
outside an elementary school in stockton calif 
the president however said earlier this week that he wanted to 
find a method of preventing the criminal use of the weapons while 
doing whats right by the legitimate sportsman 
bush a member of the national rifle association said he had 
asked william bennett picked by the president to direct the 
nations war on drugs to study the proliferation of assault weapons 
sessions meanwhile defended the fbis background investigation 
of john tower during the former texas senators unsuccessful bid to 
win senate confirmation as defense secretary 
the lengthy investigation of tower prompted criticism by some 
senators that the fbi was conveying unsupported rumors and 
allegations about the former republican senator 
towers drinking habits relationships with women and financial 
ties were criticized during the debate leading up to thursdays 
5347 senate vote to reject the nominee 
but sessions who removed himself from the tower investigation 
because of past political ties said the bureau carried out its 
function in this case as im sure it did in hundreds of other 
cases 
we have had absolutely no criticism at all concerning the 
conduct of the investigation from the white house sessions said 
adding that he saw no need to change at all the fbis procedures 
for conducting such background checks 
floyd clarke the bureaus director of investigations said the 
fbi carefully tries to verify any derogatory allegations made about 
a nominee 
later in the day attorney general dick thornburgh also defended 
the fbi saying the criticism results from a misunderstanding of 
what the role of the federal bureau of investigation is in carrying 
out background checks 
it is not the job of the federal bureau of investigation to 
make judgmenets about the individuals nominated for government 
posts thornburgh said it is their job to gather information 
no one to my knowledge has any quarrel with the accuracy of the 
job thats been done by the fbi thornburgh said 
responding to reports of friction with the attorney general 
sessions said he enjoyed a direct cordial relationship with the 
thornburgh 
but sessions said he had stopped holding informal breakfast 
meetings with members of congress the attorney general who has 
told officials the justice department will speak with one voice

federal appellate judgeship were as much a surprise to me as 
anyone

the jury in the fawaz younis sky piracy trial 
began deliberations friday under instructions from the judge that 
undercut the defendants argument that he was acting under militia 
orders when he hijacked a plane in beirut 
orders to hijack a plane are illegal orders us 
district judge aubrey e robinson jr told jurors obedience to 
illegal orders is no defense 
the judge said that only if younis did not know that hijacking 
was illegal should he be acquitted 
the jury deliberated for about for hours deliberations will 
resume monday 
younis was on the stand for two days in the nineday trial 
testifying that the military commander of lebanons amal militia 
aqil hamiyya ordered him to lead four other heavily armed men in 
the hijacking of royal jordanian airlines flight 402 on june 11 
1985 
under crossexamination younis has testified that he knew that 
hijacking was illegal in peacetime and that amal was not at war 
with royal jordanian airlines the government of jordan the two 
americans aboard the aircraft or any of the other 70 passengers and 
crew members 
he did not attempt to refute testimony by five eyewitnesses who 
pointed him out in the courtroom as the leader in the hijacking 
defense attorney frank d carter sought to persuade the jury that 
younis acted as he did because he was a victim of the civil war that 
has engulfed lebanon since 1975 
younis now 30 was arrested on sept 13 1987 by members of the 
fbi hostage rescue team who working closely with the us military 
and intelligence agencies lured him aboard a yacht in international 
waters in the mediterranean sea 
the case is viewed as a test of a 1984 longarm statute that 
asserts us jurisdiction over cases involving american hostages 
taken abroad 
the counts against younis and the maximum possible sentences for 
each are hostage taking life in prison aircraft piracy 20 
years performing acts of violence against individuals 20 years 
destruction of a civilian aircraft 20 years carrying aboard an 
aircraft devices likely to endanger its safety 20 years and 
conspiracy to commit a hijacking five years

cheney thank you very much mr president 
obviously things have moved rather rapidly in the last 24 hours 
i am honored to be asked by the president to join his 
administration 
i look forward very much to working with him and especially also 
with brent scowcroft whos an old friend of many years standing 
and with jim baker whos an old friend of many years standing in 
the difficult assignment ahead 
and i think the next four years hold significant challenge in 
terms of us defense policy and foreign policy and i am glad to be 
a part of the team and eager to get to work in terms of helping the 
president address some of those very important issues 
q congressman two questions first could you give us an update 
on your health and also what can you tell us about the depth of 
the expertise you feel you have on defense 
cheney well first of all with respect to my health i have in 
the past been a heart patient 
many of you know i underwent bypass surgery in august of last 
year 
i was after that surgery back at work in about three weeks 
i skied at christmastime at vail if anybodys curious and 
skiing was very good at vail at christmastime 
and i talked just this afternoon with my cardiologist who has 
followed my case for several years and to make certain he was aware 
of this and so that he would be in a position to say as he has 
as he did tell me just today that theres absolutely no medical 
reason why i cannot undertake this assignment 
i have no restrictions at this point in terms of my own 
activities 
with respect to my background in the defense area its an issue 
that ive a set of issues that ive been interested in for a long 
time obviously had some exposure to them during the ford years when 
i served as white house chief of staff and sat in on all the 
national security council meetings 
ive had an active interest in it in the congress and currently 
serve as the senior republican on the budget subcommittee of the 
intelligence committee which authorizes all of our intelligence 
programs and the activities of many defense agencies such as the 
national security agency defense intelligence agency all of the 
tactical intelligence programs across all the services in the 
pentagon 
so obviously there are areas that i need to know and that ill 
have to work hard on to master but i feel that i do have a depth of 
understanding now in very specific areas that come within the 
general jurisdiction of the defense department and national security 
in general 
q mr president 
q mr president 
bush helen and then terry or am i getting out of protocol

as defense secretary won bipartisan applause friday from 
congressional colleagues of the wyoming republican 
hes a very able and impressive person said sen tim wirth 
dcolo hes one of the smartest people in congress 
an excellent choice said sen charles robb the freshman 
from virginia who was one of the last democrats to announce his 
opposition to john tower whom the senate had refused to confirm as 
defense secretary thursday 
sen sam nunn dga the armed services committee chairman who 
led the democrats fight against tower issued a joint statement 
with sen john warner of virginia the committees senior 
republican that said 
dick cheney is well known and highly respected by the members 
of the senate we have worked with him on many issues involving 
national defense and intelligence matters 
nunn and warner said that at bushs request the committee would 
open hearings on the nomination next week 
nunn speaking to reporters in philadelphia said i know of no 
impediment to his nomination 
and warner said he found cheneys choice a wonderful perfect 
nomination 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine said he was 
pleased that president bush has moved quickly and added that 
cheney has served with distinction in the us house of 
representatives since 1978 
senate republican leader bob dole quickly hailed the appointment 
in a barbed comment that reflected the bitterness lingering from the 
tower confirmation struggle 
hes tough thats what we wanted a tough tough tough guy 
he said of cheney this time it will be a confirmation not an 
execution 
praise for cheney a sixterm congressman and the no 2 
republican in the house cut widely across party lines with both 
democrats and republicans bruised by the lengthy battle over tower 
indicating they hope cheney will be quickly confirmed 
house majority leader tom foley called the appointement 
splendid and added i would predict an early and unanimous 
confirmation 
its a very fine selection said rep charles bennett 
dfla a member of the house armed services committee 
sen albert gore jr dtenn another member of the senate 
committee that will consider cheneys confirmation had high praise 
as well but said he would not give final judgement until hearings 
are held 
i know of no reason why it wouldnt be unanimous but i want to 
reserve judgment said gore 
i like him a lot he said i served with him in the house 
while i am going to reserve final judgment particularly as a 
member of the committee i know of no reason at this point not to 
accept speedy confirmation 
but the initial reaction from those who have known cheney was 
that bush had made a shrewd choice 
dick cheney is a close friend and colleague said sen john 
mccain rariz a member of the senate armed services committee and 
one of the strongest supporters of tower 
i have the greatest respect for his broad range of experience 
and knowledge said mccain i look favorably on this nomination 
and hope that he will be confirmed expeditiously 
few people in washington understand the executive and 
legislative branches of government as well as dick cheney said 
rep tony coelho of california the house democratic whip this is 
a smart move on the part of the president but a great move on behalf 
of the country 
and sen gordon humphrey rnh one of the most conservative 
members of the senate said on first glance it looks like a very 
good appointment he has long experience in congress and the 
executive branch he appears to have a very solid record on defense 
issues 
bill greener a former air force colonel and the pentagons chief 
spokesman during the ford administration when cheney was white 
house chief of staff said friday the congressman was a perfect 
choice 
there should be loud cheers in washington greener said 
hes a great manager he is a quick learner with an absolute 
amazing mentality and hes always been a strong defense person 
hes also very open and easy going hes a perfect choice

equivalent of the antinato greens formed a government friday that 
pledges to reduce allied military control of the city and curb 
police action against street protest 
the coalition agreement between the social democrats and the 
farleft alternative list won nearly unanimous approval friday at a 
special social democrat congress an alternative list meeting is 
scheduled for sunday 
walter momper of the social democrats is to become mayor when the 
new legislature meets next week replacing eberhard diepgen whose 
christian democrats were set back in the jan 29 city elections 
voters gave the christian democrats and social democrats 55 seats 
each in the 138member legislature and the alternative list got 17 
the farright republican party won the other 11 
chancellor helmut kohls christian democrats have been slipping 
in opinion polls and the socalled redgreen government in west 
berlin will be a major test of whether such a coalition can work 
nationally 
several polls have indicated kohls centerright coalition may 
lose the national elections in december 1990 
i think that with this redgreen coalition alternative 
policies will play a much more essential role than before in the 
city and on the federal level alternative list leader christian 
stroebele told reporters

have a ripple effect throughout west germany

women youth and family 
the party has advocated stronger environmental controls curbs on 
police restrictions on the use of motor vehicles and more 
governmentsubsidized housing 
otto schily a prominent greens member of the federal parliament 
said his party and the social democrats should study the possibility 
of a national coalition 
business spokesmen have said some companies might leave west 
berlin because of the leftist government particularly if it raises 
taxes to finance social programs 
the christian democrats had dominated city politics in recent 
years and promoted business develoment to help reduce the isolation 
of west berlin which is 90 miles inside communist east german

oliver norths former white house boss 
testified friday that james a baker iii suggested to thenpresident 
reagan in 1984 he could be impeached for allowing solicitation of 
money from other countries for the nicaraguan contras 
the suggestion by baker then reagans chief of staff and now 
president bushs secretary of state was strongly countered by 
other top officials at a meeting with reagan with the conclusion 
that baker was wrong testified former national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane 
still reagan said well all be hanging by our thumbs if word 
got out that mcfarlane or other administration officials were indeed 
seeking help from abroad at a time that congress had forbidden 
direct us aid to the contras according to minutes of the meeting 
read into the court record 
mcfarlane testifying at norths trial said reagan knew in 1984 
that arrangements had been made to get 1 million a month from saudi 
arabia for the the usbacked rebels in nicaragua 
i told the president i told adm john poindexter colonel 
north knew of it mcfarlane said 
however he testified later in the day that he himself had been 
unaware of various north activities that have been described by 
other witnesses in the trial and earlier in congressional hearings 
for example mcfarlane said he didnt know that north was 
involved in private fundraising from wealthy donors that it was 
north who decided how the money would be spent or that north was 
instrumental in setting up a southern front for the guerrillas 
fighting the nicaraguan government 
i did know north had given a number of speeches mcfarlane 
testified about the money raising 
one man who contributed to the contra cause beer magnate joseph 
coors testified briefly friday when he was finished he walked 
over to an apparently surprised north and shook his hand 
though all the witnesses so far have been called by the 
prosecution they have generally spoken highly of north with whom 
they worked in efforts to aid the contras 
mcfarlane testifying about norths military adivice and 
activities in nicaragua said 
i had been in the military for 20 years and i knew the 
activities of a single officer in setting up a southern front was 
inconsequential it did not occur to me that colonel north in 
washington not in the field 90 percent of the time could set up a 
southern front 
mcfarlane testified he instructed north to do everything he could 
to keep the rebels functioning after the united states cut off 
official aid in 1984 
he was questioned about six memos written to him by north 
between dec 4 1984 and may 31 1985 that showed norths deep 
involvement with the nicaraguan contras charges against north 
include lying to congress by saying he wasnt doing anything for the 
rebels 
the memos 
dec 4 1984 north reports the contras are in urgent need of 
antiaircraft weapons in urgent need of expertise in maritime 
operations in need of financial support munitions and training 
assistance 
feb 6 1985 north asks mcfarlane to authorize the sinking of 
a ship in the east china sea carrying arms to the sandinistas 
nothing ever came of that suggestion 
march 5 1985 north suggests ways to compensate guatemala for 
helping get arms to the contras by signing phony end user 
certificates for weapons on the witness stand mcfarlane said he 
didnt even look at the certificates 
march 16 1985 north suggests a fallback plan in case congress 
does not authorize resumption of aid to the contras including 
persuading private donors of the need to continue their funding 
for munitions after oct 1 1985 
april 11 1985 north says 245 million has been spent by the 
rebels since us aid expired in may 1984 mostly for ammunition 
and the resistance has grown from 9500 personnel in june 1984 to 
over 16000 today 
may 31 1985 north reports there are today more combatants 
actively in the field than at any time in the last 12 months 
mcfarlanes face reddened at the start of his testimony when he 
was asked by chief prosecutor john keker did you try to commit 
suicide 
yes said mcfarlane looking at the jury on feb 9 
1987 that was shortly before release of a white houseordered 
report on the irancontra affair and the beginning of congressional 
hearings 
mcfarlane told too of pleading guilty to four charges of 
withholding information from congress and of being sentenced to two 
years probation 200 hours of community service and fines of 
20000 
during a june 25 1984 discussion of allowing money to be 
solicited from other countries mcfarlane said baker suggested 
reagan could be impeached 
i recall mr baker believed that if the president were to 
authorize procuring money from third countries that that would be a 
violation of law and the president could be so charged and impeached 
removed from office mcfarlane testified 
i remember that statement and its being strongly countered the 
conclusion being that it was not true he said 
he recalled that at that meeting of the national security council 
planning group which included in its membership reagan thenvice 
president bush and the secretaries of state and defense reagan said 
he did not want any leaks about the thirdcountry support for the 
contras 
keker reading from minutes of the meeting quoted reagan as 
saying if such a story gets out well all be hanging by our 
thumbs in front of the white house until we find out who did it 
mcfarlane testified he never did say go lie to congress he 
did say when learning of foreign contributions to the contras just 
do not share that information

q you said that senator tower was the best qualified for this 
job where does congressman cheney stand in this priority 
bush i said that on i said that on december whatever it was 
and now were in march whatever it is 
and as of today dick cheney is the best laughter and the 
proper choice 
q do you agree with the vice president in his harsh indictment 
of the vote on tower 
bush i havent read the harsh indictment 
i expect he felt as strongly as many of the senators having 
served in the senate 
but look thats history 
were moving forward with a new nominee 
i told the senators yesterday when they called both senator 
mitchell and senator nunn i think marlin had the release on that 
that i was going to work with the congress 
dick cheney and i have discussed that 
hes confident he can work with the congress both senate and 
house 
and so theres no point in my dwelling on what happened 
yesterday 
ive got my own views about it but weve got a big problem out 
here and we need to work cooperatively in defense with the senate 
and with the house 
and were going to do just that as dick cheney is confirmed 
yes and then ill be back in the middle 
q mr president you said when you originally picked your 
cabinet that you didnt want to pick anybody from the house or 
senate because you didnt want to deplete the ranks of republicans 
in congress now youve picked mr cheney what happened to that 
rule 
bush this is the exception that proves that rule laughter 
yes john 
q for mr cheney youve said many times that youve enjoyed 
your work in congress why would you give up a post on the 
leadership ladder in the house are you frustrated because you think 
that the republicans are going to be in a minority position ad 
infinitum or why have you suddenly decided now to go into the 
executive branch 
cheney well i first of all john im optimistic about the 
future of the republican party in congress 
i think we will become a majority within the next few years 
obviously ive loved the house of representatives 
ive enjoyed it immensely 
it i thought that thats where i would spend the bulk of my 
political career 
but when the president asks you to consider a proposition such 
as this one you have to take it seriously 
and when you look at the challenge thats involved the 
importance that he assigns to the problems that have to be addressed 
in this area and the basic attraction of taking on a difficult task 
after i agonized over it and i did agonize it was not an easy 
decision i decided that i would in fact accept the post of 
secretary of defense

egyptian president hosni mubarak warned 
on friday that the timetable set by the international monetary fund 
for economic reforms in his country could cause political and social 
upheaval in egypt 
the imf wants mubarak to speed up his reforms before a new 
meeting can be held on a rescheduling of egypts 44 billion foreign 
debt 
the first such conference was held in may 1987 
we are not against the reforms the egyptian president told 
reporters it is the timetable that bothers us 
mubarak spoke after meeting with senior european economic 
community officials in brussels including eec commission president 
jacques delors 
his stop was part of a european tour to win support for an 
international middle east peace conference which israel opposes 
he outlined his economic reform program in his talks with delors 
and explained the political and social risks inherent in speeding 
them up 
international banks want mubarak to slash egypts budget deficit 
apply energy price reforms liberalize interest rates and 
rationalize its multitier exchange rate system 
but some price reforms the imf is asking of us would mean 
increasing some prices sevenfold mubarak said 
earlier friday the eec approved two development projects 
totaling 49 million 
the bulk of the money 333 million will go to a fouryear 
rural development project in the nile valley 
the remainder will go to promote joint ventures notably between 
small and medium enterprises in the eec and egypt 
on the middle east mubarak said israel should not fear an 
international conference which cannot impose a peace settlement 
on anyone 
he said the conference would only be a guarantee for direct 
talks between the main actors in the israeliarab conflict 
mubarak said he did not ask delors to urge the 12 eec states to 
recognize palestine 
the question of recognition is a detail he said what 
counts is that an international peace conference should get off the 
ground 
mubarak also denied that egypt is assembling swissmade parts 
that could be used to create a chemical weapons plant at abu zaabal 
north of cairo 
the new york times said friday us officials believe egypt is 
doing this 
mubarak said this is the first ive heard of it we are 
against chemical weapons and of course dont make any such 
factories 
mubarak was due to leave brussels saturday for the hague the 
netherlands to attend the international conference on atmospheric 
pollution 
he is scheduled to have a private meeting with president francois 
mitterrand of france who will also attend the conference 
on sunday mubarak will travel to west germany for a fiveday 
state visit

headquarters to the chinese un mission to demand tibets 
independence from china 
on the 30th anniversary of a failed tibetan uprising protesters 
gathered across the street from the united nations and chanted 
china out of tibet and un help tibet 
china regards as an internal affair the unrest in tibet that

emergency medical care at public hospitals is 
suffering due to increases in aids patients drug overdose cases and 
elderly patients as well as cuts in government funding hospital 
administrators said friday 
the problem is so severe that patients requiring emergency 
treatment face up to a threeday wait for hospital beds in the new 
york city area and waits of up to 18 hours in los angeles and 12 
hours in miami said larry s gage president of the national 
association of public hospitals 
gage said hospitals in boston chicago st louis washington 
dc and even memphis tenn are severely strained doctors are 
facing a challenge to their hippocratic oath to give patients bad 
treatment in some cases or no treatment at all he said 
we are rationing health care for the poor in a necessary 
aggressive way he said 
gage was one of more than a dozen speakers at an emergency 
conference friday on indigent care sponsored by the public hospitals 
association the association serves 85 public and nonprofit 
hospitals 
we know what to do we just dont have the resources said 
arthur kellerman medical director of the emergency department at 
regional medical center in memphis we are being put in the 
position of having to give inadequate care to our patients we have 
situations where we have one doctor two nurses and 30 patients in 
the emergency room 
kellerman said a crisis has occurred in the past two years 
because hospitals have reduced total beds under pressure from the 
federal and state governments medicare funding has been cut and 
more and more people are without adequate hospital insurance 
in addition many hospitals have instituted costcontainment 
programs at government urging at a time when victims of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome are increasing 
hospitals also are seeing more drug overdoses as a result of 
rising crack cocaine use and more elderly are being sent to 
hospitals rather than nursing homes he said 
in denver the problem was so severe thursday night that five of 
nine hospitals were on ambulance diversion not accepting any 
new emergency patients because there were no critical care beds 
available said kellerman 
charity hospital in new orleans lost its certification in part 
because of a staffing shortage as a result of budget cuts he said 
kellerman said some hospitals have worsened the situation by 
phasing out their emergency rooms 
in los angeles for example most central public hospitals have 
closed their emergency rooms and people have to travel 30 minutes 
to a suburban hospital for treatment he said besides endangering 
patients lives this also hurts the community by taking ambulances 
out of service for long periods of time he said 
gage who testified earlier this month before congress on the 
issue said the association is asking congress to change funding 
procedures for hospitals 
the organization wants to put less emphasis on university 
hospitals and more on public hospitals to change medicaid funding 
and to consider some form of national health insurance

it appeared they were going to attack vrdolyak said police 
officer janice redmond 
vrdolyak supporters responded by throwing punches at a dozen 
people vrdolyak said were daley supporters and the hecklers fled 
the scene one man hit in the eye and leg was treated and released 
at resurrection hospital said spokesman warren nelson 
there were no other injuries and no arrests police said 
daley campaign officials denied any involvement and suggested 
vrdolyak himself had set up the incident 
vrdolyak said one of the cars was traced to daley supporters and 
that william daley the candidates brother and campaign adviser 
had encouraged the harassment 
all of a sudden three weeks before the election he comes out 
with this this is ridiculous said daley cook county states 
attorney 
if vrdolyak thinks these people were hired by the daley 
campaign it is more likely that he or someone in his campaign hired 
them so they could blame it on the daley campaign added daley 
spokeswoman avis lavelle 
vrdolyak held a news conference to deny the accusation and said 
he would withdraw from the race if anyone could prove otherwise 
also friday the board of election commissioners announced that 
vrdoylak had won the lottery to determine whose name would top the 
ballot for the april 4 general election daleys name will appear 
second followed by thirdparty candidate timothy evans a south 
side alderman and the only black in the campaign 
the election will choose a successor to harold washington the 
citys first black mayor 
vrdolyak a former democratic alderman switched parties in 1987 
and waged a writein campaign to win the gop nomination in the 
february primary 
the winner of the general election will serve out the final two 
years of washingtons second term the city council appointed eugene 
sawyer acting mayor after washington died of a heart attack in 
november 1987 sawyer also black ran in the democratic primary

the syrian foreign ministry said friday 
that two us diplomats who were briefly detained last week by 
palestinian guerrillas had been photographing a palestinian camp 
the guerrilla captors the radical popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command headed by ahmed jibril 
claimed the diplomats were working for the central intelligence 
agency 
in washington the state department said thursday that two 
embassy officials were detained by the pflpgc outside damascus for 
more than eight hours before being handed over unharmed to syrian 
authorities 
state department spokeswoman nancy beck said the government filed 
a protest with syria over the incident and urged syria to take 
action against the pflpgc which she called a terrorist group 
the syrian foreign ministry statement friday said col clifford 
r ward a military attache at the us embassy in damascus and his 
assistant maj peter seegel were caught shooting pictures of a 
pflpgc camp outside the syrian capital 
the statement said pflpgc guerrillas detained the two diplomats 
because they were in a forbidden zone and carried maps and cameras 
equipped with zoom lenses 
pflpgc guards arrested them while filming but the foreign 
ministry called the united states ambassador edward djerejian and 
turned over the two men to him unharmed the statement added 
the syrianbacked palestinian group issued a statement saying the 
two claimed they were canadian embassy officials when they were 
arrested for shooting pictures of one of the groups camps 25 miles 
outside damascus 
the pflpgc said the diplomats identities were later revealed 
and that they were treated well before being handed over to the 
syrian authorities along with their espionage material 
this is not the first time in which the cia carries out an 
espionage operation to the benefit of the israeli services the 
guerrillas said 
they said the united states aimed at harming the struggle of 
the pflpgc and at practicing more pressures to blackmail syria and 
make the syrian stands more flexible to usisraeli schemes 
the group formed in 1968 by jibril a former syrian army 
officer is fiercely opposed to yasser arafats palestinian 
liberation organization 
the syrian foreign ministry statement said djerejian was shown 
the diplomats belongings and was asked to provide a us government 
explanation for their behavior which is incompatible with the 
regulations of the host country and contradicts with diplomatic 
activity 
it said that the us thanked the syrian government for their 
handling of the incident in a reply delivered on friday but failed 
to provide the required explanations 
the ministry statement also reiterated the syrian position of 
denouncing terrorism but making a distinction between terrorism and 
legitimate freedomfighting against occupying forces 
the statement said ms becks charges against the guerrillas was 
damaging to the palestinian peoples right to fight for 
selfdetermination

leftist rebels said friday they 
will begin a traffic ban before the march 19 presidential elections 
which they are boycotting 
closing the highways has been a favorite rebel tactic in the 
9yearold civil war the bans virtually paralyze vehicle traffic 
the principal means of transportation in this central american 
nation and the rebels enforce them by shooting up or firebombing 
trucks cars or buses found on the roads 
venceremos the clandestine rebel radio said the ban would start 
at midnight wednesday and continue until further notice 
it said the purpose was to reinforce public sentiment against 
the march 19 election 
five traffic bans were declared last year including one to 
support a boycott of legislative and municipal elections army 
trucks with soldiers riding shotgun were used in some areas to take 
people to the polls 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance won a majority in 
the national legislature in the elections last march and its 
candidate businessman and coffee grower alfredo christiani is 
favored to win this one 
christiani is running against christian democratic candidate 
fidel chavez a lawyer and former foreign minister and guillermo 
ungo of the democratic convergence a coalition of noncombatant 
leftist groups 
a few hours before the traffic ban was announced president jose 
napoleon duarte blamed the rebel faribundo marti national liberation 
front for a delay in negotiations to end the war 
duartes christian democratic administration rejected a jan 24 
proposal by the rebels to begin talks if the election was postponed 
until at least september and their conditions for security and a 
clean vote were met 
he accused the guerrillas of rejecting dialogue and resorting 
to delay and deceit 
their strategy is to create conditions that will gain them 
points internationally and nationally with proposals of peace that 
they do not want to honor he said

list how long was the short list and youve taken so many people 
from the ford administration do you have any role for former 
president ford laughter 
bush in inverse order no i talked to president ford get good 
advice from him 
in terms of how long i moved fast on this one 
i was telling you the truth when i said i have not considered 
anybody else during the last days of the senate debate 
i wasnt about to shift gears or send a signal that wasnt true 
that i was interested in anything interested in anything other 
than the confirmation of john tower 
thats history 
thats done 
so when it became clear yesterday that the votes werent there 
yesterday i began to think and talk to our my top advisers here 
get opinions from them 
they reached out a little bit and then i called dick today and 
he came over and visited with me about 1 i think it was

q mr president have you talked about this selection yet with 
senator nunn and senator mitchell if so can you describe their 
reaction a little bit and did you get any kind of a commitment 
about the timing of confirmation hearings 
bush gerry what we did on that was divide up here just recently 
the names to talk to and i believe general scowcroft talked to 
senator mitchell and to senator nunn 
and i would let them characterize their reaction to it 
but and ive talked to the speaker 
the only one of the kind of hierarchy that we havent reached is 
bob michel and its very important that he be notified but i 
expect he will be by all of this 
but nevertheless we divided it up and the reaction from the 
people that weve contacted the understandable one has been very 
very positive 
q mr president 
bush yes 
q do you have a hearing schedule 
bush oh i dont know 
john did you talk about timing 
white house chief of staff john sununu i asked senator mitchell 
to evaluate how quickly it could be done and we will talk again in

bush yes and weve started the clearances name check has been 
completed rapidfire time and dick has undergone two thorough 
fullfield checks and hes had has there been another one since

out in indianapolis this afternoon accusing senate democrats of 
using mccarthylike tactics in the defeat of john tower with 
respect to your comments about putting the tower nomination behind

bush i havent seen what he said so i cant tell you whether he 
speaks for me 
i speak for myself 
he speaks for himself 
but i explained why that he feels strongly about it 
i feel strongly about it and i am determined to move forward 
and i think that this nomination will set that tone and well see

a threat to ban a fourth singer slated to perform in 
this weekends calle ocho festival drew protests friday from city 
officials and latin groups who say the organizers anticastro 
policy has gone too far 
city manager cesar odio froze a 15000 city subsidy to the 
little havana kiwanis club which sponsors the event on grounds the 
group may have violated its contract barring political or religious 
activities in the festival 
dade county authorities also held up another 15000 payment 
aimed at helping to market the gigantic street party slated to be 
held sunday 
calle ocho is a mardi gras of all cultures of spanishspeaking 
background said yvette morgan of the national conference of 
puerto rican women one of the critics of the ban it has always 
been for all hispanic arts not just for the anticommunists 
about 40 puerto rican men and women picketed outside the kiwanis 
club offices friday in the little havana neighborhood chanting and 
carrying signs saying this is the united states and pepsicola 
is in russia why not montanez in calle ocho referring to one of 
the banned performers puerto rican singer andy montanez 
kiwanis leaders insisted again friday they will not back down 
from their strict rule barring anyone who has performed in cuba 
since fidel castros revolution they said the lastminute freeze of 
government subsidies should not seriously affect the festitval 
our policy has to stay for this year insisted kiwanis 
president pedro menendez its too late to change it 
however he emphasized that the kiwanis had not deliberately 
picked a fight over the issue and were simply trying not to offend 
the citys large anticommunist cuban community 
this has definitely gone too far menendez said our 
original intention was not to insult certain segments of our 
community and apparently by trying to do that we have insulted 
other people 
three latin singers montanez brazilian denise de kalafe and 
spains de raymond have been banned already this year by the 
kiwanis because they made appearances in cuba as long as 20 years 
ago 
and on friday menendez said they might also exclude famed 
merengue singer wilfrido vargas of the dominican republic who is 
credited as performing on a record album made in cuba a decade ago 
menendez said kiwanis officials were checking to confirm that he was 
really there 
all the singers have strongly condemned castros government 
the miami herald withdrew its sponsorship of calle ocho after de 
raymond scheduled to sing with the duo los espanolisimos on a 
newspapersponsored stage was dropped because of a 1978 appearance 
in cuba 
de raymond said the ban was particularly painful for him because 
he was barred from spains socialistrun television for six years 
because of his strong anticommunist views i deserve a tribute 
not a ban de raymond said 
miami mayor xavier suarez has also condemned the bans 
the position the kiwanis have taken is really hurting them and 
the city suarez said it is a very extreme position for them to 
take one i dont think too many people agree with even in the 
cuban community 
some in the cuban community support the tough stand however 
saying the performers had insulted the exiles here who consider 
themselves refugees of an autocratic regime 
i cant see people having festivals in miami beach and inviting 
people who performed for hitler said state rep lincoln 
diazbalart 
calle ocho which means eighth street in spanish named for the 
main thoroughfare of little havana where it takes place has become 
the nations largest latin festival in only 10 years it attracts a 
million people as well as top entertainment from around latin 
america

president bush on friday named rep richard 
cheney of wyoming as defense secretary moving with surprising speed 
to leave behind the controversy caused by john towers rejection by 
the senate 
bush said he would order the fbi to speed up its background 
checks to get the nomination moving too much time has been 
wasted here he said 
the president won a pledge of quick action from leaders of the 
senate armed services committee who praised cheney and said 
confirmation hearings would begin next week 
i know of no impediment to his nomination said sen sam 
nunn dga the armed services chairman who led the successful 
battle to kill towers nomination 
cheney 48 is a sixterm conservative congressman who served as 
white house chief of staff during the ford administration his 
selection was a surprise in view of his relative lack of experience 
on defense issues 
appearing with bush at a hurriedly called news conference cheney 
said he had an active interest in defense matters but 
acknowledged that obviously there are areas that i need to know 
and ill have to work hard on to master 
in naming cheney bush picked the no 2 man in the house gop 
leadership depleting his partys minority ranks there after a 
postcampaign pledge not to choose anyone from capitol hill for his 
cabinet 
this is the exception that proves that rule bush said when 
asked about his earlier declaration 
and cheney said i did agonize over leaving the hill where he 
has often said he enjoyed his work 
bush brushing aside the divisive battle over tower said 
thats history thats done however vice president dan quayle 
reignited the furor by accusing democrats of engaging in a 
mccarthyite mudslinging campaign against tower and waging an 
assault on the powers of the presidency 
commenting on quayles remarks bush said i cant tell you if 
he speaks for me i speak for myself he speaks for himself 
towers nomination was killed thursday on a near party line vote 
of 5347 in the democraticcontrolled senate he was defeated by 
concerns over his drinking habits his relationships with women and 
his work as a paid defense industry consultant after leaving 
government service 
bush praised cheney as a widely respected man of principle 
and predicted his nomination would go very fast and have 
smooth sailing 
democrats and republicans alike saluted the selection 
senate republican leader bob dole quickly hailed the appointment 
in a barbed comment that reflected the bitterness lingering from the 
tower confirmation struggle 
hes tough thats what we wanted a tough tough tough guy 
he said of cheney this time it will be a confirmation not an 
execution 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine said cheney had 
served with distinction in congress he promised to work with 
nunn to ensure the nomination gets prompt consideration by the 
committee and the full senate 
sen tim wirth dcolo said hes a very able and impressive 
person hes one of the smartest people in congress 
an excellent choice said sen charles robb the freshman 
from virginia who was one of the last democrats to announce his 
opposition to tower 
in a joint statement nunn and sen john warner of virginia the 
ranking republican on the armed services committee said cheney is 
well known and highly respected by the members of the senate we 
have worked with him on many issues involving national defense and 
intelligence matters 
almost immediately after towers defeat the white house turned 
to cheney 
the congressman said he was contacted late thursday afternoon by 
white house chief of staff john sununu and national security adviser 
brent scowcroft then at 1 pm friday cheney went to the white 
house and discussed the job with bush 
i said i want to make a decision fast on this because i know 
him well and have known him well over the years the president 
said 
cheney said he checked with his cardiologist before accepting the 
job and was assured there were no medical restrictions to stop him 
a heart attack victim cheney underwent bypass surgery last august 
but returned to work three weeks later he said 
looking back at the handling of towers nomination bush said 
i may have made a mistake by holding it back pending fbi checks 
of allegations against tower there may have been some other 
tactical things that went wrong but please remember that when the 
nomination went up there it was very well received generally 
in response to reporters questions on star wars and a series of 
other defense issues cheney said i have extensive views on 
defense policy but i dont believe ill share them today 
bush was asked about his past declarations that tower was the 
best qualified candidate to head the pentagon 
i said that on december whatever it was and now were in march 
whatever it is and as of today dick cheney is the best and proper 
choice the president said in an appearance before reporters 
shortly after his departure for a weekend at camp david 
many potential candidates had been mentioned for the job 
including former rep jack edwards rala sens william cohen 
rmaine and ted stevens ralaska former defense secretaries donald 
rumsfeld and james schlesinger former cia deputy director bobby 
inman paul oneill chairman and chief executive officer of alcoa 
and norman augustine chairman and chief executive officer of martin 
marietta aerospace corp 
fitzwater at a latemorning briefing said bush reviewed 
candidates from any number of people and sources in the 
government in the white house and outside the government as well 
meanwhile quayle flew to indianapolis and in a speech harshly 
criticized senate democrats and warned there will be a lingering 
bitterness over the tower fight 
never in all my years in the senate have i encountered anything 
like the feeling of outrage that exists today among my former 
republican senate colleagues he said never have i encountered 
such anger and bitterness in the senate chamber 
quayle said the harmful consequences of the tower affair will 
not soon pass im afraid that the misguided democratic assault on 
the powers of the presidency will continue 
at the white house fitzwater said quayle had given a copy of the 
speech to the white house on thursday but that he did not have to 
have his remarks cleared in advance

president bush served up the last question at 
his news conference on friday with a lecture to outspoken reporter 
sarah mcclendon that the loudest voice wont always be 
recognized 
but the feisty texas newswoman who has covered 10 presidents 
had the last laugh her question wasnt for bush but for defense 
secretarydesignate richard cheney 
i wanted to ask you new man what he feels she began 
ms mcclendon a fixture at white house news conferences since 
1944 was seeking to get the presidents attention in her usual way 
by calling out robustly for recognition 
at first ignoring her calls bush wound up the news conference 
called to announce his choice of cheney by recognizing her 
but at the same time he told her i will make a new 
announcement of press policy sarah the squeaking wheel will not 
always get the grease in life and the loudest voice wont always 
get recognized 
you and i have known each a long time and so this is the last 
time that i can succumb to the tendency to go to the loudest or most 
frantic wave i cant do it and its not fair to calmer souls 
ms mcclendon who operates her own texas news service said 
afterwards that she has known bush a long time and took no offense 
from his remarks which she called just a bunch of gaff 
it doesnt bother me at all i have a right to get in my 
questions just as everyone else we dont all have a seat in the 
front row she said

workers began a sitin strike at warsaws 
main post friday in a spreading pay dispute by postal employees that 
has made it difficult to pay bills collect pensions and conduct 
other business 
the first warsaw post office closed tuesday and by thursday 38 
of the 242 branches were on strike according to official reports 
post offices also were closed in the southern cities of krakow 
and radom where an official report said workers at 10 post offices 
were refusing to handle mail not labeled emergency 
strikers are seeking wage increases and changes in working 
conditions at the offices which provide a wide range of services 
including collecting rent and utility and insurance payments 
workers seek monthly raises averaging 30000 to 35000 zlotys 
54 to 63 at the official exchange rate according to zuzanna 
dabrowska of the banned polish socialist party 
she put the average postal employees monthly salary at 32000 
zlotys or 57 the state pap news agency said pay raises last year 
made the average mail carriers salary 55000 zlotys or 99 and 
the average cashiers monthly salary 66000 zlotys 118 
mail carriers also are demanding that they not be required to 
deliver weekly newspapers and magazines except perhaps to disabled 
people and are disputing pension and benefit payments 
pap quoted the management of warsaws main post office as saying 
the possibility of pay increases here like in all other 
enterprises are directly dependent on economic effects 
banners announcing the strike covered the entrance doors at the 
main post office 
the banners did not indicate if the strikers were affiliated with 
the outlawed solidarity union movement or the governmentsanctioned 
opzz union 
ms dabrowska said strike committee members were not associated 
with either group and the sitin would continue at the main post 
office at least until monday 
poland has had labor disputes since the beginning of the year 
with workers trying to cope with inflation that exceeded more than 
60 percent last year government officials hope to reduce that to 50 
percent this year 
a strike entered its 11th day at the poltex j marchlewski cotton 
mill in lodz and bankers told managers the plant is facing 
insolvency 
pap said mill workers voted to continue the strike after a 
discussion it quoted a strike committee member as saying the 
financial situation of the factory is bad the workers do not feel 
responsible for that he blamed taxes management and financial 
regulations 
industry minister mieczlyslaw wilczek is considering liquidating 
the plant pap said

q mr president 
q mr president 
bush yes 
q one of the things that senator tower did in this period was 
work up a strategy which apparently you approved of which was that 
the you would squeeze the defense budget down into the limits set 
by the congress if the congress would let you make some or all of 
the choices is this strategy going to be passed along to dick 
cheney and do you plan to pursue a similar strategy 
bush im going to have to defer answering that because though 
we talked about budget generally and making tough choices generally 
we didnt go into that much detail yet and i think hes entitled to 
giving me his views on it before we do 
jerry 
q mr president 
q mr president have you asked the congressman the obvious 
question is there anything in his background that would be 
prohibitive or embarrassing or anything like that how much 
bush yes 
q detail have you gone into 
bush and im satisfied on that 
q mr president 
bush yes 
q mr president can you 
bush cant hear you sarah

difference between speaking for himself and speaking for you since 
he is your vice president and he is out in indianapolis has used 
the words mccarthytype tactics and yet youre here wanting to 
have things go smoothly for the congressman im just wondering how 
you can square your desire to have peace with the congress and what 
your vice president is saying indianapolis 
bush please dont ask me to comment on something i havent read 
thats what id say to that one 
yes 
q mr president 
q a question for congressman cheney about defense policy does

its america can erect a perfect defense or something more modest 
cheney i have extensive views on defense policy but i dont

it seems to me its appropriate for me to discuss those matters 
before the senate committee during the confirmation process and not 
in this forum 
bush now back im sorry i 
q mr president 
bush excuse me go ahead 
q sir theres been an incredible amount of analysis about what 
happened to the tower nomination as youre aware and i think weve

food shortages in several vietnamese 
provinces have forced some peasants to eat roots and sell farming 
utensils to buy grain but the government can provide only limited 
aid according to an official 
the shortages resulted from severe weather conditions that 
destroyed crops last year and are expected to last until the next 
harvest in may and june 
agriculture minister nguyen cong tan said that even in normal 
conditions about 10 percent of vietnams peasant families experience 
food shortages annually including those in the mekong river delta 
in the south that is the countrys most productive area 
tans comments came in an interview the official vietnamese army 
newspaper quan doi nhan dan published last month a translation was 
seen friday in bangkok 
tan reported shortages in the northern and central provinces of 
lang son thanh hoa nghe tinh binh tri tien quang namdanang and 
gia laicong tum and in areas east of nam bo and the mekong river 
delta in the south vietnamese radio reported earlier this month 
that hundreds of thousands of rural families in nghe tinh where 
floods had hit have run out of food grain 
tan said 90 percent of the peasants in the ky anh district of 
nghe tinh were short of food and some had to sell their utensils 
and private property to buy grain others had to dig roots in the 
forest to eat 
he said ky anh has lost five consecutive crops since 1986 and its 
per capita output of grain was only about 70 pounds last year 
vietnamese officials said total national grain production was 19 
million metric tons last year an increase over the previous year 
but the country is still losing the struggle to feed a fastgrowing 
population of more than 63 million

the government trying to head off an 
increasingly severe urban smog problem this summer ordered tougher 
hydrocarbon emission standards for gasoline friday but the federal 
action is not as tough as some states would like 
the environmental protection agency announced that for the first 
time gasoline will have to meet nationwide volatility levels these 
levels which are controlled during the blending process determine 
how easily gasoline evaporates and in turn how much hydrocarbon 
pollutants get into the air 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides are key ingredient of ozone and 
urban smog 
under the epa requirements gasoline volatility may be no greater 
than 105 pounds per inch in most parts of the country this summer 
in some states especially during the hottest months the standard 
is somewhat tougher 
the epa action is the first time the federal government has told 
the petroleum industry it had to curb volatility to a specific level 
on nationwide basis there have been local limits in southern 
california since the early 1970s 
the epa estimated the federal requirement which sets a 105 psi 
gasoline volatility level or lower in every state would mean a 13 
percent reduction of hydrocarbon emissions into the air gasoline 
volatility generally has been at at a level of 115 psi 
but the epa said that level causes a release of gasoline vapors 
beyond the capacity of existing vehicleemission controls to 
handle as a result vapors are released into the air from auto fuel 
systems as well as while gasoline is transferred from one storage 
area to another or while vehicles are being fueled officials said 
most of our major urban areas suffer from unhealthful summer 
smog levels said epa administrator william k reilly in a 
statement the standards set today will help reduce this harmful 
pollutant 
the country had the worst urban smog problem in recent years last 
summer with nationwide ozone levels higher than anytime in this 
decade and 14 percent greater than the year before federal maximum 
ozone levels were exceeded 60 percent more often last summer than in 
1983 the worst previous year 
but a group of northeastern states have pushed for even tougher 
restrictions and officials in those states have expressed concerns 
that their state requirements which would limit gasoline 
volatility to 9 psi this summer might be scuttled by the federal 
regulation 
by law federal emission rules normally would preempt local 
requirements unless specific waivers are provided epa officials 
said the epa said last month it plans to grant a waiver to 
massachusetts but the agency has not acted on waiver requests from 
the other six states states 
the tougher gasoline volatility standards enacted for this summer 
are to go into effect may 1 in massachusetts rhode island 
connecticut new york new jersey vermont and maine unless 
preempted by the federal regulation 
the tougher state standards have been strongly opposed by the 
petroleum industry the american petroleum institute has filed suit 
in new york seeking to prevent that states tougher restrictions 
from going into effect it argues the state requirements which 
establish a maximum 9 psi volatility level for gasoline sold between 
may 1 and sept 15 could cause driving problems and problems in 
gasoline distribution 
but supporters of the more stringent requirements deny that the 
lower volatility levels adversely affect gasoline performance they 
maintain the oil companies opposition to the tighter standards stem 
from the fact the gasoline with the lower volatility is more 
expensive to produce 
the northeast is faced with a sever ozone problem in the 
summer months we have two choices we can either reduce emissions 
that contribute to ozone formation or we can continue to ask people 
to restrict their activity during ozone episodes said michael 
bradley executive director of a coalition of state enviornmental 
officials formed to implement the tougher requirements in the seven 
northeastern states

prominent lebanese international banker 
roger tamraz reappeared friday and denied reports he was kidnapped 
and held for ransom by a militia leader who lost money when his bank 
went under 
earlier friday however a tamraz business associate told the 
associated press in nicosia cyprus that the banker was freed after 
arranging to pay the final installment of a 3 million ransom 
tamraz 48 checked into the seaside west beirut summerland hotel 
shortly before sunset 
i was not kidnapped he said in an interview with the 
associated press i was on my own doing my own thinking 
tamraz who was reported kidnapped feb 19 said the ransom 
report was based on rumor and figment of the imagination and 
theres nothing to it 
the christiancontrolled radio station voice of lebanon said 
thursday that tamraz was being held by elie hobeika commander of a 
christian militia in the eastern bekaa valley town of zahle 
the report said that hobeika a former commander of the lebanese 
forces the main christian militia was forcing tamraz to pay 3 
million he claimed was owed him after the collapse of bank 
almashrek lebanons secondlargest bank 
tamraz who is a united states resident headed the christianrun 
bank until december when a run on its assets began an arrest 
warrant was issued for tamraz pending investigation of the banks 
affairs 
the respected newsletter middle east economic survey estimated 
almashreks deficit in lebanon at 100 million a largely 
stateowned conglomerate owned a major share in the bank 
tamraz fled from christian east beirut to the moslemheld western 
part of the capital in january and lived in the summerland hotel 
until shortly before his disappearance since last fall lebanon has 
had two rival governments one christian and one moslem 
the tamraz associate who spoke by telephone from paris and 
declined to be identified said a loan instrument was fixed to 
transfer the final 750000 in ransom money to the kidnappers 
through a swiss bank 
he said tamraz release was delayed for two days while the loan 
was arranged 
hobeika is held responsible for the september 1982 massacre of 
hundreds of palestinian civilians by christian militiamen in two 
beirut refugee camps after israel invaded lebanon the charge was 
confirmed by israeli reports but denied by hobeika 
in his interview friday tamraz predicted he would be vindicated 
of charges in connection with the banks demise investigators say 
the bank under his direction made shaky investments in spanish 
real estate and a moneylosing cargo airline it also took over 
three ailing banks and assumed their deficits 
in the past tamraz a maronite catholic blamed lebanese central 
bank governor edmond naim for deliberately undermining the bank in 
order to get rid of him

bush i have read that we made mistakes 
i dont i think and if so i would be you know glad to 
say so 
but i dont know exactly i cant think of a specific that we 
might have done differently in this circumstance 
you have to remember one of the allegations was i took too long 
to send it up 
but what we were trying to do was the same thing that overtook 
events once it got to the hill gunning down groundless rumors 
so i you know thats what took the time to begin with 
every time wed get ready to go up with the nomination which i 
felt was a good one thered be some other allegation printed out 
there not by the senate but just floating out there 
and wed have to say what is this please send the 
investigators to geneva to see if indeed the east not east texas 
here the east german spy was true you know 
and then wed find it wasnt true 
then wed be ready and thered be some other allegation 
and thats the way so maybe i made a mistake in not just going 
ahead 
but what i wanted to do and told our general counsel is look 
i think we have an obligation to have the fbi look at these 
i think that may and i would have to bear full responsibility 
for that maybe set a tone up there that then encouraged you know 
leaks counterleaks and investigation of rumor and innuendo 
so id have to accept some responsibility for that i think 
and there may have been some other tactical things that went 
wrong 
but please remember that when that nomination went up there it 
was very well received generally 
and indeed senator nunn i think said on the floor that he was 
you know had been fully prepared to vote for it 
so i dont know but in that area i think there might i may 
have made a made a mistake 
q mr president 
q can i just follow up 
bush she has a followup yes 
q some of the things that have been analyzed have centered on 
the fact that it takes any new white house staff some time to get 
its act together and that this crisis came at one of the worst 
times it could have come for you in terms of having the same kind of 
weak and inexperienced staff that any president would have at this 
stage of the game and weve all read things about some of the 
senators werent contacted and that you did not really go all out 
in terms of twisting arms you sort of appealed to fairness is 
there anything along this line that you think might have worked 
differently 
bush i dont think id do it differently to do over again 
and i dont i certainly am not going to fault my staff 
i think this was historic in the and im not you know i 
dont think the time is appropriate to start trying to assess blame 
i mean i think therell be a lot of aftermaths in what happened 
but were going to go forward 
and i frankly feel that ive given you a long list of things that 
make me feel the administration is moving forward appropriately 
were moving swiftly on this nomination 
and im one who has a rather broad perspective of how things are 
in washington 
and tomorrow itll be some other problem 
and we will i will work with the congress 
and i think i will continue to keep this feeling that i can work 
with the congress

ethnic albanian miners on friday 
stayed away from their jobs for a second day to protest the 
treatment of ethnic albanian leaders in troubled kosovo province 
the state tanjug news agency said 
elez zeinalihi director of the mine told the associated press 
in a telephone interview that he and local party leaders talked to 
about 120 miners for two hours friday morning and tried to persuade 
them to resume work 
they even refused to talk to us zeinalihi said about the 
strikers i dont know what will happen now 
zeinalihi said the miners who began their strike thursday were 
protesting what they described as the hounding of some ethnic 
albanian leaders by police and demanded an explanation of why 
azem vlasi a former communist party leader of kosovo and two other 
officials were recently arrested 
the 400 miners of three shifts at the mine about 140 miles south 
of belgrade were visited thursday by kosovos premier nazmi mustafa 
who urged them to deal with their grievances through legal means 
tanjug said 
do not complicate the already serious situation he 
reportedly warned the miners 
miners of two pits at the trepca lead and zinc mines also stopped 
work friday morning for an hour tanjug reported 
last month about 1300 ethnic albanian miners staged an 
eightday sitin at the trepca mines demanding that no changes be 
made in yugoslavias 1974 constitution which granted kosovo 
wideranging autonomy the miners also demanded the resignations of 
three senior communist party officials 
the action which brought kosovo to the verge of a general 
strike prompted federal authorities to impose emergency measures in 
the region and led to the arrest of vlasi two directors of the 
trepca mines and several other people accused of sedition 
the strike ended after the three party officials who are 
generally believed to be supporters of serbias party chief slobodan 
milosevic bowed to the strikers demands and handed in their 
resignations 
since then however serbian govermnment officials and the 
republics partisan press have been demanding that the resignations 
be withdrawn and the strikers punished 
milosevic has been pressing for constitutional changes that would 
introduce more serbian control over the affairs of kosovo in an 
effort to provide more security for the slav minority which claims 
persecution by the majority ethnic albanians

tibetans and chinese news reports painted 
radically different pictures of how the remote region after a week 
of riot and martial law marked the 30th anniversary friday of a 
fruitless uprising against china 
state tv said more than 30 tibetan rioters surrendered to 
police and admitted to taking part in disturbances this week in 
lhasa the capital 
it said tibetans peacefully celebrated the 30th anniversary of 
democratic reforms in tibet 
tibetans reached by telephone thursday and friday spoke of 
largescale roundups and pervasive fear in the city of 70000 
one woman said arrests began soon after the last western tourists 
were expelled from the city tourists were ordered out when martial 
law was imposed at midnight tuesday and the last planeload of 
foreigners left friday 
protests and riots cost 16 lives by official count but western 
travelers say most tibetans put the death toll at 20 to 30 
a group of five men an american and four swedes arrived in 
the nepalese capital of katmandu friday night and said they were 
happy to be out of lhasa they left lhasa tuesday morning and were 
the first batch of foreigners to reach nepal 
i feel very lucky to get my passport back from the chinese and 
make my journey safely to katmandu russell liebman 22 of new 
york city told the associated press there 
a 22yearold swede from uppsala who identied himself only as 
pontus said they had reserved a vehicle and we had a 2day ride 
along the tibetan plateau but after reaching nyalam we had to 
walk rest of the day through the snowfields to reach zangmu the 
last tibetan township situated near the border with nepal 
liebman said i still feel dazed after witnessing the warlike 
scenes we saw three bodies of the people killed in actual 
shooting near our place 
liebman said they took many photographs but police confiscated 
the film when they ran back to their hotel after shooting broke out 
chinas nightly news said martial law stopped a riot planned for 
friday in lhasa 
new martial law orders issued thursday demanded the immediate 
surrender of anyone who planned instigated or participated in the 
riots or was harboring criminals or hiding looted goods

to work and tibetans bringing food and blankets to chinese soldiers 
depicted tibetans as supporting the crackdown 
a veteran tibetan worker took a bottle of yakbutter tea to 
police said the official xinhua news agency when an officer 
refused because of military regulations the old man insisted that 
the policeman at least come to his home nearby to get a warmup from 
the cold the report said 
earlier this week foreign travelers said most tibetans were 
terrified of martial law and the police 
tibetans told me the night they declared martial law people 
were staying up late cleaning their houses of anything that might be 
incriminating an american said friday they were burning 
pictures of the dalai lama the exiled spiritual leader who fled 
to india after the uprising in 1959 
during the riots tibetans demanding independence and chanting 
loyalty to the dalai lama threw stones ransacked chineseowned 
shops set fire to chinese property and attacked government

end the violence in lhasa and begin talk on a peaceful solution 
in an interview with the bbc he said negotiations with the 
chinese are the only way 
in new york about 200 tibetans and sympathizers carried a wooden 
coffin from un headquarters to chinas un mission chanting 
slogans and blowing prayer horns 
for china the march 10 anniversary marks the beginning of 
democratic reform the institution of communist political and 
economic systems in the remote himalayan region 
tibetans remember the day as one when tens of thousands converged 
on the dalai lamas palace to prevent what they thought was a 
chinese military attempt to kidnap their godking 
a week later the chinese allegedly fired two mortar shells into 
the palace grounds and the dalai lama and his family fled secretly 
to india 
when he was gone the chinese army destroyed the tibetan 
resistance killing hundreds of people perhaps thousands 
china says tibet has been an inalienable part of its territory 
for seven centuries many tibetans say their land was independent 
for much of that time and they seek a sovereign state under the 
dalai lama

a volcano erupted near here and another 
crater spewed ash and steam in nicaragua but officials in the two 
central american countries said thursday they had no immediate 
reports of major damage or injuries 
eddy sanchez deputy director of guatemalas seismological 
institute said in an interview that 255 residents of two villages 
on the slopes of the pacaya volcano were forced to evacuate their 
homes because of lava flows 
pacaya 16 miles south of the capital started spewing lava 
tuesday afternoon about 175 people in the village of el caracol and 
80 from el patrocinio cleared out of their homes late wednesday 
hours ahead of a small river of lava that destroyed their 
coffeebean fields 
but a number of farmers in other villages in the area stayed 
behind sanchez said he said the lava is flowing down pacayas 
slopes in a southeasterly direction at about 15 feet an hour 
the 8421foot peak one of 32 volcanos dotting guatemala has 
been erupting intermittently since it first turned active jan 21 
1987 on tuesday the volcano blew open a new crater 
the pacaya continues active spewing out lava with constant 
explosions sanchez said 
in nicaragua santiago volcano 12 miles southeast of the 
capital managua began releasing white gases on sunday but 
scientists monitoring the activity say there is no immediate danger 
of an eruption 
santiago is one of three in the masaya complex one of the most 
active volcanic ranges in central america its single crater has 
been releasing gases about once every two decades 
lava flows often have followed the initial eruptions but they 
solidified before reaching populated areas 
favio segura an engineer with the nicaraguan institute of 
territorial studies told reporters it is difficult to predict if 
santiago will develop a large or small lava flow 
he said three nicaraguan and three british vulcanologists are 
monitoring the peak around the clock 
the national association of geologists has reported no 
immediate risk of a violent explosion that would endanger 
surrounding communities

bush well were in general agreement and i think as dick gets 
over there and gets into the details hes going to have to make up 
his after hes confirmed make up his mind on the after the 
budget review is complete as to exactly what can be done and how 
fast it can be done 
theres no question of his support for sdi nor mine 
but in terms we arent there yet tom because we have to wait 
until the reviews that we talked about are finished before we 
either of us can definitively address levels of funding or where we 
might go on those things 
q mr president do you assume that this nomination will receive 
clear sailing in the senate 
bush yes i do 
q mr president 
q mr president 
bush i do i believe 
q mr president 
bush itll go very fast and i believe that itll have smooth 
sailing 
why because of dick cheney because of the merits

shouting over helicopter blades 
and i hope its been good for you 
and i will continue to try but i cannot identify people i dont 
think its fair to the others who stand up and yell while others 
sit and raise their hands 
but i dont mean to be pedantic about this or in some lecturing 
mode but you and i have known each other a long time 
and so this is the last time that i can succumb to the tendency 
to go to the loudest or most frantic wave

youll have the command now do you think youre going to have a 
problem with recruiting and pay and benefits to keep these people 
going or do you think that youll have to cut back on the forces 
cheney sarah those are very important questions but they 
really are the kind of things that i should not discuss until i have 
the opportunity to appear before the committee and until i have the 
opportunity in many cases to discuss them at length with the 
president

opposition parties on friday said 
officials were irresponsible for not shutting down a nuclear power 
plant where two of four emergency cooling systems broke down 
the hesse state government said there were no radioactive leaks 
and the local population was not in danger in the accident thursday 
at the biblis power plant 30 miles south of frankfurt the plant has 
a history of problems 
the state environment ministry said the two cooling systems broke 
down after workers tried to fix a cooling water pump an emergency 
water pump also broke down leaving only two emergency cooling 
systems working the ministry said in a statement 
the reactors output was reduced but workers repaired the 
malfunctioning pump and the unit was never shut down the ministry 
said the cause was not immediately known it said 
there was no danger for the workers or for the environment 
said ministry spokeswoman annette grossbongardt no radioactivity 
was released 
but the opposition social democrats and greens parties in the 
hesse state legislature accused the ministry of playing an 
irresponsible game with the safety of the populace by keeping 
the reactor running while the cause of the malfunction was unknown 
ernst welteke a social democratic leader in the hesse 
legislature said the same unit of the biblis plant had 175 recorded 
malfunctions between 1975 and 1988 according to official government 
documents 
several social democrats and greens said the plant one of the 
oldest in west germany should be shut down 
in december 1987 a small amount of radioactive steam was 
released from the plant into the atmosphere the accident caused a 
public outcry when it was disclosed a year later

political asylum 
the fugitive eddie hatcher was inside the consulate about three 
hours before the soviets asked him to leave said a friend who had 
accompanied him inside at one point hatcher sent out a handwritten 
statement claiming that federal and north carolina officials were 
trying to destroy him 
hatcher 31 and timothy jacobs 20 held as many as 20 people 
hostage in the offices of the robesonian newspaper in lumberton 
nc in february 1988 the two tuscarora indians said they took over 
the newspaper to draw attention to their claims that law enforcement 
officials were involved in drug trafficking and other corruption 
the 10hour siege ended when gov jim martin agreed to form a 
state task force to investigate their charges the task force found 
no evidence to support the claims and martin later said they were 
based on rumor and gossip 
the state of nc and the government of the united states has 
made every vindictive attempt to destroy my life my family and my 
people they will not cease until they have accomplished this 
said hatchers statement written on a sheet of yellow legal paper 
i see no hope in the american government nor do i see fairness 
in october a federal jury acquitted both men on federal 
hostagetaking and firearms charges after a threeweek trial but a 
robeson county grand jury indicted the two indians in december on 
kidnapping charges 
after the indictment hatcher was arrested in pembroke but jacobs 
sought sanctuary at the onondaga indian reservation near syracuse 
ny 
hatcher later fled to the same reservation after his 25000 bond 
was posted by the national council of churches he then left new 
york and sought refuge on the fort hall reservation in idaho 
disappearing from that reservation several weeks ago after being 
taken under tribal custody 
jacobs was arrested in new york after leaving the reservation a 
state judge is considering whether he should be extradited to north 
carolina to face the charges 
both men have claimed their lives would be in jeopardy if they 
return to robeson county 
in a telephone call from the consulate to the associated press 
bureau in raleigh nc hatcher said he gave the soviets documents 
and news articles to support his plea for political asylum 
bernadette sambrano a member of the international indian treaty 
council who was with hatcher inside the consulate said the soviets 
rejected his request and asked him to leave hatcher was arrested by 
fbi agents as soon as he walked off the grounds 
sergei aivazion soviet press attache for the consulate said he 
had no comment on the incident chuck latting spokesman for the 
fbis san francisco office was also not immediately available for 
comment his office said 
the people in the united states are always crying about human 
rights violations in the soviet union hatcher said in the 
telephone interview i want them to know about the human rights 
violations in this country against the indians and the poor 
im tired of being persecuted for winning the federal case 
he said 
hatchers attorney civil rights lawyer william kunstler reached 
by the associated press before hatchers surrender said he had 
spoken with his client at the consulate and was waiting to see what 
would happen 
i would urge them to give him sanctuary kunstler said

an internal investigation has uncovered 
improper use of an information computer system of the library of 
congress by some military agencies which may have tried to bypass 
regular pentagon procurement procedures in awarding research 
contracts librarian james h billington said friday 
billington said the library had ordered the federal library and 
information network fedlink to cancel the contracts or transfer 
them to the proper pentagon authorities 
under library of congress jurisdiction fedlink administers 
information and library services contracts on behalf of member 
libraries and information centers in order to get the best possible 
price for the government the services are open to any federal 
agency 
fedlink has grown since 1976 to become the nations largest 
provider of automated library network services according to 
billington it gives government libraries and other government 
participants access to hundreds of databases and to many new 
information technologies 
during the investigation which began in january it was learned 
that fedlink had been signing contracts for services which had 
nothing to do with libraries or information databases according to 
the librarys inspector general john w rensbarger 
he said various contractors were to provide services which 
included an analysis assessments and independent appraisals of 
the navys ahlw night targeting system development of a 
standard missile2 security plan and support of the army 
machine gun program 
by using fedlinks contracting services procurement officers at 
several us military installations such as the navys charleston 
sc shipyard and the air forces seventh communications group in 
washington dc apparently bypassed special pentagon rules on 
competitive bidding and other procurement procedures said 
rensbarger 
he said the questionable contracts involved orders from various 
army navy and air force units totalling some 45 million last 
fiscal year total fedlink activities in the fiscal year which ended 
sept 30 involved contracts for 971 million with 135 vendors to 
provide services for some 1395 different federal entities 
according to the library 
we still do not know why these inappropriate contracts were 
made said rensbarger our investigation and that of the defense 
department are continuing 
a pentagon spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the report

president hosni mubarak of egypt denied 
on friday that his country is assembling swissmade parts that could 
be used to create a chemical weapons plant at abu zaabal north of 
cairo 
this is the first ive heard of it mubarak told reporters 
we are against chemical weapons and of course dont make any 
such factories we dont back the idea of such factories or even 
nuclear ones 
the new york times said friday that us officials believe egypt 
is assembling swissmade parts that could be used to build a 
chemical arms plant 
state department spokesman charles redman said in washington the 
united states opposes all weapons of mass destruction chemical 
biological and nuclear and has raised the issue with egypt 
washington has accused libya the radical north african nation 
bordering egypt of building a plant capable of producing poison gas 
at rabta about 60 miles north of the libyan capital of tripoli 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi has replied this is a medical 
plant 
mubarak spoke friday after he met with senior european economic 
community officials including eec commission president jacques 
delors as part of a european tour to win support for an 
international middle east peace conference which israel opposes 
mubarak also discussed his economic reform program at the eec 
head office 
the swiss engineering company krebs ag said friday it has cut 
its business links with a militaryindustrial complex in egypt that 
reportedly planned to build the poison gas plant 
krebs said it believed the parts it shipped to egypt would be 
used to produce pharmaceuticals krebs president hans rudolf 
weber told the associated press on friday that the company severed 
its business relationship with the egyptian complex on advice of the 
swiss government he would not elaborate 
the new york times report said krebs delivered to egypt parts 
that will be installed in the plant which it said is part of a 
militaryindustrial complex that is also scheduled to include a 
joint egyptianamerican plant for assembling the m1 tank 
mohammed wahby a spokesman for egypts embassy in washington 
denied the report earlier we are not involved in the manufacture 
of chemical weapons the times quoted him as saying 
the times quoted an unidentified us official as saying bush 
administration efforts to stop proliferation of chemical weapons 
applies to all countries and not just those which have had hostile 
relations with america 
the newspaper quoted another us official as saying washington 
recently told cairo it was concerned about the project 
redman said the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in 
areas of instability such as the middle east is a particular 
concern and the united states has urged all states in the region 
to forgo the development and acquisition of all such weapons 
he said the issue has been raised with egypt but gave no details 
in the case of egypt we consult frequently and closely on 
these kind of subjects redman said the krebsegyptian project 
again illustrates the difficulties of controlling production 
technologies that have dual uses both legitimate civilian uses and 
potential chemical weapons uses 
we have been in touch on this particular issue with the swiss 
government for some time the attitude of the swiss government has 
been serious and responsible

hungarys new president of parliament 
said friday the brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty for 
soviet allies is dead 
also friday the official mti news agency reported the ruling 
communist party has committed itself to reforms that include free 
elections in a multipleparty system representative democracy and a 
free press the party also expressed willingness to form a coalition 
government 
matyas szyeroes elected president of the body friday told a 
news conference that hungary must never be servile and accept advice 
that would erode its independence 
in hungariansoviet relations the brezhnev doctrine is 
already dead said szueroes the communist party central 
committees secretary in charge of foreign affairs 
the brezhnev doctrine permits military intervention in a 
soviet bloc country in the event of a liberal insurrection the late 
president leonid i brezhnev announced it after the red arnmy 
crushed the liberal prague spring of 1968 in czechoslovakia 
secretary of state james a baker iii this week urged soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to renounce the doctrine 
those in the east should be free of the fear that armed soviet 
intervention justified by the brezhnev doctrine would be used 
again to deny them choice baker said in a speech in vienna on 
monday 
in an interview published in the magyar nemzet daily on march 4 
szueroes said soviethungarian relations did not develop over the 
years in the spirit of equal rights and mutual benefits 
the brezhnev doctrine caused a further deformation 
accompanied by greater power aspects on the one side and a kind of 
servility on the other as well as insistence on certain dogmas 
until the mid1980s he said 
those comments and others szueroes made in a radio interview 
indicated criticism of the hungarian leadership under party chief 
janos kadar who was replaced by karoly grosz in may 
on friday szueroes said even at the time of the brezhnev 
doctrine a lot depended on the leadership of the small countries 
whether they subjected themselves to it or tried to serve more 
consistently the interests of their own country 
he also reiterated an earlier statement that in the future 
hungary could adopt a neutral foreign policy 
in an action program published friday the policymaking central 
committee said it supports representative democracy and an 
independent judiciary free elections and open politics based on the 
constitution 
it also expressed willingness to consider the possibility of 
coalition in governing 
other pledges in the document adopted tuesday and carried friday 
the mti news agency included independent trade unions and interest 
groups free creative and intellectual work freedom of conscience 
and religion individual rights and administration free of 
corruption 
the document said the reforms could be preserved by legal 
guarantees openenness and a reponsible free press 
the document also mentioned mistakes by the communist 
leadership under kadar who gained power after soviet troops crushed 
the hungarian uprising of 1956 
in emphasizing the need for reform the central committee said 
the current economic and political structure was full of 
mistakes 
last month the leadership said it would accept a new 
constitution that omits references to the partys leading role and 
endorses the development of a pluralistic society 
hungary has embarked on an ambitious reform program parliament 
approved a set of draft principles this week that justice ministry 
officials said would guarantee a multiparty system and separation of 
powers 
in another development friday interior minister istvan horvath 
outlined a program to deal with the continuing influx of refugees 
from neighboring romania he said romania continued to discriminate 
against minorities many of whom are ethnic hungarians 
horvath said romania approved 1936 emigration requests last 
year more than double the number in 1987 he said the government 
plans to set up refugee stations to process residency requests

hundreds of students marched friday 
protesting the governments employment policies and about 150 began 
a hunger strike 
their action added tension to the crisis over the formation of a 
new government by prime minister sadek mahdi 
leaders of some of sudans political parties and trade unions in 
an effort to force madi to resign announced friday they would not 
consult with the prime minister 
egypts middle east news agency reported that the opposition 
leaders after a fivehour meeting decided to send an ultimatum to 
mahdi insisting he step down within 24 hours they did not say what 
they would do if mahdi refused 
representatives from mahdis umma party and the national islamic 
front which is a partner in the coalition cabinet did not attend 
the meeing there was no immediate reaction to the ultimatum from 
mahdi 
last month the army demanded that mahdi and the umma party open 
negotiations with other groups to form a broadbased cabinet that 
would arrange a peace agreement with the rebels of the peoples 
liberation army and end the 6yearold civil war in southern sudan 
the army on thursday repeated its demand western diplomats said 
the army action implied the threat of a military takeover but 
senior generals did not appear ready to move against mahdi 
the dispute began in january when the democratic unionist party 
the second largest party in parliament quit mahdis government 
because he refused to endorse a proposed peace agreement the 
democratic unionists had worked out with the peoples liberation 
army on nov 16 
one of the clauses in that agreement calls for the suspension of 
islamic laws a condition rejected by the national islamic front 
about 850 graduate students took part in the march protesting 
regulations requiring language examinations before possible 
employment in the public sector 
police stood guard friday night outside the building where the 
hunger strikers began their fast the government promised to respond 
within a day to the protesters demand that the the language tests 
be ended 
faddlallah ali fadl minister of administrative reform said the 
tests were to screen graduates for available positions but the 
protesters claimed they were designed to reduce employment 
in a similar protest last year students set fire to a government 
employment office

a pipe bomb friday destroyed a van driven by the 
wife of of the skipper of the uss vincennes which mistakenly shot 
down an iranian airliner last year authorities suspect it was a 
terrorist attack 
sharon rogers escaped just seconds before the van burst into 
flames 
they the fbi view this incident as an act of retribution 
against capt rogers for the incident in the middle east said ted 
royster assistant special agent in charge of the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms los angeles field office he said he assigned 
six agents to help the fbi 
a justice department source in washington who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said investigators suspect the bombing was the work of 
terrorists however local fbi investigators would not confirm that 
theory 
we have no motive at this point in time certainly we have no 
suspects tom hughes special agent in charge of the local fbi 
office told reporters 
we certainly do not rule out the potential retribution to capt 
rogers for his command in the navy he said but on the same 
token this could have been perpetrated for some other reason unknown 
at this time 
mrs rogers was uninjured and was taken to a police station 
where she was joined by her husband capt will rogers iii rogers 
was home at the time of the blast and authorities placed the family 
under protection their son was away at college and was notified 
mrs rogers a school teacher was driving alone to school and 
was stopped at a red light when the bomb exploded at 745 am the 
pipe bomb was planted on the underside of the white toyota van 
police spokesman bill robinson said 
robinson said pieces of the pipe bomb were recovered 
nevertheless the fbi was not prepared to confirm the type of 
device the type of explosive used or how it was detonated hughes 
said 
she got out just as it blew said kurt lent a construction 
worker who witnessed the explosion 
john christy owner of a nearby masonry company said he heard 
two loud pops followed by a loud explosion running outside he saw 
the vehicle engulfed in flames and a woman standing near it 
for what had just happened she reacted like a real strong 
type of person she took it very well he said she just 
wanted me to call her husband i called her husband he came down 
here maybe about four minutes later they embraced and went from 
there 
a message from the rogerses was relayed by cmdr david dillon 
spokesman for the naval surface force pacific fleet to which the 
vincennes is assigned 
i talked with capt rogers and mrs rogers this morning at the 
police station they wanted to pass on that mrs rogers was fine and 
in good shape he said 
asked about rogers reaction to the bombing dillon said i 
think hes just exasperated by the whole thing obviously hes 
concerned about what happened to his wife they just want to get on 
to other things 
investigators went to the rogerses home to check for any other 
bombs and authorities investigated a report of a vehicle following 
mrs rogers 
there was a vehicle that was observed in the area at the time 
of the detonation and were looking into that right now said fbi 
spokesman ronald orrantia there was no immediate claim of 
responsibility 
the navy increased its security at the san diego navy base and 
other facilities navy chief craig huebler said other vincennes 
crewmembers and their families were notified 
the vincennes a guidedmissile cruiser based in san diego 
returned from its sixmonth persian gulf deployment last october it 
remains in port and rogers remains its skipper 
as the vincennes exchanged fire with iranian speedboats last july 
3 iran air flight 655 appeared on the us warships hightech 
radar after the plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and 
military channels rogers gave the order to fire 
the decision he said later was in defense of his ship and crew 
but what rogers feared was an iranian f14 fighter actually was an 
airbus a300 wih 290 people aboard all of whom died the reagan 
administration defended the decision but also decided to compensate 
the victims families 
after the shooting irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called for 
an allout war against the united states speculation after the 
december destruction of a pan am jetliner over lockerbie scotland 
focused on whether that bombing was in retaliation for the 
vincennes action 
fbi special agent gene riehl said investigators were not ruling 
anything out in fridays bombing 
the fact that she is the wife of the captain of the vincennes 
you could draw your own conclusions about whether its a random 
bombing or theres some connection he said were not making 
any suppositions 
in washington navy officials at the pentagon said they were 
unaware of any threats against rogers or his family but were 
awaiting additional reports from san diego 
after the vincennes returned to san diego rogers expressed 
regret over the deaths of the iranian passengers 
i as well as my crew will live with the result of the tragic 
loss of civilian lives associated with these actions tempered only 
by the belief i had no other course of action and that any prudent 
commanding officer would do the same he said 
robinson said no other bombs were found on the van the blast and 
fire shattered the vans windows flattened its tires and melted its 
paint 
lent who watched the van explode said he heard a pair of 
backfires separated by a 10second interval and then a loud 
explosion 
it went boom boom then bam he said it worked 
real quick 
after seeing that she got out of the van lent ran to the flaming 
vehicle to make sure no one was inside he and fellow workers 
directed traffic while their supervisor escorted her to a pickup 
she was shaken up obviously said lew davis another worker 
police sealed off the area and the fbi took over the 
investigation from local authorities naval investigative service

military security is paramount here the home of 
the nations largest navy complex with 12 major facilities including 
a submarine base two air stations and a vast marine corps base 
san diego is a big navy town it security is a big concern 
for us and a big concern for the navy police sgt dave douglas 
said friday 
security was tightened friday following a bomb attack on a van 
driven by the wife of capt will rogers iii the uss vincennes 
commander who directed the attack that mistakenly downed an iranian 
airliner 
we dont discuss security we just say its an increase in 
security measures said navy chief craig huebler spokesman for 
the naval base san diego increased heightened awareness 
no special measures were imposed in october when the vincennes 
returned from its deployment in the persian gulf he said the ship 
was protecting oil and merchant shipping from crossfire of the 
iraniraq war 
we had no special security arrangments made at the time nor 
have there been any special security arrangements made with anybody 
aboard the ship or their families huebler said 
there also is no record of any threats being made against rogers 
his family or any other crewmember of the vincennes he said 
state rep bill lowery a rogers family friend said the captain 
said friday that he hadnt expected to be vulnerable in san diego 
the nations sixthlargest city known as much as a sunny vacation 
spot as a military town 
rogers said those stationed abroad certainly realize theyre at 
peril lowery said but no one expects you have to be worrying 
about your wives and kids back home lowery quoted rogers as 
saying 
rogers and wife were being protected as was their son who is 
attending school in colorado officials said the couple had been 
living in the la jolla area as rogers awaited his next assignment 
fbi and naval investigative services agents police and 
bombsniffing dogs made a sweep of the rogers home and neighborhood 
friday after the explosion 
huebler said a decision on further security measures would depend 
on what is discovered by the fbi which is conducting the 
investigation into the bombing protecting offbase personnel 
presents difficulties huebler added 
youre talking about a family living out in the san diego 
community and when youre living in that environment theres not a 
great deal that you can do on a regular basis he said 
there are 141000 sailors and marines in the san diego area 
including the camp pendleton marine corps base because of the 
number of personnel combined with the total acreage of navy and 
marine facilities it is commonly considered the nations largest 
navy complex huebler said 
the marine corps is under the direction of the secretary of the 
navy 
largescale security exercises are held annually in san diego 
and all of the bases go through their own security exercises 
annually huebler said there have not been any major breaches of 
security in san diego he said

the state supreme court cleared the way 
friday for the execution of a man who killed 14 relatives ruling 
that he knowingly and intelligently had waived his right to 
appeal the death sentence 
r gene simmons is scheduled to be executed by injection thursday 
if no appeal is made to the federal courts no one has been executed 
in arkansas in 25 years 
the bodies of his relatives were found in his home and property 
near dover where authorities ities went after simmons was arrested 
for a 40minute shooting rampage in russellville on dec 28 1987 
simmons 48 was sentenced to death last month for the slayings 
and on thursday simmons asked the high court to hurry its review of 
his competency to waive appeals from last months conviction 
after a careful review of the record and exhibits we affirm 
the trial courts decision that the petitioner has knowingly and 
intelligently waived his right to appeal the court said in its 
threepage opinion 
simmons also was convicted last may of killing two people during 
the russellsville rampage and was sentenced to death 
in august us district judge g thomas eisele halted his 
execution for those killings but on thursday lifted his order after 
consulting with simmons and john wesley hall an attorney appointed 
to review the simmons first trial transcript for possible 
appealable errors 
simmons conviction for the russellville slayings was challenged 
by the rev louis franz a death penalty opponent who contended in 
both courts that simmons was not competent to waive the appeal 
franz lawyer mark cambiano said franz would not intervene in 
the second conviction 
the decision to appeal or not appeal is a personal one 
simmons told reporters after eiseles decision he said he would 
not be strongarmed by any courts to justify his decision 
after an execution date was set in the first trial simmons asked 
that no one interfere in the case he said the sentence was just 
pleading let the torture and suffering in me end

eastern airlines fought back against a crippling 
strike friday by packing its northeast shuttle with passengers at 
12 a head and announcing restoration of 80 flights a day mostly 
latin american and top domestic routes 
but thousands of angry and confused eastern ticket holders trying 
to get refunds or fly on other carriers learned they would have to 
pay more or put in their claims in us bankruptcy court where the 
carrier filed for chapter 11 reorganization on thursday 
a judge in new york extended his order barring commuter railroad 
workers from honoring any picket lines thrown up by easterns 
striking machinists union 
on friday lawyers for the machinists said they would ask the 
bankruptcy court to unfreeze striking workers final prestrike 
paychecks since judge burton r lifland on thursday allowed eastern 
to pay nonstriking employees 
it seems not coincidental that the timing of the bankruptcy was 
intended to deny these employees the wages for the work they 
performed said attorney robert clayman the 8500 machinists are 
owed about 75 million dollars 
we are going to rebuild this airline in prudent sensible 
increments and get our men and women back to work so they can 
support their families eastern president phil bakes said friday 
this is the beginning of a new smaller restructured and viable 
eastern airlines 
eastern said the more than 140 daily flights including 62 
shuttle flights connecting boston new york and washington would be 
operated with picket linecrossing employees who have been with the 
company since before the start of the strike saturday over easterns 
demand for contract concessions 
but strikers charged the crews on the restored flights beginning 
sunday and monday will be from easterns sister carrier continental 
airlines and vowed to extend pickets to that airline treating 
parent texas air corp as a single company 
eastern pilots honoring the picket lines also accused the company 
of stepping up its campaign to threaten coerce and otherwise 
entice pilots to cross the picket line 
this includes illegal offers of bonuses for second officers and 
phone calls to pilots homes attempting to intimidate spouses and 
even their children with threats that their breadwinner will never 
be able to work again for eastern said ron cole an air line 
pilots association spokesman 
more than 300 workers from around new jersey rallied friday in 
support of the eastern machinists offering them money and help 
walking picket lines 
i have never seen this kind of solidarity said matthew 
adams aflcio regional representative from washington dc 
from the rally workers went to newark international airport for 
a demonstration outside the terminal used by continental police 
estimated 350400 people rallied at the airport 
at new york citys laguardia airport three of the regions 
democratic congressmen thomas downey gary ackerman and charles 
schumer joined strikers on the picket line outside the eastern 
shuttle terminal 
most of easterns pilots and flight attendants honored the 
machinists picket lines and the airlines prestrike schedule of 
1050 flights a day had fallen to 62 flights a day on its northeast 
shuttle and three a week to latin america 
that pushed the nations seventhlargest carrier to file for 
financial reorganization thursday in the fifthbiggest chapter 11 
filing in terms of company assets the strike is costing eastern 
about 4 million a day 
eastern management listed more than 45 billion in net assets 
339 billion in liabilities and 15696 creditors 
in washington presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked 
if there was any chance president bush might change his mind on 
intervening in the eastern strike hes not rethinking it 
fitzwater said 
frank borman the former astronaut who once headed eastern 
blamed the strike and the airlines decision to file for chapter 11 
on charles bryan head of the international association of 
machinists 
borman said thursday in las cruces nm where he lives that 
eastern had good relations with the union before bryans 1980 
election 
we had the biggest profitsharing program in the industry 
borman said adding that bryan terminated that program when he was 
elected 
the first eastern shuttle to leave boston for new york and 
washington with the new 12 oneway fare friday had 92 people on 
board said a spokesman for the massachusetts port authority which 
operates logan international airport 
although figures were not immediately available for passengers 
who took advantage of the offer throughout the day eastern 
spokesman robin matell said that demand had exceeded capacity 
the previous weekend fare for the shuttle was 69 and the 
original 99 weekday fare was lowered to 49 spokesman phil 
orlandella said previous shuttle flights during the strike carried 
as few as seven passengers 
many holders of eastern tickets learned they would have to pay 
higher fares on most other carriers or join a long line of unsecured 
creditors seeking refunds in us bankruptcy court in new york 
this has been one of those days that we all hope would never 
happen said phil davidoff presidentelect of the 23000member 
american society of travel agents 
but a threat to the 320000 commuters who use trains in the new 
york city area eased when a federal judge who had temporarily 
barred commuter railroad workers from honoring picket lines 
extended his order indefinitely beyond a friday midnight deadline 
pending his decision on whether to allow picketing 
a federal appeals court panel in philadelphia issued a similar 
ban for that area 
eastern intends to resume its profitable service between miami 
and 13 latin american cities and restore flights linking boston and 
washington miami and san juan puerto rico miami and new york and 
new york and montreal eastern officials in miami said 
the exact number of nonunion employees who will be recalled to 
help had not been determined they said the carrier laid off 9500 
nonunion employees this week and said it had 200 pilots available 
before shutting most routes monday 
those pilots will cover our new schedule eastern spokeswoman 
cory zywotow said adding that since the bankruptcy filing pilots 
have been calling in to report back to work 
but machinists union officer wally haber charged eastern has 
brought 100 pilots and 60 mechanics from continental to miami to 
wear eastern uniforms and operate the restored flights denying 
eastern pilots would cross picket lines 
if were successful he texas air chairman frank lorenzo wont 
build anything until we have some new management at eastern with 
new management at eastern we can settle our differences in 24 
hours haber said 
jb stokes an 17year eastern pilot and spokesman for the air 
line pilots association said a retraining program was allowing 
eastern to expand its routes 
theyre going to be able to slightly augment the current 
schedule but theyre just trying to maximize the available pool of 
pilots he said theyve moved them to different locations to 
give the image of its expanded flight schedule 
eastern employment stood at 31200 before the strike was launched 
march 4 but has shrunk to 1500 most of the 3600 pilots and 5900 
flight attendants honored picket lines set up by the 8500member 
machinists union 
about 3200 eastern workers have filed for 26 weeks of 
unemployment benefits at a temporary office set up in miami and 
another office is being set up strictly for job placement 
my offices are really really strained said marianne 
salazar employment and training regional manager for the florida 
state labor department 
jose marquez a 10year flight attendant went to apply for 
unemployment with his wife and 2yearold son i think senior 
people might come back to work but not me he said 
those are eligible for benefits will receive about half their 
average weekly wages up to 200 for up to 26 weeks they also must 
actively seek employment

this is the first story in a threepart easter 
series the military and jesus about jesus and his involvement 
with the roman rulers of the time based on the bible and historical 
and ancient noncanonical christian writings 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fall in the roman troops roused from their barracks in the 
second watch of night sleepily formed ranks in the compound 
alongside the towering fortress antonia in the militaryruled colony 
of judea 
orders for the covert midnight arrest of the galilean agitator 
jesus had come directly from the roman procurator pontius pilate 
the company centurion slapped his vitus staff of command against 
his leg lanterns on the wall cast flickering streaks on the 
cobblestones and the helmets and bucklers worn by scores of men 
it seemed an unnecessarily heavy force to deploy for seizing this 
single hinterlands rabbi one biblical account says an entire roman 
cohort 600strong was involved although such designations 
were commonly applied to units short of a full complement some 
scholars believe a smaller contingent perhaps reduced by the 
centurions assessment of the situation assembled that night 
the officer certainly didnt want a massed parade through the 
incendiary city of jerusalem column of twos he ordered the 
men shuffled into a thinner line for the road 
then he waited leaders of the adjoining jewish temple had agreed 
to provide an informant to lead the troops to the galileans 
nighttime camp 
cooperation of these sadducean oligarchs served handily in 
controlling this unruly judean province their collaboration was 
assured by the appointive authority pilate wielded over them 
rome had ousted four high priests before finding a sufficiently 
compliant one in the current officeholder caiaphas 
ancient noncanonical christian writings describe a flow of 
messages between him and pilate but their liaison had to be kept 
secret to avoid inflaming the populace 
once when word slipped out that caiaphas was supplying funds to 
pilate from the temple treasury to build an aqueduct an angry 
throng jammed the plaza beside the fort and temple 
they were outraged that sacrificial tithes of shekels would be 
diverted to the heathen roman oppressor bad enough were the 
empires commercial levies paid in roman money but diverting holy 
funds to pagan purposes seemed utter profanation 
to quell the upheaval pilate had ordered 400 soldiers four 
centuries to mingle among the demonstrators disguised as jewish 
civilians but armed with swords and clubs hidden under their cloaks 
at his signal they laid on amid cries and moans a great 
number were slain many trodden to death while others ran 
away wounded recounts the ancient historian josephus 
another time pilate had a 120horse wing of cavalry ambush a 
procession of singing samaritans at their holy mountain slaying and 
scattering them wantonly 
because of such ruthlessness jews customarily spat whenever a 
roman soldier passed however this peculiarly crowdrousing jesus 
apparently didnt hate the military something the waiting centurion 
had learned from fellow officers 
the story had come from capernaum in galilee where a fellow 
centurion was stationed with a small garrison 
as the account went the capernaum centurions sergeant had 
become critically ill having heard how the roving galilean teacher 
strengthened the sick the centurion sought him out 
lord i am not worthy to have you come under my roof the 
centurion says in matthew 8 but only say the word and my servant 
will be healed for i am a man under authority with soldiers under 
me 
jesus marveled telling his men truly i say to you not even 
in israel have i found such faith he added something about 
sustaining people of all kinds east and west and told the 
centurion go be it done for you as you have believed 
the centurion found his sergeant suddenly well again 
it was an odd case a jew powerfully befriending a gentile a 
roman devotee to the imperial gods and part of a foreign military 
occupation force in a conquered land a strange beneficence 
the centurion assigned to arrest jesus drew his redtinged cloak 
tighter about his shoulders still waiting for the temple crew he 
had heard another story indicating jesus even understood the 
rudiments of arms 
as recorded in luke 14 jesus observed and what king going to 
encounter another king in war will not sit down first and take 
counsel whether he is able with 10000 to meet him who comes against 
him with 20000 
while likely referring to the costs of serving his cause as 
bible scholars say it nevertheless showed his practical awareness 
of military operations 
also some of his own men bore arms a puzzling aspect brought 
out at his last supper with them luke 22 relates that when one of 
his men said look lord here are two swords he said it is 
enough 
one apostle was a zealot member of an antiroman revolutionary 
faction that vowed no ruler but god romans called them 
sicarri for the concealed daggers they carried 
at the irongrilled gate the temple functionaries appeared 
clamorous blustering a mob a priest gestured toward a dourfaced 
civilian hell show you the place 
the centurion wanted no hubbub no unnecessary noise no calling 
cadence by his men route step and keep it quiet they filed 
through the gate and circled around the temple as the city slept 
its temporary calm was a relief in this turbulent time of 
passover disorders had flared like scattered brushfires across the 
city keeping troops doubletiming to put down one outbreak after 
another 
several troublemakers and brigands had been imprisoned including 
an insurrectionist ringleader barrabas captured in a melee 
involving fatalities 
the centurions detachment moved through the sheep gate and down 
the trail into the kidron valley overspread with tents of pilgrims 
smouldering camp fires and knots of squatting peasants in low talk 
the soldiers tracked up the mount of olives their way lit by 
flaring torches at a clearing near an abandoned oil press they 
spotted the prey the informant slouched forward and kissed the 
wanted man on the cheek the agreed signal 
temple minions lunged toward jesus and one of his men brashly 
whipped out a sword slashing off one mans ear but jesus sternly 
intervened put your sword back in its place for all who take the 
sword will perish by the sword 
he said he could summon 12 legions of angels to defend him if 
he wanted but didnt amazingly he restored the dangling ear lobe 
and under the glare of torches calmly regarded the arresting band 
have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to 
capture me day after day i was with you in the temple teaching and 
you did not seize me but let the scriptures be fulfilled 
the centurion had the man bound and led back across the valley 
another passover prisoner it seemed a questionable case but orders 
were orders

shortly before dawn the centurion longinus began buckling on his 
gear a courier had brought word of an early morning execution it 
smelled of a rush job apparently timed before the fractious holiday 
crowds clogged the streets 
some sort of trial was already nearing its conclusion in the 
governors atrium at the fort the prisoner jesus a hillcountry 
jew who captivated the multitudes had been arrested by a roman 
patrol only last midnight 
longinus had been tapped to finish the business an orderly 
fastened the padded bronze greaves around his lower legs and 
tightened the thongs holding the protective leather cuirass on his 
chest 
he slipped on the feltcushioned bronze shoulder pieces called 
heart guards and drew on his helmet with its lined cheek 
pieces hinged visor and decorative crest 
his name isnt specified in scripture but ancient writings 
identify him as longinus scripture makes clear that his role in 
jesus final hours keenly troubled him 
but for the moment it only seemed puzzling that the military 
governor pontius pilate would be conducting a trial at such an 
early hour after the prisoner had been shuffled about through the 
night among pilate the high priest caiaphas the galilean puppet 
herod and now pilate again 
longinus had heard reports of the stir this fellow jesus caused 
the throngs he attracted his popularity with ordinary people left 
both local and roman authorities apprehensive about how to curb him 
they feared the people scripture says they did not find 
anything they could do for all the people hung upon his words 
but pilate a master of ruthless artifice and caiaphas his 
tractable romesanctioned high priest had maneuvered to avoid a 
public outcry by acting between midnight and the edge of day 
longinus recalled the scene a week ago when the galilean rode 
into the city to cheers of an ecstatic throng hosanna they 
cried meaning save us they waved leafy branches spreading 
fronds and garments in front of him 
son of david blessed be he who comes in the name of the lord 
even the king of israel hosanna in the highest 
next day roman sentries in turrets of the fort overlooking the 
temple square had watched jesus onslaught on the commerce there 
swinging a braided whip overturning moneychanging tables and 
merchants booths driving out dealers tourists and guards alike 
my house shall be called a house of prayer but you have made 
it a den of robbers he thundered 
longinus directed a sergeant to turn out a sixman detail in 
front of the guardhouse before heading there himself he nibbled 
some figs and a chunk of honeyed bread 
centurions were career officers the backbone of the roman army 
senior centurions commanded centuries of l00 men each with 10 
maniples or squads 
under the legionary tribunes in charge of 600man cohorts the 
centurions were responsibile for discipline drill inspections 
quartermaster supplies and operations efficiency of the roman 
legions depended on them 
the roman historian polybius wrote 
centurions are required not to be bold and adventurous so much 
as good leaders of steady and prudent mind not prone to take the 
offensive or start fighting wantonly but able when overwhelmed and 
hardpressed to stand fast and die at their posts 
scholars believe four roman legions were stationed in the 
judeangalilean province at that time the 3rd 6th 10th and 12th 
each with about 6000 men at full strength each legion included a 
cavalry wing siege weapons camels for carrying supplies slingers 
archers and other infantry soldiers most were mercenary auxiliaries 
recruited from thrace syria gaul germany and other imperial 
provinces 
pilate kept the bulk of his forces at his headquarters in the 
coastal city of caesarea but he regularly brought reinforcement to 
jerusalem for the jewish passover when the annual influx of 
pilgrims turned the city into a tinderbox of turmoil and clamor 
against the colonial yoke 
longinus left his quarters and strode to the guardhouse where his 
detail loitered with their legionary ensign crucifixion tools and 
spears the iron points topping wooden shafts 
the sound of a flogging floated out from the guardroom the crack 
of the bonetipped flagellum mingling with the whoops of soldiers as 
they roughed up a prisoner taunting him as king slapping him about 
shortly three condemned culprits were jostled into the yard one 
of them jesus badly mauled lacerated and bleeding a circle of 
thorns jammed on his head 
longinus winced but his martial demeanor returned automatically 
he was a professional an adjutant brought from pilates chambers 
the execution tags to be hung around the prisoners necks 
two of them were simply stamped thief but the third verdict 
for treason was written out in pilates scrawl for jesus king of 
the jews 
pilate as procurator held the jus gladii full powers of 
criminal justice only he in this restive province could impose 
capital punishment he did so regularly a common fate for resistant 
jews for a quarter century their landscape had been spiny with 
crosses 
longinus aligned his detail with the prisoners each carrying a 
heavy crossbeam and moved them off through the jerusalem streets 
onlookers trailed the procession shoving gawking curiously as 
temple subordinates scoffed and some women wept over the maimed 
weakened jesus 
he kept falling under the heavy beam and longinus brusquely 
conscripted a muscular african onlooker to carry it 
when they reached the execution site golgotha place of the 
skulls it was still early only the third hour 9 am says the 
earliest account in mark the prisoners were bound to the 
crossbeams thick nails pounded through their wrists once the beams 
were hoisted by pulleys to the uprights the convicts feet were 
nailed to the posts 
the tortuous ordeal stretched on the shooting bursts of pain 
the convulsions the straining upward to breathe the massive 
cramps the writhing limbs the temple claque jeered women sobbed 
the thieves screamed and raved jesus exhibited stoic grit 
father forgive them for they know not what they do 
at the foot of the cross soldiers threw dice for jesus robe 
longinus allowed it it was a roman rule to the executioner 
belonged the spoila 
at noon the sky darkened thunder crashed and a shuddering 
earthquake rent the ground the overcast continued until the ninth 
hour when jesus cried loudly father into thy hands i commit my 
spirit 
he had died in only six hours usually crucifixion took about 
l2 a spearman ran him through to make sure he was dead 
longinus looked up at him as the sun broke through and a bird 
chirped 
certainly this man was innocent he murmured truly this 
man was a son of god

tom was great i trusted him fully thats important when 
youre so vulnerable emotionally and physically and for the first 
time it was wonderful i was very fortunate 
zuniga considers herself fortunate in most of her films in the 
sure thing which costarred john cusack she was helped by the 
sensitive direction of reiner 
rob was an actor so there was no problem with communication 
none whatsoever she said he understands about romance and love 
and all those feelings very well i just fully trusted him to bring 
out qualities that i wasnt in touch with or didnt remember 
i was worried about being funny enough but rob pointed out 
that comedy comes from reality 
but for brooks mastermind of such offthewall films as 
blazing saddles and young frankenstein comedy comes from 
every direction zuniga was admittedly nervous about working with a 
director whose previous stars included such wacky comedians as 
madeline kahn and teri garr 
my background was in dramatic training and much more realistic 
i really had to trust him and he really helped me find that big 
isnt necessarily bad in fact its preferred 
she found brooks to be serious about his work however sometimes 
running his crew through multiple takes and had a similar 
experience with ball discovering that televisions zany lucy 
ricardo was a dedicated professional 
shes very serious about what shes doing zuniga said she 
knows what works for her and i really had to earn her respect in 
the very beginning she said i looked wonderful but i had to speak 
up and express more i took that as a sign that i wasnt satisfying 
her but that wasnt it at all she was very warm and supportive 
zuniga has long been involved in social causes accompanying her 
mother to antiwar rallies the actress cofounded young artists 
united an organization of hollywood activists and is also a member 
of cispes the committee in solidarity with the people of el 
salvador her father is from guatemala and is especially concerned 
about human rights in central america 
my family has been threatened so its not just an intellectual 
commitment its something deeper she said my parents not only 
cared about issues but expressed it they were both students and 
both were very expressive they said if you believed in something 
you should pursue it 
she has certainly been determined to advance her acting career 
and is anxious to try as many different roles as possible 
i have been offered a few genre films special effects movies 
but i really feel like i havent been typecast because ive played a 
real broad variety of parts 
im just reading scripts and would like to do something more 
down to earth where my leading man stays a human being through the 
whole thing

picture a football field piled with radioactive 
gloves rags papers research animal carcasses bandages tools 
filters and stuff that makes exit signs glow then picture it piled 
500 feet high 
thats 225 million cubic feet of lowlevel nuclear waste all of 
it generated since 1980 when congress essentially got out of the 
radioactive rubbish business and told the states you make it you 
take it 
waste is something thats undesirable or else they would call 
it gold its an intruder said marvin resnikoff of the 
radioactive waste campaign which opposes the new sites people 
dont want waste in their backyard 
lowlevel waste is everything that isnt spent fuel or the 
leftovers from the making of nuclear bombs 
about 90 percent of the volume and 97 percent of the 
radioactivity comes from power plants and industrial sources other 
stuff comes from research labs hospitals and medical centers that 
use radiation as treatment 
most of the slop becomes innocuous in a short time but iodine 
129 has a halflife of 16 million years and technetium 99 will lose 
half its potency in 212000 years other potent elements include 
cesium 137 strontium 90 cobalt 60 and carbon 14 
the key date in the new national policy is jan 1 1993 when 
states must take title to their own garbage and the only three 
commercial repositories will close their gates to states outside 
their regions 
congress encouraged states to save money and headaches by banding 
together in regional compacts to date nine compacts including 41 
states have been formed five states are going it alone and the rest 
remain unaligned 
experts say 14 new sites are more than are necessary the cost of 
building and operating 14 sites for 30 years would be 22 billion 
to 54 billion according to a us department of energy report to 
the congress last year 
three or four sites could do the same job according to the 
electric power research institute 
its three times more than enough said ed helminski 
publisher of the radioactive exchange a washington dc 
periodical that focuses on nuclear issues 
its politics nobody wants nuclear waste said us rep 
butler derrick dsc who coauthored the lowlevel waste laws 
its a matter of the states not wanting to act and wanting to dump 
on someone else 
congress got involved in 1980 after the governors of south 
carolina nevada and washington said they would close sites in their 
states concerned about poorly packed containers and trucking 
accidents they balked at being the nations dumping ground 
three other sites closed by 1978 and have since leaked radiation 
they are at maxey flats ky sheffield ill and west valley 
ny which environmentalists called kick and roll dumps because 
drums were kicked off a truck rolled into a ditch and covered with 
dirt 
in the past all wastes were buried but because of leaks 11 of 
the 14 new repositories will limit or ban burial they will shield 
wastes in concrete burial vaults or above ground clusters that will 
be mounded with layers of dirt 
there were some problems with past practice said steve 
romano of us ecology inc which buried wastes in illinois and 
kentucky cardboard boxes and crates were thrown haphazardly into 
a trench lets move on from that and prevent it from happening 
again 
annual waste generation hit a peak of 377 million cubic feet in 
1980 fell to 27 million cubic feet in 1985 and dipped to 143 
million cubic feet last year according to the us department of 
energy 
it has to go somewhere we cant drown in our own waste said 
douglas eldridge general counsel of the new york lowlevel 
radioactive waste disposal facility siting commission 
not counting transportation states pay about 50 per cubic foot 
of waste the compact price will rise to 100300 per cubic foot 
according to brian farrell program manager on lowlevel wastes for 
the edison electric institute 
some fear high costs could encourage illegal dumping 
its desirable to keep generating costs low enough to provide 
significant incentive against midnight dumping said malcolm knapp 
of the us nuclear regulatory commission 
even if the hightech graveyards improve safety danger wont be 
altogether eliminated according to the us environmental 
protection agency which projects an additional 44 fatal cancers 
over 10000 years for each lowlevel waste site of 250000 cubic 
meters there are 500000 annual cancer deaths from normal causes 
to keep exposures low sites limit the amount of the hottest 
material they take in 
a fence to keep out intruders for 100 years is required at each 
site and the mostcontaminated wastes must either be buried deeper 
or shielded with concrete for 500 years by then the radioactivity 
should pose no health risk although no one is sure if concrete will 
keep its integrity that long 
there are parts that can kill you if youre exposed to them 
said diane darrigo of nuclear information and resource service 
if were going to produce waste we should be responsible to 
future generations who are going to suffer the consequences 
opponents of nuclear dumps are so upset theyve brought buckets 
of tar and feathers to town meetings and created uproars 
michigan is like a sponge sitting in a bathtub were 
surrounded by 95 percent of the fresh surface water supply in the 
country said ellen beal of dont waste michigan who would 
think of something so stupid as to put a nuclear dump here 
jeff dewan a guitarist and carpenter in hays kan wrote 
talkin rad waste blues thats a hit song among nuclear foes in 
kansas and nebraska some lyrics 
i said say mister where you from 
you must think im pretty dumb 
that stuff youre peddlins nuclear trash 
and we dont want your cold hard cash 
to make a repository more acceptable nebraska and illinois will 
offer 1 million a year to the town that takes it pennsylvania also 
plans payments so the host town can attract other industries which 
critics say amounts to a bribe 
its not a bribe said james neal of us ecology the company 
hired to select a site in nebraska its an incentive like a tax 
break free land or free services 
the state making the most headway is california where a 
repository may be open in 1991 in the mojave desert 
the area gets 6 inches of rain a year and the groundwater is 700 
feet below the surface its so dry tracks remain from gen george 
pattons armor drilling for world war ii battles 
fences are needed to keep out the desert tortoise but for the 
most part the repository is accepted because it will bring 15 to 20 
jobs 
its going to be worth several million dollars worth of goods 
services and wages said larry deatley former president of the 
chamber of commerce in needles 23 miles from the site its not a 
smokestack its not coal dust its a safe nonpolluting industry 
that will pay good wages and be an asset to our community

in a backroads town where being a good 
neighbor is as important as church on sunday the prospect of a 
nuclear waste dump has spawned an economic boycott and discordant 
civic meetings its pitted friend against friend 
in january boyd county a sparsely populated agricultural area 
on the south dakota border became one of three semifinalist sites 
in nebraska for a lowlevel radioactive waste dump 
its the most tragic thing thats ever happened here said 
lowell fisher a thirdgeneration rancher whos chairman of the 
save boyd county association 
were not antinuke kooks were not a bunch of political 
activists were babes in the woods when it comes to trying to stop 
this but we live in gods country and we dont want everybody 
elses garbage 
fishers group has garnered 1107 signatures against the dump 
about 3000 people live in boyd county and 1499 voted in the last 
general election 
but jc marcum a retired spencer veterinarian who heads 
people for progress in boyd county is delighted the dump might 
be located within 12 miles of his home 
outside rabble rousers have teamed up with local kooks to 
coerce people into being against the waste site said marcum 
these farmers dont read very much they arent educated on the 
issue they think their property values will be lower but in fact 
theyll be higher and we may get as many as 40 new jobs out of it 
he criticized the dump opponents for boycotting businesses owned 
by supporters people ive known for 35 years wont speak to me 
but that doesnt bother me ive got a thick hide 
about 2 million will be spent this year to study surface and 
ground water geology topography and environmental resources of 
320 acres in boyd county along with similar acreage in two other 
semifinalist counties nuckolls on the nebraskakansas border and 
nemaha on the nebraskaiowa line near the missouri river 
the dump is designed to be an aboveground reinforced concrete 
vault capable of storing five million cubic feet of waste its 
lifespan will be 30 years or full capacity whichever comes first 
radioactive refuse will be trucked in from five states 
the semifinalist sites picked in january resulted from a 
monthslong winnowing process eighty communities at first expressed 
interest in the dumps potential jobs and fees an estimated 40 
million over three decades for local and state government but 
eventually almost all declined not in my backyard 
a dead black cat in his mailbox caused a webster county 
commissioner to switch his vote from favoring to opposing the site 
in his county letters to the editor got bitter and personal 
as long as our governor kay orr and state oppose the right of 
the people to vote on the waste site being placed in their county 
wrote fisher strife will only increase 
federal law mandates that every state have a dump for its 
lowlevel radioactive garbage mostly tools clothing and resin 
from nuclear power plants by jan 1 1993 most states are banding 
with others in regional disposal compacts 
nebraska voted against hosting the central interstate compact 
dump but was outvoted by kansas oklahoma arkansas and louisiana 
who argued that nebraska ranked highest in generated waste and 
environmental suitability 
a referendum which would have made nebraska the first state to 
pull out of a compact was defeated by a nearly 2to1 margin last 
november the citizens group that placed the issue on the ballot 
raised only about 25000 to get its message across compared to the 
15 million spent to defeat the measure by the utility industry 
political analysts believe ads warning that power plants could be 
shut down and hospitals might cut back radiological treatments if 
the initiative passed prompted many ambivalent voters to keep the 
compact 
when initiative 402 was rejected us ecology inc the company 
chosen in 1987 by the compact to find a site and build and operate 
the dump forged ahead the louisville kybased firm disposed of 
nearly half the nations commercial lowlevel radioactive waste in 
1987 
but us ecologys track record is a major cause of concern to 
nebraskas dump opponents because two of its nowclosed lowlevel 
radioactive waste sites leak 
vice president richard paton vows us ecology is committed to 
building a stateoftheart dump in nebraska on a site that will 
meet or exceed public health and safety requirements 
no one can make guarantees about the future said a us 
ecology handbook distributed to nebraskans but through the 
judicious selection of a site that meets or exceeds the siting 
standards and the concept of multiple engineered barriers built 
into our design the situation that occurred at belowground 
disposal facilities built in the 1960s are very unlikely to occur at 
the nebraska facility 
the compact commission delegated siting to us ecology so it 
would be decided on technical merit rather than politics said 
dennis grams director of nebraskas department of environmental 
control adding that his agency would ensure that us ecology meets 
regulations 
this process would have been a lot easier for us if the areas 
had been designated by the state or federal government said us 
ecologys paton but i believe the controversy will die down when 
we show we are not out there to try and do harm 
even so he acknowleged hes been threatened one caller warned 
well take you out feet first 
in acquiescing to host the radioactive facility gov orr imposed 
10 conditions on the compact commission including assurances that 
the developer will not locate the facility in a community without 
the communitys consent 
but faced with a groundswell of opposition in boyd county a 
growing antidump coalition in nemaha county and the potential for 
resistance in nuckolls county the governor said in midjanuary 
there would be a great danger in letting voters decide whether 
to approve the site in their own county 
legislators she said will have to define what constitutes 
support by the people of that area two bills requiring voter 
approval in the county eventually chosen for the site are pending in 
the legislature 
us ecology estimates it will be 12 to 18 months before a final 
dump site is picked opponents promise to fight on 
hugh kaufman a government whistleblower whos currently 
assistant to the director of the hazardous waste site control 
division of the us environmental protection agency spoke as a 
private citizen during a meeting in nemaha county 
this region of the united states is being singled out as the 
new major dumping area for america said kaufman the nuclear 
and toxic waste industry is looking around for more naive 
governments and officials who dont know how to deal with it 
lowell fisher believes all three nebraska counties were picked as 
potential sites because were rural and sparsely populated have 
low incomes are mostly above middle age politically conservative 
free marketoriented have a high school education or less and 
staunchly patriotic 
but were not stupid added fisher surrounded by antidump 
paperwork scattered on the kitchen table of his farmhouse weve 
got a lawyer were raising money and were getting smarter every 
day

since lowlevel radioactive waste dumps moved in 
nearby two communities have had opposite relationships with their

worries in beatty nev the dump is called a good neighbor

this gray illinois prairie has been home 
to coal and crops but it was something alien in the soil that gave 
rise to 10 years of litigation and a legacy that could linger for 
centuries 
deep in the earth among tons of waste in a longclosed dump a 
radioactive substance called tritium is leaking from dirt trenches 
in which it was buried 
though experts say this form of hydrogen from nuclear power 
plants factories and research labs isnt enough to pose any danger 
the leak illustrates the potential risks of such dumps 
nobody knows how to safely bury hazardous waste for the length 
of time the waste will be hazardous argues hugh kaufman a 
government whistleblower who now works at the us environmental 
protection agency its all supposition and prayer 
others say the industry has come a long way since the late 1960s 
when the lowlevel nuclear waste dump opened in sheffield still 
scientists concede that while tests to determine the suitability of 
the sheffield area were considered sufficient then theyd be 
terribly inadequate by current standards 
in the mid60s not much was known about the regulation of 
lowlevel waste disposal said dave ed senior nuclear scientist 
at the illinois department of nuclear safety weve learned an 
awful lot in 20 years weve learned before you ok a site you 
should do a very thorough investigation weve learned it after the 
fact in sheffield 
by todays standards that site shouldnt or wouldnt be 
used said ed noting the soil is too sandy and gravelly allowing 
water to move distances in six months that experts originally 
thought would take hundreds of years 
ed says the dump has a mixed record 
it didnt contain the radioactivity as predicted he said 
but it continues to isolate the radioactivity from people 
that doesnt satisfy local activist stanley gingrich who heads a 
citizens group that has opposed the dump as well as an adjacent one 
filled with nonnuclear hazardous waste that is also leaking 
it has to be one of the biggest blights in this country he 
said 
even those who believe the operators were conscientious say it 
doesnt do a community any good to be near two leaking dumps 
its definitely been a deficit to us said businessman bob 
sprowls adding like anybody else i dont know whats out there 
im not smart enough to know what the real danger is 
the 20acre dump located about 3 miles from this westcentral 
town of 1100 is in a former strip mining area now dotted with 
farms 
it holds about 33 million cubic feet of lowlevel radioactive 
waste including contaminated tools and clothes from hospitals and 
nuclear power plants 100 pounds of plutonium and uranium and parts 
of a dismantled nuclear reactor all buried in 22 trenches 
the dump was closed in 1978 when the state refused to allow the 
operators then nuclear engineering co to bury waste in a new 
trench the state said tritium which also is used in most modern 
bombs was leaking and the ground was too sandy 
nuclear engineering decided to leave 
the company put the keys to the gate on the table in one of the 
sheds and sent us a telegram saying we have finished our work at 
the site since you own it its yours again said clifford 
weaver a private attorney who represented the state 
the state filed a 97 million lawsuit charged the company had 
broken its 99year lease a judge ordered the company which in 1981 
became us ecology inc to remain there until trial 
a decade later an outofcourt settlement was reached us 
ecology will commit more than 8 million to test monitor and 
maintain the area remain there until 1998 and build a new 
4footthick clay cover over the dump 
state officials insist the agreement is fair gingrich disagrees 
we think our community was sold out not having any input in 
that settlement he said eight million dollars and theyre able 
to walk away in 10 years we think 8 million is peanuts to take 
care of that site 
as part of the 1988 agreement us ecology also purchased a 
170acre buffer zone and built a fence around it after it was 
discovered tritium had moved beyond the dump into nearby groundwater 
and a lake 
that angers gingrich the states bandaid has been to allow 
them to buy more property where its leaking he said we cant 
say theres devalued land next to it because they bought the land 
it can move to the end of town and they can continue to buy the 
land can they buy the town eventually 
but ed says the land has been thoroughly studied and experts feel 
the leak can be contained within the buffer zone until the 
radioactivity decays most he said will be gone within 100 years 
ed also said the highest levels of tritium which leaked because 
earthen covers didnt prevent rain from seeping into the radioactive 
material is only 10 percent of the maximum the government allows to 
be released to unrestricted areas 
the levels were talking about you cant build bombs he 
explained noting the same was true of the plutonium which is 
thoroughly dispersed 
however the plutonium and uranium will remain hundreds of years 
and though its unlikely theyll move people must be prevented from 
digging into the waste the site has to be monitored and 
maintained for a hundred years at least he said 
though one legal battle is over a 9yearold lawsuit is pending 
over us ecologys 45acre nonnuclear hazardous waste site 
chemicals are leaking from the 43 million cubic feet of waste and 
some of the chemicals have apparently mixed with the tritium 
us ecology also is spending more than 13 million to study the 
scope of that problem and seek remedies 
meanwhile the company started holding community forums last year 
to keep the town informed of its work 
the site is a mystery to a lot of people said mark cade the 
sites post operations manager the word radioactive puts 
everybody on guard by being more open than we had in the past 
it would give them an opportunity for a better understanding of what 
goes on out there 
theyre trying to communicate more than they used to 
confirmed mayor jack weber before they did things they didnt 
tell us about the public relations is better now

they had a good laugh down at the sourdough 
saloon when an antinuclear activist claimed that beattys 
radioactive waste dump had turned the place into a ghost town 
she must have been a ghost when she walked through here bar 
owner dick sorenson said the other day while perched on a stool 
this aint no ghost town were having the biggest boom beattys 
ever seen 
the economics of this thirsty little desert town near death 
valley are suddenly of interest as a 1993 deadline nears for states 
to dispose of their own lowlevel radioactive waste under a 
schedule set by congress most states have formed regional compacts 
and now are seeking places to put their dumps 
the debate that follows any specific site proposal often turns to 
beatty which for 27 years has been neighbor to the nations oldest 
lowlevel radioactive waste dump one of only three in the country 
beatty pop 1500 or so is a way station in the desert 115 
miles north of las vegas its a onetrafficlight town where 
chickens scratch in the dusty side roads and everyone seems to know 
everyone else 
the dump 11 miles south of town has caused its share of 
problems mismanagement and accidents there in the 1970s helped 
build support for the regional compacts 
but dont expect to hear beatty residents badmouth their nuclear 
neighbor for one thing people would rather talk about the new gold 
exploration near town thats why motels are filled most nights 
they say and why new buildings are going up on main street 
for another thing the dump is seen not so much as a threat but 
as an accepted community member it donates money to the volunteer 
fire department and employs 23 local residents 
with most people around here if it comes down to money or a 
little radioactivity they take the money said bob clary 53 who 
came to beatty 20 years ago 
beatty is used to things nuclear six miles east of town is the 
edge of the nevada test site home of the nations nuclear weapons 
testing since 1951 oldtimers recall watching the fiery mushroom 
clouds and newer residents talk of shocks from underground testing 
when nuclear engineering co opened the lowlevel radioactive 
waste site in 1962 relations were friendly between townspeople and 
dump workers 
too friendly it turned out 
if you wanted a wall clock for example the dump was the place 
to get it a worker there would pry open a box of radiumdial ships 
clocks slated for burial and sell you one cheap 
trying to be good neighbors dump managers lent out equipment 
such as a radiationtainted cement mixer for use on construction 
projects in town 
the open door policy ended in march 1976 when the company 
discovered that a cement floor it had helped lay in back of the 
sourdough saloon was mildly radioactive 
they came in tore it all up and took it away sorenson 
recalls 
state health inspectors descended on beatty going door to door 
with radiation detectors in five days they collected thousands of 
mildly radioactive items that should have been in the dump clocks 
watches compasses tools electric motors and plywood paneling in 
backyards and at ranches outside town they found 23 metal tanks 
that once had contained radioactive waste but had been converted to 
septic or water tanks 
officials concluded there was no health risk but clamped down on 
the dump nonetheless they closed the site for three months and 
fined nuclear engineering 10000 
the company fired the employees involved and vowed to make 
sweeping changes but it was just the start of the waste sites 
troubles 
in may 1979 a truck carrying tritium carbon14 uranium 238 and 
iodine 32 caught fire at the site and spread a cloud of radioactive 
smoke over the desert whoever is responsible ought to be hung 
from the yardarm said thengov robert list though health 
officials concluded the accident had posed no health hazard 
over the next year and a half liquid leaked from crates 
containing nuclear waste from michigan a mystery package 
outside the dump turned out to be radioactive and the bottom 
dropped off a barrel containing uranium waste during unloading 
list and others urged that the site be closed permanently joined 
by officials in south carolina and washington the two other states 
with lowlevel radioactive waste sites they lobbied congress to 
make each of the 50 states responsible for its own waste 
through it all beatty residents stuck by their dump at one 
point collecting 500 signatures in favor of keeping it open 
but opponents prevailed in 1980 when congress passed the 
lowlevel radioactive waste act colorado will be the site of a new 
regional dump that will accept nevadas waste after 1993 
with four years to go until mandated closing the beatty dump is 
quiet these days two to five trucks a week arrive at the dump 
which occupies half of a fencedin 80acre site the other half 
handles hazardous chemical wastes 
nuclear engineering which changed its name in 1981 to us 
ecology administers the dump watched over by a state health 
division inspector 
the regulations are a lot more stringent than they were in 
1962 assistant site manager bob marchand said recently as he 
escorted a visitor around the site 
marchand said the dump accepts no radioactive liquids to reduce 
the already slim chance that radiation could seep into groundwater 
which in this arid climate is 350 feet below the surface 
nearly 4 million cubic feet of lowlevel radioactive waste is 
buried in the dumps trenches and pits 
standing over a closed trench radiation safety officer terry 
king said the radiation level there was no greater than anywhere in 
the surrounding desert a radiation monitor clipped to his pocket 
proved him right 
waste today is put into a 50footdeep pit and covered with 
earth the huge pit was opened in 1980 it will be just over half 
full when the site closes in 1993 marchand said 
despite the accidents of the 1970s a booklet put out by the 
company says the public health has never been threatened 
they run a good tight ship over there said bill sullivan 
justice of the peace and chief of the volunteer fire department 
several dump workers serve on the fire department and the 
companys expertise in handling chemical wastes has helped the 
department respond to accidents that had nothing to do with 
materials heading to the site sullivan said 
sullivan said he understands the concerns of a community 
contemplating a new waste site but i would be more concerned 
about somebody dumping contaminated lab equipment in the city 
dump can you imagine what things would be like if they didnt have 
sites like this

the romeo and juliet romance of a 
16yearold greek cypriot schoolgirl and a 17yearold turkish 
settler has stirred political passions on this divided east 
mediterranean island 
the love story has underlined the deeprooted divisions that 
plague cyprus 15 years after turkey invaded and seized the northern 
onethird of the island 
but it also in its own small way symbolizes hopes of 
reunification as leaders of the rival communities try to find ways 
to bring them together 
there was an uproar in the greek cypriot south in september when 
the turkish moslem cengis coksun seytan and alexia chronia a 
christian were married in a widely publicized moslem ceremony in 
the north 
alexia was only 15 at the time she is only the second greek 
cypriot girl known to have married a turk since the 1974 invasion 
her family is part of a small isolated greek community in the 
karpas region of the north following the flight or expulsion of 
200000 greek cypriots after the invasion 
greek cypriots were incensed not just that one of their own would 
marry a turk but one of the 50000 mainland turks shipped to the 
north to increase the turkish cypriot population which is 
outnumbered 41 by greek cypriots 
the greek cypriots demand the withdrawal of all the settlers and 
some 30000 turkish troops from the north before a settlement can be 
reached on reunification 
hardline greek cypriots alleged the girl had been kidnapped some 
officers in the united nations peacekeeping force believe the 
hardliners sought to undermine the talks between their political 
leaders 
the greek cypriot press angrily demanded action by the un 
force which supervises the living conditions of the greek cypriots 
left in karpas to rescue alexia high school students staged 
protest demonstrations demanding un action 
un officers reported they found no evidence of coercion and 
that alexia was happy greek cypriots called that a coverup 
anger was fueled when turkish cypriot television seen in the 
south broadcast the marriage of cengis and alexia and announced 
that turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash had given the couple an 
expensive wedding present 
greek cypriot newspapers claimed the marriage was a turkish 
attempt to prove to the world that the mainland settlers were being 
assimilated and were even acceptable to greek cypriots 
in february when alexia crossed to the south she claimed she had 
indeed been kidnapped and forced to convert to islam before being 
pushed into marrying seytan 
a few weeks later seytan slipped across the socalled green line 
that divides the island to become a christian so he and alexia could 
live in the more prosperous south 
he was immediately arrested and held in jail on charges he had 
kidnapped alexia and entered the republic of cyprus illegally 
alexia then changed her story saying she had been forced by her 
own family to concoct the kidnap story to save them from the 
humiliation of her love for a turk and conversion to islam 
id go to the end of the world to be with him she said of 
the curly haired seytan 
seytan said during a brief court appearance i love her i want 
to see her why wont they let me 
nonetheless the greek cypriot authorities ruled that he should 
be deported as an illegal immigrant the order is pending 
some greek cypriots newspapers insist that alexias denial of 
being kidnapped followed turkish warnings they would harm her family 
still in the north if she told the truth 
but other newspapers have become sympathetic and urged tolerance 
if these two youngsters are really in love why dont we accept 
the fact and let them live in peace the independent epikeri 
weekly said in an editorial why do we object so violently and 
fight this possibility

weeks before a killer earthquake tore 
down the homes of a halfmillion armenians the soviet caucasus was 
already shaken by a tragedy that has left 300000 other people 
without places to live or work 
its cause was the distrust and dislike of one people of another 
first by the hundreds then by the thousands armenians and 
azerbaijanis fled their homes in fear they might become the next 
victims 
the soviet government appeals to them to return home but for 
many the fear remains 
i consider that its better to die here in yerevan than to try 
to live there said gena agabekyan an ethnic armenian who fled 
baku the azerbaijani capital three months ago 
strife between the predominantly moslem azerbaijanis and mostly 
christian armenians broke into the open in february 1988 in a 
dispute over the nagornokarabakh district of azerbaijan 
armenians who make up the majority of the districts population 
complained of discrimination under azerbaijani control and demanded 
annexation with the armenian republic 
violence flared throughout 1988 and 91 people were killed most 
of them in november thats when the exodus began from both 
republics 
to date about 141000 azerbaijanis have fled armenia and 
159000 armenians have left azerbaijan the soviet interior ministry 
says 
the refugees have been all but forgotten in the aftermath of the 
dec 7 earthquake that killed 25000 people and left much of 
northwestern armenia in ruins no international aid has poured in 
for the refugees as it did for earthquake victims and little help 
comes from within the soviet union 
in an attempt to cool tempers in the caucasus the name for the 
general area between the black and caspian seas and to snuff out 
the nagornokarabakh dispute the kremlin has placed the region 
under its direct control it has announced plans to pump millions of 
rubles into the district to improve schools services and even 
upgrade television broadcasting in the armenian language 
but officials acknowledge that they are overwhelmed by the double 
tragedies of ethnic flight and earthquake 
if there hadnt been an earthquake we would have settled 
everyone long ago and everything would be normal yuri 
khodzhamiryan a deputy armenian premier told a recent news 
conference 
as it did for quake victims armenias government set up a 
commission to help resettle refugees they receive a onetime 
payment of 100 rubles 160 each and have been offered jobs in 
rural areas 
early on the soviet press trumpeted the return of a handful of 
refugees to their homes clearly trying to encourage others to 
follow suit but officials say fewer than a sixth of the refugees 
have returned home 
meanwhile those waiting for new jobs and homes are getting 
restless 
despite a ban on public gatherings the refugees have massed 
regularly on lenin square in downtown yerevan the armenian capital 
on one recent afternoon gena agabekyan and 100 other refugees 
complained outside the state agriculture committee offices that the 
government was refusing to give them jobs or homes 
agabekyan 50 said he was left without a job when he was fired 
as a crane operator for the staterun azerbaijan film committee in 
baku because i am an armenian 
even government officials who usually claim that interethnic 
brotherhood prevails in the soviet union acknowledge that the 
hostility felt by the neighboring caucasus peoples for each other 
was behind the refugee wave 
people were driven out only because they were of different 
nationality arkady volsky the head of a new governing committee 
in nagornokarabakh told the defense newspaper krasnaya zvezda 
yerevan a city of 12 million people has become a magnet for 
both refugees and people made homeless by the earthquake 
the armenian land use institute has set up a refugee placement 
center in the city its deputy director telemak mutafyan said 
there is no shortage of jobs or housing in armenia but many refugees 
are not willing to adjust to new conditions 
azerbaijanis left rural areas here and armenians come to us 
from baku and kirovabad and other azerbaijani cities mutafyan 
said a city man adjusts with great difficulty to a village 
many refugees are staying with relatives in yerevan but others 
have settled on their own in buildings condemned as unsafe 
according to mutafyan 
ironically the earthquake may have a silver lining for some 
refugees the kremlin has ordered that the devastated area be 
rebuilt in two years and thousands of construction workers are 
needed

despite last summers disastrous 
drought tractor dealer chuck german says the us agricultural 
economy is poised for recovery and growth thanks to lessons learned 
in the decadelong crisis that gripped the farm belt 
but german doubts manufacturers bullish forecasts for strong 
sales of tractors combines and farm implements he doesnt see a 
quick fix but a gradual improvement largely dependent upon 
cooperation from mother nature 
german 52 is president of german implement co of princeville 
a community of 1700 about 20 miles north of peoria his experiences 
the past 10 years are common among people who sell tractors 
our last good year was 1979 german said things started 
going downhill in 1980 and they really hit a low ebb in 1984 our 
volume that year was half of our 1979 volume 
in 1981 german laid off 25 percent of his employees 
indefinitely saying its sad but its been a matter of survival 
and waiting for things to pick back up 
like most experts german thought the farming industry was ripe 
for recovery last spring as tractor and combine sales started 
picking up but sales eased quickly in the drought that parched the 
midwest 
instead german watched the drought claim three neighborhing farm 
equipment dealers illinois has lost 1500 dealers since 1949 
according to the illinois retail farm equipment association 
german survived but had to cut expenses again just as he did at 
the start of the decade when the farm economy soured 
now german said his manufacturers ford motor co and japans 
kubota ltd are telling him to expect big demand in 1989 
while he agrees farmers need to replace aging equipment german 
doesnt expect any activity in his showroom which his father opened 
in 1940 unless rain falls more regularly than last year 
farmers are conservative and waiting for moisture he said 
thats the big factor my manufacturers are enthusiastic but im 
not 
thats because the farmers who survived the farm crisis are 
astute money managers who think long and hard before spending on 
average 60000 for a tractor and 110000 for a combine he said 
manufacturers like deere amp co of moline are upbeat about 1989 
prospects thats partly because deere enjoyed record earnings last 
year of 315 million despite the drought which produced the worst 
year of tractor and combine sales industrywide since records were 
first kept in 1963 
deere flourished in the drought by cutting costs entering joint 
ventures with foreign companies and expanding its product line 
especially in the lucrative lawn and garden market 
the companys diverse array of insurance and financial services 
also helped the bottom line 
officials at fords agricultural machinery unit in new holland 
pa are equally upbeat claiming they were solidly in the black 
in 1988 and looking at some good years ahead they decline to 
release earnings or sales figures 
ford spokesman gene hemphill said the company wasnt hurt by the 
drought as badly as others because it does not have a high 
concentration of dealers in the midwest which suffered most from 
the drought 
case ih of racine wis was not as lucky as ford and suffered a 
95 million loss in 1988 on the heels of a 253 million loss in 
1987 the company hasnt shown a profit since 1981 but officials 
think prospects have improved 
the company remains bullish about the agricultural equipment 
market said vickie l rickey case ih vice president 
other signs of an agricultural rebound include low stockpiles of 
grain and higher commodity prices said emmett barker president of 
the farm and industrial equipment institute in chicago an 
industrysupported think tank

with us soldiers watching from guard 
towers on the other side of the border maj kang sung nam of the 
north korean army launched a verbal assault on the americans 
blaming them for dividing the korean people 
panmunjom is just a military demarcation line which the 
imperialist americans drew to divide the korean people kang told 
tourists from hong kong during a visit to the snowdusted truce 
village on the border of north and south korea 
we hope you can go back and tell your people that we koreans 
are longing for reunification 
kang then presented each tourist with a lapel pin depicting two 
hands shaking across the korean peninsula set on a background of the 
north korean flag 
although hundreds of thousands of troops from north and south man 
the tense 155milelong demilitarized zone panmunjom is a tourist 
attraction for both sides 
the official north korean tour of panmunjom includes the use of a 
largescale model to explain the demilitarized zone that was set up 
after the korean war it also includes as a visit to one of the 
large huts that straddle the demarcation line where the two sides 
have negotiated since the armistice in 1953 
the north koreans offer a version of the 195053 korean war 
markedly different from that of the south koreans and americans who 
fought under the banner of the united nations command 
visitors are shown a 20minute documentary accusing the united 
states of invading the communist north using chemical weapons and 
bearing sole responsibility for the peninsulas division the film 
features closeups of wounded korean civilians and surrendering us 
soldiers 
the documentary does not mention however that it was north 
koreas invasion of the south on june 25 1950 that set off the war 
nor does it refer to the chinese who entered the conflict to help 
north korea recover from severe military setbacks 
kang repeatedly maintained that at the 1953 truce signing in 
panmunjom the south korean representative was unable to speak for 
his people because he said the negotiations were dominated by the 
united states 
the north and south remain technically at war with each 
government claiming to be the legitimate ruler of all korea 
but in recent months the two sides have been exchanging 
proposals on ending the confrontation and panmunjom the site of the 
latest round of political talks once again has been the focus of 
attention 
panmunjom became neutral after the war but has been a symbol of 
the division and tension on the peninsula to both north and south 
the heavily militarized korean peninsula includes an estimated 
850000 military regulars in north korean and 650000 soldiers in 
south korea supported by a 42000member us military contingent 
but north korean officials talk as though any hostilities would 
come from the south 
the peoples army is here to protect you tour guide yoon mu 
ho reassured the tourists as eight north korean soldiers stood 
stiffly at attention at the truce village huts

after months of nothing but sunshine and 
blue skies rains finally are falling on italys parched croplands 
some areas had not seen rain in 80 days in others the rainfall 
in the last five months was less than half the average 
but the new rains may be too late it will take months to 
determine what the drought has done to the wheat crop fruit and 
olive orchards vineyards citrus groves and vegetable farms 
italians already know it will mean higher prices for some foods 
and possibly even for their bottle of wine however they may be 
saved higher costs for their pasta which is made from durum wheat 
while until a month ago we were very concerned about the 
effects of the drought on the recent harvest the recent rains have 
pretty much calmed our fears said albino ganapini a spokesman 
for barilla italys largest pasta producer if the rainy season 
continues normally as meteorologists are predicting then we will 
have a normal harvest 
he said the planting had been increased by 4 percent this year 
and noted that italy normally imports about 25 percent of the wheat 
it uses for pasta anyway 
but farm groups say the drought will mean higher prices for 
fruits and vegetables producers say the retail price of artichokes 
one of the most popular italian vegetables could triple from the 
current average price of 900 lire 67 cents apiece 
growers say fruit olive and citrus trees will produce less this 
year because of the drought which also is expected to diminish the 
grape harvest bringing the prospect of higher prices for wine 
for some farmers this is the third bad year in the last five of 
poor harvests 
ive never seen a drought like this said alfio pieraccini 
who has farmed for 50 years on this fertile plain that stretches 
toward the tyrrhenian sea from the foot of the tuscan hills 
pieraccini said it was too late to recover the cost of planting 
agriculture minister calogero mannino recently told a senate 
committee the ministry cannot yet realistically evaluate the damage 
which varies widely from region to region 
earlier the ministry released a preliminary estimate of 15 
billion but it said the amount of rain over the next few months 
could drastically alter the picture 
giuseppe avolio the president of the italian confederation of 
farmers said the damage could reach 74 billion 
so far the government has declared only sardinia a disaster area 
the island has had below average rainfalls for three years and 
despite some recent rain the situation there is still grave its 
barren fields are unable to support sheep and goats that represent a 
third of italys herd 
about 5000 farmers demonstrated recently in cagliari sardinias 
capital to demand that the government provide more drought relief 
funds 
the regional government estimates damage in sardinia alone at a 
half billion dollars or more 
but despite the recent rains agriculture minister mannino said 
other regions in italy could still be declared disaster areas the 
drought has withered crops from lombardy in the north to sicily in 
the south 
regional officials in lombardy say the drought might destroy 30 
percent of the crops in the region known as one of the most fertile 
in europe 
normally the fields on the pianura di grosseto the wide plain in 
southern coastal tuscany are green with durum wheat by february 
the harvests usually average 40 to 50 metric tons an acre but this 
year farmers expect the average will be no more than 10 tons 
farmer pieraccini of grosseto still active at 76 takes his 
troubles in stride 
in 1985 he suffered because of a killer frost that destroyed 
olive fruit and citrus trees as far south as sicily last year 
heavy rain washed away 40 percent of his crop this winter at least 
70 percent of his wheat has died 
what happens happens he shrugs

profits from illegal cocaine sales are so vast 
these days that government agents measure drug dollars by weight and 
cocaine dealers in a scramble to launder the bulky cash have even 
gone so far as to buy banks 
the cocaine organizations are generating a horrendous amount of 
cash said us attorney robert bonner 
if they cant convert this cash and get it out of the united 
states the whole point of the illegal drug operation is frustrated 
most people dont realize the physical space and weight taken 
up by cash proceeds until it is counted we are measuring this 
money in weight 1 million in cash is well over 100 pounds of 
currency 
so drug dealers devise ingenious schemes to get money out of the 
country the arrests of 37 jewelers and their employees has exposed 
what authorities say was a clever new mechanism using bogus gold 
transactions to hide drug profits 
in recent years bonners office has prosecuted moneylaundering 
rings that went so far as to buy their own banks but nothing has 
matched the scope of the ring broken by the federal operation 
polar cap which allegedly involved whole families as defendants 
and more money than any case before it 
the case broke open feb 22 as federal agents searched 85 
locations in los angeles new york and miami and us marshals swept 
into los angeles wholesale jewelry mart arresting proprietors of a 
dozen jewelry and bullion outlets 
jewelers allegedly laundered more than 1 billion in just over 
two years 
a federal grand jury here indicted 33 jewelers and associates 
wednesday four other defendants were indicted in san jose the 
previous week 
authorities also confiscated 80 million in property including 
jewelry 12 million in gold 674 million in cash a condominium 
apartment complex five houses and a 10story building in the center 
of the downtown mart 
this investigation certainly will pay for itself bonner said 
at a news conference announcing the indictments 
according to court documents the moneylaundering operation was 
run primarily from ropex corp owned by wanis joseph 
koyomejian and andonian brothers manufacturing co owned by vahe 
and nazareth andonian one defendant raul vivas is in custody in 
uruguay from where he allegedly ran the ring 
the defendants were charged with aiding the distribution of 
thousands of pounds of cocaine by laundering hundreds of milllions 
of dollars in cash from drug sales across the country they also 
were charged with conspiringto violate the money laundering control 
act and to avoid reporting currency transactions over 10000 as 
required by law 
the maximum sentence for conspiracy is life imprisonment the 
maximum for money laundering is 20 years in prison and fines up to 
25 million 
most of the defendants are different from any arrested in the 
past instead of colombian nationals deep into the drug trade they 
are of armenian syrian turkish and lebanese extraction emigres 
who seemed to have grabbed a piece of the american dream with their 
thriving gold and jewelry businesses 
the defendants through their lawyers have declared their 
innocence 
government officials wont comment in depth on polar cap but 
some 300 pages of affidavits show their view of how the gold and 
jewelry trade became a nearly perfect cover after the 1986 arrests 
of major moneylaunderers 
according to affidavits heres how one goldrelated transaction 
worked 
on dec 12 1988 nine boxes of cash 2568000 were shipped 
from zampg gold in new york by armored car to andonian brothers in los 
angeles where it was counted and phone calls were made confirming 
the amount 
the next day nazareth andonian ordered 177 kilograms of gold 
credited to a gold brokerage account of ronel refining of hollywood 
fla a gold refining company and deposited the 2568000 in a los 
angeles bank 
he later wiretransferred 2491152 to ronel keeping 76848 as 
abis 3 percent commission for laundering ronel owner richard 
ferris used the money to pay for the gold keeping a 4 percent 
commission at that point according to an affidavit ronel is 
positioned to repeatedly sell the same gold to apila via various 
gold brokers 
cash was delivered daily by drug couriers to about a dozen 
jewelry stores in new york and los angeles then transported to abi 
or ropex for counting and deposit under the guise of gold sales the 
government said millions then were transferred to banks in panama 
and uruguay for delivery to colombia as payment for cocaine that had 
been shipped on consignment to the united states 
the amount represents proceeds of approximately 70 tons of 
cocaine sold in the united states in two years bonner said 
the scheme worked without detection until early last year when 
incidents on two continents led fed the play is brooks first writing 
for the theater he composed 
the music for the films marjoe the garden of the

describe him as being able to fly anything that can fly drive 
anything that can move and shoot anything that can shoot hes a

more sensitive hes going to need the instincts and special skills 
of his indian ancestors 
in the tv series the aliens have been in suspended animation 
since their defeat in the 1953 movie but accidental exposure to 
radioactive waste revives them and sends them off again on their 
mission to wipe out human life and prepare earth for alien 
colonization 
the hourlong series also stars jared martin lynda mason green 
and philip akin it is a sister syndicated series to paramounts 
star trek the next generation and friday the 13th the 
series 
hg wells war of the worlds was a victorian classic that 
became a granddaddy of science fiction in 1897 paramount purchased 
the film rights in 1925 for director cecil b de mille for nearly 
30 years the script passed through many hands until it reached 
producer george pal his 1953 production won an oscar for special 
effects and is considered a film classic 
the series is made in toronto where chaves said he sometimes has 
a charcoal heater on each side during outdoor filming im hoping

said ironhorse was written as a blackfoot but i asked to play 
him as my own heritage my mother was part cherokee scottish and 
irish my father was a fullblooded castilian from spain my 
grandparents came from spain 
this role is perfect timing its a role that combines my 
indian background and my military experience ive been very 
fortunate in my career that way 
chaves said when he auditioned for the role in war of the 
worlds he found that he was up against a close friend sonny 
landham 
i called sonny and he started laughing he said he took it 
wonderfully weve played golf since then he dropped out of the 
competition i think his price was too high in my heart i knew i 
was meant for this role 
chaves 37 is unmarried but said he has been close twice he is 
an avid golfer 
recently i was driving my car and got to thinking he said 
i played a doctor on hill street blues a lawyer on miami vice

dennis r patrick made a simple proposal two 
years ago let american telephone amp telegraph co earn as much 
profit as it can but cap the annual increases in atampts 
longdistance rates 
patrick said it was time to throw out the 20yearold 
rateofreturn philosophy that had allowed atampt to earn a certain 
percentage above its costs 
use price caps he said to reward efficiency and create economic 
incentives to lower costs and save consumers hundreds of millions 
of dollars 
congress howled and consumer groups said it would lead to 
unrelieved price increases 
but patrick stood fast adjusting his plan here and there and on 
thursday is expected to gain commission approval to implement the 
rate cap proposal 
congress still could intervene and block rate caps but patrick 
said he considers the program one of his biggest accomplishments 
since he became fcc chairman in april 1987 
i think that the rate cap proceedings have been a model in 
terms of interaction between the commission and the congress on an 
important issue of public policy patrick said in an interview 
last week 
i think there has developed a consensus that rateofreturn 
regulation is flawed and that we need to have incentive regulation 
i think we have a formula and a process that is going to cap 
rates and bring them down faster than what we should anticipate 
under rateofreturn regulation 
the longterm benefits he said would give companies such as 
atampt and eventually the seven regional bell companies an 
incentive for the first time to reveal to the federal government how 
efficient they can be right now those companies have an incentive 
to play hide the ball but if we say to them heres the mark if 
you can beat the mark well allow you to keep a little bit more in 
the way of profits in the short run in the long run were going to 
emulate the market and capture those benefits for consumers 
his other major accomplishment he feels was abolishing the 
fccs 40yearold fairness doctrine that required broadcasters to 
present opposing views of controversial issues the commission 
patrick said was standing foursquare in favor of more first 
amendment freedoms for electronic journalists 
i am convinced that the fairness doctrine was antithetical to 
the purposes for which it was created in fact it was 
counterproductive he said of the commissions august 1987 
decision it chilled speech and on a more fundamental level i 
think it is offensive to have the federal government monitoring 
regulating attempting to balance by and through our subjective 
judgments the speech of broadcasters because broadcasters are 
journalists and journalists are supposed to be free 
congress didnt see it that way and quickly passed legislation 
that made the fairness doctrine law thenpresident reagan vetoed 
the bill but congress is expected to pass it again this year 
president bush said on the campaign trail he would veto it 
controversy has dogged the 37yearold former california attorney 
since he moved up from being an fcc commissioner to succeed another 
friend of deregulation mark fowler 
it is no secret that early on in my administration the 
commission was called upon to engage some very tough and very 
contentious issues that strained relations a bit with the congress 
or some members i have since that time remained completely 
willing and disposed to communicate with the congress to reach 
compromises where possible and to move the ball forward on these 
various fronts in a cooperative way 
at this point he said relations in fact i think are very 
good between the commission and the congress 
but he doesnt apologize for his vigorous deregulatory approach 
i have tried to pursue on the broadcast side of our 
jurisdiction policies that reflect our belief in competition our 
belief that competition is the best regulator of licensees it is 
the restraint mechanism that is most likely to cause broadcasters to 
identify and serve the public interest patrick said 
at the same time he also supports a policy that sends chills up 
the spines of broadcasters spectrum auction selling licenses to 
the highest bidder 
although patrick hasnt proposed that such a plan be adopted for 
radio and television station owners or amateur radio or public 
safety operations he like the reagan administration thinks 
airtoground radio operators cellular telephone companies and the 
like should pay for the airwaves they use 
if the secretary of interior were to propose tomorrow to give 
away federal mineral rights or oil rights or grazing rights or 
what have you he or she would probably be impeached and yet the 
way we pursue communications policy is one wherein we are virtually 
directed to give away what is arguably one of the most valuable 
natural resources we have radio spectrum 
in an era of huge budget deficits its absolutely absurd that 
we give away this resource he said 
in the long term he said he thinks bidding would help the 
airwaves to be used in a more socially beneficial way 
he said his approach isnt inconsistent with the notion that the 
airwaves belong to the public 
if this is a public resource radio spectrum which i think it 
is then there ought to be some compensation to the treasury for the 
use of the resource 
patrick acts like a man who enjoys what he does and he said he 
puts in 11 to 12 hours days with weekend work not uncommon 
he said hes a big movie fan and in warm weather he likes to 
play volleyball near the lincoln memorial perhaps something the 
native californian cant get out of his blood 
he was born in the los angeles suburb of glendale on june 1 
1951 and graduated magna cum laude from occidental college with a 
bachelors degree in political science 
he was a 1976 graduate of the law school at the university of 
california los angeles and joined the los angeles firm of adams 
duque amp hazeltine before going to the white house personnel office 
in december 1981 he was named an fcc commissioner in december 1983 
his term ends on june 30 1992 but fccwatchers generally expect 
him to leave his 82500ayear post this year 
i think its fair to say that 1992 will not see me in this 
position he said but he said he has no immediate plans to leave 
government 
patrick said he is a great believer in the proposition that the 
government should be run by and large by citizens of the republic 
that come to government for a while and return to the private 
sector and i think thats good for your perspective as well as your 
energy level

people living in families that dont conform to the ageold 
concept of mom dad and the kids are locked in battles in a number 
of communities where personal freedom is pitted against the desire 
to control who lives next door 
in some of denvers most exclusive neighborhoods for example 
unmarried people cant legally live together under a living in 
sin zoning code in poughkeepsie ny four or more people cant 
live in the same rental dwelling if theyre not of the same family 
and in chicago eight couples in a public housing project got 
married late last year to avoid eviction 
many communities have laws restricting housing according to 
varying definitions of what constitutes a family the reasons range 
from preserving quality of life in the face of an influx of 
outsiders to cutting backlogs of people waiting to get into public 
housing to fighting drugs 
supporters of denvers 30yearold code say it encourages strong 
familyoriented neighborhoods we should stand up and say we stand 
for families and traditional values said city councilman ted 
hackworth 
i just do not think its appropriate for the city to regulate 
whether you are married any more than we should regulate whether you 
go to church said councilwoman cathy reynolds who has fought for 
13 years to repeal the law 
elinor lewallen whose neighborhood is covered by the ordinance 
said she opposed it because if her husband were to die she would be 
barred from seeking a livein companion so she could continue living 
in her home 
the city council is scheduled to vote on the matter march 27 
poughkeepsie in its ordinance passed last month to keep college 
students from overcrowding apartments defined family as a group 
which in theory size appearance structure and function 
resembles a traditional family unit cooking together and sharing 
expenses 
the local newspapers got it a little confused they said it 
meant that kate and allie wouldnt be able to live together but 
thats not right said city clerk patricia havens kate and 
allie is a cbstv show in which two divorced women and their three 
children share an apartment 
delray beach fla approved an ordinance last august allowing 
only one person outside of the immediate family defined as 
parents and children to live with a family in a singlefamily 
home city officials say it is meant to curb overcrowding that can 
lead to increased garbage and noise traffic congestion and health 
and safety problems in neighborhoods 
as of last month officials had cited 11 homes all owned by 
haitians 
the american civil liberties union of florida is deciding on a 
challenge said attorney jim k green of the palm beach county 
chapter of the aclu 
tamarac fla officials temporarily tabled a similar ordinance 
after the aclu threatened action the proposal said no more than 
three unrelated people and no more than five foster children could 
live in a singlefamily home 
were creating a recipe for more homelessness said broward 
county aclu attorney larry corman 
many housing authorities prohibit unwed couples in public housing 
in woonsocket ri dana dagnese and susan arsenau who have 
lived together for six years and are expecting their third child 
filed a lawsuit in january alleging that the woonsocket housing 
authority violated their rights to freedom of association family 
privacy and equal protection of laws by denying them emergency 
housing 
us district judge ronald r lagueux refused last month to issue 
a preliminary injunction saying here is a couple in an illicit 
relationship who are creating children for the welfare rolls where 
others who qualify for housing are shunted aside no trial date 
has been set 
the chicago housing authority banned overnight guests in the 
rockwell gardens project after a september police raid to combat 
gang violence that meant eight women could not allow their livein 
boyfriends to stay with them without a trip to the altar the 16 
residents including one couple with seven children were married 
en masse in novemeber 
in massachusetts three couples filed a lawsuit five years ago 
charging they were illegally barred from public housing in worcester 
because they were unmarried state law prohibits discrimination on 
the basis of marital status 
the massachusetts commission against discrimination ruled in 
their favor the worcester superior court upheld that ruling and 
the case is pending before the massachusetts appeals court the 
housing authority contends the law applies to individuals for 
example a divorced woman with children not couples 
to open up public housing slots to unmarried couples would 
create such an enormous strain on a system which is already so badly 
burdened said housing authority attorney michael clancy 
in west hollywood calif the nations first city with a gay 
majority of city officials a 1985 domestic partnership ordinance 
gives unmarried couples the same rights as married couples 
if you have a domestic partner you cant be evicted if you 
have someone living with you said deputy city clerk vivian 
vukojevich it can be a gay couple or lesbian couple or 
heterosexual couple 
sometimes the definition of family is intended to circumvent 
zoning restrictions as in a bill sought by the rhode island 
department for children and their families to protect group homes 
from local opposition 
no legislative action is expected for several weeks on the 
measure which says a departmentrun group home providing 
residential care andor treatment to eight or fewer children 
residing out of their natural homes shall be considered a family for 
purposes of zoning 
and in king william county va 23yearold twin sisters kim 
taylor and cam porter pamunkey indians are gathering signatures 
from pamunkey women all over the east coast to change a tribal law 
barring them from the reservation because they both married white 
men pamunkey men can marry whites 
chief william swift eagle miles who supports the sisters 
petition said when they gather what they think are enough 
signatures they can request a tribal council meeting to discuss the 
issue 
taylor said she wasnt able to marry anyone on the reservation 
because theyre all girls or theyre my cousins

democracy gorbachev style went to 
work aboard a soviet fishing vessel off south america its 50 
officers and sailors met during a storm to nominate a candidate for 
a new national assembly back home 
slicing through 40foot foamflecked waves the 18000ton kola 
bay covered 400 nautical miles before its crew could agree on who 
they thought should represent them in the halls of power in moscow 
said first mate konstantin s atroshnikov 
democracy gorbachev style preempted the movie king kong in 
the palace of culture of this port city 1000 miles north of moscow 
famed as the destination of the world war ii allied convoys carrying 
guns and spam to the embattled soviets 
in snowcoated kirov palace where on other days the great ape 
had roared on the screen more than 700 delegates from city 
workplaces and neighborhoods gathered to whittle down the list of 
candidates to be proposed to voters it took them nine hours to pare 
the list of six names to three 
with passion and skepticism a modest measure of ballyhoo and a 
big dose of confusion this city of 440000 and the soviet union at 
large are experiencing their first nationwide election campaign 
where voters will be allowed a choice instead of having a single 
candidate put up by the communist party 
im running because the law now gives me that right and i want 
to state my positions said one murmansk candidate andrei a 
zolotkov an engineer who has worked on nuclearpowered icebreakers 
thats my only goal 
said the chief of murmansks communist party apparatus vladimir 
p khachenko in the past we used to gather in committee and say 
how many women candidates do we need here or how many workers 
there this time not a single candidate has been endorsed by the 
city party committee 
president mikhail s gorbachev who championed the 
multicandidate elections calls the exercise a school of 
democracy he says soviet political life must be opened to greater 
citizen participation if his program for perestroika social and 
economic change is to succeed 
thats the theory 
in practice there are clear signs of pressure from the party in 
some sections of the country like the conservative ukraine to have 
a partybacked candidate become the voters sole option in the 
elections march 26 for the newly created council of peoples 
deputies 
the electoral changes approved in december by the soviet 
parliament also create what some soviets call filters at 
several levels to block candidates who cant garner majority support 
on nominating panels 
one famous victim of the filters was andrei d sakharov the 
dissident and nobel peace prize laureate whose candidacy was not 
backed by the academy of sciences the choice of the kola bays 
crew the captain of another fishing boat never made it through a 
subsequent nominating meeting held by representatives of sevriba 
the enterprise that runs the kola bay and more than 70 other 
murmanskbased fishing vessels 
bungling by murmansks election commission also blocked a 
candidate nominated by more than 100 boats representing 20000 
fishermen and their families from making the final list pravda 
the communist party newspaper accused murmansks election 
commission wednesday of misinterpreting the law by ruling that only 
sevriba and not each of its ships had the right to propose 
candidates 
due to the commissions error irina a rogachev an economics 
professor will not get to run for office pravda said a storm of 
political discontent is brewing in murmansk 
as a result of the meeting in late february at the culture 
palace voters in murmansks territorial election district no 224 
will choose on march 26 from among a doctor the chief of a fishing 
trawler fleet and the 37yearold zolotkov 
whats emerging in their fledgling campaigns is a pronounced 
accent on local issues such as the lack of housing thats keeping 
50000 murmansk residents waiting for better apartments the 
rationing of sugar sausage and other staples the lack of 
polyclinics in new neighborhoods and the fouling of the environment 
by industry in this once pristine region north of the arctic circle 
zolotkovs nineminute speech at the kirov palace never mentioned 
gorbachev but detailed the problems of his fellow city dwellers and 
had a distinct lets send a message to moscow tone 
when youre talking about peoples lives you must make 
demands he declared 
according to khachenko theres little if any difference in the 
candidates platforms what people want is a deputy with courage 
who will fight for what he believes in 
whats also becoming apparent in murmansk is a clannishness or 
splitting along professional lines 
the citys doctors are campaigning for the doctor and are in 
the street passing out leaflets khachenko said the captain 
meanwhile has surrounded himself with other captains 
a local editor viktor v prostikhin is trying to shake off 
attempts by murmansks electoral commission to force his arctic star 
newspaper run by the murmansk shipping company to give equal space 
to other candidates besides zolotkov a shipping company employee 
thats pressure on the press prostikhin maintained 
if gorbachevs new electoral system is a school zolotkov is a 
budding star pupil 
the lanky murmansk native with graystreaked black hair wears a 
burgandy tie and light blue shirt because allies advised him to 
however the engineer drew the line at loosening his collar and 
tie while campaigning as his advisers suggested 
somebody told me thats what american senators do but it 
wouldnt look proper here zolotkov said in an interview between 
puffs on an imported pall mall cigarette 
before the kirov palace meeting zolotkov bought time on an 
electric sign that shines down on murmansks main square 
vote for andrei alekseyeich zolotkov it said 
he wanted to rent a sound truck but relented when told that the 
move might offend other candidates 
his character became a campaign issue when one participant in the 
kirov palace meeting asked him if he would have the courage to 
publicly oppose a decision by gorbachev 
yes he responded 
i already have disagreements with the election law zolotkov 
said why should a member of the party central committee have 
more votes than i do 
the gorbachevbacked law gives the communist party the right to 
directly fill 100 of the assemblys 2250 seats 
whether a candidate like zolotkov can win march 26 is a subject 
of keen debate in murmansk 
perestroika so far here is more slogans that deeds said yura 
verbitsk 24 who works at a plant that burns garbage to generate 
electricity there are a lot of people still around from the era 
of leonid i brezhnev the late soviet president 
but the fact zolotkov even made it to the ballot is a sign of 
changing times to become the candidate proposed by the murmansk 
shipping co he beat out a man who would have been an easy winner 
in past elections an icebreaker captain awarded the coveted title 
of hero of socialist labor 
zolotkov a candidate for membership in the communist party says 
he is no expert on economics or legal matters but wants to go to 
moscow to make gorbachevs vision of soviet democracy work 
if one party is directing things thats exactly why we need a 
stronger legislature he said by my activities i want to 
demonstrate that there can be controls on power

repo man kevin mcgivern says business is brisker than usual at 
his chicago auto repossession company one of the nations largest 
with about twice as many people surrendering their cars because 
they cant make payments 
the repossession rate is even more frenetic at bruce schneiders 
allied recovery inc in portland ore where nearly five times as 
many car owners are voluntarily handing over their keys compared 
with last year 
whats going on right now is no different than at any time when 
money has tightened up a little said mcgivern its all 
cyclical 
easy credit including longer loan terms dating from a time when 
interest rates were lower has spawned an increase in defaulted auto 
loans say automakers repo agents and some banks 
its been somewhat of a boon to the repo business which thrives 
by working for creditors to seize goods bought on borrowed money 
when loans arent repaid on time 
people were attracted to the lower interest rates and ran out 
and bought on impulse said huey mayronne executive director of 
american recovery association trade group for the nations auto 
repossessors 
at the same time they were buying tvs and other things on 
credit mayronne said they didnt realize what their budgets 
could handle its catching up with them now 
domestic automakers which offered lowrate loans in 1986 and 
1987 to help regain marketshare from foreign competitors have 
especially noticed this trend 
no 1 general motors corp for instance reports that 2 percent 
of the vehicles financed through its lending arm or about 143000 
cars and trucks were repossessed last year up from 16 percent in 
1987 and the highest level in eight years the rate peaked at 29 
percent in 1970 but had remained below the 2 percent level until 
1988 
ford motor cos repossessions and loan defaults also climbed in 
1988 from the previous year according to its financing unit ford 
motor credit co although the company doesnt provide figures it 
noted that 1988 profits fell 17 percent over the previous year 
partly because of credit losses 
banks also have been involved in the auto financing frenzy 
introducing 60month loans about four years ago in reaction to 
rapidly rising auto prices but even though theyve seen a slight 
rise in credit losses it hasnt been nearly as much as experienced 
by the automakers themselves 
the overall repossession rate of banks that lend directly to 
buyers averaged 012 percent of outstanding loans in 1988 up 
slightly from 010 percent the previous year according to the 
american bankers association 
delinquency rates on direct bank loans averaged 183 percent in 
1988 up from 171 percent the previous year the bank trade group 
said 
the competition is so great among the loan instititions that 
theyre taking fringe buyers where they wouldnt take them said 
repo man myles weiss owner of able auto adjusters in los angeles 
the bottom line is someone will take a chance on you 
ford motor credit chairman william odom conceded that credit 
standards had been lowered particularly among firsttime buyers 
but he said the company has been tightening procedures he said the 
unexpectedly high credit loss of 1988 is changing things in 
the way we evaluate and investigate loan applications at the lower 
end of the creditworthiness scale 
with the steady increase in interest rates lately some industry 
experts are predicting that financial institutions will be more 
selective in who they lend money to and that many more wouldbe car 
owners will remain on the sidelines 
but for now lenders must deal with the problems of the recent 
past 
generally speaking the adjusters have been busier than they 
have been before said weiss 
he declined to provide any figures at his repossession firm but 
some others who did noted an increase particularly among owners who 
voluntarily relinquish their cars 
schneiders oregon repo company used to have one or two people 
surrender their cars every week but now hes seeing that same amount 
each day youre finding more 86 and 87s being surrendered he 
said 
chicago repo man mcgivern has 10 to 16 voluntary giveups a week 
twice as many as usual 
they lenders put out a hellacious amount of paper on car 
loans in the last year and a half mcgivern said but they 
would not finance these cars if they did not know they had the 
alternative to repossess the car 
in many cases defaults occur in the later stages of longterm 
loans when debtburdened owners realize their vehicles are worth 
less than the amount outstanding on the loan a condition known in 
the industry as being upside down 
not realizing what could happen to his credit rating the 
car owner thinks maybe i would be better off defaulting said 
donald w grigley senior vice president at connecticut national 
bank in hartford conn 
over a twoyear period the value of a new car may depreciate 
anywhere from 35 percent to 60 percent a rate which experts say has 
been creeping up in the last three to five years the longer the 
loan the more time it takes to build up equity 
grigley gives the following example a new subcompact costing 
10000 in 1987 would have a book value of 4100 today if the 
owner took out a 9000 bank loan over 48 months at 9 percent 
interest he would still owe 490218 or around 800 more than the 
cars value 
the owner wouldnt gain equity until the 30th month when the car 
would be worth 3800 vs 3750 left on the loan full equity is 
achieved after four years when the car is worth 2800 and the loan 
is retired 
the longer you go in loan period the more problems you can 
have said weiss a 36month loan should really be the maximum 
after a car is repossessed voluntarily or not it usually is 
sold at auction often as is 
but repossession wont put an end to previous owners credit 
problems they still remain liable for the difference between the 
amount of the loan and what the car sells for

for jim hooley the moment of truth came as he 
stood on the tarmac in a remote industrial area of the los angeles 
international airport watching ronald reagans eightcar caravan 
drive off 
i just suddenly realized its over im standing there 
waving at a car he recalls 
for eight years hooley had been a white house advance man and 
then head of the advance office arranging for reagans presidential 
trips and accompanying him in airplanes and motorcades at home and 
abroad 
now he was left at the airport 
he had known he would not travel in this final motorcade to the 
former presidents new home but it still came as a shock 
i dont know what you expect but it sort of ends abruptly 
he says 
hooleys experience is typical of that of many but not all 
former white house aides as they move from 1600 pennsylvania avenue 
to more mundane addresses 
some say they experience no pangs 
i had been wanting to get out of government for about five 
years so this is a fun thing says rebecca range who directed the 
white house office of public liaison before jan 20 and is now a 
vice president of texas air 
after a while i think everyone gets to the point where they 
want to live a more normal life says elizabeth board looking for 
work after her years as director of the white house television 
office 
but for many like hooley it is kind of traumatic 
people handle it differently he says you went from people 
who literally cried as they packed their cardboard boxes to others 
who went through a state of numbness 
i think when we began to feel it was when the time came to 
start clearing out of your offices and new people who were going to 
be moving into your offices were beginning to stick their heads in 
but even after they were on the airplane headed west hooley 
says the impact did not quite sink in for the staff perhaps not 
for reagan either since the routine was one they had followed 
before 
then came the moment at the airport 
after hooley arrived back at his suburban virginia home workmen 
came to remove the white house telephones on every floor part of 
the elaborate communications setup he enjoyed as head of advance 
all of a sudden you realize that you are like everybody else 
now he says

us sprint communications co says it has bought 
the us end of a fiberoptic phone cable beneath the atlantic ocean 
that is scheduled to begin operating in august 
the cable will be the second to go into operation across the 
atlantic ocean following one inaugurated in december by american 
telephone amp telegraph co british telecom inc and france telecom 
us sprints partner in the new cable called ptat is britains 
cable and wireless plc both companies are likely to defray the cost 
of the cable by bringing in other partners 
the two companies said that as part of a new alliance announced 
thursday to be named global fon they will offer telephone credit 
card billing to the united states or united kingdom in the currency 
of the users choice and a service that will allow sevendigit 
calling between specified locations in the two countries 
sprint purchased its stake in the cable from the washingtonbased 
private transatlantic telecommunications system the acquisition 
which is subject to approval by the federal communications 
commission gives sprint a 50 percent interest in ptat along with 
cable and wireless 
terms of the deal werent disclosed 
at a new york city news conference carried by closedcircuit 
television to washington and three other us cities us sprint 
president william t esrey said the cable is expected to cost 
between 450 million and 475 million when it is completed 
it will have 17000 circuits capable of carrying 80000 digital 
voice communications and will have more capacity than all the 
existing transatlantic cables combined the companies said 
it will compete directly with the tat8 transatlantic fiber 
cable built by atampt and its european partners 
esrey said the ptat cable can operate at half the cost of tat8 
but he said that did not necessarily mean global fon rates would be 
half those of its competitors 
esrey said the deal would cause very little impact on 
sprints balance sheet sprint the thirdlargest us longdistance 
company after atampt and mci communications corp had an operating

esrey said the cable would have a substantial amount of 
business right from the start as sprint and cable and wireless 
shift their existing customers to the new cable which will carry 
both business and residential traffic 
esrey would not comment on the possible effect the new cable 
would have on its competition other than to say we are offering a 
quality of service and products that are not now available 
esrey said it was distinctly possible that sprint would allow 
others to buy into its half of the cable 
we have been eagerly approached by a number of people who want 
significant capacity on ptat he said 
gordon owen deputy chief executive of cable and wireless said 
his companys mercury communications subsidiary will handle the 
british end of the ptat traffic mercury currently carries 11 
percent of the usbritish phone traffic by satellite and cable 
and wireless north america already operates in the united states 
ptat will have spurs to ireland and bermuda 
owen said global fon also would be carried on a new transpacific 
cable expected to be ready in 1990 that is partly owned by cable and 
wireless and which will link the united states with japan hong kong 
and singapore 
sprint a subsidiary of united telecommunications inc of 
westwood kan and gte corp now provides voice service to 150

a precedentsetting 225 million fine against 
ashland oil inc for negligence in one of the nations largest 
inland fuel spills should be a warning to future violators federal 
officials say 
we want to try and send a message to these people this is 
something were going to take a hard line on said charles sheehy 
us attorney for western pennsylvania 
ashlands penalty the largest ever imposed against a company for 
a fuel spill shows the concern for these types of offenses 
agreed charles demonaco assistant chief of the justice departments 
environmental crime section 
us district judge gustave diamond on thursday imposed what he 
called a gentle sentence against the kentucky company for last 
years fuel spill that fouled two rivers in three states and 
threatened to disrupt drinking water supplies for more than a 
million people 
were it not for the defendants responsible action following 
the fuel spill and during this weeks court proceedings the penalty 
would have been much harsher he said 
ashland spokesman roger schrum however described the fine as 
excessive it was not immediately decided whether an appeal 
would be filed he said 
the judge said the company was guilty of more than simple 
negligence when the tank at its floreffe terminal ruptured on jan 
2 1988 unleashing 38 million gallons of diesel fuel more than 
700000 gallons escaped a dike and entered the monongahela river 25 
miles south of pittsburgh 
the fuel moved down the monongahela a source of drinking water 
for suburban pittsburgh then entered the ohio river also a source 
of drinking water 
authorities blamed the accident on a dimesized flaw in the 
tanks world war iiera steel 
the company did indeed have a responsibility to exercise more 
than minimal care diamond said 
diamond presided in a criminal case in which ashland pleaded no 
contest to two misdemeanor counts under the clean water and refuse 
acts each count normally would carry a maximum fine of 200000 per 
count 
but diamond invoked a special fines provision marking the first 
time the federal provision had ever been applied in an environmental 
criminal case since it was instituted five years ago he therefore 
was not limited in setting a fine as long as half of it represented 
actual damages 
the occupational safety and health administration fined ashland 
more than 50000 for safety violations and the environmental 
protection agency fined the company 145000 for alleged 
deficiencies in its spill prevention plan 
ashland is negotiating with state governments to settle civil 
penalties and damage claims totaling more than 10 million in 
addition 20 class action suits are pending against the company 
schrum said 
about 23000 suburban pittsburgh residents endured a week without 
tap water because their system lacked sufficient reserves to last 
until the river current carried the pollution downstream past their 
water intakes 
mandatory conservation was ordered for businesses and homes 
elsewhere in parts of pennsylvania ohio and west virginia 
so far ashland said it has paid about 18 million in cleanup 
costs and civil claims from affected residents and businesses 
the best deterrence against a recurrence of this kind of 
accident is the expense and humiliation my client has already been 
subjected to ashland attorney thomas donovan said 
this is an incident that involves no willful misconduct he 
said no one got sick no one was physically injured there was 
inconvenience but its purely a matter of economics 
donovan cited the companys quick move to resolve such problems 
in asking diamond to merge the two counts and impose the usual limit 
of 200000 
demonaco however argued for a multimilliondollar fine 
ashland without question was negligent he said 
diamond agreed a low fine would not deter future violators 
sufficiently punish ashland or protect the public 
nevertheless he said a deterrent effect of all of this will 
come not so much from the fine but the object lesson

the dollar lost ground against the japanese yen in 
tokyo today while share prices gained on the tokyo stock exchange 
after opening lower at 12885 yen the dollar finished the day 
almost unchanged at 12888 yen down 035 yen from thursdays 
12923yen closing it ranged during the day between 12882 and 
12908 yen 
dealers said the us currencys decline was prompted by a 
federal reserve board officials comment early today that the dollar 
needs to fall further in order for the united states to reduce its 
trade deficit 
anxiety over february us unemployment figures due to be 
released later today in washington also sidelined many players 
said a dealer at a major commercial bank who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
because of the upcoming release of employment numbers there 
was no major movement today in tokyo said an exchange dealer at a 
major us commercial bank in tokyo there was some active selling 
by insurance companies in the early morning when the dollar got up 
above 129 yen but that was about it all day 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues which lost 18121 points on thursday rose 4533 
points or 014 percent to close the week at 3170178 
share prices droped sharply during the morning session with the 
nikkei index falling 11633 points before noon however strong 
buying by private investors pushed the index up in the afternoon 
session 
some shares which once were considered overpriced have come 
down to a level which appears reasonable to investors said 
ichitaro watanabe a dealer at nikko securities co 
dealers said the market had been bearish since the end of 
february because of fund managers unwillingness to risk their 
portfolios near the end of the accounting period for mutual and 
trust funds japans fiscal year ends on march 31 
most fund managers appear to have won reasonable profits thanks 
to the bullish market throughout the year said keiichi nishida a 
dealer at kidder peabody securities in tokyo most have already 
cashed in and there doesnt seem to be much incentive in the market 
for buying at this point 
but he said investors might turn to buying again if share prices 
go down further

the dollar lost ground in thin european trading 
this morning as the market waited for the release of the latest us 
unemployment figures gold prices rose about 5 an ounce 
foreign exchange dealers said the market had come to a virtual 
standstill in anticipation of the us unemployment statistics for 
february which were to be released later today 
economists were predicting a decline in the unemployment rate to 
53 percent from 54 percent 
some traders said the us unemployment report could shake the 
market out of its current lethargy if the figures come in 
significantly above or below expectations 
but others doubted that the report would be capable of lifting 
the market out of its current doldrums 
one trader said he thought it was rather ridiculous how the 
market can be paralyzed because of what likely would be just a 
minor change in a monthly statistic 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 035 yen to a closing 12888 yen later in london 
it was quoted higher at 12900 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late thursdays 
rates included 18585 west german marks down from 18600 15863

possibly at a higher price and passengers who bought tickets with a

energy secretary james d watkins is moving 
quickly to tackle the problems of modernizing the nations 
problemplagued nuclear weapons plants and cleaning up their 
hazardous wastes 
even before his formal swearingin thursday a team of nuclear 
experts assembled by watkins had begun assessing conditions and 
prospects at key weapons plants to give him an independent view of 
the problems department officials said 
members of the watkins team visited the savannah river plant 
near aiken sc last week and were at the hanford reservation in 
washington state earlier this week the officials said 
the creation of the team and the start of their work were not 
announced by the department 
watkins informed the senate energy and natural resources 
committee late last month that he wanted a special review of efforts 
at savannah river to prepare the restart of three reactors there 
that produce tritium a perishable and scarce gas needed to make 
nuclear warheads the reactors have been shut down since last spring 
because of safety technical and management problems 
this review will provide me with an integrated overview of 
progress and planned activities at savannah river and other key 
parts of the weapons complex watkins said in a written response to 
questions from members of the senate panel a text of watkins 
comments was made available by the panel this week 
the department has said that unless it gets at least one of the 
savannah river reactors back in operation by the end of the year 
supplies of tritium would be dangerously low 
will callicott a department spokesman said he could confirm 
that members of the new review team had visited savannah river but 
he declined to provide more details 
tom bauman a spokesman at the departments hanford office in 
richland wash said two members of the team leo duffy and fred 
carlson had visited the site on monday he too said he could not 
discuss other details of the visit 
at watkins swearingin ceremony at energy department 
headquarters president bush pledged to waste no time starting 
to correct the weapons plants problems including extensive soil and 
groundwater contamination at some sites 
this task is critical bush told an audience of several 
hundred energy department employees 
these problems developed over time and theyll be fully solved 
only over time but well waste no time getting started on fixing 
these problems bush said 
the department in the waning days of the reagan administration 
issued a preliminary plan for spending 81 billion over the next 21 
years to modernize and begin cleaning up the weapons complex bush 
has not explicitly endorsed the plan 
at his swearingin watkins said his main goal was to instill a 
more responsible attitude in energy department workers that would 
lead to sounder practices in the nuclear field 
nuclear power demands no less than the best from all who 
control it he said this then is exactly what i ask of my 
department a commitment to excellence 
so i ask you to help me forge in the workplace a culture that 
rejects the mediocre and substandard 
watkins last week circulated a memo to department employees 
around the country spelling out some of his top priorities 
including restarting the savannah river reactors and developing 
fiveyear objectives for waste cleanup at each of the nuclear 
weapons sites department spokeswoman christina sankey said 
other priorities mentioned in the memo include legislation to 
remove the remaining price controls on natural gas moving ahead 
with the 59 billion superconducting super collider project to 
study the nature of matter and energy pushing legislation to allow 
oil exploration on the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife 
refuge in alaska and developing an integrated national energy 
policy

sen patrick leahy says he needs to know what 
role the commodity futures trading commission played in an 
investigation of the chicago exchanges before his committee decides 
whether to reauthorize the agency 
leahy dvt made the comment thursday during an appearance 
before the agriculture committee by cftc chairman wendy lee gramm 
the committee chairman said he and fellow senators would have to 
know what the commission did during the twoyear undercover fbi 
investigation of alleged abuses at the chicago board of trade and 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
mrs gramm said her agency was cooperating with the fbi but she 
would not elaborate saying the justice department told her to 
refrain from further comment 
but leahy said without knowing its very difficult for us to 
pursue oversight responsibilities leahy said he has asked 
attorney general richard thornburgh for a senatorsonly briefing 
both the senate and house have been conducting hearings to 
determine if the commission should be restructured to better police 
the exchanges 
the cftc is the federal agency charged with overseeing the 
exchanges involved with commodities trading but its authority to do 
so is granted by congress its authorization expires in september 
sen kent conrad dnd asked mrs gramm if the commission 
asked the fbi to investigate 
how the investigation got started is something i cannot comment 
on she replied i cant say the nature of the cooperation of 
the cftc 
when asked by sen robert kerrey dneb whether the cftc could 
have done its own undercover investigation mrs gramm said she did 
not think her agency had the authority to do the kind of criminal 
work such a probe entails 
it is my view that we have a good cooperative effort with the 
fbi she said 
we are concerned about whether you do the best job you can 
said sen thomas daschle dsd he said he wondered why the 
commission had never asked if it had the authority for undercover 
work 
mrs gramm said the commission uses aggressive techniques for 
uncovering fraud and abuse and the exchanges have been responsive 
to enforcement action by the commission 
daschle said he could not see any objective measure of the cftcs 
success and asked mrs gramm to supply him with such evidence later 
leahy asked mrs gramm to provide within 30 days an analysis of 
the pros and cons of 11 proposals for tightening oversight of the 
exchange floors 
they are 
requiring the exchanges to devote more resources to floor 
surveillance and compliance 
requiring greater representation on exchange governing boards of 
nonfloor membership interests like wire house and trade firms and 
public members 
barring exchange members who have been repeatedly disciplined 
from serving on exchange disciplinary or oversight panels 
increasing penalties for trading abuses 
requiring broker associations to register and limit trading 
among association members 
curbing dual trading in pits where the exchange audit trail 
cannot demonstrate a oneminute accuracy rate of 90 percent or 
better 
mandating improvements in exchange audit trails 
increasing physical presence of cftc staff on exchange floors 
barring oral orders on the floor 
adjusting cftc rules to attract and keep the best professional 
staff possible and 
increasing cftc powers 
he also asked her to provide any other proposals that the 
committee could consider

state legislative leaders say they oppose 
raising federal excise taxes because past increases in those taxes 
on gas alcohol and cigarettes have cost the states billions of 
dollars in lost revenue 
to prove that point the national conference of state 
legislatures released a study thursday estimating the cost to 
states of federal excise tax increases conference leaders were 
meeting today with president bush and administration officials 
whenever the federal government has raised those excise taxes 
the states have lost money said samuel b nunez jr president 
pro tem of the louisiana senate and president of the conference 
the study estimated that the states have lost revenue amounting 
to 37 billion as a result of increases in those federal taxes in 
1983 and 1985 and projected the figure would grow to 72 billion 
by 1992 
the study said that higher federal excise taxes increase the 
final cost of the taxed goods and that higher prices in turn reduce 
the quantities purchased because states also tax those goods based 
on quantity rather than price the amount of state excise tax 
revenue is reduced the study said 
the conference is lobbying against an increase in federal excise 
taxes as part of any deficitreduction package this year maine 
house speaker john martin vice president of the conference said it 
would not oppose a federal income tax increase as part of a deficit 
solution 
the study was underwritten by a major cigarette company but 
martin said the company philip morris usa had nothing to do with 
its contents 
states traditionally rely on excise taxes on cigarettes alcohol 
and motor fuels for large portions of their revenues most states 
earmark those revenues for specific purposes with most fuel taxes 
going for transportation needs 
martin said further increases in the federal excise taxes would 
inhibit states and local governments from further increases in their 
own excise taxes thus limiting an important revenue source 
the study estimated that a 1 percent increase in the price of 
gasoline reduces sales 06 percent and that comparable increases in 
the price of cigarettes reduce sales 04 percent and in distilled 
spirits 1 percent 
in 1983 the federal tax on cigarettes rose from 8 cents to 16 
cents per pack and the tax on gasoline rose from 4 cents to 9 cents 
per gallon the tax on distilled spirits rose from 1050 to 1250 
per gallon in 1985 the study said 
the study was conducted for the conference by the policy 
economics group of peat marwick main amp co a national certified 
public accounting firm

a democratic measure to increase the minimum 
wage by 130 an hour to 465 over three years is gaining ground in 
congress even as president bush insists he will veto any raise 
higher than his own proposal 
the plan to raise the 335anhour minimum wage for the first 
time since 1981 won approval from the house labor standards 
subcommittee on thursday democratic leaders at the same time 
called for a compromise on a subminimum training wage for new 
hires in hopes of passing the increase this month 
rep austin murphy chairman of the subcommittee said he plans 
to propose a reduced minimum when the bill reaches the house floor 
although requirements will be far stricter than what the 
administration wants 
the house bill drawn up thursday is virtually identical to the 
one passed wednesday by the senate labor and human resources 
committee where chairman edward m kennedy dmass says he hopes 
the legislation is on a fast track for approval 
but the bush administration repeated warnings thursday that an 
increase beyond 90 cents an hour over three years and without its 
own reduced minimum for all newly hired workers would be vetoed 
the entire package is the bottom line both the 425 figure 
and the sixmonth training wage at 335 said dale tate a 
spokeswoman for labor secretary elizabeth dole weve come more 
than halfway towards meeting the goal of proponents of a minimum 
wage increase 
despite the differences democrats were encouraged that the white 
house favors an increase at all 
recent white house proposals are both constructive and 
encouraging said murphy dpa 
the bush package would keep the hourly floor at 335 for all 
newly hired workers for their first six months employment on any 
job otherwise 30 cents an hour would be added to the minimum 
annually for three years 
the democratic plan would raise the minimum to 385 on enactment 
and add 40 cents an hour in the next two years to reach 465 in 
1991 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif has scheduled action on the 
measure by his house education and labor committee next tuesday he 
said he hopes for a full house vote the following day although a 
spokeswoman for senate majority leader george mitchell said no vote 
is expected there until members return from the easter recess in 
april 
hawkins became the latest democratic leader to reverse field on 
the training wage issue saying thursday hes willing to accept a 
subminimum if it is limited and includes education and real 
training requirements 
democratic committee aides said the murphy plan being drawn up 
would limit a subminimum to firsttime workers and likely have 
specific requirements for training on different occupations the 
aides said duration of the subminimum would be for between 30 and 
90 days and that the lower wage would be pegged to a percentage of 
the standard minimum wage 
our amendment will be more restrictive than the proposals we 
have heard from the president said murphy however our effort 
will show we are sincere and prepared to address all the components 
of this issue 
democrats and organized labor have long opposed a second tier for 
new employees because of fears that workers would be laid off in 
favor of those covered by the lower scale 
but hawkins said thursday if they want to have a training 
wage we will discuss it with them it would have to be a 
meaningful training wage it could not be one in name that allows 
only a subminimum

investigation codenamed operation ill wind of the 
pentagons 150billionayear purchasing practices 
one of the men who pleaded guilty in us district court was 
charles f gardner 58 former general manager of unisys corps 
surveillance and fire control systems division in great neck ny 
gardner admitted bribing melvyn paisley the former assistant 
secretary of the navy for research engineering and systems by 
buying paisleys condominium in sun valley idaho for an inflated 
price in 1986 and to funnelling illegal corporate contributions to 
congressional campaigns 
these pleas of guilty are significant developments not only 
because of what they demonstrate in themselves but also because the 
cooperation we will receive from these three individuals will move 
this investigation forward at a tremendous pace hudson said 
james g neal and kenneth f brooke both private consultants 
pleaded guilty to other charges before us district court judge 
claude hylton neal a consultant to unisys worked closely with 
gardner prosecutors said in court documents gardner also worked 
with william galvin a private consultant who is brookes stepfather 
neal admitted conspiring to bribe garland tomlin jr who was a 
navy engineer with the naval electronics systems command until his 
retirement in october 1985 
on instructions from gardner neal transferred in 1983 and 1984 a 
total of 400000 to a longwood international a company in nassau 
bahamas owned by tomlin in order to influence tomlins decisions 
the government said tomlin has not been charged with any crime 
gardner was charged in a criminal information with three counts 
including bribery conspiracy to commit bribery and file false 
statements and aiding and assisting in the filing of a false tax 
return he faces a maximum sentence of 23 years in prison and fines 
of up to 750000 
prosecutors said gardner amassed a slush fund by hiring 
consultants to unisys with the understanding that some money 
would be placed in bank accounts both domestic and foreign for 
purposes of bribery illegal campaign contributions and in part for 
gardners personal use 
the government also said gardner caused unisys to make and 
present to the departments of the navy and air force false 
fictitious and fraudulent claims upon and against the united 
states 
unisys a giant computer company with headquarters in blue bell 
pa said in a statement that it had cooperated with the government 
and welcomed gardners guilty pleas 
what has been uncovered is a deliberate fraud and other 
criminal activities carefully disguised by a small group of former 
sperry employees and consultants the company said unisys is a 
successor to sperry corp 
the government said gardner at galvins suggestion arranged to 
have neal buy paisleys resort condominium in august 1986 for 
149000 a price above fair market value a year later the property 
sold for 100000 
hudson said the condominium purchase was designed to influence 
paisleys actions on two pentagon contracts sought by unisys one on 
the aegis automated radar firing system and the other on the marine 
air traffic and landing system unisys eventually received a portion 
of the 9 billion aegis contract 
paisley now a private consultant has not been charged with any 
crime but prosecutors said he performed certain official acts to 
benefit unisys with regard to the two contracts 
gardner also caused illegal 1000 corporate contributions to be 
made in 1986 and 1987 to the campaigns of rep roy dyson dmd and 
former rep bill chappell dfla both members of a house committee 
that handled defense issues dyson and chappell have denied knowing 
that illegal contributions were funnelled to their campaigns 
in january robert d barrett a former unisys executive pleaded 
guilty in january to charges stemming from the complicated scheme to 
make illegal campaign contributions 
prosecutors spelled out an elaborate network of companies in 
northern virginia that neal set up at gardners request to receive 
money from unisys and sperry 
neal also pleaded guilty to making false claims to the government 
and conspiring to defraud the government by concealing his true 
taxable income he faces up to 15 years in prison and fines of 
750000 
brooke 40 pleaded guilty to evading about 66000 in taxes in 
1985 prosecutors said he faces a sentence of five years in prison 
and a fine of up to 250000

fords son william c ford jr and nephew edsel b ford ii the 
31yearold william ford jr called billy is managing director of 
ford of switzerland and edsel ford is general sales manager for 
fords lincolnmercury division 
both of the young fords are members of the companys board of 
directors but neither holds key positions 
i think that will be taken care of in the near future 
william ford said at a rare news conference at ford headquarters 
thursday he said he expected the cousins to be named to committees 
of the companys board in the near future 
ford has been a member of the companys board of directors since 
1948 the year before he graduated from yale and will remain a 
member of the board and as chairman of its finance and executive 
committees 
fords retirement announcement five days before his 64th 
birthday was no surprise for weeks there has been talk around 
auto circles in detroit about the roles of billy and edsel in the 
company a fortune magazine article hit the newsstands in december 
saying that ford chairman donald petersen didnt believe the two 
were ready for leadership posts 
during the annual automobile show in detroit in january however 
petersen said the cousins were now coming of age 
ford said thursday that members of the family should be in top 
positions of the company however no family member should be given 
a position simply because of the family name he said 
nature has got to take its course ford said 
the ford family through trusts and individually exercises 40 
percent of voting power of shareholders through a special class b 
stock the number of votes connected with each share of class b 
stock is adjusted before each annual meeting to give those 
shareholders the 40 percent

ford who took part in decisions that lifted the company out of 
severe financial troubles in the early 1980s has been chairman of 
the boards design committee since it was created in 1957 
two of the main reasons the company was put on the road from 
financial problems to the nations mostprofitable automaker were 
the ford taurus and mercury sable automobiles both of which 
capitalized on sleek aerodynamic looks 
in offering a public farewell to ford company chairman harold 
poling said thursday that development of the aerodynamic look 
wasnt exactly a unanimous thing in the company 
later ford said i was all for it i think everybody kind of 
resists change personally i find it very appealing 
he was the youngest of four children of edsel b ford president 
of the automobile company from 1919 until his death in 1943 
fords oldest brother henry ford ii was the companys 
president chairman and chief executive officer before his death in 
september 1987 his other brother benson ford was vice president 
and chairman of the dealer policy board when he died in 1978 
ford also is the sole owner and president of the detroit lions 
professional football club 
now that he has retired ford said he will have more time to 
devote to golf and the lions one of the worst teams in the nfl last 
year with a 412 record

the state of california has charged 
trans world airlines with deceptive air travel advertising 
the complaint filed thursday alleges that twa advertised in 
newspapers and other media a low oneway fare to london although in 
fact the fare could be obtained only by buying a roundtrip ticket 
state attorney general john van de kamp issued a statement saying 
the suit in san diego county superior court would bar the 
airline from further unfair advertising and assess civil penalties 
van de kamp said twas advertising fails to clearly and 
adequately disclose other fees that must be paid to utilize the 
advertised oneway fare 
the complaint also alleges that twa falsely advertised that 
customers who used the low london fare could obtain an alamo rental 
car free but it says there is a mandatory fuel fee regardless of 
how far the car is driven and even when the customers buy their own 
fuel 
the announcement said that in filing the action the attorney 
generals office took notice of a recent decision by the us court 
of appeals for the district of columbia that rejected us 
department of transportation rules permitting airlines to omit 
certain taxes and fees from advertised flight costs

a joint committee of the legislature has 
voted 73 to rename north dakota simply dakota ridding the 
state of an unimaginative unattractive ordinary word 
critics called the muchballyhooed idea a public relations stunt 
but the joint constitutional revisions committee on thursday 
endorsed a resolution that would put the name change on the november 
1990 ballot as a constitutional amendment 
before that referendum is held though the resolution will have 
to be approved by the state senate and the state house if the 
voters eventually endorse the idea the name change would also have 
to be approved by congress 
gov george sinner does not oppose the name change but has no 
plans to lobby for it press secretary robert jansen said 
state tourism director jim fuglie who has plugged the name 
change in radio interviews across the country was ecstatic about 
thursdays vote vowing to resign his job and work fulltime to 
campaign for it if lawmakers eventually place the issue before the 
voters 
the word north is an unimaginative unattractive ordinary 
word tacked onto the spectacular word dakota fuglie said 
backers also say the word north conjures up a cold harsh 
climate and detracts from the word dakota which means 
friend and is the name of a group of indian tribes also known as 
the sioux 
dakota is such a beautiful word said rep janet wentz 
when we were given the name north dakota we didnt have anything 
to say about it 
sen ray holmberg one of the three legislators who voted against 
the resolution said the name north dakota is extremely important 
to the history and heritage of the state and should not be used as a 
public relations experiment 
the proposal also has drawn fire in newspaper editorials and 
letters to the editor and became the focus of a tongueincheek 
campaign by a montana paper to find a new name for the state the 
winner of the billings gazette contest was manitscolda as in 
man its colda 
before voting for the idea committee members shot down an 
amendment that would have changed the states name to dakotah 
sen donna nalewaja said she thought it might be classy to add 
the h but said it would meet resistance from voters

a jury has awarded 36 fired casino workers 388 
million in a case that could affect the way nevadas gaming industry 
hires and fires its employees 
the federal court jury on thursday found the las vegas hilton 
guilty of age and sex discrimination breach of contract bad faith 
and inflicting severe emotional distress in the firing of the 
workers in september 1983 
hilton attorneys contended that casinos have the right to hire 
and fire at will because of the volatile nature of the business and 
the large amount of cash that is handled 
the resort also claimed the dealers understood they could be 
fired at will and accepted it as a tradeoff for large amount of 
money they made in wages and tips 
the dealers though claimed they were the victims of age and sex 
discrimination when they were replaced by younger female workers 
and contended the hotel gave them an implied contract when hired 
that they would not be fired except with justifiable cause 
casinos have traditionally held themselves to be above the 
law said brian berman an attorney for the plaintiffs we think 
the jury sent a clear example to the employers in the state of 
nevada that they cannot do this 
hilton executives testified that the workers were fired over the 
1983 labor day weekend after other unsuccessful attempts to clear 
up an unusually low win percentage in the hotels blackjack pit 
the verdict came after four days of deliberation following a 
14week trial 
the biggest portion of the award was for punitive damages which 
the jury assessed at 30 million 
steve wynn owner of the golden nugget hotel and casino attacked 
the verdict saying it was stupid for a jury to award that much in 
such a case 
the affected dealers disagreed 
its been 5 years of praying and a little hope said jack 
bosarge we realized we were up against one of the biggest 
corporations in the world but we all stuck together and came out on 
top 
hilton attorneys said they would ask the verdict be set aside 
claiming the jury was misled by sympathy for the workers if that 
fails resort attorneys said they would appeal 
were very disappointed said hilton attorney raymond kelly 
casino manager robert kelley and the hilton did exactly what it 
had to do under the circumstances 
all but five of the casino workers won claims for age 
discrimination and were awarded sums ranging from 7000 to 107000 
for lost wages each plaintiff also was given 200000 for the 
hilton having inflicted severe emotional distress in the firings 
and will share the 30 million in punitive damages 
maybe the whole gambling business will learn something from 
this said joseph saunto one of the fired workers maybe they 
wont throw people away now when theyre done with them 
the plaintiffs had sought nearly 50 million in actual and 
punitive damages

ncnb texas national bank is resisting regulators 
pressure to dispose of about 6 billion in troubled assets the 
company manages as a result of its takeover of first republicbank 
corp 
the federal deposit insurance corp which owns 80 percent of 
ncnb texas wants to sell the assets mainly real estate while bank 
officials are contemplating holding on to the property 
we would be inclined to take a longer view than they would be 
inclined to take ncnb texas chairman francis r kemp said we 
have to be realistic to achieve the highest value for their assets 
that contrasts with fdic chairman l william seidmans statement 
earlier this week that we are not in the business of speculating 
on real estate values 
kemp said the bank could see some value in retaining assets 
particularly real estate for a number of years until market prices 
begin to recover 
acknowledging that many lenders have sustained losses from 
attempting to outlast the texas real estate slump kemp said he 
believes disposal may be illadvised 
we are concerned that we would like to take more time with real 
estate than the fdic would like but were not sure were right 
he said this is clearly a how high is high question 
the government segregated the troubled loans and other assets 
were placed into a separate pool which ncnb texas agreed to manage 
last summer when it bought the former banks of first republic 
fdic officials would not comment thursday in other situations 
regulators have adopted a strategy of making all assets available 
for sale at market prices

a federal judge who has temporarily barred 
commuter railroad workers from honoring eastern airlines strikers 
picket lines has extended his order until he renders a final 
decision 
us district judge robert p patterson jr extended his 
selfimposed friday midnight deadline indefinitely until he rules 
on whether it is legal for railroad workers to strike in sympathy 
with airlines workers 
patterson gave no indication how long the temporary restraining 
order would remain in effect or when he would issue a written 
opinion on the complex labor dispute 
his secretary kathleen howley said patterson on friday decided 
to extend the deadline because the transcript of two days of 
hearings he conducted was not immediately available and electrical 
power in manhattans federal courthouse would be off for several 
hours on saturday for testing purposes 
i hope to render an opinion as soon as possible patterson 
told lawyers for both sides at the end of the second day of hearings 
on thursday but gave no indication when that might be 
less than an hour after strikebound eastern filed for chapter 11 
protection from creditors patterson heard competing legal arguments 
from lawyers for four metropolitan area railroads and the unions 
that represent their workers 
the unions claim that federal law allows secondary picketing in 
the railroad and airline industries 
but the railroads maintain that the law requires their employees 
to stay on the job until they go through a series of mandated 
arbitration steps 
on sunday at the request of the railroads patterson barred 
workers at the long island rail road metronorth and new jersey 
transit from honoring the picket lines of eastern strikers 
patterson later extended the temporary restraining order to 
amtrak workers 
eastern machinists had said they might set up picket lines at the 
railroads as part of their strike but have not done so yet 
this could bring the city to an absolute standstill the 
judge said near the end of wednesdays session 
earlier wednesday the unions urged a federal appeals court to 
overturn pattersons order but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
declined to intervene until the lower court made a determination 
in two days of lengthy hearings patterson heard railroad 
officials testify that they would be forced to shut down if their 
workers honored eastern strikers picket lines 
the unions will not concede that point and maintain that they 
will only urge and encourage their members to honor picket lines 
not order them to do so

iraqs state airline has asked the 
government to lift a ban on flights by trans world airlines so that 
a baghdaddetroit route can be opened a senior iraqi airways 
official said 
nouri el din safi iraqi airways director general said thursday 
he hoped the ban on twa flights under an arab boycott of firms that 
do business with israel soon would be lifted 
he said that iraqi and united states civil aviation authorities 
reached agreement last year on starting flights between the 
countries but the accord was never implemented because of the twa 
ban 
the us government does not permit a foreign airline to operate 
in the united states if an american airline is banned from operating 
in that country 
safi said the planned flight would link baghdad and detroit 
which has a large iraqi community with a stop in paris

the finance minister says that if 
wealthy countries dont do something about reducing latin americas 
debt populists and demagogues will gain political power in the 
region 
the minister mailson da nobrega said people will believe in 
messiahs radical groups will replace moderate ones now grappling 
with latin americas 400 billion foreign debt 
recent riots in venezeula which left more than 250 people dead 
were a clear alert that the current debt situation is socially 
and politically unbearable da nobrega said 
latin american debt is being paid at the cost of low salaries 
for latin americans the industrialized countries dont understand 
this he said 
brazil owing 115 billion mostly to big us banks is the third 
worlds biggest debtor 
brazil which in 1985 returned to civilian government after 21 
years of military rule is preparing for presidential elections on 
nov 15 the first such popular vote in brazil since 1960 
political parties still must hold conventions to choose 
candidates but media polls show leftist leaders are very popular 
da nobrega said news reports that the bush administration is 
preparing new policies for dealing with third world debt are very 
positive 
this seems to be the maturing of an idea that there must be 
something more than just the debtors and the banks in the resolution 
of the debt the involvement of governments of industrialized 
countries and of international financial institutions he said 
latin american governments now in power realize that 
confrontation is not the answer da nobrega said 
but he added that these current administrations need 
corresponding measures from the developed world to reduce the 
amount of latin american debt and provide a flow of new financial 
resources to latin america

consuming countries are expected to call for the 
suspension of the current levy on traded cocoa at international 
cocoa organization talks opening here monday delegates said friday 
they are expected to argue a formal suspension is warranted 
because key cocoa producers have unilaterally stopped paying their 
share 
the levy of 30 a metric ton is collected by producers when they 
sell to cocoa organization consumers and by consumers when they buy 
from nonmembers 
the money is supposed to be forwarded to the cocoa organization 
headquartered in london to meet operational costs and to finance 
possible marketintervention measures 
the organization lacks the money to implement a proposed 
stockpiling scheme to stabilize prices in the current oversupplied 
market because of producer arrears totaling more than 80 million 
producer debts the bulk owed by the ivory coast and brazil have 
created a feeling of injustice among consuming countries delegates 
said requesting anonymity 
consumers were disappointed when producers at the last meeting of 
the 41nation cocoa organization here in january rejected a proposal 
to suspend the levy 
traders said that they did not expect the talks to produce any 
marketmoving developments 
international action to support prices looks likely to remain 
paralyzed for the foreseeable future said one 
all leading consuming countries except the united states are 
members of the cocoa organization the only key producers that do 
not belong are malaysia and indonesia

eastern airlines one day after filing for 
bankruptcy protection said today it will resume 80 flights because 
more pilots and flight attendants are crossing picket lines 
meanwhile thousands of eastern ticket holders scrambled to get 
refunds or fly on other carriers and a judge in new york today 
extended his order barring commuter railroad workers from honoring 
eastern machinists picket lines 
beginning sunday and monday eastern will resume its profitable 
service between miami and 13 latin american cities and restore 
flights linking boston and washington miami and san juan puerto 
rico miami and new yorks laguardia airport and laguardia and 
montreal said eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak in miami 
we have a number of pilots a number of flight attendants and 
in fact theyre coming back in higher numbers eastern president 
phil bakes said in announcing the new flights on nbcs today 
show 
the exact number of employees who will be recalled to work the 
restored flights has not been determined ms ceremsak said 
eastern has been flying 62 flights a day during the strike on its 
northeast shuttle linking boston new york and washington and three 
a week from miami to buenos aires and santiago eastern had 1040 
flights daily before the strike 
we are going to rebuild this airline in prudent sensible 
increments and get our men and women back to work so they can 
support their families bakes said 
a spokesman for the machinists union wally haber charged that 
eastern had brought 100 continental pilots into miami and was 
outfitting them with eastern uniforms he denied that eastern pilots 
were crossing picket lines 
the bankruptcy action by the nations seventhlargest airline 
announced thursday on the sixth day of a punishing strike by 
machinists union over easterns demands for concessions was the 
fifth biggest chapter 11 filing in history in terms of company 
assets 
the move sparked a new wave of denunciations by union leaders 
who called eastern chief frank lorenzo a robber baron 
machinists also called for a public boycott of easterns sister 
carrier continental airlines set up pickets against continental in 
houston and said they would oppose easterns reorganization plan 
and any sale of assets 
no pickets were reported at continentals area of new yorks la 
guardia airport but continentals telephone lines there were jammed 
as people sought alternate travel arrangements 
the first eastern airlines shuttle to leave boston for new york 
and washington today with a new 12 oneway fare in effect had 92 
people on board said a spokesman for the massachusetts port 
authority which operates logan international airport phil 
orlandella said previous shuttle flights since the machinists strike 
carried as few as seven passengers on planes equipped to carry as 
many as 177 passengers 
in new york us district judge robert p patterson jr extended 
a friday midnight deadline indefinitely until he rules on whether 
it is legal for railroad workers to strike in support of eastern 
workers a federal appeals court panel in philadelphia has issued a 
similar ban 
angry and confused passengers meanwhile confronted eastern 
ticket agents as well as travel agencies often getting little 
satisfaction as they learned they might have to wait on a long line 
of unsecured creditors for a refund or pay higher fares on other 
carriers 
but many service people as well as travel agents were as 
confused as the ticket holders about the effects of the action in 
us bankruptcy court in new york which temporarily frees the 
airline of the debt obligations 
this has been one of those days that we all hope would never 
happen said phil davidoff presidentelect of the 23000member 
american society of travel agents 
in miami ticket agent marion gordon and two coworkers at 
easterns office could only respond to angry customers by saying 
they had no money for refunds 
i am an old lady and im stranded on miami beach said rose 
aolt of new york city i have no money for another ticket 
youll just have to wait and see gordon answered 
under the chapter 11 filing the bankruptcy court must approve 
ticket refunds said ms ceremsak adding that she did not know how 
the process would work the wouldbe passengers who hold about 200 
million worth of tickets fall behind bigger secured creditors in 
priority in the eyes of the court 
but chances remained good that if the passengers destination 
were a popular one another carrier would honor the ticket although 
possibly at a higher price 
in addition passengers who bought tickets with a major credit 
card probably wont have to stand in line at the courthouse since a 
federal law protects consumers who make credit card purchases but 
fail to receive goods or services 
the best passengers could do was to trade eastern tickets for 
travel before march 15 for seats on its sister airline continental 
but beyond next week i dont know gordon told customers 
we dont even know if were going to get paid 
eastern meanwhile said it will attempt to get as many planes 
back in the air as possible in order to make old tickets good 
the company also plans to renegotiate agreements with other carriers 
to honor eastern tickets 
as late as wednesday miamibased eastern had insisted that a 
chapter 11 filing remained a last resort in its effort to survive 
the strike which is costing the airline about 4 million a day 
lorenzo at a news conference thursday blamed the damage that 
has been caused by the pilots union for the decision to seek 
protection the machinists strike which started saturday following 
a 17month dispute over wage concessions has been honored by most 
eastern pilots and flight attendants 
the 3600 pilots are critical to easterns operations and their 
support of the 8500 machinists forced the airline to shut down 
virtually all its operations monday and lay off some 9500 nonunion 
employees 
the airline faces a cash crisis that can only be averted and 
stabilized by turning to the bankruptcy court bakes said 
the bankruptcy filing is designed to give eastern a reprieve from 
debts and the threat of lawsuits by creditors while it tries to 
restructure and extricate itself from the worst crisis in its 
60year history 
eastern management listing more than 45 billion in net assets 
339 billion in liabilities and 15696 creditors insisted it 
intends to restore the company through the bankruptcy proceeding 
though in a smaller form 
we intend to operate our airline make no mistake about that 
bakes said 
lorenzo and bakes pledged that all creditors would be paid in 
full shareholders would receive fair value passengers would be 
protected and as many employees as possible would return to work 
eastern had 31200 employees before the strike 
the two eastern officials avoided specific comment on reports 
that lorenzo rival carl icahn had been asked by eastern strikers to 
consider a buyout of eastern 
the chapter 11 filing would still allow a takeover but would 
force approval by the bankruptcy court as well as by creditors 
making such a transaction cumbersome unions would also have a say 
icahn chairman of trans world airlines inc has said he would 
consider requests to acquire eastern only if eastern allowed the 
negotiations

federal aviation administration officials say they 
have received 59 reports of miswiring or faulty plumbing in 
cargohold and engine firesuppression systems of commercial jets 
made by the boeing co since 1981 
the first problem was reported in 1983 and the latest on thursday 
faa officials said 32 of the problems were found by airlines 
before jan 31 when the agency issued an airworthiness directive 
for checks of 741 jets in the united states while the other 27 were 
found afterward the faa also has heard from many foreign carriers 
flying some of the other 836 boeing jets that were built in the same 
period 
boeing is in the process of redesigning some parts and 
overhauling test procedures to try to prevent future errors 
meanwhile the seattle postintelligencer reported today that a 
letter dated jan 26 from leroy keith local manager of the faas 
aircraft certification service to boeing officials renewed concerns 
about delays in reporting safety problems to the federal agency 
boeing learned of crossed wires in a 757 cargo compared 
firesuppression system last august but reported the problem four 
months later keith noted 
until now i had been encouraged that there were definite 
improvements his letter said the 757 issue however indicates 
that more needs to be done 
the newspaper also said an internal faa briefing paper cited 
several factors in the plumbing and wiring mistakes 
fireextinguishing system connectors were identical in size 
making it easier to misconnect them and boeings functional test 
procedure did not include the completed systems to insure that the 
proper connector was attached to the corresponding plug on fire 
bottles 
results of this faa inspection have identified several areas of 
concern within the boeing quality control system the briefing 
paper said

the nations unemployment rate in february 
plunged to 51 percent the lowest point in 15 years as employers 
created 289000 new jobs in a sign of the economys continued 
strength the government reported today 
the jobless rate was down 03 percentage points from january 
hitting 51 percent for first time since may 1974 the labor 
department said the rate last was lower in december 1973 when it 
hit 49 percent 
at the same time employers created 289000 new nonfarm jobs last 
month with the gains confined to serviceproducing industries 
according to a separate survey of business payrolls 
februarys jobgrowth figure reflected some fallback after 
payrolls grew by a robust 415000 jobs in january when employment 
was spurred by unusually mild weather januarys figure was revised 
upward from an initial estimate of 408000 new jobs 
the latest figures provided fresh evidence that the economy 
continues to command strength in the seventh year of its record 
peacetime expansion despite widespread anticipation of an impending 
slowdown 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the drop in 
the unemployement rate good news and said jobs are still the 
best barometer of a sound economy 
while the numbers are volatile on a monthly basis the economy 
can continue to create jobs and inflation remain in check 
fitzwater said 
daniel t van dyke senior economist for bank of america in san 
francisco said februarys strong numbers are good in the near 
term but raise concern about growing inflationary pressures from 
tight labor markets 
certainly numbers like these do nothing to suggest pressure 
will be coming off labor markets he said the labor force just 
isnt growing fast enough to sustain employment growth at the rate 
were experiencing right now 
the unemployment rate had hovered around 53 percent and 54 
percent for the prior five months 
janet l norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics 
said in testimony prepared for congress that many wondered whether 
it was possible for the rate to decline any further or whether the 
labor market had already expanded as far as it could go 
she said that while the decline was important most of the 
decrease was among groups whose jobless rates tend to be erratic 
notably youth and hispanics 
we need another month or so of data to determine whether this 
single months phenomenon will be sustained ms norwood said 
overall the civilian labor force contracted by 247000 people 
last month to 1232 million while 142000 workers found jobs 
according to the departments monthly sample of households from 
which the jobless rate is calculated 
with the rise in employment 629 percent of workingage 
americans held jobs matching the record high level set in january 
februarys job growth was paced by gains in serviceproducing 
sectors while employment in goodsproducing industries decreased 
slightly due to a weatherrelated decline in construction 
there were 321000 new jobs in the serviceproducing sector of 
the economy including gains in health and business services 
construction employment was down 22000 jobs due to harsh weather 
after a strong surge in january that had been attributed largely to 
mild weather 
manufacturing employment was down 8000 jobs after steadily 
increasing since september 
in figures closely watched for signs of inflation the report 
showed that seasonally adjusted average hourly earnings of 
nonsupervisory employees were up a slim 01 percent and average 
weekly earnings declined 02 percent in february 
a separate unemployment calculation including the 17 million 
members of the armed forces stationed in the united states also 
stood at 51 percent in february down from 54 percent a month 
earlier 
in the civilian population the jobless rate among whites was 43 
percent last month down from 46 percent in january while the 
unemployment rate for blacks was 119 percent down from 12 percent 
the jobless rate among hispanics plunged to 68 percent from 84 
percent in january 
the rate for teenagers dropped by 16 percentage points to 148 
percent while the unemployment rate for young adults aged 20 to 24 
fell 12 points to 81 percent 
analysts have long been forecasting an economic slowdown but 
most reports at the start of 1989 have indicated the economy 
continues to demonstrate strong momentum 
weve had strong growth in employment that suggests were going 
into the first quarter with significant gains already in our 
pocket economist james annable of first national bank of chicago 
said in advance of todays report were not going to get a 
significant slowdown in growth in the first quarter 
analysts now expect the slowdown to materialize later this year 
as higher interest rates begin to take their toll 
the federal reserve board for a year has been pushing up interest 
rates in an effort to restrain excessive economic growth and keep 
inflation in check 
the feds latest round of credittightening came after reports 
showed consumer prices rose 06 percent during january and wholesale 
prices shot up 1 percent fed chairman alan greenspan blamed the 
increases in part on acceleration of wage increases in the tight 
labor market

the federal government has sold to private 
interests thousands of acres in the west worth a thousand times the 
lands selling price according to a published report 
the arizona republic reported in todays editions that the 
transactions described in a report by the general accounting 
office are allowed under a 117yearold law designed to promote 
miing in the west 
according to the gao report the republic said at least three 
phoenixarea tracts are involved including a 19acre site that sold 
in 1987 for 47 and now is estimated to be worth 376000 to 38 
million that site was bought by melluzzo and nichols granite 
operation the republic said 
other phoenix deals reported by the republic include the 1985 
sale of 15 acres for 38 but estimated to be worth 272000 it was 
bought by phoenix sand amp rock the republic also cited sale of 40 
acres near mesa in 1983 to another sand and gravel operation 
johnson amp johnson for 100 but estimated to be worth 400000 
the gao said that since 1970 the federal government has 
collected 4500 for land valued in 1988 at 14 million to 48 
million the newspaper reported 
the land was sold under the patent provisions of the mining law 
of 1872 which says a patent holder owns the land and the minerals 
contained in it 
to acquire a patent a person must meet certain minimal 
requirements intended to show mining activity but critics say the 
requirements are lax and meaningless 
the report urged that the law be changed to prohibit land sales 
under the loophole 
among the federal land sold was an inactive 160acre mining claim 
near the keystone colo ski resort that was patented in 1983 for 
250 an acre last year 44 acres of that tract were offered for 
sale at 11000 an acre 
this is outrageous said rep nick joe rahall dwva who 
heads the interior subcommittee on mining and natural resources 
where the report was released wednesday 
at 250 an acre these valuable federal lands are being 
transferred out of public ownership for fastfoodhamburger 
prices a statement released by rahall said 
the intent of the mining law is to facilitate mineral 
extraction not serve as a vehicle for land speculation and 
profiteering at the publics expense he added 
keith knoblock vice president of the 450member american mining 
congress said the report was misleading and contained factual 
errors he added that changing the law would hurt the struggling 
mining industry 
he said the gao decided what conclusions it wanted to reach and 
then presented information to justify those conclusions 
since passage of the mining law the federal government has sold 
about 32 million acres an area about the size of connecticut 
interior secretary manuel lujan jr told rahalls subcommittee 
wednesday that he supports legislation increasing patent fees from 
the current 250 and 5 an acre

the head of the world bank called friday for 
special relief to mexico from its debt burden of more than 100 
billion 
mexico has indicated a willingness to engage in major 
reforms said barber conable it has substantial prospects it 
also has substantial debt and it has lived up to its obligations 
the international financial community should offer mexico a 
wider than traditional range of options to finance its requirements 
over the next few years conable said 
his first suggestion was that there should be a signficant 
reduction in mexicos debt the largest in the third world after 
brazils current loans to mexico should be exchanged at a discount 
for longterm bonds he said this would be a form of debt 
forgiveness by the commercial banks to which the bulk of mexicos 
debt is owed 
mexico would have less to repay when the bonds came due and 
interest paid in the interval would also be reduced 
the world bank owned by 151 governments is the major source of 
aid to third world countries under a plan proposed by thentreasury 
secretary james a baker iii in 1985 it is in charge of helping 
debtor countries map new policies to put them in a better position 
to carry their debt burden 
conable also suggested 
exit bonds to be taken by creditor banks at a discount from 
the sums now owed them enabling some banks to get out of lending to 
mexico this would also reduce the principal and interest mexico has 
to pay 
a debtequity swap program which would allow banks to use 
the dollars they have lent to mexico to buy shares in mexican 
businesses 
strong support from international bodies like his own bank and 
its sister organization the international monetary fund to support 
mexicos austerity policies though conable did not specify this 
support would presumably include additional loans on more favorable 
terms than those offered by commerical banks 
new tax trade and banking regulations by creditor countries to 
encourage private investment from abroad that will help mexicos 
income to grow 
new money will be needed in mexicos case even after 
significant debt reduction conable added 
he said that his bank and other international bodies cannot 
furnish the needed money alone implying that new loans from 
commercial banks will also be needed

delays in shipping boeings new 747400 jumbo jet

as the new models industry officials say 
its a sellers market and there just arent any planes out 
there right now said bill avery editor of cargo facts an 
industry newsletter published in seattle 
the first 747400 was to have been delivered in december but to

although a number of the planes are close to completion boeing 
hopes to deliver 57 of the planes by the end of the year 
twentytwo customers have ordered 192 of the advanced planes 
which can carry 412 passengers more than 8000 miles 
boeing has cited late deliveries by suppliers complex new 
avionics an inexperienced work force and a decision to win 
simultaneous certification for several versions of the new plane as 
reasons for the delays 
because of the delays airlines are holding on to their older 
planes as a result just eight of the more than 700 older 747s are 
for sale worldwide and most of those are spoken for says avmark a 
virginiabased aircraft appraisal company 
higher demand also has meant higher usedplane prices says 
avmarks paul turk 
boeing 747200s that used to sell for about 275 million now 
are commanding up to 32 million turk said some even have gone 
as high as 38 million 
the 747 went into service in january 1970 and the 
largercapacity 747200 in november 1971 many 747200s sold for 
less than 30 million new 
newer used planes when available sell for much more such as 
40 million for a 747200 model that can be used for passengers and 
cargo and 75 million for a used 747300 a model that went into 
service in february 1983 
the eight planes now on the market arent going to be available 
until next year because their owners klm dutch airlines and 
singapore airlines have had their 747400s delayed by boeing turk

the chairman of the us house banking 
committee called today for the resignation of federal savings and 
loan regulators after hearing a government report that the thrift 
crisis could have been handled more efficiently 
us rep henry b gonzalez chairman of the house banking 
finance and urban affairs committee which is conducting a field 
hearing on thrift problems has been critical of m danny wall the 
chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
gonzalez comments seeking the resignation came after testimony 
by frederick d wolf assistant comptroller geneneral of the general 
accounting office who said that the handling of the savings and 
loan problems could have been handled in a lesscostly manner 
wolf said the deficit for the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp had at least quadrupled between 1987 and 1988 when it began 
takeover of insolvent thrifts 
those deals were terribly expensive and our thinking is that 
there could have been more ways you could have done it less 
costly he said 
we are still in the process of doing the audit and the number 
may be higher than lower wolf said 
gonzalez interrupted wolfs testimony to say that the new figures 
contradict testimony by wall and others before the committee earlier 
this year 
i just feel under these circumstances the congress and 
therefore the public have been disgracefully misinformed the 
persons responsible should step aside at this time gonzalez said 
reiterating his criticism of wall 
federal and state officials are scheduled to testify in the 
twoday hearing looking into the savings and loan crisis wall is 
not among the witnesses scheduled to testify 
so far this year 118 savings and loan institutions have been 
taken over by federal regulators including 36 in texas 
wolf said that he believed the administrations projection to 
spend 100 billion to rectify the thrift crisis was adequate

japan does not fear a tougher trade policy will 
emerge from washington because the united states would be unlikely 
to further restrict trade with japan while it promotes a freetrade 
policy with the rest of the world officials say 
us trade representative carla hills has established a task 
force that is considering managed trade as part of a review of 
how to reduce the united states 52 billion trade deficit with 
japan 
a policy of managed trade could include specific targets for 
increased japanese purchases of us products and reductions in the 
trade imbalance 
but japanese officials do not appear worried that such changes 
will be implemented 
i think mrs hills has reservations about managed trade and her 
basic stance is still toward free trade said shin yasunobe an 
official at the ministry of international trade and industry miti 
the united states would have a difficult time promoting its 
basic commitment to multilateral free trade and at the same time 
moving toward managed trade with japan added yasunobe deputy 
director of the americas and oceanic division at miti 
other ministry officials see recent criticisms of japan by mrs 
hills as politically motivated it is necessary for her to display a 
tough attitude toward japan they say to win approval for the team 
she wants in the new administration 
they concede however that she may turn out to be tough 
miti officials see a trade policy vacuum right now in the us 
government with few us officials concerned with formulating 
economic and trade policy in place they believe mrs hills has 
little support currently for setting new policies 
ministry officials say they dont expect anything concrete to 
emerge in trade policy from the united states until midmay after 
mrs hills deputies are confirmed and have been briefed 
when that happens the two sides can have a meaningful exchange 
of views they say 
we do not support managed trade said yoshio nakamura head 
of usjapan economic relations at keidanren japans powerful 
federation of economic organizations 
but he added japan already has managed trade with the 
united states in automobiles steel and semiconductors japan has 
adhered to voluntary restraint agreements for steel and auto exports 
to the united states for several years it agreed in 1986 to 
encourage foreign semiconductor sales in japan 
while the united states complains that japanese markets are 
closed to its products japanese government officials and business 
leaders believe there is little correlation between market access 
and the trade imbalance 
since 1980 we have in response to us pressure enhanced 
access to japanese markets nakamura said but while japanese 
markets have become more open the trade imbalance has worsened 
it is almost nonsense to measure the openness of the market by 
looking only at the trade imbalance said yasunobe the miti 
official even mrs hills admits the imbalance is the outcome of 
macroeconomic policies and structures 
greater coordination of these policies is needed the officials 
say along with a reduction in the us budget deficit reduced 
consumer demand in the united states and greater stimulation of 
japans domestic economy 
nakamura said what happens in the trade relationship between the 
two countries will likely depend on trade statistics in the coming 
months 
if they worsen the frustration level will be higher in the 
us congress and administration and japan will be in a bad 
position hills may have to take strong action against japan 
nakamura said

a microsoft corp shareholder has filed a federal 
classaction lawsuit alleging the computer software publisher and 
two of its officers violated us securities laws by misleading 
stockholders about the companys financial outlook 
microsoft shareholders were damaged when the price of the stock 
plummeted 137 percent tuesday after microsoft announced it faced 
lowerthanexpected thirdquarter sales and profits according to 
allegations in the suit filed in us district court in seattle by 
bruce adelstein 
the suit says microsoft gave no indication in the weeks before 
the announcement that it was facing any problems it seeks 
undetermined compensatory and punitive damages 
we are reviewing the plaintiffs claims and we believe them to 
be entirely without merit william h neukom microsoft vice 
president of law and corporate affairs said in a news release 
friday microsoft intends to defend the case vigorously the case 
is now before the courts and microsoft will not offer comment 
outside of this statement 
in addition to microsoft the suit names as plaintiffs jon a 
shirley microsoft president and chief operating officer and 
francis j gaudette the companys vice president treasurer and 
chief financial officer microsoft cofounder and chairman bill 
gates is not listed as a defendant 
microsofts stock traded over the counter dropped by 850 a 
share to 5350 tuesday after the company announced it expected 
lower profits and sales for its third quarter ending march 31st it 
would be the first time quarterly profits declined since the company 
went public three years ago 
microsoft blamed the lower forecast on delays in shipping new 
versions of its wordprocessing software microsoft word and 
overstocking by key distributors 
microsoft predicted thirdquarter sales at 180 million to 200 
million down from the 200 million to 215 million expected by many 
market analysts 
the company had sales of 1618 million and profits of 373 
million in the third quarter of last year it said it expected 
profits for the current quarter to be somewhat less than a year 
ago 
adelsteins seattle attorney steven berman said the suit 
alleges that in a quarterly report filed feb 10 with the securities 
and exchange commission and in conferences with investors and 
analysts that month microsoft and its executives gave no indication 
of the inventory problems or that shipments of the new word versions 
would be delayed 
the suit says that as a direct result of the companys belated 
disclosures of the problems tuesday the markets response to 
microsofts announcement was swift and severe 
it alleges the microsoft officers misled stockholders to protect 
their jobs enhance the value of their microsoft stock and holdings 
and cover up their own prior misconduct and mismangement of 
microsoft and avoid being held responsible 
the class named in the suit covers investors who bought microsoft 
stock between jan 19 and march 6 berman said he didnt know how 
many people that covered although 19 million shares of microsoft 
were traded during that period 
adelstein bought 1400 shares of microsoft on feb 10 when the 
stock closed at 63 a share berman said 
he bought on the upswing because he read the news and so forth 
and was pretty unhappy at what happened berman said 
with the 850ashare drop adelsteins stock would have lost 
11900 in value on tuesday in contrast shirley listed in the 
suit as owning 638400 shares faced an onpaper loss of 54 
million while gaudette listed as having 33334 shares saw his 
stock drop by 283339 
gates with over 20 million shares took a paper loss of about 
174 million

a recovery in world wheat production to possibly a 
record 540 million metric tons in the 198990 season was tentatively 
forecast friday by the international wheat council 
the council one of the worlds leading wheat forecasting bodies 
revised its 198889 world wheat crop estimate to 504 million from 
502 million in january 
this compares with 512 million produced in 198788 and the record 
538 million in 198687 
the estimate for the season running from june 1989 to july 1990 
is based on an expected increase in planting and good growing 
conditions the council said 
it must be stressed that the final outcome will depend on the 
weather and crop developments over the next few months the 
council said noting that sowing in some parts of the world has not 
yet begun 
production forecasts for 198990 include the soviet union 900 
million tons 845 million estimated for 198889 china 890 
million 870 million the european economic community 862 million 
861 million the united states 650 million 493 million india 
490 million 445 million canada 260 million 155 million 
turkey 190 million 185 million australia 140 million 143 
million argentina 82 million 80 million and brazil 50 million 
59 million 
for the 198889 season output of coarse grains principally 
corn is now estimated at 725 million tons this season 800 million 
tons in 198788 
world wheat trade in 198889 is estimated to fall to 98 million 
tons from a record 106 million in 198788 because of lower soviet 
and indian imports 
soviet wheat imports are put at 140 million 220 million last 
season and indian imports at 21 million 30 million 
the council expects china to overtake the soviet union as the 
worlds biggest wheat importer in 198889 buying a record 166 
million tons compared with 153 million in 198788 
world coarse grain trade in 198889 is put at 970 million tons 
against 860 million last season 
soviet imports of coarse grains in 198889 are estimated at 210 
million tons 90 million in 198788

top american trade negotiators met 
friday with officials of the european economic community for a 
series of talks focusing on the troublesome issue of farm subsidies 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and trade representative 
carla hills met for about two hours with the common markets top 
foreign affairs official frans andriessen and its agriculture 
chief ray macsharry 
nico wegter spokesman for the 12nation trading bloc said the 
discussions were held in a constructive atmosphere but provided 
no details 
the officials were having dinner together friday night and 
continuing their talks saturday morning yeutter and mrs hills were 
scheduled to leave brussels later saturday 
the officials are trying to find ways to ease a conflict between 
the united states and the community over government subsidies to 
farmers before the resumption of international trade talks april 5 
in geneva the dispute has stalled the uruguay round negotiations 
held under the auspices of the 96nation general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
the united states wants the common market to end import barriers 
and export and domestic farm subsidies that it says distort trade 
it initially demanded the subsidies be eliminated by the year 2000 
an american proposal offered last month to the europeans seeks to 
gradually lower farm subsidies a us statement said the plan 
does not use language strongly opposed by the community that 
specifically calls for elimination of tradedistorting subsidies by 
a certain date 
the community has refused to agree on a date for withdrawing all 
supports and wants the united states to include shortterm reform 
measures in the debate 
the common market provides hefty subsidies to its 18 million 
farmers through guaranteed prices for many of their crops it also 
gives exporters help so costlier european farm products can compete 
with lower world prices 
the united states complains the export subsidies have helped the 
community increase its share of the world market it has responded 
by setting up its own export enhancement program 
a year ago european leaders began the politically sensitive task 
of curbing farm payments they agreed to limit the maximum annual 
amount of expenditure on price guarantees over five years us 
officials say the measures were not enough to fix a fundamentally 
flawed policy 
europeans argue they cannot leave the bulk of their farmers to 
compete without help in the world market their farms they say are 
on average smaller than in the united states and need extra aid 
the four officials held a round of getacquainted talks in 
feburary in washington during which they agreed to set up a task 
force to try to resolve a dispute over a european ban on imports of 
hormonetreated meat from the united states the task force has 
until early may to complete its findings 
the common market imposed on jan 1 a ban on imports of meat from 
cattle treated with growth hormones the united states refused to 
comply and instead slapped stiff duties on a variety of european 
products 
the europeans have threatened to impose their own retaliatory 
measures tough tariffs on american walnuts and dried fruit if 
the conflict isnt resolved 
the hormone ban was imposed because of european concerns the 
stimulants pose a health risk to consumers a claim the united 
states disputes 
the ban is expected to block imports of about 100 million worth 
of beef and beef byproducts from the united states the trading 
partners totaled about 165 billion worth of trade in 1988

standard amp poors corp announced friday it has 
lowered its rating on 5 billion of rjr nabisco inc debt because of 
the 2453 billion leveraged buyout of the food and tobacco company 
by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
standard amp poors a credit rating service said it was lowering 
rjr nabiscos a rating to bb 
preferred stock and convertible debentures to be issued in 
connection with the buyout are expected to receive a b plus rating 
standard amp poors said 
standard amp poors announced it was reassessing rjr nabiscos debt 
rating last fall after the companys managers said they were 
considering a leveraged buyout of the firm management lost a 
bidding war to kohlberg kravis which is in the process of carrying 
out its own lbo 
a leveraged buyout which is accomplished with largely borrowed 
funds sharply increases the debt load of a company and can raise 
questions about its ability to repay its loans 
an a rating the thirdhighest in the standard amp poors rankings 
is given to debt that has a strong capacity to pay interest and 
repay principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the 
adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions 
than debt in higher rated categories 
the highest standard amp poor rating is aaa 
a rating of bb is fifth on the standard amp poors list and is the 
highest of five grades assigned to debt on which there is 
speculation about the issuers ability to pay interest and repay 
principal it is followed by b 
while such debt will likely have some quality and protective 
characteristics these are outweighed by large uncertainties or 
major risk exposures to adverse conditions standard amp poors said

unemployment dropped to a 15year low of 51 
percent in february as employers created 289000 jobs the 
government said friday in a report cited as evidence of surprising 
sustained vigor in the economy 
wall street seemed to regard the growth as too vigorous as stock 
prices fell on the labor departments announcement analysts cited 
concerns the federal reserve board may raise interest rates to cool 
down the economy as employers bid up wage rates in an 
evertightening labor market 
a record 629 percent of the workingage population was at work 
last month matching the high set in january the department said in 
data calculated from its monthly household survey 
the jobless rate stuck at 53 percent or 54 percent for five 
months fell 03 percentage point in february to 51 percent its 
lowest since may 1974 the last time the rate was lower was in 
december 1973 when it hit 49 percent 
the gain of 289000 nonfarm jobs in february reflected improved 
conditions in serviceproducing industries such as health care and 
retail trade according to a separate survey of business payrolls 
februarys job gains although strong were off from januarys 
huge increase of 415000 jobs last months harsh weather cut 22000 
jobs from construction employment manufacturing jobs were down 
8000 after rising steadily since september 
those decreases were more than made up for by a gain of 321000 
jobs in the service sector of the economy including gains in health 
and business services and in retail trade 
many analysts had been expecting unemployment to be stagnant or 
little changed last month developments wall street would have taken 
as a sign the economic expansion was slowing down 
wall street is concerned because the economy has shown few signs 
of flagging despite a yearlong campaign by the federal reserve to 
dampen growth and restrain inflation by pushing up interest rates 
after fridays report some analysts expect further credit 
tightening 
any way you look at it this is more strength than the feds 
going to tolerate and that means interest rates will be heading 
up said economist david wyss of data resources inc in lexington 
mass 
daniel t van dyke senior economist at bank of america in san 
francisco commented were adding jobs much faster than the labor 
force is growing the report portends more monetary tightening 
just last month alan greenspan the chairman of the federal 
reserve said he had found recent price gains disturbing and 
laid part of the blame on an acceleration in wage increases 
februarys report however showed that seasonally adjusted 
average hourly earnings were up just 01 percent while average 
weekly earnings declined 02 percent both categories had posted 
strong gains during january 
economist michael evans head of a washington consulting firm 
saw some underlying signs of economic weakness in the report 
including the drop in manufacturing employment a shortening of the 
average work week and steady overtime hours at factories 
i read this report as saying the economy is slowing down even 
though the socalled headline figures give the veneer of strength 
evans said 
that interpretation was disputed by jerry jasinowski chief 
economist of the national association of manufacturers who said 
manufacturing was strong except for autos 
virtually all of manufacturing continues to report good orders 
and pretty strong production he said all i get is reports 
about how strong orders and the economy are overall 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater called the drop in the 
unemployment rate good news 
jobs are still the best barometer of a sound economy he 
said while the numbers are volatile on a monthly basis the 
economy can continue to create jobs and inflation remain in check 
overall the civilian labor force contracted by 247000 people 
last month to 1232 million while 142000 workers found jobs 
the commissioner of the labor statistics janet l norwood told 
congress that most of last months jobless decrease was among young 
adults and hispanics groups whose jobless rates tend to be erratic 
the jobless rate among whites was 43 percent down from 46 
percent in january while for blacks it was 119 percent down from 
12 percent 
the jobless rate for hispanics plunged to 68 percent from 84 
percent in january 
the rate for teenagers dropped by 16 percentage points to 148 
percent while the unemployment rate for young adults aged 20 to 24 
fell 12 points to 81 percent

government said 
selling accelerated shortly thereafter on reports of a volcano 
eruption in guatemala lespinasse said a private meteorologist had 
said last week that a volcano eruption would reduce the likelihood 
of a us drought this summer because an increased number of 
particles in the air could encourage rainfall

destroying coffee plantations in the path of the molten rock 
seismologists said they said the eruption was not dangerous

a bill designed to reinforce the powers of the

coming in the wake of a series of stock market insider trading 
scandals and controversial takeover battles the proposed reform 
would allow the commission des operations bourse to initiate legal 
action in french courts and hand out fines 
the commission currently has no enforcement powers of its own 
the bill was approved at the weekly meeting of government 
ministers on wednesday 
the measure would make takeover operations in france more 
transparent thereby protecting the interests of small shareholders 
an official government spokesman said the reform would make 
sure that the stock exchange did not become a jungle where the small 
investor is at the mercy of the big operators 
in a nationwide television interview last month president 
francois mitterrand called for the moralization of french 
financial markets and condemned stock market speculators 
the proposed legislation would give commission investigators 
wider authority to examine suspected market irregularities and make 
it more difficult to launch takeover and partial bids in france 
however it falls short of calls from political and financial 
circles for the commission to be given the broad powers enjoyed by 
the us securities and exchange commission 
under the proposed legislation commission investigators would be 
able to carry out searches for incriminating material but only 
under the supervision of a judge and in the company of police 
officers 
the commission also would be empowered to block company bank 
accounts confiscate assets and temporarily suspend company activies 
the finance ministry said the reform would require an investor or 
a group of investors acting together to make a full bid for a 
company once it controlled more than onethird of the shares or 
voting rights of that company 
the change would prevent investors from building up excessively 
large stakes in companies without making a bid for full control 
the executive council of the commission also would be increased 
from five to eight members four of whom will be chosed by top state 
institututions two members would be selected by stock market and 
futures market authorities the last member would be a stock market 
professional the commission president would be named by the cabinet 
for a sixyear nonrenewable term 
in recent months france has been rocked by a series of insider 
trading scandals and takeover battles that have forced the 
resignation of a top finance ministery official and implicated a 
close associate of mitterrand 
the need for the reforms were recently highlighted by the 
pechiney sa insider trading scandal in november the us sec 
uncovered evidence of insider trading by french investors who 
profited from the acquisition by the french nationalized aluminum 
group of american national can and the other packaging properties of 
usbased triangle industries inc 
after judicial investigation five of these french investors were 
chargd with insider trading offenses including rogerpatrice pelat 
70 a close friend of the mitterrands 
pelat died of a heart attack tuesday at the american hospital of 
paris

japan has never agreed to bring the share of us 
semiconductors sold in the japanese market up to 20 percent by 1991 
the minister of japans powerful miti said friday in the first 
cabinetlevel statement on the issue 
hiroshi mitsuzuka head of the ministry of international trade 
and industry also denied that japanese companies were involved in 
the construction of a chemical weapons plant in libya 
on the semiconductor issue the minister was responding to a 
recent statement by us trade representative carla hills that japan 
secretly agreed to increase the share of us chips to 20 percent 
when it signed a bilateral semiconductor accord in 1986 
while issuing the first official denial by a cabinet minister 
mitsuzuka added however that there is no change in the japanese 
government intention of making efforts to increase the share of us 
semiconductors in japan 
saying the japanese chip market is open he told reporters that 
it is possible to bring the share of us chips up to the us 
target if the two countries cooperate 
mitsuzukas denial of the involvement of japanese companies in 
the construction of the libyan chemical weapons plant came one day 
after mitsubishi heavy industries ltd said in a statement issued 
under the name of its president yotaro iida that it played no part 
in the libyan project 
in a senate foreign relations committee hearing earlier this 
month us intelligence sources were reported to have said 
mitsubishi helped ship machinery which was part of the equipment to 
manufacture chemical weapons such other japanese companies as 
toshiba corp mitsubishi corp and japan steel works ltd were also 
allegedly involved 
mitsuzuka said miti itself has investigated the allegations but 
found that there is no truth to them there is no problem right 
now he said 
there is speculation in japan that the charges might be designed 
to pressure the us administration to put a stop to a general 
dynamics corp move to provide mitsubishi heavy industries with the 
technology needed to build a jetfighter modeled after a us plane

top officials of gannett co inc and time inc 
discussed the possibility of a merger in 1985 but disagreed on 
whether the company should be run with cochief executives gannett 
chairman allen neuharth said friday 
neuharth made his remarks in a column published in gannetts usa 
today newspaper commenting on times agreement to merge with warner 
communications inc the deal calls for cochief executives to run 
the company initially 
the gannett chairman wrote that he and j richard munro times 
chief executive were of one mind on the merits of a merger of 
gannett and time 
but we had two very diverse views about creating a twoheaded 
monster neuharth wrote 
he said after he and munro had several discusssions munro sent 
sol linowitz a former time director to try to sell me on the 
coceo idea 
i didnt buy it because i knew it wouldnt work id had 
experience before in 5050 partnerships large and small nothing 
happens neuharth said 
neuharth said munro also had preached that philosophy about 
coceos to thomas wyman who was chief executive of cbs inc in 
1985 he did not say what wymans reaction was wyman was forced out 
by the cbs board in november 1986 
in their merger agreement time and warner said the new company 
to be called time warner inc initially would be headed by cochief 
executives munro from time and steven j ross from warner 
but the longerterm plan is for nj nicholas times president 
to succeed munro as cochief executive in two years and eventually 
become sole chief executive 
time spokesman louis slovinsky said friday his company had no 
comment on neuharths assertions and that munro was unavailable a 
call was placed to a spokesman for cbs but it was not immediately 
returned 
a gannett spokeswoman said she had nothing to add and that 
neuharth was unavailable 
there were published reports in the summer of 1985 that gannett 
had made advances to both cbs and time although a gannett spokesman 
at the time refused to confirm or deny them 
time a leading book and magazine publisher with interests in 
cable programming and cable tv systems announced last saturday that 
it had agreed to a merger with warner the film and record giant 
time warner would have an estimated 10 billion in revenue 
making it the worlds largest communications concern

in early 1986 easterns former ceo frank borman said the company 
had to be fixed sold or tanked with the iam at that time in 
1986 refusing to join all other employees in the effort to fix the 
company by agreeing like all other employees did to 20 percent pay 
cuts at that time eastern only narrowly avoided extinction by texas 
airs purchase of it 
later that year i joined eastern and we put forward a sixpoint 
plan to fix eastern if you will to turn it around and only one 
of those points involved changes in labor costs 
the other points involved making eastern an ontime airline for 
the first time in its history for expanding its consumer 
reservations reach into travel agencies and we were clearly 
successful in both of those objectives 
but the labor problem obviously took front stage and one of the 
reasons for that is a federal agency called the national mediation 
board that literally threw all pretense of neutrality to the wind 
kept eastern locked up in a fruitless destructive mediation process 
for 17 months while our losses grew alarmingly 
meanwhile some of our critics some of the union leaders engaged 
in what can only be described as a vicious vicious attack on the 
company and its management an organized litigation and 
disinformation campaign to smear the reputation of texas air of 
eastern and its management particularly frank lorenzo and to 
thwart our very efforts to provide working capital for the company 
through some liquidity programs 
you know if you step back the last several weeks have really 
seen the real issues at eastern airlines in my view unfortunately 
pushed to the background of the public debate instead some have 
framed the issues in large global terms almost defying rational 
boundaries 
they have tried to paint frank lorenzo who happens to be by 
the way the longest sitting ceo in the airline business today with 
16 continuous years in that role as some kind of corporate 
villain ignoring the fact that his efforts over the last 26 years 
in this business have created more aviation jobs than any other 
individual 
texas international in the early 1970s had 2500 employees and 
up until last week 60000 employees were under the texas air 
umbrella for those many years of building not destroying 
there has not been an honest debate of the issues that face 
eastern airlines for example the companys offer to the iam to 
guarantee all jobs for five years all jobs for five years to pay 
unskilled workers in a retraining program full pay while they get 
retrained to learn how to be technicians and mechanics so they could 
earn twice what theyre earning under the training program that 
hasnt been debated 
while trying to make this appear to be some kind of a national 
labor struggle between good and evil no one is even seriously 
debating the fact that the pilots union leadership decision to 
cripple the company defies rationality 
consider that their members average nearly 100000 a year in 
wages and benefits and the company proposed no reductions in base 
pay we proposed job guarantees for five years guarantees that 
there would be no sale of additional aircraft at eastern airlines 
that there would be protection on their pay in the event the company 
was not successful and had to seek reorganization under the 
bankruptcy laws 
this proposal from a company that in the last 10 years has lost 
one billion five hundred million dollars and that last year lost 
460 million 
the pilot union decision to ground easterns planes has been 
described i think accurately as professional suicide it almost 
defies explanation even in the context of a hard fought labor 
battle 
alpas leaders and financial adviser however have said publicly 
for some time that they are prepared for bankruptcy and in fact 
welcome actually welcome a bankruptcy process so that they could 
achieve their stated goal of seeking control of the airline 
the pilots union action has forced the bankruptcy filing they 
say they are prepared for but however prepared the financial 
adviser and the coterie of lawyers may be and the pilot union 
leaders whose salaries will continue how ever prepared they are for 
bankruptcy i wonder i wonder how prepared the eastern pilots and 
their families are for that process how prepared can those whose 
livelihood and standards of living and family security depend on 
flying easterns 200 plus airplanes most of which sit idle today 
how prepared can they be 
when the giddiness and emotional solidarity wears off and the 
picket line is no longer the selfdeluded battle between good and 
evil how will the real issues be resolved 
as a management not only with a personal stake in the outcome 
and im not ashamed to say a strong emotional attachment to this 
company but also with clear fiduciary obligations to the 
constituencies of the corporation including our investors including 
our creditors we tried mightily to keep eastern from bankruptcy 
but we also feel very strongly that we will be able to protect those 
interests of the creditors and those interests of investors and 
shareholders in the process that we have been driven to 
we expect and intend that all creditors will be fully safe that 
investors will realize a value and a fair return and that a 
restructured and revitalized although somewhat smaller eastern 
airlines will be flying and will be serving the traveling public for 
many years to come and most importantly to me at least is 
providing many more jobs to the eastern professional men and women 
who have had the cloud of failure hanging over their heads for many 
years and who have brought the airline in recent months to the 
number one position in ontime performance and i think theyll be 
able to do it again

the stock market pulled back today faced with 
news of continuing strong growth in employment 
the labor department reported that the civilian unemployment rate 
fell to 51 percent a 15year low in february from 54 percent the 
month before 
the report also showed an increase of 289000 in nonfarm payroll 
employment topping most advance estimates 
wall street had been anxiously awaiting the report all week 
hoping for new evidence that economic growth was slowing taking 
upward pressure off inflation and interest rates 
so the figures were poorly received in both the bond and stock 
markets prices of longterm government bonds which move in the 
opposite direction from interest rates fell more than 5 for each 
1000 in face value

warwick ri job counselor robert macdonald 
knew about eastern airlines labor problems when he booked a flight 
to dothan ala on the carrier two months ago but he couldnt 
resist the low ticket price 
now hes paying for it several hundred dollars to be precise 
when eastern filed for federal bankruptcy law protection this 
past week in the midst of a crippling strike macdonald had to find 
a lastminute costlier flight on another airline 
hes one of the luckier ones 
many more eastern ticketholders have been grounded forced to 
cancel travel plans because a number of other booked carriers arent 
honoring their tickets and they cant afford to make other 
arrangements travel agents said friday 
worse a few others that flew one way before the eastern strike 
began a week ago have been stranded the agents said some booked on 
package deals linked with eastern have faced other problems they 
said 
one man who surprised his wife for their anniversary by whisking 
her away for a fiveday stay in florida found a key west hotel 
wouldnt honor the room voucher that came as part of the eastern 
package said maija groden manager of church travel in warwick ri 
fortunately he was able to stay at the condo of a friend 
there groden said 
in miami eastern ticketholder mary jennings complained to a 
local television station we dont know if were going to be 
lifetime floridians or if we get to go back home 
jennings had a cruise deal that included roundtrip tickets on 
eastern to the busy port of miami 
eastern has told us that our tickets are nonrefundable on our 
cruise line we learned later that continental airlines would honor 
them but they cant even guarantee that jennings said 
its all very confusing right now said marsha thompson a 
travel agent with dms travel in new york nobodys quite sure what 
to do 
she said her company like other travel firms had been steering 
clients away from eastern when its labor problems intensified 
several weeks ago but a few that already booked eastern flights are 
now forced to change their plans 
thompson said one woman who had planned to fly on eastern as 
part of a 2000 eightday florida cruise package will have to pay 
about 500 more for roundtrip tickets on another airline or scrap 
her plans 
it was a disneybeachcruise deal her daughter will be real 
disappointed if they dont go thompson said 
many cruise lines however have arranged for flights on other 
airlines for passengers booked on package deals linked to eastern at 
no extra cost said tim gallagher a spokesman for carnival cruise 
lines in miami 
it hasnt been easy but were getting them all protected he 
said 
miamibased eastern the nations seventhlargest airline with 
1000 flights a day before the strike said 200 million worth of 
tickets were in the hands of passengers and other airlines when it 
filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy act on thursday 
in the eyes of the bankruptcy court ticketholders are unsecured 
creditors trailing secured creditors in priority that means it may 
be some time before they can get refunds if ever 
those who paid for tickets on a major credit card however may 
have an easier time since a federal law protects consumers who make 
creditcard purchases but fail to receive goods or services 
eastern has promised to get as many planes airborne as possible 
as it reorganizes under bankruptcy protection and make good on old 
tickets 
nonetheless travel agents said theyre not optimistic 
we havent been selling eastern wholeheartedly in the last 
eight months i dont know if we will ever again said jack 
bloch owner of jbs world travel in new york 
others say it may take some time for strikeburdened passengers 
to forgive and forget 
among those are macdonald owner of an employeeassistance 
company in rhode island who in january bought a restricted 28050 
eastern roundtrip ticket to dothan ala as a gift for his 
daughter nancy he had to shell out 32050 more for tickets on 
another airline after the strike 
i now have another set of tickets lost in limbo macdonald 
said although he admits he was partly to blame i bought these 
tickets even though they were talking about a strike because they 
were the cheapest around

soybean futures prices were whipsawed friday amid reports of a 
nuclear mishap in west germany then plunged to a sharply lower 
close as news of a volcanic eruption in guatemala eased fears of 
another droughtridden us growing season 
ooh boy it was wild said victor lespinasse a trader with 
dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
grain futures finished mixed on the chicago board of trade on 
other markets silver futures gained while gold retreated livestock 
and meat futures advanced and energy futures were mixed 
soybean futures settled 5 cents to 11 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 757 a bushel wheat was cent 
to 3 cents higher with march at 436 a bushel corn was cent to 
2 cents lower with march at 275 a bushel oats were cent lower 
to cent higher with march at 207 a bushel 
soybeans rallied at midday following wireservice reports of a 
nuclear reactor breakdown near frankfurt west germany 
traders recalling the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident 
frantically bought futures contracts on fears of european crop 
contamination at one point in the session the most active soybean 
contract for may delivery was up more than 12 cents from 
thursdays close 
but buyers turned sellers on followup reports that no radiation 
had leaked from the reactor two out of four emergency cooling 
systems at the biblis nuclear power plant problems temporarily broke 
down the hesse state government said 
selling accelerated shortly thereafter on news of a volcano 
eruption in guatemala the pacayo volcano which last erupted in 
june 1987 was reported to be spewing lava ash and sand forcing 
the evacuation of 255 people 
analysts said the markets reaction was partly based on a finding 
published four years ago by paul handler a university of illinois 
physics professor that volcanic eruptions near the equator 
typically are followed by good growing weather in the united states 
handler had spoken on the subject last week at a cropweather 
symposium in chicago he said in a telephone conversation friday 
that it was too soon to tell whether the eruption in guatemala might 
have some impact on this summers weather 
handler said volcanic eruptions can send certain gases into the 
stratosphere where they oxidize into sulfuric acid and water then 
condense into a sunlightreflecting fog that can stay there for a 
year or longer 
one hundred and twenty years of data show that when you have a 
lowlatitude volcanic eruption you have good growing weather in the 
us corn belt handler said 
silver futures built strongly on thursdays gains on the new 
yorks commodity exchange pushing the price for spot delivery well 
above the psychologically important 6atroyounce level breached 
in the previous session 
analysts said fridays national unemployment report showing a 
03 percentage point drop in unemployment last month ignited new 
inflation fears and brought more dollars into the silver market as a 
hedge against rising prices 
but gold futures retreated displaying once again the reluctance 
to rally that is turning some investors against gold as an inflation 
hedge 
gold settled 20 cents to 90 cents lower with april at 39650 a 
troy ounce silver was 6 cents to 74 cents higher with may at 615 
an ounce and the spot march contract at 6068 an ounce 
strong cash markets boosted live cattle futures on the chicago 
mercantile exchange which spurred buying in the adjacent pits 
live cattle settled 30 cent to 1 cent higher with april at 7805 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 03 cent lower to 38 cent higher 
with march at 8125 cents a pound live hogs were 07 cent lower to 
40 cent higher with april at 4365 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 08 cent lower to 60 cent higher with march at 3845 
cents a pound

higher interest rates in a bid to slow the economy and reduce 
inflationary pressures bond prices deteriorate when interest rates 
go up but bond values are also eroded by inflation

striking eastern airlines machinists said friday 
they would file their own plan to rescue the carrier from bankruptcy 
and they denounced management for threatening to split the union by 
replacing unskilled members 
bolstered by crucial support on the picket lines theyve received 
from easterns pilots the machinists said theyll continue striking 
together in the face of what they call the companys 
divideandconquer strategy 
we went out on strike together well go back together roy 
anderson a machinists general chairman in miami said friday the 
idea of a union is everyones together 
he insisted that easterns petition for protection from creditors 
under the bankruptcy laws filed thursday in a new york court 
hasnt daunted the machinists spirit 
there is no incentive for people to go back anderson said 
the machinist strategists said they plan to fight in bankruptcy 
court any company attempts to split the union 
they said theyll also seek an emergency court order against 
sales of eastern assets notably the plan to sell its profitable 
northeast shuttle service to developer donald trump 
in addition they said theyll try to bring easterns parent 
texas air corp and sister carrier continental airlines into the 
bankruptcy proceedings and to change the court location of the 
proceedings from new york to miami 
the machinists plan to present an alternative reorganization plan 
to the court that calls for the sale of eastern intact to an outside 
party according to sources close to the union 
the union is seeking such a sale so weve got a live asset to 
move said a source who requested anonymity 
financier carl icahn chairman of eastern rival trans world 
airlines publicly expressed interest several months ago in 
acquiring eastern icahn reportedly has been asked in recent days by 
eastern union representatives to consider a buyout 
the chapter 11 filing would still allow a takeover but would 
force approval by the bankruptcy court as well as by eastern unions 
and creditors 
when eastern officials announced the filing thursday they 
addressed the two factions within the machinists union separately 
the 8500 members of the international association of machinists at 
eastern are divided into two categories aircraft mechanics and ramp 
service workers 
the mechanics the more skilled of the two groups earn a top 
wage of 1883 an hour at eastern the less skilled ramp workers 
who fuel planes handle baggage and drive motorized equipment on 
airport runways make top pay of 1560 an hour 
if easterns pilots could be induced to return to work much of 
the ground work will be contracted out eastern president phil 
bakes told a news conference if our mechanics come back to work 
they will get paid 
the machinists chose to leave their jobs the majority of the 
machinists union are not mechanics the majority are cleaners 
baggage handlers stock clerks janitors 
eastern has arranged for those types of work to be done with 
outside vendors some that are serving other airlines bakes said 
bakes apparently was holding out a carrot to the skilled 
mechanics which eastern needs almost as much as the pilots and a 
stick to the ramp workers who could be replaced relatively easily 
that approach might not get a warm reception from the bankruptcy 
judge a legal expert suggested 
what a judge would be looking to do is to bring the parties 
together said william ury associate director of the program on 
negotiation at harvard law school 
the machinists could be successful in court in blocking efforts 
to split the union he said

news of continuing strong growth in employment 
sent stock prices lower in relatively quiet trading friday 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 929 to 228214 
reducing its gain for the week to 785 points 
declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
612 up 838 down and 507 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 14683 million 
shares against 14336 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trades in those 
stocks on regional exchanges and in the overthecounter market 
totaled 17408 million shares 
the labor department reported that the civilian unemployment rate 
fell to 51 percent a 15year low in february from 54 percent the 
month before 
the report also showed an increase of 289000 in nonfarm payroll 
employment topping most advance estimates 
wall street had been anxiously awaiting the report all week 
hoping for new evidence that economic growth was slowing taking 
upward pressure off inflation and interest rates 
so the figures were poorly received in both the bond and stock 
markets prices of longterm government bonds which move in the 
opposite direction from interest rates fell more than 5 for each 
1000 in face value 
however most of the selling hit the stock market early in the 
day when the dow jones industrials loss approached 20 points 
brokers said the markets partial recovery in late trading was 
encouraged by a feeling that the latest data might not prompt any 
immediate further credittightening moves from the federal reserve

too soon to gauge the effect of new prescription procedures in new

raising taxes to solve the savings and loan 
crisis could save taxpayers 138 billion over the next 30 years a 
congressman critical of federal regulators handling of the crisis 
said friday 
congress and americans were misinformed about the costs of saving 
the troubled thrift industry said us rep henry b gonzalez who 
also suggested top thrift regulators step aside after he heard that 
the deficit of the federal savings and loan insurance corp had 
quadrupled from 14 billion in 1987 to at least 56 billion in 1988 
gonzalez a democrat from san antonio who is chairman of the 
house banking finance and urban affairs committee is conducting a 
twoday field hearing on the sampl crisis 
gonzalez was highly critical of m danny wall chairman of the 
home loan bank board which administers the fslic 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the federal home loan bank board 
said the agencys figure for the 1988 fslic deficit is closer to 45 
billion and complained that the general accounting office arrived 
at their number without the benefit of having talked to us 
hoyle said wall has testified before the house banking committee 
that the size of the sampl problem was 75 billion to 80 billion he 
said that could not be directly compared with the fslic deficit 
clearly mr gonzalez is mixing up apples and oranges hoyle 
said 
frederick wolf assistant comptroller general of the general 
accounting office fueled the criticism of wall after telling the 
committee the southwest plan to bail out insolvent thrifts was too 
costly 
the deals were terribly expensive and we think there could have 
been more ways you could have done it less costly wolf told the 
committee 
we are still in the process of doing the audit so the numbers 
may be higher than lower he said about the fslic deficit 
wolf said solving the crisis would cost at least 140 billion 
60 billion for the deals already made 50 billion for the current 
insolvents and another 30 billion for the future insolvencies 
he also said the cost would not have been as great if the 
government had taken steps to solve the problem three years ago 
even using accounting numbers we believe you could have known 
that the problem was bigger than what wall was saying weve had 
other hearings where weve both been there and weve disagreed about 
the numbers wolf told reporters after his testimony 
gonzalez meanwhile suggested that raising taxes instead of 
borrowing could save taxpayers money even if it meant not 
complying with the grammrudmann budget balancing law 
i dont see why we should pay 138 billion just to make gramm 
look good he said 
gonzalez said wall as late as january had not told the committee 
about the fslics deficit 
these statistics refute the testimony weve had gonzalez 
said i just feel under these circumstances the congress and the 
american public was so disgracefully misinformed 
the persons responsible should step aside at this time he 
said while criticizing wall 
there is something wrong somewhere how can we allow a 
quasiindependent agency to in effect authorize and appropriate 
without going through those regular procedures that even the 
president cant do the president wouldnt be able on his own do 
what danny wall did last december gonzalez said 
wolf meanwhile said that he would not be surprised if half the 
tax dollars spent on solving the sampl crisis were spent in texas 
so far this year 118 savings and loan institutions have been 
taken over by federal regulators including 36 in texas

a christian organization called friday for a 
boycott of pepsi because the soft drink maker refused to cancel its 
contract with the singer madonna who also is starring in a steamy 
music video set in a church 
the american family association based in tupelo miss said it 
was asking people not to drink pepsi for a year because pepsi 
rejected its request to cancel a contract with madonna for her 
appearance in a pepsi commercial 
it is indeed unfortunate that pepsi would give madonna millions 
of dollars for the right to promote her as a role model for our 
youth said donmald e wildmon executive director of the 
association 
the group publishes a monthly christian magazine that claims a 
circulation of 380000 pepsi has not said how much it is paying the 
singer although published reports have estimated it at between 2 
million and 5 million 
asked if the boycott was simply an attempt at censorship wildmon 
said pepsi doesnt have to withdraw the commercial just dont 
ask me to pay my money to help pay for madonnas contract 
at pepsicola co headquarters in somers ny spokeswoman becky 
madeira said it is regrettable that he is taking this action 
because it is difficult to definitively make a value judgment 
she said pepsi officials had talked to wildmon and hoped to set 
up a meeting at which it could discuss his concerns at greater 
length 
the company has previously said its commercial with madonna was 
entirely separate from the singers music video both the commercial 
and the video feature her new song like a prayer 
pepsi bought time on the toprated shows in 40 countries on march 
2 to launch its new twominute commercial called make a wish 
which featured the first public broadcast of like a prayer 
the commercial showed madonna watching a home film of her eighth 
birthday and then trading places with the young girl who played her 
as a child 
on march 3 madonnas music video debuted on the mtv cable 
network 
it tells a story of a woman who goes to the rescue of a man 
wrongly accused of attacking another woman the video shows madonna 
seeking refuge in a church dancing among burning crosses kissing a 
statue that come to life freeing an accused man and then kissing 
him 
wildmon said his group interpreted the character madonna plays in 
the video to be symbolic of jesus christ while the man she rescues 
symbolizes a priest 
but the videos symbolism of christ having sex with a priest 
suggesting the priests indeed all christians are sexually 
repressed is blatantly offensive that is absolutely repugnant to 
christians he said 
pepsi pulled its madonna ad from mtv after the cable network 
began running the video although a source close to pepsi said it 
was so the commercial would not compete with the video rather 
because of than reservations about the video 
pepsi officials said they still plan to sponsor a worldwide 
concert tour by madonna and to run shorter versions of the 
twominute pepsi ad with the singer on broadcast television

drexel burnham lambert inc has agreed to ban 
financier michael milken from ever working at the firm and forbid 
other workers from talking business with him even if hes acquitted 
of expected criminal charges sources said friday 
sources familiar with the firms pleabargain settlement talks 
who spoke on condition they not be identified said the same 
restrictions apply to milkens brother lowell a senior drexel aide 
who is expected to be indicted as well 
securities and exchange commission negotiatiors imposed the 
restrictions in talks with drexel aimed at resolving wideranging 
civil fraud charges against the firm the sources said 
terms of the settlement represent much tighter restrictions on 
drexel and the milken brothers than earlier disclosed in its 
bargaining to end an intense federal fraud investigation that has 
dogged the firm for more than two years a draft of the settlement 
which sec commissioners are expected to vote on next week also 
compels drexel to submit to the oversight of two panels that will 
scrutinize its finances and interrogate employees about possible 
wrongdoing the sources said 
further the sources said the sec will require the firm to put 
on leave any drexel employee named in future enforcement actions by 
the watchdog agency 
in exchange the sec has dropped an earlier insistence that 
drexel relocate its lucrative highyield bond division from beverly 
hills calif to the firms new york headquarters the sources 
said drexel had argued that such a move would devastate its 
business in the 175 billion highyield bond market 
a drexelsec settlement is a crucial precondition for finalizing 
a criminal plea bargain with the justice department which the firm 
agreed to in december to avoid a crippling racketeering and fraud 
indictment 
in negotiations with federal prosecutors drexel previously had 
agreed to fire the milkens and withhold most of their 1988 
compensation lawyers for the brothers have challenged that 
agreement in court 
the sec agreement takes it a step further said one source 
it implicitly says you cant hire the guy after you fire him and 
it says you cant talk to the guy 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said in a statement both sides 
to the settlement discussions have worked diligently and 
conscientiously for months now toward an agreement and we are not 
going to comment on it when the details are final they will be made 
public and then the facts will be available 
chiles larson a spokesman for the sec in washington declined to 
comment in accordance with agency policy on pending cases 
officials at robinson lake lerer amp montgomery a public relations 
firm hired by michael milken to speak on his behalf declined to 
comment eugene licker an attorney for lowell milken also declined 
to comment 
michael milken is considered one of the most dynamic financiers 
of the decade and is largely credited with vaulting drexel to the 
forefront of the lucrative market in highyield debt securities 
known as junk bonds he created drexels beverly hillsbased bond 
trading division about 10 years ago 
he also has been a leading target of a federal campaign against 
trading abuses spawned by a wall street corruption scandal that led 
to the exposure of frauds by ivan f boesky a wellknown speculator 
now in prison 
boesky has been the main source of evidence against drexel and 
the milken brothers accusing them of crimes that range from insider 
trading to stock manipulation to cheating drexel clients 
drexel asserted innocence until dec 21 when it capitulated to 
federal pressure and agreed to a plea bargain in order to avoid 
potentially devastating racketeering charges which carry enormous 
fines and penalties 
the milkens have denied all wrongdoing and have yet to be charged 
with any crime but they are widely expected to be indicted soon on 
federal fraud and racketeering charges 
drexels chief executive frederick joseph admitted in court 
papers filed earlier this week that the firm agreed to fire the 
milkens and deny them most of their 1988 compensation at the 
insistence of federal prosecutors 
in an indication of other settlementrelated management changes 
at drexel the firm on friday announced the appointment of a new 
vice chairman and three appointments in the corporate finance 
department 
joseph said in a statement that the moves importantly position 
drexel to capitalize on the opportunities we see ahead

offered friday to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the 
consumer and industrial products manufacturer but emhart dismissed 
the offer as unacceptable

agreement under which emhart would give the investor group access to 
confidential financial information about the company topper has

a telephone company that charges to provide 
unlisted numbers now wants to sell another service that gives 
customers a peek at the number of the person calling before they 
pick up the phone 
the caller id service already used in new jersey and 
proposed in several other states is drawing static from consumer 
and civil rights advocates who say it would invade privacy and break 
antiwiretap laws 
the state public utility commission must approve the bell of 
pennsylvania proposal before it takes effect the company a 
subsidiary of philadelphiabased bell atlantic corp had hoped to 
initiate the service by march 19 but on friday postponed the date to 
april 9 to give itself time to respond to the concerns said puc 
spokesman john frazier in harrisburg 
caller id would enable customers to view on a display device the 
telephone number of the callers phone even if that number is 
unlisted the device would cost about 70 and the service 650 
monthly 
bell of pennsylvania says the service would enhance the privacy 
of the person being called enabling him or her to screen incoming 
calls and pinpoint their origin 
its much like a peephole in a door in your home it allows you 
to see whos at your door company spokesman miles kotay said 
the company has invested about 20 million in philadelphia alone 
to upgrade its equipment to handle a range of services including 
caller id kotay said the company expects revenues in the tens of 
millions of dollars from the services within five years 
but state consumer advocate david barasch warned the service 
could be devastating for example to someone staying in a shelter 
for battered women who needs to contact her husband but would not 
want him to know the shelters number 
once somebody has your number it doesnt take a lot of effort 
to find out where you are barasch said 
barry steinhardt executive director of the american civil 
liberties union in pennsylvania argues the service would be illegal 
steinhardt filed a complaint friday with the public utility 
commission contending the state wiretapping and electronic 
surveillance act strictly limits the use of trap and trace 
devices that identify the number of a phone on which a call is 
being placed 
bells customers would all be committing a thirddegree felony 
if they ordered this steinhardt said 
kotay disputed the question of illegality saying the company had 
concluded after a very careful examination of the laws that 
caller id would be legal he declined further comment pending action 
on steinhardts complaint 
bob frazier a prosecutor in the public utility commissions 
office of trial staff in harrisburg said his staff filed a request 
friday for formal hearings on the effect of the services on bell of 
pennsylvanias rates 
with annual revenues of about 2 billion and more than 38 
million customers the company could benefit or lose substantially 
from the new services bob frazier said 
the filing could result in the postponement of the service for 
several months he said 
the introduction of such service is likely to be proposed around 
the country as companies upgrade their switching and signaling 
equipment to handle the sophisticated information it requires 
bell atlantic subsidiary new jersey bell began offering caller id 
late last year after a sixmonth trial period in two areas of the 
state serving 213000 residential customers and 85000 business 
customers said george dawson a spokesman for the new jersey board 
of public utilities 
fears that the service would be used by businesses to obtain 
numbers for telephone solicitations did not pan out he said 
overall the service drew positive support he said 
since the introduction statewide the board of public utilities 
had received about 50 complaints mostly from people with unlisted 
numbers dawson said the rate of complaints had dropped to about 
two or three a month since the first weeks of the service he said 
new jersey bell hopes to make the service available to 72 percent 
of the state by the end of this year and will update the board on 
any complaints every six months dawson said 
nynex corp the regional phone company that owns new york 
telephone and new england telephone is studying a similar service 
but expects to conduct extensive trials and air privacy concerns 
said spokesman bob obrien 
he added that the technology required for such service is not in 
place throughout nynexs network and would cost hundreds of millions 
of dollars 
southern bell a subsidiary of atlantabased bellsouth corp 
included caller id in a threeyear trial program in orlando fla 
starting in 1984 said southern bell spokesman bob morrow 
the company which serves north carolina south carolina georgia 
and florida will probably propose the service to regulatory 
agencies later this year he said 
my feeling is that caller id is a very valuable and a very good 
option morrow said adding it could help computerized companies 
serve customers more quickly 
concerns about people learning unlisted numbers can be addressed 
by the caller he said as the originator you can control the 
number on that display he said you can go to a pay telephone 
or to a friends house to place a call 
one option being considered by pacific bell a subsidiary of the 
san franciscobased pacific telesis corp would allow callers to 
prevent their number from being displayed 
but bell atlantics companies contend such a blocking feature 
would defeat the purpose of the service

lawyers for eastern airlines machinists said 
friday they will mount a legal battle to get wages owed to striking 
union members and repeated accusations that the crippled carrier 
timed its bankruptcy filing to make sure workers went unpaid 
machinists who expected to be paid thursday instead had their 
final prestrike paychecks withheld by eastern as part of its 
petition for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy code 
all of easterns expenditures and business transactions now must 
be approved by the bankruptcy court 
robert clayman a washingtonbased attorney for the machinists 
said he would file papers soon in us bankruptcy court in manhattan 
to correct the pay situation and make sure these employees get 
paid as quickly as possible 
sources estimate the 8500 machinists are owed about 75 million 
for the week 
the machinists are particularly irked because a federal judge 
overseeing the bankruptcy has signed orders allowing eastern to 
compensate other employees who have continued working instead of 
joining the strike 
federal judge burton r lifland on thursday authorized the 
carrier to pay its employees working outside the united states in 
central and south america and the caribbean provide benefits and 
salary and reimburse expenses for other currently working eastern 
employees 
easterns timing of its bankruptcy court petition really 
rankled the people clayman said 
it seems not coincidental that the timing of the bankruptcy was 
intended to deny these employees the wages for the work they 
performed he said clayman said he will stress that issue when he 
files court documents 
a number of union officials voiced similar complaints on 
thursday after eastern made its filing 
attorneys for eastern however were upbeat about the court 
action eastern attorney bruce zirinsky said the signing of the 
orders represented a fair amount of movement in what is certain 
to be a lengthly court proceeding 
while no further hearings have been scheduled zirinsky said a 
meeting would be held within the next two weeks to organize an 
official creditors committee the panel ultimately will have a say 
in easterns reorganization plan for emerging from chapter 11 
zirinisky also said easterns creditors already are beginning 
to communicate with us as well as the company and with each other 
he said creditors were requesting information on the affects of the 
bankruptcy filing and are indicating that they are interested in 
assisting eastern 
nearly 20 attorneys are working on the case for eastern and its 
parent texas air corp things are moving very smoothly 
zirinsky said 
meanwhile spokesman david jimenez a spokesman for seattlebased 
boeing co said the company is not worried about the 54 million it 
is owed by eastern were confident were going to be paid he 
said 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo and other eastern executives 
have vowed all creditors will be paid and shareholders will receive 
fair value 
at the bank of new york trustee for about 150 million unsecured 
bonds held by nearly 4000 bondholders spokesman owen brady said 
the bank was consulting with its counsel to determine what actions 
would be appropriate for us to take in terms of our responsibilities 
to the bondholders 
trustees often are either invited or seek to serve on creditors 
committees in order to represent the interests of the bondholders

two shareholders of bankamerica corp have sued 
company officers over a studentloan fiasco that could cost a group 
of banks 450 million to 650 million their law firm announced 
friday 
bankamerica announced wednesday it was boosting its firstquarter 
reserves to cover its part in losses that resulted from an unusually 
high default rate on student vocational loans for which it acted as

a federal jury friday ordered santa fe 
southern pacific corp and one of its units to pay 345 million to a 
pipeline joint venture after ruling earlier that they conspired to 
delay the ventures construction of a coal slurry pipeline 
the amount will be tripled automatically to 1035 billion if the 
judge upholds the jurys award and issues it as a final judgment 
santa fe is expected to appeal 
the planned 1800mile underground coal slurry pipeline would 
have extended from wyoming to texas and oklahoma and was abandoned 
in july 1984 after a series of delays the pipeline venture alleged 
were caused by a group of railroads 
the pipeline venture known as energy transportation systems 
inc filed a 1984 suit against burlington northern railroad co 
union pacific railroad co missouri pacific railroad co kansas 
city southern railway co and chicago and north western 
transportation co santa fe was added to the suit a few months later 
all the railroads except santa fe had settled out of court for 
285 million 
the members of the pipeline venture were texas eastern corp 
bechtel petroleum inc a subsidiary of the construction giant 
internorth inc now houstonbased enron corp and kn energy co 
us district judge robert parker had given the jury a directed 
verdict determining that santa fe southern pacific and its santa fe 
railway co unit had participated in an illegal conspiracy 
after deducting the total of 285 million already paid by the 
other defendants the net amount of the recovery against the santa 
fe will be 750 million assuming the jurys award is tripled texas 
eastern spokesman fred wichlep said 
sfsp and santa fe railway continue to believe that they did not 
cause the failure of the proposed etsa coal slurry pipeline and that 
the award of damages is not justified a statement by santa fe 
said the company believes there are significant issues on which 
to base posttrial motions to set aside the verdict the company 
also believes there are significant issues on which to base an 
appeal and intends to appeal the verdict 
lawyers for the pipeline contended the project if completed 
would have had a net cash flow of about 11 billion over 35 years 
the railroads were accused of delaying the project by using 
complex legal procedures before federal and state regulatory 
agencies organizing farm and environmental groups in opposition and 
not granting rightsofway through railroad property 
etsi attorneys said the delays occurred during a period of high 
inflation and increased the cost of the project from 689 million in 
1974 to 35 billion in 1984 
judge parker ruled monday that there was an agreement or 
conspiracy to delay hinder or stop the project and santa fe 
knowingly took part in the agreement 
santa fe attorney fred furth argued the pipeline project was a 
sham and bechtel profited from the project by taking money for the 
engineering but would not take the risks needed to get the project 
off the drawing board 
he also contended that project was destined to fail without the 
railroads because companies could not secure customers financing 
and a ruling on whether the pipeline fell under interstate commerce 
commission regulations

eastern airlines filed for protection from 
creditors in bankruptcy court thursday the sixth day of a 
machinists strike blaming pilots for a cash crisis that 
paralyzed the nations seventhlargest airline 
the move came a day after eastern insisted such a step remained a 
last resort in the airlines effort to endure the strike which had 
strong support from pilots and flight attendants and was costing 
eastern an estimated 4 million a day 
eastern filing under chapter 11 in us bankruptcy court here 
listed more than 45 billion in net assets 339 billion in 
liabilities and 15696 creditors the filing is designed to give 
eastern a reprieve from debts while it tries to restructure and 
extricate itself from the worst crisis in its 60year history 
eastern boss frank lorenzo blamed the damage that has been 
caused by the pilots union he and eastern president phil bakes 
insisted they intend to restore the airline in bankruptcy court 
though in a smaller form 
we tried mightily to keep eastern from bankruptcy bakes said 
at a news conference we intend to operate our airline make no 
mistake about that 
bakes said eastern faces a cash crisis that can only be averted 
and stabilized by turning to the bankruptcy court 
union leaders denounced lorenzo as a robber baron machinists 
called for a public boycott of easterns sister airline 
continental set up pickets against continental in houston and said 
they would oppose easterns reorganization plan and any sale of 
assets 
lorenzo and bakes pledged that all creditors would be paid in 
full shareholders would receive fair value passengers would be 
protected and as many employees as possible would return to work 
eastern had 31200 employees before the strike 
john peterpaul a machinists vice president said eastern filed 
for bankruptcy on payday in a spiteful attempt to deny eastern 
workers their last paycheck earned before the strike paychecks 
were frozen by the move 
eastern encouraged its ticketholders to redeem their tickets 
with other carriers and failing that to mail them in for refunds 
continental said it would accept eastern tickets at full value 
as of thursday other carriers such as braniff and twa refused to 
honor eastern tickets while some carriers accepted them subject to 
such significant restrictions as standby seats only for 
fullprice tickets 
john bavis head of the eastern pilots union said management 
continued calling pilots at home in hopes some will return to work 
he said the effort would fail 
henry duffy president of the air line pilots association said 
he hoped the move meant lorenzo is finished at eastern 
the company which has a staggering 25 billion in debt has 
admitted it was taken by surprise when most of the 3600 eastern 
pilots honored machinists picket lines forcing miamibased eastern 
to shut down nearly all operations monday and lay off 9500 
nonunion employees 
eastern running just 4 percent of its flights with a crew of 
1500 is losing 4 million a day bakes said before the 8500 
machinists struck saturday in a dispute over concessions losses 
were pegged at 1 million daily 
union leaders long have said they believe lorenzo wants to break 
them and tear eastern apart but lorenzo would have a tougher time 
imposing lower wages at eastern than he did when he reorganized 
continental in 1983 congress amended bankruptcy law in 1984 to 
require bankrupt companies to negotiate with unions and prove 
economic necessity before abrogating contracts 
lorenzo stressed the filing covered only eastern and not its 
parent texas air corp of which he is chairman but on thursday 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio filed a bill to allow eastern 
creditors to collect from the parent company 
this bill would prevent frank lorenzo and any other airline 
buccaneers from using bankruptcy to escape their creditors and 
destroy their workers metzenbaum said 
make no mistake about it continental is on strike now 
eastern machinists leader charles e bryan said as his members 
cheered theres never been a more classic example of a robber 
baron anytime anyone buys a ticket on continental theyre 
making a contribution to treachery to atrocity to evil 
at a news conference in new york lorenzo noted the animosity 
union leaders have expressed toward him and said it had hurt my 
family and me 
but i suggest that the intensive focus on a single person does 
a real gross injustice to the real issues that are at stake in 
airline deregulation and indeed in our business climate today 
he said 
bakes and lorenzo avoided specific comment on the news that 
lorenzo rival carl icahn had been asked by eastern strikers to 
consider a buyout of eastern 
the chapter 11 filing would not prevent such a takeover but would 
force approval by the bankruptcy court as well as creditors making 
such a transaction cumbersome unions would also have a say 
icahn chairman of trans world airlines said wednesday he would 
consider requests to acquire eastern only if eastern allowed the 
negotiations 
the machinists helped icahn snatch twa in 1985 despite lorenzos 
competing bid icahn mulled a bid for eastern last fall but talks 
faltered when he asked for up to 300 million in concessions from 
its union in exchange for a stake in the company 
bakes said easterns immediate focus will be on the few 
operations it has retained its northeast shuttle service and 
flights to south america 
as pilots become available eastern plans to prudently but 
unmistakably put more planes into the air bakes added 
bankruptcy court must approve any ticket refunds to passengers 
the court considers ticket holders as unsecured creditors who must 
wait in line behind secured creditors who receive higher preference 
among other developments 
the machinists said in washington that the union along with 
the pilots union and the transport workers union which represents 
flight attendants would draft a reorganization plan to submit to 
bankruptcy court next week no details were given 
bakes said the court action would not affect a pending 365 
million sale of the northeast shuttle to new york developer donald 
trump 
in new york a federal judge heard arguments but withheld 
ruling on whether to extend a ban against commuter rail sympathy 
strikes which could disrupt travel for more than 320000 people in 
the new york area a federal appeals court in philadelphia refused 
to overturn a ban on sympathy strikes at commuter railroads there 
in washington the house public works committee approved 
legislation aimed at pushing president bush into the strike by 
forcing appointment of an emergency board the legislation goes to 
the house where passage is likely but the bush administration has 
threatened to veto it and it may not even make it out of the senate
