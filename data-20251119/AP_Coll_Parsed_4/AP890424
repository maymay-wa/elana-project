prime minister noboru takeshita announced on 
tuesday that he will resign to take responsibility for a massive 
influencepeddling scandal he said has led to growing public 
distrust of politicians 
the scandal and a widely criticized sales tax that took effect 
april 1 sent his popularity rating skidding to a rockbottom 39 
percent and made him japans most unpopular prime minister since 
world war ii 
takeshita 65 spoke at a nationally televised news conference 
after telling a cabinet meeting he would end his 18month tenure in 
office half of it a downhill slide due to a scandal named after 
the recruit co conglomerate 
the recruit question has caused a grave crisis for the 
nations parliamentary democracy he said as the chief 
executive of government and president of the ruling party i deeply 
apologize 
the prime minister said he will step down after the fiscal 1989 
budget is passed that leaves the timing of his resignation 
uncertain because parliament is deadlocked by an opposition boycott 
of budget deliberations parliament is expected to pass the budget 
by early may 
it also was unclear who would succeed him since other senior 
figures in the governing liberal democratic party are tainted by 
donations from recruit 
news reports cited former foreign minister masayoshi ito as a 
possible successor to takeshita but ito is 75 and ailing he is a 
diabetic 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater traveling with president 
bush in san jose calif said tuesday night japan is a close 
ally and friend we will continue to work closely with the new 
prime minister and government 
takeshita became prime minister in november 1987 he denied 
wrongdoing but acknowledged receiving more than 1 million in what 
he called legal political donations from the recruit co weekend 
news reports said he also borrowed 381700 from the 
informationpublishing giant in 1987 returning the funds a few 
months later 
a former takeshita aide and a relative also profited from sales 
of the recruit cosmos shares for a total of 192000 
about 17 politicians or their aides and 150 other influential 
people are known to have reaped profit from sales of hundreds of 
thousands of unlisted shares in a recruit real estate subsidiary 
recruit cosmos in 1986 the transactions generated hefty profits 
when the share prices soared after the stocks were made available 
for overthecounter trading 
recruit also paid millions of dollars to influential politicians 
or their aides as contributions raising suspicions it was seeking 
favors in return 
the chief cabinet secretary reizo obuchi said in making the 
first official announcement tuesday that takeshita would resign 
said takeshita wanted to clarify his responsibility for the 
publics distrust in politicians due to the recruit question 
more than a dozen people have been arrested on bribery and other 
charges and three takeshitaappointed cabinet members have 
resigned in connection with the scandal along with takeshita 
former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone shintaro abe the 
secretarygeneral of the liberal democrats and former finance 
minister kiichi miyazawa have been implicated 
takeshita said tuesday he would continue with a planned trip to 
five southeast asian nations scheduled to start saturday and 
lasting through may 7 news reports earlier said he planned to 
cancel the trip 
after takeshitas resignation governing party members would 
chose their next party president who would in turn become prime 
minister due to the liberal democrats majority in both houses of 
parliament 
ito chairman of the governing liberal democratic partys 
executive council and an eighttime member of the lower house told 
reporters who had gathered in front of his tokyo residence before 
takeshitas announcement late tuesday morning this is the time 
for fundamental political reform 
ito and takeshita met on monday and afterward both denied 
setting a plan for ito to take over the premiership 
a recent poll by the kyodo news service put takeshitas support 
at 39 percent the lowest ever recorded by kyodo for a prime 
minister 
political analysts say that along with the scandal and low 
popularity ratings the premier has been pressed by dissent within 
the party because younger party members fear they will not be able 
to win elections with takeshita as their leader 
elections for half the seats in the upper house are due this 
summer though general elections need not be called by the prime 
minister until the summer of 1990 
media reports did not say if takeshita might call for early 
general elections or if the liberal democrats would pick a 
successor 
the liberal democrats have governed japan for about 48 years and 
hold 297 seats in the 512member lower house of parliament 
many of the recruit donations to takeshita and others were 
ticket purchases to fundraising parties such gatherings of fellow 
politicians and business leaders are common in japan where 
politics and business are closely related they are especially 
popular with the liberal democrats as a way around laws restricting 
campaign funds 
in recent weeks takeshita had repeatedly vowed to push through 
political reforms to restore public trust in government 
the scandal has caused the greatest political fallout in japan 
since former prime minister kakuei tanaka was accused in the 
lockheed affair in 1976 tanaka was convicted of taking a 2 
million bribe after the us aircraft company admitted it spent 
121 million to advance its sales in japan

a small town library was set free from 
budget woes when officials found an original copy of abraham 
lincolns emancipation proclamation lying in a pile of junk 
it was like a providential finding said maurice isserman a 
trustee of the ashfield public library and a professor of history 
at mount holyoke college in south hadley 
isserman discovered the document last fall as trustees were 
meeting to discuss the prospect of receiving state and federal 
grants 
somebody said we could sell those old prints over there in the 
corner isserman said i walked over and looked at one and it 
wasnt a print it was a document and i looked down at the bottom 
and there was abraham lincolns signature which was faded a 
different color from the printed material 
the document was one of 48 copies made in 1864 and signed by 
lincoln and secretary of state william seward experts at sothebys 
auction house in new york told trustees recently 
library officials believe the document was donated years ago by 
george william curtis a friend of lincolns and a founder of the 
ashfield library association 
the library received its grants but they totaled about 50000 
less than officials expected the threeroom belding memorial 
library also needed renovations isserman said 
so the document will be auctioned next fall and is expected to 
fetch at least 70000 which should cover the renovations he said

fur is expected to fly this week in the years 
first budget vote on the floor of congress despite the bipartisan 
amity that so far has marked lawmakers deficitreduction efforts 
the house is scheduled to vote wednesday on a measure providing 
47 billion in new spending this year for veterans assistance 
antidrug initiatives education loans and other programs 
the legislation has run into opposition from members of both 
parties who say it would add to an already embarrassing fiscal 1989 
deficit of 163 billion and would trample spending limits that 
former president reagan and congressional leaders forged in a 
budget summit pact two years ago 
i hope i dont have to engage in immolation on the floor of 
the house but this is the last line in the sand said rep bill 
frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the house budget 
committee this would be a stunning indictment of congress for 
being willing to go back on its word 
it is common this late in the fiscal year which ends sept 30 
for congress to provide money for unforseen needs 
but with president bush and lawmakers having recently shaken 
hands on a deficitcutting pact for 1990 that has been criticized 
by some as phony and inadequate many members of congress are 
sensitive about adding even more to this years shortfall they 
also dont want to rupture relations with the administration which 
has threatened a veto of the measure because of its cost 
this is a crucial vote for congress as to whether it will 
stand by the spending limits of the 1987 budget summit and whether 
it will stand by the agreement just arrived at said house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
frenzel and panetta who hope to trim the size of the bill will 
also be busy next week on fiscal 1990 matters the house budget 
committee plans to complete its work on a 12 trillion budget 
which the two lawmakers hope will incorporate 28 billion in 
savings hammered out in a month of negotiations with white house 
officials 
since the budget agreement set broad spending levels for 
domestic defense and international affairs programs the committee 
must still divide spending within the domestic category the 
lawmakers must decide how to distribute 1813 billion among 
education child care space science housing and other 
priorities each of which has passionate proponents in congress 
even then congressional leaders may have to fend off 
legislators who wish to alter the budget agreement by either 
redistributing spending or seeking extra savings 
there is a gnawing feeling among some members that this budget 
agreement doesnt do that much complained rep charles schumer 
dny a member of the budget panel 
the senate budget committee voted 167 last wednesday for a 
116 trillion version of the plan house and senate budget writers 
say they want to settle their differences and complete work on the 
spending plan by may 15 so they can plunge into subsequent bills 
permitting the government to spend and raise money 
with bush insistently against large tax increases and democrats 
opposed to domestic cuts congressional leaders believe the budget 
plan will ultimately be approved 
i dont see how anybody can come up with a real alternative 
that has a chance says sen pete domenici of new mexico ranking 
republican on the budget committee 
in other congressional action the house may vote thursday on 
whether to impeach us district judge walter l nixon of 
mississippi nixon is hoping to return to the bench after serving a 
fiveyear term for a perjury conviction the house judiciary 
committee is expected to vote tuesday to send the matter to the 
house floor 
a major preoccupation in the house is the continuing ethics case 
against speaker jim wright the texas democrat could appear before 
the panel as early as this week 
wright was formally charged last week with 69 instances of house 
rules violations including charges that he accepted 145000 in 
gifts from a business partner who had a direct interest in 
legislation and that he evaded limits on outside income through 
bulk sales of a book he wrote 
ethics committee members were scheduled to travel to texas early 
in the week to interview businessmen involved in an oil deal which 
yielded large profits for wright last year that deal is the 
subject of continuing investigation by the committee

theres a new effort on capitol hill to polish 
the tarnished image of congress 
no the organizers who include some of the weightiest movers 
and shakers of the senate and house are not worried about scandals 
or opinion polls or the accusations plaguing house speaker jim 
wright 
rather they are concerned about the actual fabric of the place 
to be precise they worry about the preservation of the marble 
and sandstone and bronze of which the capitol building is composed 
the art work which adorns it and the history the capitol has 
sheltered since congress moved to washington 189 years ago 
they are aware also that in an era of shrinking budgets and 
tight money congress is increasingly reluctant to appropriate 
taxpayers dollars for feathering the nest in which it does 
business 
so a group of congressional leaders sat down over coffee last 
week and with portraits of thomas jefferson and john adams looking 
over their shoulders announced the imminent launching of the us 
capitol preservation fund 
the multiple purpose 
to persuade private citizens and corporations to do for the 
capitol what such contributors have already done for the white 
house for the historic americana collection at the state 
department and for the newly refurbished blair house the 
presidents guest house 
to provide a way for the house and senate to accept gifts of 
fine art and historic items related to the history of congress 
to use the money raised to undertake major restoration projects 
in the first such effort the deteriorating 19foot bronze 
statue of freedom will be removed from its commanding perch on top 
of the capitol dome probably by helicopter and be brought to 
earth for a major facelift costing at least 300000 
it will be the first time the statue has been moved since dec 
2 1863 when the last of its five separate parts was lifted to the 
top of the dome by a steam hoist and hammered and bolted into place 
also on the drawing board is the installation on the capitols 
east plaza of two 30foot carrara marble fountains which were 
crafted 19 years ago for lady bird johnsons beautification 
campaign but placed in storage when the money ran out 
the installation of the fountains and the paving of the plaza 
with ornamental stone blocks planned for later will banish the 
cars that have used the plaza as a parking lot since the beginning 
of the automotive age 
capitol architect george white says money also is needed for the 
restoration of dozens of works of art inside the capitol itself 
the initial fundraising is being handled by new york corporate 
executive preston r tisch the former postmaster general 
he predicts 15 million will be raised at a june 20 gala 
celebrating the bicentennial of congress 
funds also will be received from a 50 percent share of the 
profits from the sale of coins commemorating the 200year history 
of congress to be minted by the treasury in fivedollar onedollar 
and halfdollar denominations 
sen robert c byrd dwva the senates president pro tem and 
most ardent student of its history says the fund and the capitol 
preservation commission created to administer it will be 
congress bicentennial gift to the nation 
what better testimony to congress 200 years than to ensure a 
means to provide for the continued restoration of our nations 
symbol of democracy byrd said 
the capitol is a unique working museum fifteen million 
visitors come here each year making it one of the most frequented 
public buildings in the world through these efforts we are 
committed to ensuring the ongoing legacy of the capitol for 
generations to come

agonizing personal experience led linda noie to 
her fervent antiabortion stance ten years ago she had an 
abortion but still carried a fetus to term and gave birth she 
shared her private anguish over that failed abortion with the 
associated press in a story that is one in a series examining the 
emotional question of abortion rights as the us supreme court 
prepares to hear arguments this week 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
two months after her abortion linda noie 
feared a cancerous tumor was growing inside her but the rhythmic 
buhbump of a fetal heartbeat heard through a stethoscope confirmed 
she was still pregnant 
my tumor had a heartbeat two beautiful arms and two beautiful 
legs ms noie said 
the episode in 1979 transformed ms noie into a zealous 
prolifer now the state director of women exploited by abortion 
she lives next door to the clinic where she had the fiveminute 
surgery and pickets there at least twice a week 
her son joshua now 9 years old joins her at marches rallies 
and speeches he wears a tshirt saying i survived the abortion 
holocaust 
if that baby could make it through that terrible experience 
that baby was mine no matter what ms noie 44 said nobody 
was going to talk me into killing this baby i thought i committed 
murder one time i wasnt going to do it again 
there is a reason joshua survived i think god wanted to start 
his army in the spiritual battle against abortion he wanted 
somebody to be on the front lines here we are out on the 
battlefront 
nationally the bitter abortion fight is approaching a turning 
point 
the us supreme court will hear arguments april 26 on a 
missouri case that could narrow or overturn a 1973 ruling that 
established a womans right to abortion 
when defenders of a womans right to choose a safe legal 
abortion have marched on washington dc most recently april 9 
some have carried coat hangers as brutal reminders of backalley 
butchery done before 1973 
those opposed to abortion like ms noie counter with pictures of 
fetuses being cut up or sucked out of the womb she has yelled at 
patients and jumped in front of cars bringing pregnant women to the 
fox valley reproductive health care center where she had her 
unsuccessful abortion 
her mailbox is painted crimson and adorned with red ribbon to 
symbolize babies blood 
i dont want anyone else to get hurt like i was ms noie 
said i made a bad mistake it eats away at me every day i want 
to be there for somebody else i dont want them to look out and 
not have anybody like i did 
abortion doesnt just mean being unpregnant its legalized 
murder babies are being killed she said you just cant put 
it in a closet that door doesnt quite shut tight its going to 
creep out some day 
ms noie says shes on a crusade to help women who feel guilt or 
suffer psychological scars after their abortions dr vincent rue 
a psychotherapist and former teacher at ucla called this condition 
postabortion syndrome and said it can include suppressed 
hostility unresolved mourning for the loss of the fetal child and 
a reexperiencing of the abortion 
the way ms noie sees it the clinic either botched the abortion 
or aborted a twin fetus 
maggi case director and owner of the clinic declined to 
comment on ms noies case because she is not at liberty to 
discuss a patients medical records 
ms noie cried several times as she recounted her achingly 
private pain in a recent interview her gaze frequently drifted out 
the dining room window to a childs swing set and sandbox in the 
backyard 
in 1979 she was recently divorced after 15 years of marriage 
and had two children aged 16 and 10 a waitress she became 
pregnant to a restaurant customer who befriended her 
afraid confused and burdened with a pregnancy her boyfriend 
didnt want she scheduled an abortion at the clinic for jan 12 
the day of the surgery she wrote one word in her calendar 
diary slaughterhouse after a fivehour wait in the crowded 
clinic she spent five minutes on the operating table her 
boyfriend paid in cash 
i was mixed up i was wishing somebody would break in and take 
me out of there i wanted it stopped ms noie said the pain 
was awful it seemed very very wrong 
i killed a baby i felt so dirty and crummy it was like part 
of me was gone she said i couldnt look at myself in the 
mirror i was ready to commit suicide not because i wanted to die 
but because i hated myself so badly for what i had done 
that night she and her boyfriend ended their relationship 
ms noie returned a month later for a checkup complaining about 
being dizzy and weak at work she was told the abortion had 
removed particles of conception but her hormones hadnt 
readjusted 
on march 29 she came back again and was referred to a second 
doctor when he checked her for a suspected tumor she was given a 
stethoscope and was asked do you want to hear your babys 
heartbeat 
ms noie says her son has hearing lapses memory loss and other 
health effects that she attributes to the abortion 
she returned to the clinic about a year after joshua was born 
dressed in black she circled the stone and frame building 
touching it while joshua played with driveway pebbles 
i wanted to make sure it couldnt hurt me anymore she said 
a chainlink fence erected by the clinic marks the property line 
i had nightmares when i first moved in ms noie said i 
dreamed of little babies with charred arms and legs crawling out of 
the barrels in back where they burn their medical waste 
joshua likes the house but he tells people he lives next to 
the place where they kill babies she said once when he was 3 
years old he woke up screaming at night and said mommy why did 
you do it didnt you want me

a vast arctic bay dubbed the golden 
triangle for its unparalleled treasure of fish and wildlife may 
be spared oil exploration because of the catastrophic effects 
nearby of the nations worst oil spill 
three alaska governors and the stubborn fishermen of bristol bay 
have appealed to three presidents to ban oil and gas drilling in 
the bay the richest red salmon grounds in the world 
for 10 years the powerful of washington brushed aside the pleas 
of complainers living far far away last year nine oil companies 
paid 954 million to the federal government to search for oil and 
gas in bristol bay 
this year everythings different now the 4500 people of 
bristol bay a 44000squaremile marine paradise even richer than 
devastated prince william sound are pleading their case again 
hoping that the wreck of the tanker exxon valdez will prompt 
president bush to hand back the money 
with millions of fish threatened thousands of birds dying and 
hundreds of sea otters dead in prince william sound the despairing 
fishermen of western alaska suddenly have environmental clout and 
renewed attention to their cause 
i hate to say it but without a doubt the spill may help us 
save bristol bay said sue flensburg executive director of the 
bristol bay coastal resource service area 
until the huge tanker split open last month the faint outraged 
voices in bristol bay 450 miles southwest of prince william sound 
on the very edge of the continent were literally crying in the 
wilderness 
oilcompany assurances of environmental integrity and safety had 
consistently won out 
they always dangled their success in front of us said 
deborah tennyson executive director of the bristol bay native 
association 
the oil companies and the feds said youre psychotic youre 
paranoid weve shipped millions of gallons of oil out of valdez 
weve got caribou grazing under the pipeline little chicks are 
being born at prudhoe bay and the whales come back year after year 
to prince william sound 
well a massive oil spill is like nuclear war said mrs 
tennyson who fishes along with her whole family during salmon 
season 
if it happens once it would be so horrible that saying 
sorry well never do it again doesnt mean a damned thing if 
something like this happened in bristol bay it would be a cultural 
economic and social holocaust 
bristol bay supports the worlds largest red salmon fishery and 
the largest herring fishery in us waters as well as a majority 
of the worlds northern fur seal population the pacific gray whale 
population and millions of seabirds geese and ducks 
to most alaskans the arguments for bristol bay boil down to 
pure economics a barrel of oil is worth about 20 most of the 
year a ninepound bristol bay red salmon retails in anchorage for 
7425 salmon is more plentiful than oil here they say and it is 
a resource that renews itself 
alaska gov steve cowper claims bristol bays wholesale fishery 
value exceeds 1 billion and employs 10000 people in a good year 
its always been obvious to us that our annual renewable 
resources far outweigh any potential oil and gas gains said ms 
flensburg once oil is gone its gone forever but our fish come 
back every year why cant the federal government understand that 
the oil companies have pressed ahead with bristol bay plans 
despite surveys that show limited oil deposits at best and a 
warning from the us fish and wildlife service dating back to 1978 
that no adequate safeguards could protect bristol bay because of 
strong tidal currents severe winds earthquakes and heavy ice 
ten patches in the bering chukch and beaufort seas totaling 
480 million acres of ocean bottom have been identified by 
geologists as potential outer continental shelf oil and gas fields 
the interior department pegs bristol bays hydrocarbon potential 
in the bering sea among the lowest in that ocs area with perhaps 
as little as 2 percent of the nations undiscovered offshore 
resources 
experts estimate the area contains anywhere between 63 million 
and 615 million barrels of oil by contrast the prudhoe bay fields 
which feed the transalaska pipeline are estimated at 10 billion 
barrels 
at the most bristol bay could amount to only about a months 
worth of oil consumption for the nation 
alaska officials acutely aware that oil royalties now account 
for more than 80 percent of the states revenue long ago learned 
to coexist with the multinational energy companies and federal 
regulators 
although state coffers dont gain a cent from drilling outside 
alaskas threemile limit former governors jay hammond and bill 
sheffield as well as cowper all supported ocs leasing except in 
bristol bay 
but alaskas decadeold effort to exclude bristol bay from ocs 
sales was stymied by the reluctance of its own congressional 
delegation to fight exploration and the adamant refusal of 
presidents carter and reagan to exclude the bay from interior 
department leasing 
with nearly unanimous support from environmentalists and 
fishermen alaska turned to the courts for help 
this region is commonly referred to as the golden 
triangle wrote lance trasky of the alaska department of fish 
and game during the lengthy litigation these fish and wildlife 
resources have great social and economic value to the world 
last october us supreme court justice sandra day oconnor 
rejected the states appeal immediately thereafter bids were 
opened and 23 tracts were leased by nine oil companies at an 
average price of 78387 an acre 
shell western eampp and chevron usa the two big winners 
announced plans to begin surveying as early as this summer with 
drilling to follow as soon as permits were obtained 
in a lastditch letter to bush 24 days before the prince william 
sound disaster cowper urged him to defer leasing long enough to 
study environmental impacts of an oil spill in bristol bay 
so far cowper has had no reply from the white house 
alaskas senate added its plea last week unanimously passing a 
resolution urging the federal government to hold up bristol bay 
exploration 
hammond the former governor and a bristol bay resident agrees 
that the politicians and oil companies have been listening to 
alaskans for years but not hearing them 
like many he feels the prince william sound disaster may be 
the death knell to bristol bay leasing because of the nightmarish 
potential if a spill happened here 
but as a battlescarred veteran of two decades of alaskan 
political infighting the man who was governor throughout the 
building of the transalaska pipeline is also a realist 
i am optimistic theres a substantially greater impediment to 
bristol bay leasing today said hammond but i am not 
optimistic it will never be done after all this is alaska 
unhappily dillingham mayor joe mcgill agreed 
i liked living here so much better before electricity taxes 
and lawyers sighed mcgill 
when the oil companies are really ready to do it theyll do 
it hell theyre a lot bigger than a bunch of fishermen and 
money in alaska always talks

its almost salmon season again the high point of the year 
everything in ekuk and chignik aleknagik and igiugig and the

mending nets checking engines painting hulls men women and 
children whose entire annual income depends on their success on the 
sea are now scrambling to be ready for that momentous day when the

you forget everything else until after fishing season said 
dillingham mayor joe mcgill a commercial fisherman in bristol bay 
since 1947 thats all that matters dillingham goes from a 
sleepy little town to a crazy metropolis 
the blazing summer arctic sun now rises higher in the sky 
melting the bays icepack and hundreds of inches of snow on boats 
in the storage yard this town of 1570 becomes a hub for boat 
repair transportation and speculation about the season ahead 
will it be a good one like the last five and yield enough to 
make boat payments cancel the winters grub bill at the grocery 
store leave enough left over for a new refrigerator or even a trip 
outside to the lower 48 when the thermometer dips to 50below 
zero next january 
the entire region totaling 44000 square miles has a permanent 
population of about 4500 
in the summer theres a big influx of people from outside 
who come up just to fish and hope they make a killing in a month 
said mcgill forget flying out of here this becomes the third 
busiest airport in the state because of fishing fishermen coming 
in fish being flown out 
the years cycle along bristol bay depends on the worlds 
richest red salmon run which usually begins in midjune and 
continues at a fever pitch through midjuly before tapering off in 
late summer 
more than 3500 fishing permits involving about 10000 
fishermen are issued by the state for bristol bay 
robert heyano holds a permit now worth more than 250000 so 
does his wife marie and his mother rose and two of his brothers 
his parents are the only yearround residents of ekuk 14 miles 
south of dillingham where his father peter is the cannery 
caretaker in the summer that tiny settlement swells to dozens who 
camp out for three months fishing 
heyano like nearly everyone around bristol bay following the 
prince william sound oil spill is adamantly opposed to oil and gas 
development in the precious fishing grounds 
the whole rhythm of our lives is based on fishing and 
subsistence hunting said heyano 37 if you werent able to do 
that i dont see how anyone could continue to live in a village 
the meaning of life would be gone

soviets once danced in the streets to celebrate 
their countrys space successes hailed by the party as proof of 
the superiority of socialism 
but with chronic shortages of everything from toothpaste to 
housing the cheers are now drowned out by calls to spend available 
rubles on earth 
the soviet space program has become the latest target of 
criticism as president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness unleashes longsuppressed public 
complaints 
untold billions of rubles were spent to put the first sputnik 
satellite in orbit 1957 to make yuri gagarin the first man in 
space in 1961 and to achieve other space feats 
on april 12 the anniversary of gagarins flight in vostok1 a 
newspaper recalled how soviets celebrated the news by singing and 
dancing through the streets 
but more than 31 years after sputnik circled the globe soviet 
space exploration has not realized the prediction of russian rocket 
pioneer konstantin tsiolkovsky who said harnessing the cosmos 
would bring mountains of bread and enormous power to those who 
mastered it 
soviets began soulsearching about space expenses after a series 
of problems with their countrys space program the problems 
coincided with official pressure to cut a 162 billion budget 
deficit and growing impatience with shortages of food consumer 
goods and housing 
in part for economy reasons the mir space lab will be without a 
crew for three months starting thursday when three cosmonauts 
return to earth 
the debate on soviet space spending is reminiscent of the 
american publics questioning of the billions of dollars spent on 
the apollo project in the 1960s and 1970s to put men on the moon 
while some americans lived in poverty 
controversy over space spending spilled into the open early this 
year in the campaign for a new parliament candidates including 
maverick communist boris n yeltsin received some popular support 
when they suggested the space program be put on hold for a few 
years 
the kremlin already has reduced outlays for another institution 
once outside public criticism the military last year soviet 
leaders announced some defense plants will be converted to produce 
consumer goods food and building supplies to parry chronic 
shortages 
adding fuel to the spacespending controversy were the november 
launch of the 10 billion shuttle buran the loss in september and 
march of two unmanned mars probes phobos i and ii at a cost of a 
halfbillion dollars and embarrasing delays caused by technical 
problems and human error in the landings of the last two crews from 
mir last year 
opposition grew when space officials hungry for foreign currency 
last month chose a japanese and not a soviet who could only pay 
rubles for the first commercial trip to mir the price tag was 
11 million 
the public has flooded the press with letters and articles have 
examined the costs and benefits of the space program 
isnt it too lavish to finance space perhaps it pays to stop 
until we fill the holes shortages 10 readers suggested in a 
joint letter to the defense ministry daily red star 
defenders of space exploration emphasize the benefits of 
technology and information transfers to the earthbound economy 
the tass news agency recently reported that more than 2 billion 
was spent on space research in the soviet union last year and that 
economic benefits totaled 32 billion 
satellites have gathered weather information extended 
television and telephone service aided navigation of ships and 
located mineral and oil deposits according to articles in 
staterun media 
but media reports have said industry is not adequately using the 
information and technology and they have criticized the 
spendthrift attitude of government agencies involved in space 
pravda and other newspapers say public support has declined 
because space officials tout successes and hide problems 
such propaganda not only did not inspire trust but conversely 
alienated people from this sphere and took away their feeling of 
participation wrote the space correspondent of the labor daily 
trud vitaly golovachev 
space scientist roald sagdeyev said officials must work hard to 
save the space program and also acknowledge failures 
we have one very serious task to restore the peoples faith 
though glasnost through truthful information that is honest to the 
end he told colleagues at a recent meeting about the phobos 
problems we must show and prove to the people that without 
space mankind doesnt have a future 
some soviet officials admit they have made mistakes 
particularly in not doing more to put space research to practical 
use they envy the united states for sucesses in that area 
our space technology is one of the most advanced naturally if 
we do it right like the americans and convert it to other fields 
we can receive a big economic effect said viktor d blagov 
mirs deputy flight director 
blagov in a telephone interview cited nasa figures that for 
every dollar invested in the us space program 9 is returned in 
technology benefits according to the tass figures the soviet 
return is about 15 rubles for every ruble spent 
in an attempt to make space research yield a better financial 
return nasas soviet counterpart glavkosmos is hoping to sell 
crystals grown in mirs zerogravity for use in electronics as 
well as medicines manufactured on the space station 
the soviets also are starting to charge foreign crews that want 
to travel to mir at 1012 million a shot

a us trade association says worldwide growth 
rates for computers and other information technology are likely to 
fall between now and 1993 
the computer and business equipment manufacturers association 
says it expects that only telecommunications equipment will buck 
the trend global revenues of the information technology industry 
in 1988 totaled 6047 billion up 112 percent from the previous 
year the association says 
the figure includes computers and other electronic data 
processing equipment 304 billion office equipment 621 
billion telecommunications equipment 1122 billion as well as 
software and services 1264 billion 
in a global market analysis issued last week cbema said 
information industry revenues grew at an average annual rate of 
108 percent over the period 198088 but that growth rate it 
said is projected to decrease to 87 percent a year for the period 
from 1988 through 1993 
looking ahead for the next four years there is a slowdown in 
all equipment markets except telecommunications said helga 
sayadian director of industry marketing statistics for the 
washingtonbased association 
ms sayadian said this trend reflects economic conditions 
worldwide and the slight recession that is forecast near the 
beginning of next year 
for electronic data processing equipment the worldwide annual 
growth rate averaged 123 percent in 198088 and is projected to 
drop to 89 percent in 198893 
average annual growth for office equipment was 93 percent in 
198088 and is forecast to decline to 77 percent in 198893 while 
yearly growth of software and services averaged 19 percent in 
198088 and is projected to drop to 119 percent in 198893 
by contrast cbema said annual growth for telecommunications 
equipment is forecast to increase slightly from 45 percent in 
198088 to 53 percent in 198893 
for 1988 consumption of information technology in north america 
totaled 2994 billion europe 2124 billion asia 767 
billion south america 88 billion and the rest of the world 
74 billion 
projections for 1993 are north america 4486 billion europe 
3033 billion asia 1411 billion south america 162 billion 
and the rest of the world 121 billion for a global total of 
9211 billion 
in terms of market share the share of worldwide information 
technology accounted for by electronic data processing equipment 
was 503 percent in 1988 and is forecast to edge up slightly to 
505 percent by 1993 software and services are projected to rise 
from 208 percent in 1988 to 241 percent in 1993 
however the global market share for telecommunications 
equipment is expected to drop from 186 percent in 1988 to 157 
percent in 1993 while office equipment is projected to decline 
from 103 percent in 1988 to 97 percent in 1993

the abrupt decision of tamil rebels to 
come to the negotiating table after six years of waging jungle 
warfare and massacring civilians could herald a breakthrough for 
sri lankas new president 
however it might also be a shrewd pragmatic maneuver by the 
tamil tigers to consign rival tamil groups to the political 
wilderness and then pick up the fight for a separate homeland some 
analysts say 
preparations for peace talks between the rebels and the 
government are likely to start in earnest this week with the 
arrival of the leader of the rebel delegation anton balasingham 
he is a sri lankan native who holds british citizenship and lives 
in london 
the government has blamed the tigers for the deaths of about 
9000 people mostly sinhalese civilians however no major attacks 
have been reported since april 15 when the tigers sent president 
ranasinghe premadasa a letter saying they would accept his offer 
for peace talks 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratna who also serves as deputy 
defense minister said the tigers sudden change of heart may have 
surprised the world but not sri lanka 
after what we have been through nothing surprises us 
anymore he said 
premadasa took office in january replacing junius r 
jayewardene who had governed since 1977 
early this month premadasa declared he was ready to go anywhere 
in the country to meet the tigers he also offered them amnesty 
jobs measures to ensure better treatment of their ethnic minority 
and seats in parliament if they gave up their insurrection 
premadasa belongs to the sinhalese majority which has dominated 
sri lanka since independence from britain in 1949 sinhalese who 
are mostly buddhists comprise 75 percent of the 16 million people 
on this island off indias southern coast 
the tamils who account for 18 percent are mostly hindus and 
say they suffer discrimination under the sinhalese 
tamil sources say the tigers will ask premadasa to dissolve a 
newly created joint administrative council for northern and eastern 
provinces and order new elections with tiger participation 
the government put in motion a plan for greater tamil autonomy 
after an accord with india in 1987 india which has millions of 
its own tamils sent in peacekeeping troops under the pact 
when the tigers refused to participate in the provincial 
elections rival tamil groups that once fought beside the tigers 
swept the balloting the tigers began to attack troops from india 
once viewed as their protector 
the autonomy plan also generated a backlash by militant 
sinhalese who mounted attacks in an effort to force the government 
into tougher treatment of the tamils 
an independent tamil and veteran of the political scene 
suggested the tigers sudden willingness to talk peace may stem 
from a desire to dislodge their former allies from the political 
front afterward the tigers might resume their fight for a 
separate homeland in the northeast he said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the tigers are also expected to demand withdrawal of the indian 
forces the president has also called for a pullout 
the tamil source however questioned whether india would give 
premadasa a free hand to negotiate with the rebels 
an indian government spokeswoman said her government would 
welcome such talks 
indias whole purpose of signing the 1987 accord was to 
bring peace to this country said the spokeswoman for the indian 
embassy who commented on condition of anonymity 
many of the guerrillas are teenagers who have known no work but 
war and killing and some analysts wonder if such fighters will 
accept a political solution 
one tamil soldier who spoke on condition of anonymity said he 
was certain the boys in the jungle would lay down their weapons 
if commanders told them to do so 
he said they wear lethal cyanide capsules around their necks and 
sometimes bite them under orders to avoid capture

more and more economists are expressing 
pessimism about the chances of surviving another year without a 
recession as fears over rising inflation and tightcredit policies 
continue to mount 
some analysts are even raising the spectre of the old bugaboo of 
the 1970s stagflation a period when growth slows and unemployment 
climbs but inflation rises as well 
for its part the bush administration is continuing to insist 
that the economy is on track for a soft landing in which growth 
slows enough to dampen inflationary pressures but not enough to 
push the country into a recession 
but private economists are not so sure the latest survey of 50 
top economists issued each month by blue chip economic indicators 
an investment newsletter showed that more than half of the panel 
now expect a recession to begin by late this year or early next 
year 
even those analysts who are not predicting an outright 
recession defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth 
are looking for this year to be extremely sluggish 
the governments first look at how the overall economy is 
performing will be issued on wednesday and despite all the 
pessimism the number is expected to be very good on paper at 
least 
many forecasters believe the gross national product the total 
output of goods and services expanded at an annual rate of 5 
percent in the januarymarch quarter 
that would represent the fastest rate of growth in more than a 
year and would be double the 24 percent gnp rate turned in during 
the final three months of 1988 
the trouble is that all of the pickup in growth will result from 
an artificial calculation needed to close out the books on last 
summers devastating drought 
while the droughts primary impact on the economy occurred in 
the second and third quarters last year the commerce department 
annualized its figures to show the lost farm output for the entire 
year now with a new year there will be an artificial bounceback 
in the numbers 
discounting this factor economic growth is expected to have 
slowed dramatically in the first three months of this year to 
around 25 percent down a full percentage point from the 35 
percent nonfarm growth in the fourth quarter 
early statistics showing sluggish retail sales and plunging 
housing construction in april have bolstered the belief that the 
economy will slow even further in the current apriljune quarter 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc of 
lexington mass said gnp growth would likely fall below 2 percent 
in the current quarter and average a weak 1 percent rate in the 
second half of the year 
an economy growing at such sluggish rates would not be able to 
generate enough new jobs to keep the unemployment rate from rising 
ms latta said dri is forecasting that unemployment will climb 
to 56 percent by the end of the year up from the current 15year 
low of 5 percent 
ms latta said she is not forecasting a recession because she 
believes the federal reserve will be successful in its yearlong 
effort to tighten credit enough to dampen demand but not enough to 
push the country into a slump 
we believe the odds still favor a soft landing the slowdown 
has been fairly broadly distributed and there is not a sign that 
any one sector is going to collapse she said 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he 
too believed the country would be able to escape without a 
recession over the next year as long as business profits do not 
begin to suffer from escalating wage demands or rising costs for 
raw materials 
we dont really get recessions until businesses get nervous 
and start cutting back he said i dont see signs that is 
happening 
but allen sinai chief economist of the boston co is 
predicting a recession beginning early next year 
i side with history he said the fed is making a mighty 
effort to engineer a soft landing for the economy but in the past 
they have failed more often they have succeeded 
some analysts believe the bush administration would be wise to 
take a downturn now as far away from the next presidential 
election as possible just as ronald reagan did in his first term 
when the country suffered through the 198182 recession 
but administration officials who are counting on robust 
economic growth to meet the goal of lowering the federal budget 
deficit below 100 billion next year continue to insist that they 
see no signs of a downturn 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers said in recent congressional testimony that he remained 
optimistic that the current economic expansion would be able to 
continue for some time to come as long as policy makers avoid 
mistakes such as increasing taxes to balance the budget

his fundraising among celebrities for his reelection campaign

think they are he said on sundays knbctv show news 
conference 
hayden said he was certain he will be able to raise money for 
his planned reelection campaign for state assemblyman or if he 
decides to run for state insurance commissioner 
the trial separation announced in february also wont affect 
the core of younger celebrities inspired by their activism hayden 
said 
i may not be as much a part of the hollywood left as i have 
been in the past but thats all right theyre solid mature 
people whose appetite for politics and for change has been whetted 
and definitely they dont need gurus or senior advisers he said 
the haydenfonda marriage in january 1973 grew out of their

when tiny nepal stood up to its giant 
neighbor india in a treaty dispute india imposed a trade blockade 
that has caused shortages of fuel salt medicines and other 
essentials in the mountain kingdom 
the trouble started last month when nepal rebuffed india by 
refusing to accept a treaty encompassing both trade and transit 
rights 
nepal wanted to renew two separate treaties one for trade and 
the other for transit or passage through the country that 
expired march 23 
being a landlocked nation nepal insists that transit is a 
constant necessity and wants it treated separately on a longterm 
basis rather than linked in a trade pact with changing conditions 
indias halt on trade with its himalayan neighbor has created 
hardships for many of nepals 17 million people 
dipak silwal a schoolteacher called indias move the 
unfriendly act of a friendly country 
they have stopped export of even salt india wanted to deprive 
nepalese of even that pinch of salt essential for human 
consumption he said 
kamal tuladhar the owner of a pharmacy said we are unable 
to meet the demands of people who need regular medicines to treat 
diabetes heart diseases or blood pressure 
before the blockade nepal imported more than 150000 worth of 
medicines from india each month 
nepal is bordered on three sides by india and shares its 
northern frontier with chinas tibet region that geography has led 
nepal to conduct most of its business with india and handle 
virtually all other foreign trade through the indian port of 
calcutta 
when the treaties lapsed india closed 13 of the 15 crossing 
points along the border with nepal and stopped exports 
if india wins the argument and nepal agrees on one treaty 
covering both trade and transit that would give give india a 
stronger bargaining position in any future disputes 
both india and nepal are predominantly hindu and have had a 
special relationship for decades but china has been wooing nepal 
and india has watched with concern chinas growing influence on the 
buffer state 
indiannepalese relations were hurt earlier this year when nepal 
bought artillery from china nepal also offered china and other 
nations trade terms that india considered better than the offers it 
had received 
silwal expressed confidence the nepalese could cope with the 
situation while the stalemate continues we can survive with them 
the indian goods or without them and most things though 
rationed are available in the markets people in katmandu now 
use kerosene to cook because gas imported from india is not 
available but some people say the weekly ration of about three 
quarts of kerosene per family is insufficient 
truckloads of logs for fuel are being hauled into the capital 
from the southern plains and that is causing a problem 
the sharp rise in logging and thoughtless destruction of 
forest will adversely effect the environment said kp sigdel 
the head of nepals forum of environment communicators 
nepal has bought petroleum products from singapore saudi arabia 
and other countries but shipments are held up at the indian border 
and the government rationed gasoline 
i get 15 liters about 4 gallons of gasoline per week but 
this is hardly enough for a day said taxi driver laxmi 
manandhar i have to garage my car most of the time 
an indian news agency reported that smugglers who once supplied 
luxury goods to the nepalese are now doing a booming business in 
items like salt kerosene gasoline and diesel fuel 
about 500 couriers are operating along the border and 
delivering their wares to remote areas said united news of india

the gender of a familys children once was 
determined by nature alone but modern prenatal testing techniques 
now enable expectant parents to make calculated decisions about 
having sons or daughters 
the tests in effect give parents an option although one that 
is rarely exercised pregnant with a girl but want a boy get an 
abortion and try again eventually you should get the gender of 
your choice 
many people consider this practice repugnant and perhaps a first 
step toward eugenics it is almost universally condemned by 
geneticists who conduct the prenatal tests those in favor of a 
womans right to abortion usually are opposed to gender choice and 
surveys show that only a very very few pregnant women will 
actually abort for sex selection 
but the fact that this type of family planning is possible and 
available is one of the dark undercurrents that continues to haunt 
the increasingly sophisticated world of modern human reproduction 
and it is an element cited by groups who oppose abortions made 
legal by the roe vs wade decision of the supreme court 
the court in a case from missouri is being asked to overturn 
or substantially limit that landmark 1973 decision arguments are 
scheduled wednesday in that case which does not specifically 
involve the genderselection issue 
the two types of prenatal testing chorion villus sampling and 
amniocentesis are used most frequently to determine if the fetus 
has some sort of genetic abnormality women who take these tests do 
so in anticipation of having an abortion if the fetus is shown to 
have a severe birth defect 
except for some rare genetic defects determining the gender is 
just an incidental part of the prenatal test findings but for some 
american couples apparently a rare few it is the whole point of 
the tests 
dr mark i evans a detroit doctor who is on the ethics 
committee of the american college of obstetrics and gynecology 
said the number of american women who use prenatal testing to 
control the gender of their children is incredibly minuscule 
in five years ive only been aware of two cases said 
evans who has a large practice specializing in prenatal testing 
thats two cases out of about 10000 its an incredibly 
minuscule problem and everybody is making a mountain out of a 
molehill 
evans however was concerned enough about the issue to take a 
survey of colleagues he found that 20 percent of the 212 doctors 
surveyed around the country believe gender selection is morally 
acceptable but nonetheless very few will actually participate in 
the practice and most said they very rarely are presented with the 
dilemma 
having talked to colleagues around the country ive found 
that everybodys experience is roughly the same said evans 
doctors who perform prenatal testing in philadelphia 
washington houston san francisco and other major centers all 
reported that they get so few requests for gender selection testing 
that it is not considered a problem of significance 
weve done 25000 prenatal diagnosis and it has happened to us 
only a few times said dr mitchell s goldbus of the university 
of california medical center in san francisco we run into it 
about one per thousand 
the policy at most centers is to specifically reject patients 
who ask for prenatal testing to determine gender alone but doctors 
admit they dont always know patients sometimes will request the 
testing for a genetic reason but actually are seeking the gender 
its possible to be fooled occasionally but i really think 
that on a percentage basis it is a very low number said evans 
one doctor who will perform prenatal testing for gender 
selection is dr gabriel khodr of san antonio and he reacts to 
criticism from other doctors in no uncertain terms 
who are they to impose their morality to others khodr asked 
in a telephone interview 
he said doctors will perform abortions for economic reasons for 
reasons of birth control or because the pregnancy is 
inconvenient for the mother but then balk at abortions for 
gender selection 
if they dont do abortions at all then i accept their 
point said khodr but if they do abortions then they dont 
have right to say i do abortions for any reason but sex 
selection why is it worse to want an abortion for family planning 
when youve got three girls and dont want another 
he adds i dont like abortions and i dont do abortions but 
who am i to force my morality on others 
khodr said that even though it is known that he will do prenatal 
testing for gender selection he still sees such patients only 
rarely 
he said last year he had two pregnant patients who requested the 
service for the same reason they both had three sons and were 
determined to have a daughter khodr said that by coincidence both 
women got their wish they gave birth to daughters 
evans and others however believe that prenatal testing should 
be used only to detect a possible disease or genetic defect 
permitting parents to select the gender of their offspring could 
eventually lead to a distortion of the natural balance of the 
sexes they feel since most parents asking for the service are 
usually seeking sons 
i am perfectly comfortable with pregnancy termination for 
genetic abnormalities but being female is not an abnormality 
said evans i am in favor of genetic testing i am not in favor 
of eugenics 
most of the genetic testing centers said requests for gender 
selection usually come from couples who are indian chinese or 
arab 
most of the family that use sex selection come from a culture 
that considers a male in the family to be important for social and 
economic stability said karen copeland a counselor at the 
baylor college of medicine genetics center in houston those are 
primarily chinese east indian and some of the middle eastern 
countries those are the ones who if they have several females will 
consider ending the pregnancy if its another girl 
ms copeland said she will turn such patients away from baylor 
but if asked will refer them to dr khodr

president bush is showing little inclination 
to delegate a lot of authority to subordinates even though he 
surrounded himself with strong personalities in the cabinet and in 
his inner circle of toplevel white house advisers 
bush has said he wants his cabinet members to speak out to say 
what they think so he did not directly secondguess attorney 
general dick thornburgh when asked last week what he thought about 
thornburghs idea to test public housing tenants for drug use 
weve got a good cabinet system and i encourage people to 
speak out the president said but the decisions on something 
of that nature will be made right here and theyre not going to 
be made until i have all the facts 
how bush goes about the job of factfinding as he nears 
decisions on key issues says much about the style of his presidency 
and the relative strength of his staff 
despite the presence of some key presidential advisers from past 
administrations such as national security adviser brent scowcroft 
and budget director richard darman bushs staff in relative 
terms is less influential than many of its predecessors 
administration sources and republican party officials privy to 
how things work in the white house inner sanctum said in interviews 
that bush is a much more activist handson type of president he 
gets immersed in the kind of internal policy debates that his 
predecessor ronald reagan sought to avoid these observers said 
reagans aides frequently depicted him as a passive player in 
the cabinet subcabinet and stafflevel discussions of policy 
options saying he chose to stay away from the arguments and await 
the recommendations of his aides 
typifying the contrasting bush style was a call that one 
presidential adviser got at home on a saturday night bush wanted 
to find out what had been done about a matter they discussed 
earlier in the week and he didnt want to wait until monday said 
the aide who asked not to be identified 
when the white house press corps was told at the last moment 
recently that bush had canceled a planned fourday weekend trip to 
his seaside resort home in kennebunkport maine press secretary 
marlin fitzwater explained that the president had decided he simply 
didnt want to go there after all 
interviews with a host of knowledgeable republicans inside and 
outside the administration produced a consensus on the most 
powerful of the bush aides not surprisingly scowcroft darman and 
chief of staff john sununu topped the list secretary of state 
james a baker iii predictably continues to wield heavy influence 
the proximity question has a lot to do with your influence 
said tom korologos a consultant who was close to the reagan white 
house and has ties to the new administration as well a guy can 
walk up to him in the hallway and say hey how do you feel about 
this he said that might be considered bad government but 
thats the way it works 
an administration official speaking anonymously said that in 
the bush white house compared to reagans its a much more 
difficult role for the staff because they never know just where 
they stand they never have absolute authority to do something 
because bush interjects himself so much 
in the reagan administration you could feel pretty safe to 
act at least on what things to recommend if you had a pretty good 
line on the reagan philosophy he said but with bush it the 
issue under debate could turn around at any moment 
gary bauer who was a domestic policy adviser to reagan and who 
now runs a private family research center said that reagan used 
to like for us to thoroughly discuss and air these issues without 
him and if there was a consensus bring it to him for signoff if 
there wasnt to go and debate it in front of him 
my sense is that president bush wants to be involved as much 
as he can in an issue and i think that just requires the staff to 
operate differently bauer said adding 
when i was there one sometimes got frustrated that you didnt 
have more presidential involvement early on but on the other hand 
it really gave you a chance to assert yourself and to influence 
policy maybe they the bush staff wish they had a little more 
flexibility to act before the president gets into it 
former white house political adviser mitchell daniels said that 
while bush has a strong first team of advisers like sununu darman 
and scowcroft he believes the lowerlevel aides perform 
essentially as functionaries 
the administration official said the staff is less powerful 
under bush than under reagan because bush is more engaged and is 
deciding more of the issues bush is less predictable than reagan 
hes a sort of compromiser and dowhatsright kind of person 
korologos said that while reagan ran the white house like a 
chairman of the board of a business bush operates much in the 
fashion of a corporate chief executive officer 
george bush knows this government he doesnt have to learn 
the initials and the acronyms korologos said

the energy department is sounding a suddenly 
louder alarm about the nations growing dependence on foreign oil 
yet some private and government analysts say talk of an approaching 
supply crisis may be exaggerated 
our vulnerability to oil supply disruptions is greater today 
than it was at the time of the arab oil embargo energy secretary 
james d watkins told a meeting of oil executives last week time 
is running out he said for action to avert a crisis 
watkins has begun speaking out on the issue recently as he seeks 
to galvanize public support for key bush administration energy 
goals a revival of the commercial nuclear power industry support 
for domestic oil drilling complete decontrol of natural gas prices 
and faster development of new energy technologies 
although the countrys reliance on imported oil has been growing 
since 1985 the energy department under john herrington boasted 
even in the final months of the reagan administration that us 
energy security had been strengthened 
our reliance on insecure sources of imported oil has been 
sharply reduced herrington wrote in an october 1988 report 
adding that the united states is better prepared than ever 
before for an oil supply interruption 
the commerce department in a report published two months ago 
said since 1979 us energy security has been strengthened and 
the united states is better prepared than before to deter as well 
as respond to an energy supply emergency 
a similar conclusion was drawn by the general accounting office 
the investigative arm of congress in a broad assessment of oil 
trends last august 
the united states and other major oilimporting countries are 
less vulnerable to an oil crisis today than they were a decade 
ago the gao report said 
nearly all energy analysts in and out of government agree that 
the united states is fast approaching the day when it gets more 
than half its oil from abroad most say this carries increased 
risk but some dispute watkins assertion that the trend makes it 
more likely the nation will face a supply crisis 
it is just as meaningless to claim that we are moving 
inevitably toward another oil supply crisis as it is to say it 
cant happen again john lichtblau executive director of the 
petroleum industry research foundation told a house energy and 
commerce subcommittee last week 
the mere fact that our imports are rising does not per se 
increase the probability of another foreign supply disruption he 
said 
in the first three months of this year oil imports averaged 44 
percent of total us supplies that is up from an average last 
year of 37 percent and the recent low point of 27 percent in 1985 
before oil prices crashed according to energy department figures 
in 1973 the year key arab producers embargoed oil shipments to 
the united states to protest us support for israel us imports 
were 35 percent of total supplies in 1977 imports peaked at a 
record 465 percent of supplies 
and while the share of us oil supplies originating in arab 
countries also has been rising reaching 106 percent last year 
according to the department it is less than the proportion 
supplied by nonarab producers nonarab foreign oil accounted for 
264 percent of us supplies last year up from 243 percent in 
1985 
analysts expect the import trend to continue as production from 
us wells declines 
lichtblau said last months massive exxon oil spill in alaska 
showed there are risks to consider even in the domestic supply 
system a brief interruption of shipments from the transalaska 
pipeline system as a result of the spill helped trigger a temporary 
but sharp jump in gasoline prices across the country 
watkins in a view shared by the oil industry says overcoming 
environmental concerns about new oil development in alaska is a 
vital step toward reducing us dependence on foreign oil and 
lessening the risks of a supply crisis 
he has struck a similar note in the departments battle to stop 
new york gov mario cuomo from carrying out a plan to scrap the 
shoreham nuclear power plant on long island federal regulators 
last thursday approved a fullpower license for the plant but 
cuomo and the plants owner have struck a deal under which it would 
be dismantled before ever producing a single kilowatt of power for 
sale 
shoreham reduces our potential vulnerability to insecure 
imports watkins said 
lichtblau and others say the key link in the nations defense 
against an oil supply disruption is the strategic petroleum 
reserve the governments underground stockpile of crude oil that 
now totals 566 billion barrels equal to nearly three months of 
imports the government is continuing to add to the reserve 
another factor working in the favor of oilimporting countries 
is a trend toward less reliance by middle east producers on 
shipments through the strait of hormuz a narrow passage that iran 
several times has threatened to close iraq and saudi arabia have 
been building overland pipelines to the red sea and the 
mediterranean in order to reduce their vulnerability to a cutoff of 
persian gulf shipping

when george bush coined the phrase kinder gentler nation 
he likely didnt know it would catch on and on and on and on 
in detroit new road signs admonish motorists to be kinder 
gentler safer drivers in windsor ontario a strip joint 
advertises itself as a kinder gentler adult entertainment 
center 
two weeks ago in phoenix one year after he was impeached for 
misusing funds and obstructing justice former gov evan mecham 
vowed to run again and lead a kindler gentler arizona 
and in south carolina plumber curt whisennant has erected a 
billboard on us 1 in columbia advertising his abcoe plumbing co 
as a kinder gentler plumbing company 
that may not have been what the nowpresident bush had in mind 
when candidate bush first used the phrase in his acceptance speech 
at the republican national convention last august 
the kinder and gentler saying and bushs thousand points 
of light remark frequently have been lampooned by cartoonists and 
others who have poked fun at the attempt at presidential poetry 
but the phrase isnt without fans 
i think its probably going to be more successful than 
wheres the beef said charlie claggett chief creative officer 
for the advertising agency darcy masius benton amp bowles in st 
louis 
wheres the beef was the wendys hamburger restaurant slogan 
coopted during a 1984 presidential candidate debate by walter 
mondale against fellow democratic hopeful gary hart 
the trend today is toward neotraditional values when bush 
made that speech i thought my god this man is reading the same 
research we are and of course he is claggett said 
even so claggett said i wouldnt dare go over to 
anheuserbusch and suggest they advertise a kinder gentler beer 
how kind and gentle can we be anyway 
the phrase meets a desperate human need at a time when you can 
step out of your house in washington dc and get shot down by 
cocaine sellers said ray browne head of the popular culture 
department at bowling green state university in ohio 
were looking for something to save us from ourselves 
browne said its a madison avenue phrase i dont know who 
cooked it up but its tremendous 
it was bushs idea said bj cooper deputy white house press 
secretary 
it seemed to capture the kind of tone he wanted for his 
presidency cooper said hes often joked about it but 
hes also very welldefined what those two phrases are supposed to 
mean 
thats nonsense said browne 
this is more than a rhetorical honeymoon its a deliberate 
attempt to grab an element of human emotion and exploit it he 
said conceding i dont know what it means 
jack mariutce executive creative director for ddb needham 
worldwide in new york city agreed slogans like this are like 
chinese food theyre good but they leave you hungry for something 
with more substance later 
hungry or not the phrase is finding varying degrees of usage in 
serious matters 
in february us attorney general dick thornburgh vowed to take 
a rougher tougher attitude toward violent drug traffickers to 
achieve bushs goal of a kinder gentler america 
and in new orleans this month students at tulane and loyola 
universities wrote bush that their attempts to rescue nine monkeys 
from a primate research center were their contributions to a 
kinder gentler nation 
when arizonas republican party passed a resolution last year 
declaring the united states a christian nation house minority 
leader art hamilton said republicans probably misunderstood bush 
and thought he had called for a kinder more gentile nation 
others however insist that kinder and gentler is 
completely overworked and should be avoided as the worst of cliches 
the phrase has been nominated for next years dishonour list of 
words banished from the english language compiled annually at lake 
superior state university in sault ste marie mich spokesman 
bill crawford said bushs read my lips quote made the 1989 
list 
id say its got a good shot at making the list because one 
of the criteria is overuse crawford said

lane kirkland sees the sanctification of 
greed he attributes to the reagan years beginning to crumble 
bringing favorable winds to the sails of the movement he often 
refers to as a ship 
i think there is perhaps the beginning of some change in 
climate the aflcio president said in an interview last week 
weve been beating against some fairly strong winds but i think 
the ship is sound and seaworthy and winds change 
his is a view cautiously shared by other labor leaders who in 
recent weeks have found themselves awash with good news a rare 
tiding in a decade the american labor movement would prefer to 
forget 
few labor leaders expect a sudden turnaround of the decline of 
the 1980s during which membership in unions has dropped by 3 
million to 17 million and the percentage of workers who are union 
members dropped from 23 percent in 1980 to 168 percent last year 
but many believe the passing of the reagan administration and 
labors recent high profile may help unions halt their slide and 
improve their public standing 
i think the american people are listening to what we are 
saying and yes i think things are progressing united auto 
workers president owen bieber said 
but kirkland cautions against reading too much into recent 
developments 
we of course swim in a sea of public opinion that helps us and 
hurts us and is valuable but i do not think that we can rely upon 
external trends or perceptions or fortunes to build the labor 
movement he said our strength comes from within 
still its hard not to notice labors presence these days 
eastern airlines has been virtually grounded for two months by a 
machinists strike that in itself has buoyed the labor movement 
because of overwhelming solidarity among traditionally fractious 
airline unions a harris poll released last week found that 60 
percent of respondents supported the strikers 
the laborbacked effort to raise the minimum wage has become the 
first domestic policy showdown between congress and president bush 
with polls showing public opinion squarely behind efforts to end 
the nineyear freeze in the floor wage 
unions are feeling better at the bargaining table as well 
two unions representing more than a halfmillion 
telecommunications workers at atampt and regional telephone companies 
are engaged in the largest round of collective bargaining this 
year national steelindustry contract talks are under way and 
labor last week won a national labor relations board ruling 
expected to help unions organize the growing health care work force 
also the teamsters recently settled a racketeering suit with 
the government bringing fresh negative reports about alleged mob 
influence on the union but promises for reform as well the 
settlement averted what would have been a lengthy trial likely to 
tarnish labors image regardless of its outcome 
there is more to come 
the minimum wage is just the first priority on a lengthy labor 
agenda that also includes proposals for parental leave child care 
health care curbs on mergers and buyouts and workersafety issues 
most of these are safe issues those with public support 
on tap for april 28 is a nationwide workers memorial day 
during which unions will stage events in 17 states and the district 
of columbia to highlight workplace hazards 
and labors considerable political war chest will be directed in 
the next two years on state races for governorships and 
legislative seats in hopes of gaining powerful influence on the 
redistricting that will follow the 1990 census 
the labor movement even is picking up its belated efforts to 
join the tv age seeking to foster good will with ad campaigns 
including a new auto workers series questioning the longterm 
effects of mergers and moving jobs overseas 
the ads make a pitch for patriotism and recount americas 
industrial heydays 
we wanted to show that what were really concerned about is 
not just our own wellbeing but the wellbeing of our country 
said bieber 
in addition the aflcio is reviving its union yes 
television campaign this month spots in which a handful of 
entertainers promote union membership 
whether the high profile will result in substantive gains for 
labor is anybodys guess 
but kirkland has no illusions of troublefree days ahead 
regardless of whether labor gains from its recent prominence 
ups and downs have happened all throughout our history and 
will in the future im sure he said weve learned to live 
with that

americas auto workers are taking on wall 
street and corporate power brokers with a new advertising campaign 
attacking mergermania and movement of jobs oversees 
theres another obvious but unstated goal as well to foster 
good will toward unions 
american business should put americas future first is the 
title of the 4 million campaign begun this month by the united 
auto workers in an effort to sway public opinion in favor of 
laborbacked efforts to curb mergers and acquisitions 
the campaign comes at a time when the labor movement has an 
unusually high profile because of a number of recent events 
including the eastern airlines strike and laborbacked efforts to 
raise the minimum wage 
but theres no mention of the word union in the text of the 
tv ads although labors union yes logo appears on the final 
frame 
instead the uaw makes a pitch to patriotism with newsreel 
footage of products manufactured in the united states in the past 
40 years as well as shots of auto workers on an assembly line 
producing quality products has always been one of our nations 
great strengths the narrator says in one ad as viewers get a 
glimpse of 1950s clock radios televisions and refrigerators our 
auto industry put this country on wheels american pioneered the 
electronic age our computer technology brought us a whole new 
world of information 
the picture then shifts to a frantic floor session on wall 
street as the narrator continues 
but in the 80s some of the bestknown products of american 
business have been takeovers junk bonds and making money by moving 
money lets turn it around we need to put americas future 
first 
in the second spot two uaw engine assemblers talk of quality 
products and goodpaying jobs before the camera turns to uaw 
president owen bieber 
but some corporations are putting shortterm profits ahead of 
longterm strength bieber says moving jobs overseas mergers 
and takeovers that are unproductive they dont help build america 
investing and training in topnotch facilities thats good for all 
of us 
a related print ad campaign features corporate executives 
surrounding a craps table and betting company assets 
the tv spots are running in two dozen markets primarily where 
uaw workers are concentrated but also in washington new york 
chicago and los angeles and nationally on several cable channels 
the print ads are to run in a variety of newspapers magazines 
and business journals

the death of an executive in a plane crash and 
the discovery of dead canaries at a lawyers home have added a 
strange twist to a federal taxfraud investigation of southern co 
a big southeast utility 
a grand jury is investigating allegations that gulf power co a 
southern subsidiary forced suppliers to make campaign 
contributions to a variety of florida politicians 
the utility allegedly reimbursed the suppliers and covered the 
payments with inflated or bogus invoices according to recent 
published reports that quoted grand jury witnesses 
the investigation began after an accountant for georgia power 
co another southern subsidiary told the internal revenue service 
last year that the utility may have accounted improperly for spare 
parts the securities and exchange commission also is investigating 
now the grand jury has widened its inquiry to include the april 
10 plane crash that killed three 
among the victims was jake horton a gulf power executive who 
had just been told by his employers that he might be disciplined 
for accounting irregularities investigators havent determined the 
cause of the crash but one witness said the grand jury asked him 
about the possibility of sabotage or suicide 
any allegations that what were doing was related to the air 
crash we would certainly be concerned with said us attorney 
robert l barr jr whose office is conducting the investigation in 
atlanta 
barr also indicated there may be ties between the grand jury 
probe and the discovery of dead canaries at the homes and office of 
fred levin a pensacola fla lawyer who has worked for gulf power 
levin had met with horton recently the executive believed he 
had been targeted for indictment and told levin he wanted to clear 
his name according to levin 
barr wouldnt say whether the grand jury had been investigating 
horton before the crash 
atlantabased southern co brings electricity to 11 million 
customers through five subsidiaries in four southeast states its 
revenues last year were 21 billion 
horton was senior vice president of pensacolabased gulf power 
he and two company pilots were killed when the plane crashed into a 
pensacola apartment complex 90 seconds after taking off for atlanta 
allan r barton president of mississippi power co another 
southern subsidiary said the grand jury asked him last week if 
sabotage or suicide could have been involved barton said he didnt 
have any clues 
the national transportation safety board said flight tapes show 
that a fire broke out in the cockpit before the crash but no cause 
has been established 
we have not uncovered anything that would indicate any type of 
sabotage so far said ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
nevertheless the fbi is checking for any sign of criminal intent 
he said 
shortly before boarding the plane horton had met with gulf 
power president doug mccrary and dr reed bell chairman of its 
audit committee 
the meeting was held to discuss concern over mr hortons 
possible circumvention of company policies and procedures and his 
supervision of processing of invoices from vendors southern co 
said in a statement 
the audit committee recommended horton be fired or suspended 
but no action was taken at the meeting the company said 
last week canaries with broken necks turned up outside the 
office and two homes of levin 
i dont know what else ive done to deserve a dead canary 
levin told atlantas wsbtv i am deeply deeply concerned and i 
dont even stay at home now 
carter haynes a gulf power spokesman said levins firm had 
represented the utility for about five years in personal injury 
cases haynes said he could recall no recent case that might have 
inspired someone to leave a dead canary as a warning to levin 
authorities havent established a motive and have no suspect on 
the canaries said ray barnes special operations supervisor at the 
escambia county fla sheriffs office

a missouri abortionregulation dispute in 
which the supreme court will hear arguments wednesday has generated 
the most friendofthecourt briefs ever submitted in one case 
the justices are being asked to use the missouri case to 
overturn or substantially limit its 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion 
the landmark roe vs wade decision based on a womans 
constitutional right to privacy said a womans decision to have an 
abortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to 
her and her doctor 
the court said states may interfere in the abortion decision 
during the second trimester only to protect the womans health and 
may take steps only to protect fetal life in the third trimester 
when the fetus can survive outside the womb 
state authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester 
was not made absolute however 
a federal appeals court relying on roe vs wade struck down as 
unconstitutional five key provisions of the missouri law now under 
scrutiny 
a ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for 
performing abortions not necessary to save a womans life 
a ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or 
assisting an abortion 
a ban on using taxpayer money for encouraging or counseling 
women to have abortions 
a requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus reasonably 
believed to be older than 19 weeks is viable capable of surviving 
outside the womb by determining lung maturity and other testing 
a declaration that the life of each human begins at 
conception 
here are excerpts of some of the arguments raised in 
friendofthecourt briefs submitted to the justices in all the 
court received 45 such briefs supporting the missouri law and 33 
briefs opposing it

from the bush administration roe vs wade as the court is 
well aware has been intensely controversial from the day it was 
decided that controversy is more than simply a reflection of the 
deep divisions in american society over the underlying question of 
abortion rather the controversy has in substantial measure been 
a product of the decision itself 
roe rests on assumptions that are not firmly grounded in the 
constitution it adopts an unworkable framework tying permissible 
state regulation of abortion to particular periods in pregnancy 
and it has allowed courts to usurp the function of legislative 
bodies in weighing competing social ethical and scientific factors 
in reaching a judgment as to how much state regulation is 
appropriate in this sensitive area 
from the international right to life federation in most 
nations of the world abortion policy has not been the subject of 
constitutional intervention by a high court remaining determined 
by a wide variety of legislative schemes the democratic 
compromises reached in developed western nations are significantly 
more protective of fetal life than is roe vs wade 
from the american collegians for life and the catholic league 
for religious and civil rights under roe the states have an 
important and legitimate interest in protecting fetal life from 
conception until birth which interest becomes compelling at 
viability 
if the states interest in the protection of fetal life 
becomes compelling at viability it necessarily follows that the 
states possess the ability to require that the point of viability 
be determined if the compelling nature of a states interest in 
unborn human life is to be anything more than illusory then 
roe and its progeny should be read to permit those states desiring 
to protect fetal life to require a physician to make a 
determination consistent with sound medical practice as to 
viability 
from the national right to life committee abortion 
jurisprudence needs resolution after 16 years of turmoil this 
court attempted to resolve the matter in 1973 time has proven the 
effort a failure this court is now confronted with the opportunity 
to restore a proper interpretation to the constitution returning 
this volatile matter of social policy to the proper fora the 
state legislatures 
from feminists for life there is ample evidence in the 
medical studies and public health statistics cited herein that the 
unfettered right of abortion on demand foisted upon our society by 
the court and by abortion advocates is a public health disaster the 
proportion of which we are just beginning to uncover 
from focus on family and the family research council of 
america changes in understanding and medical science will always 
outpace the courts ability to respond when this courts 
precedents are rooted in science and not in the constitution as 
was roes trimester framework science is pitted against precedent 
and the prestige of this honorable institution suffers 
this court can best protect the interests of our citizens by 
abandoning the trimester approach as outmoded unscientific and 
constitutionally unworkable and by recognizing that the states 
have legitimate interests existing throughout pregnancy in 
protecting the life of the mother and the unborn child 
from the us catholic conference if the court seriously 
seeks support for abortion decisions in the historical line of 
privacy cases it must reflect accurately that one persons 
liberty is not license to control even ones own body where 
anothers interest could suffer or the common good be diminished 
from the southern baptist convention the national association 
of evangelists the lutheran churchmissouri synod and the 
christian life commission it has been argued that state laws 
prohibiting abortion unconstitutionally impose the religious 
beliefs and views of one religion upon persons not adhering to 
those views thereby constituting an establishment of religion 
prohibited by the first amendment 
we do not advocate the imposition of our religious views by 
law in order to impose on others our religious beliefs rather 
those religious beliefs are deeply seated in the moral and 
ethical system that forms the basis of much of the civil and 
criminal law of this nation the fact that a states law 
coincides with a deeply held religious belief does not render that 
law unconstitutional under the first amendment

from the american medical association and other medical groups 
this court has observed that viability is usually placed at about 
seven months 28 weeks but may occur earlier even at 24 weeks 
since the improvements in health care have resulted in greater 
survival of infants born at a gestational age of 2428 weeks 
the earliest point at which a fetus can survive is 2324 weeks 
thus while substantial strides have occurred in saving 
infants born between 24 and 28 weeks the earliest point at which 
an infant can survive has changed little 
what the court found in 1973 is even more true today the 
medical risks to a woman of childbirth are greater than the risks 
of abortion 
from 167 scientists and physicians including 11 nobel 
laureates there is no scientific consensus that a human life 
begins at conception at a given stage of fetal development or at 
birth the question of when a human life begins cannot be 
answered by reference to scientific principles like those with 
which we predict planetary movement the answer to that question 
will depend on each individuals social religious philosophical 
ethical and moral beliefs and values 
assertions that viability has moved significantly earlier in 
fetal development are flatly contrary to the scientific evidence 
although advances in technology have improved the chances of 
survival of premature birth within the range of 24 to 28 weeks the 
outer limit of viability at 24 weeks has not significantly changed 
roe vs wade has not been rendered obsolete by subsequent 
advancements in science 
from the american psychological association five major 
reviews of the psychological and psychiatric literature published 
between 1975 and 1989 all confirm that for the overwhelming 
majority of women who undergo abortion there are no longterm 
negative emotional effects 
when women experience regret depression or guilt such 
feelings are mild and diminish rapidly without adversely affecting 
general functioning severe emotional responses are rare even in 
young women to the contrary the great majority of women who have 
had an abortion express feelings of relief 
from the national association of public hospitals through 
its restrictions on the use of public facilities for the purpose of 
performing or assisting an abortion and on the use of public funds 
for the purpose of encouraging or counseling an abortion 
missouri has intruded deeply into the physicianpatient 
relationship 
missouris restriction has the effect of prohibiting 
constitutionally protected conduct and it is therefore 
unconstitutional 
from women about 3000 who have had abortions a compendium 
filed by the national organization for womens legal defense and 
education fund and the national abortion rights action league 
womens privacy and liberty interests would be substantially 
infringed upon by the provisions of the missouri statute at issue 
the option of abortion is fundamental to womens lives liberty 
and their pursuit of happiness 
from 281 american historians at the time the federal 
constitution was adopted abortion was known and not illegal 
abortion was not uncommon in colonial america 
a presumed interest in protecting fetal life does not justify 
denying women their historic liberty to choose abortion

republican craig thomas who claims hes 
the rightful heir to former rep dick cheney has built momentum in 
the final days of his race against democrat john vinich for 
wyomings lone house seat 
officials of both campaigns say their polls show thomas has 
pulled even or slightly ahead of vinich voters on wednesday will 
select a successor to cheney who resigned to become defense 
secretary 
the two are vying to represent the nations least populous 
state but the contests importance is far greater than the number 
of voters suggests 
the gop is seeking to rebound from defeats in two special house 
races in indiana and alabama during the past month most 
embarrassing was the loss of vice president dan quayles old house 
seat in indiana to democrat jill long last month 
republicans have put money and manpower behind thomas including 
visits by sens bob dole of kansas and alan simpson of wyoming but 
vinich has been quick to criticize the gop effort suggesting that 
thomas wasnt running his own campaign 
thomas a 55yearold state representative who lost two races 
for state treasurer has criticized vinich as a liberal dependent 
on support from organized labor the aflcio is backing the 
democrat 
the election will demonstrate whether or not we want to 
continue to have the kind of moderate conservative representation 
that we had with dick cheney and we have with our senators or 
whether we want to take a rather marked change of philosophy 
thomas said 
vinich 38 is bidding to become the states first democrat to 
sit in congress since cheney replaced teno roncalio in 1978 vinich 
entered the race with better name recognition the state senator 
fell just 1322 votes short of upsetting republican sen malcolm 
wallop last fall 
vinich said he would be more able to instruct the democratic 
majority in the house on wyoming concerns he claimed he has been 
promised a seat on the house agriculture committee if he wins 
thomas said he had been guaranteed a seat on the interior 
committee

navy investigators will be looking at all 
possibilities of human or mechanical error in their effort to 
determine what caused the explosion that killed 47 aboard the 
battleship uss iowa officials say 
it could take months before the probe is completed and the 
results released publicly navy spokesman lt cmdr alan dooley 
said sunday 
a sevenmember team of investigators boarded the battleship a 
day after the explosion flashed through the iowas no 2 gun turret 
on wednesday 
theyre looking at any evidence of human error or mechanical 
error or anything technical said lt janet mescus a 
spokeswoman at the navys information center at norfolk va the 
ships home port the iowa returned to norfolk on sunday 
theyre moving as quickly as they can lt mescus said but 
added they want to be thorough and that takes time 
dooley said the investigation would be fairly complex 
because there were no witnesses there were 11 survivors inside the 
turret all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ships 
magazines the navy said 
dooley said no information would be released until the probe is 
completed and the navy has refused to speculate on the cause of 
the explosion which damaged only the inside of the turret 
but the new york times reported sunday that navy teams who 
entered the turret immediately after the blast found the no 2 
guns breech open and undamaged with the practice projectile that 
the gun was to have fired still there 
the times cited unidentified sources as saying this indicated 
the explosion occurred while the bags containing 550 pounds of 
propellant powder were still being loaded into the gun 
navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the 
bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun the 
newspaper said they said flame and hot gases from the blast went 
down the hoist to the lowest deck if the transfer of powder to the 
guns had been complete the hoist would have been sealed off 
the navy on sunday released an amateur videotape of the 
explosion which was made by an officer on the bridge of the iowa 
who wanted to record the firing of the guns 
the investigation team is headed by rear adm richard d 
milligan former commanding officer of the battleship uss new 
jersey and it also includes experts on gunnery and weapons

defense secretary dick cheney is calling for 
cuts in proposed star wars spending and a delay in the b2 stealth 
bomber to meet the 2992 billion pentagon budget the bush 
administration and congressional leaders have agreed upon 
cheney in a television interview on sunday also said president 
bush has decided to move ahead with two kinds of mobile strategic 
missiles combining the mx and the midgetman missiles in the 
nations defense 
the defense secretary is scheduled to appear before congress on 
tuesday to detail the cuts 
bush decided to cut spending on star wars formally known as the 
strategic defense initiative or sdi to 46 billion for fiscal 
year 1990 down from the 59 billion proposed by president reagan 
over the next five years bush would spend 33 billion on sdi 
compared to reagans proposed 40 billion 
cheney said the president will shift the focus of sdi from 
deployment sometime in the 1990s to research on a more advanced 
system known as brilliant pebbles consisting of thousands of 
orbiting satellites 
sdi is alive and well but like everything else it has to fit 
into a reduced budget cheney said on nbctvs meet the press 
program 
bush turned down cheneys recommendation to move the nations 50 
mx missiles with 10warheads apiece from silos to deployment on 
railroad cars rather than develop a singlewarhead missile to be 
based on trucks 
the singlewarhead missile is backed by national security 
adviser brent scowcroft and the chairmen of the senate and house 
armed services committees sen sam nunn dga and rep les 
aspin dwis 
what i recommended to the president was that we go forward 
with the railgarrison system brent scowcroft recommended we go 
forward with the small icbm the president basically said try to 
do both cheney said 
but instead of doing both simultaneously we will try to 
sequence them that is we will do rail garrison first try to put 
a little bit of money in the budget next year for the small icbm 
and then as we get the rail garrison deployed we will start to 
ramp up on the small icbm he said 
the small icbm known as the midgetman ultimately would cost 
24 billion for 500 warheads versus 54 billion for the same 
number of warheads aboard the railmobile mx according to recent 
congressional estimates 
the defense secretary said he had decided to delay work for one 
year on another strategic weapon the stealth bomber designed to 
elude enemy targeting radar original plans called for 132 of 
stealth bombers and recent reports have estimated the cost at 500 
million apiece making it the costliest us warplane ever 
were going to postpone actually going into full procurement 
on it because im not comfortable with the program yet there are a 
lot of technical problems with it and it is extremely expensive 
he said 
turning to the navy cheney said the administration plans to 
keep all four world war ii vintage battleships in the fleet despite 
an explosion last week aboard one of them the uss iowa that 
killed 47 sailors 
he said investigators have not yet determined what caused one of 
the 16inch guns on the middle turret of the iowa to explode last 
wednesday but the event did not shake his support for keeping 
battleships in the fleet 
it may be a matter of several months before we have all the 
details said cheney but we will do our best to get to the 
bottom of it and find out exactly what did happen 
the defense secretary said the battleships brought out of 
retirement by reagan during his military buildup would be used as 
surrogates for aircraft carriers which he has decided to cut from 
the 15 envisioned by reagan to 14 by retiring older ones as new 
models enter service

in central washingtons yakima valley 
where fruit trees bloom in blazing sunshine fear has taken root 
because of an outbreak of a contagious disease that has killed six 
people this year 
twenty people including four infants have become ill with 
meningococcal bacteria which can lead to meningitis and other 
illnesses 
doctors are swamped firefighters worried about giving 
mouthtomouth resuscitation parents pulled their children out of 
preschools and about 18000 people have been vaccinated 
the greatest worry is that there is no effective vaccine 
therefore no protection for children under age 1 
in wapato a poor town of 3300 on the yakima indian 
reservation two infants have died and three children have become 
sick from the disease 
the group of people dying and being hospitalized is the group 
we cant do anything for said fire chief tom kehm who has 
helped set up emergency vaccination clinics they can do 
nothing 
the bacteria has mostly struck poor hispanics and american 
indians living in crowded unsanitary conditions 
it is carried in the nose and throat and is passed through 
sneezing and other secretions from the nose and mouth it is not 
considered highly contagious 
however stopping the spread has been difficult because carriers 
older than age 25 usually do not become ill but can transmit the 
disease to children 
the outbreak appeared to be over in midmarch when there were 
no new cases reported for about two weeks prompting yakima county 
health district director dr bob atwood to cautiously predict it 
had run its course 
but a 4monthold wapato infant died on march 24 sparking a new 
round of mass vaccinations 
three weeks passed without a new case but the 19th case a 
5monthold wapato girl was diagnosed april 13 renewing fears 
and frustrating medical workers 
and on friday health officers in nearby franklin county 
announced that a 5monthold boy who had been hospitalized and 
released was confirmed as the outbreaks 20th case the boy had 
moved from yakima on april 14 the day before he became ill said 
dr larry jecha county health officer 
atwood is no longer willing to predict when the outbreak will be 
over 
but the federal centers for disease control in atlanta which 
has been monitoring the outbreak believes it may be winding down 
dr jay wenger of cdcs meningitis center said meningococcal 
disease typically fades away with a few sporadic cases 
the yakima outbreak started with two cases in january exploded 
with 12 in february followed by four in march and two so far in 
april 
thats sort of a classical wind down wenger said 
the disease is most common in poor african countries like chad 
sudan and ethiopia where wenger said epidemics sicken people at a 
rate of 500 per 100000 population 
in this country there are about 3000 cases and 300 deaths each 
year 
meningococcus has been an unpredictable disease since it was 
first described in switzerland in 1805 cases have been rising 
steadily in the united states up from 1476 in 1978 to more than 
3000 per year now 
wenger said the cdc does not rank clusters because of the 
difficulty in defining which cases are definitely related 
but the yakima outbreak may be the largest per capita since a 
197576 cluster in nearby seattle made more than 40 people sick 
mostly american indians and skid road bums wenger said 
yakima pediatric associates whose doctors have cared for many 
of the stricken has received up to 1000 calls per day from 
anxious parents in recent weeks said dr bruce hudson 
people are quicker to bring in their children he said because 
the disease symptoms are similar to a common cold it starts with a 
fever and progresses to vomiting lethargy stiff neck and 
irritability there is also a purple rash 
kehm said firefighters in wapato worried about giving 
mouthtomouth resuscitation until they learned the protective mask 
they use to prevent aids contraction also protects them from 
meningococcus

gasoline pump prices rose nearly a nickel a 
gallon nationwide to their highest levels since 1986 because of the 
alaskan oil spill and other supply constraints an industry analyst 
said 
prices are likely to continue rising in coming weeks because of 
the supply pinch and the seasonal increase in driving said trilby 
lundberg 
the latest lundberg survey of 12000 gas stations found overall 
prices rose an average 486 cents to 11544 per gallon from april 
8 to april 21 that was the highest price since early 1986 ms 
lundberg said 
the increases reflect higher wholesale costs caused by the spill 
from the exxon valdez a drop in opec production a fire at a 
northern california refinery and higher federal cleanair standards 
for fuel she said 
the latest jump followed a 10centsagallon increase two weeks 
ago in the immediate aftermath of the oil spill 
selfservice prices on april 21 were 10602 for regular 
unleaded 12086 for premium unleaded and 10476 for regular 
leaded fullservice prices were 13147 for regular unleaded 
14279 for premium unleaded and 12837 for regular leaded 
according to the survey

joe clay the school bus driver who was rediscovered three years 
ago by european teenagers craving 50s rock n roll 
eight european concert tours later clay also known as cj 
cheramie to his neighbors and the students and teachers on his bus 
routes is looking at the possibility of a movie of his life and 
maybe a book 
a oneyear option on his life story was bought recently by fries

he went to new york but grew frustrated with a career that 
wasnt moving and a manager who wouldnt give it a push 
he came home worked in a band and 15 years ago began driving 
the bus 
then in 1986 an english music promoter found him at his modest 
twostory house in a new orleans suburb and sent him on a concert 
tour to england holland and sweden it was a trip to success such 
as clay had never known 
its hard to come home and explain what happens to me over 
there he said i really become joe clay i really stay on the 
clouds im on a natural high 
he recently resigned from his busdriving job because finding a 
substitute while he was on tour had become a problem

more than a century after frontier 
indian wars ceased on the plains and valleys of montana native 
americans are embroiled in a new battle for independence against 
the federal government 
on the rocky boys indian reservation in northcentral montana a 
tribal prosecutor has filed criminal charges against the chief 
agent of the bureau of indian affairs accusing him of interfering 
in tribal affairs by threatening not to recognize an elected tribal 
government 
the case has implications nationwide for indian tribes power to 
control their own governments and reservations 
my whole idea in this thing was how much authority does this 
guy have said chippewacree tribal prosecutor jim morsette 
this is a problem not only in rocky boy but on all the 
reservations 
the federal government responded by suing morsette a tribal 
councilman and the chief tribal judge in federal court 
the government acknowledges indian reservations are sovereign 
territory but it claims tribal courts have no jurisdiction over 
bia personnel performing official duties 
us district judge paul hatfield of great falls should decide 
the issue later this year 
most tribes have their own constitutions and laws approved by 
the federal government 
yet many tribal programs on reservations law enforcement 
schools road maintenance welfare are operated under contract 
with the bia which provides the money and acts as overseer the 
agency also has the power to revoke contracts and run programs 
itself 
when its not operating the way its supposed to we step in 
and take over said richard whitesell the bureaus area director 
in billings 
on poorer reservations like rocky boys where unemployment runs 
at about 75 percent among 2400 resident tribal members federal 
money is the main source of employment and income and the bureaus 
authority carries clout 
despite the bureaus often pervasive role in tribal affairs its 
stated goal is to help the tribes become more independent morsette 
and his allies say that isnt happening on the rocky boys 
reservation 
their complaints center on rocky boys bia superintendent ken 
davis 
on jan 9 morsette charged davis in tribal court with three 
misdemeanors obstructing justice cruelty to animals and contempt 
of court 
davis refused to appear in court saying it had no jurisdiction 
over him as a bureau employee chief tribal judge russell standing 
rock issued an arrest warrant but a federal judge agreed to a 
government request and blocked the charges until the jurisdictional 
question is settled 
the contemptofcourt charge is the most significant it accuses 
davis of interfering with a tribal court order involving alleged 
voting fraud in a june 1988 tribal election 
davis told a tribal election official the bureau might not 
recognize the tribal government elected under the court order 
according to court records without the bureaus recognition a 
tribe could lose its contracts 
morsette said davis comments were improper and illegal and 
portrayed an outdated paternalistic attitude toward indians 
its the attitude that the bia has always had we know whats 
best for you youre still our indians morsette said 
well our constitution is for us to interpret in our court 
davis and government attorneys maintain he was merely performing 
his job as adviser to the tribe and is therefore immune from legal 
action by the tribe 
he said there are some problems i see i recognize your 
authority to resolve them but you need to get them resolved 
said roger w thomas an interior department attorney 
the pursuit of criminal charges in tribal court against a bia 
superintendent appears unique but the government argues that the 
matter is a civil case federal courts have ruled in previous civil 
cases that tribal courts have no jurisdiction over federal 
employees acting in official capacity 
morsette and standing rock are paying their legal fees without 
support from the tribal council they say it will be tough to win 
against the government and all its resources but add that the case 
is too important to drop because of its implications for tribal 
independence 
im kind of bullheaded this way but i have always stressed to 
my people that were the boss the indians the tribe said 
standing rock we tell the bia what to do

before his death he was in town long enough to see what opened as 
the abbott house in 1874 transformed into the cominos 
the hotel declined in the 1950s and began a steep slide in the 
1960s it closed in the early 1980s and now belongs to the city 
this is the most significant landmark in town said gary 
breschini an archaeologist he said preservationists are willing 
to allow most of the hotel to be razed if the original part the 
abbott is restored they estimate the cost at 500000 
officials however said it would cost about 35 million money 
that should go to projects more vital to the growing city 
a redevelopment plan calls for replacing the hotel with a 
parking lot an office building and a steinbeck museum behind a 
facade depicting the original hotel 
the citys decision stirred memories of a brillant writer who 
became hated by his own neighbors because of his defense of migrant 
farm workers 
steinbeck was not liked in this town said brusa president 
of the monterey county historical society they did not 
understand him they burned the grapes of wrath here 
this year is the 50th anniversary of the the grapes of 
wrath the pulitzer prizewinning novel that was once banned in 
the salinas library

a jumbo jet and a commuter plane flew about 100 
feet apart as they approached kennedy international airport and 45 
minutes later a jetliner reported coming within 400 yards of a 
private plane 
no injuries were reported in either incident sunday and federal 
aviation administration spokeswoman kathleen bergen said they were 
totally unrelated and happened miles and miles apart 
also sunday a piedmont airlines jet was evacuated at 
fayetteville nc regional airport when the crew noticed smoke 
inside the plane two of its 76 passengers were injured during the 
evacuation officials said 
the first near miss involved a small turboprop commuter plane 
and a boeing 747 bergen said 
twa flight 701 from london was flying at 1900 feet about five 
miles southeast of kennedy when the pilot reported that a pocono 
airline plane had passed about 100 feet above and to the right 
bergen said 
both planes were being monitored by air traffic controllers and 
preparing to land at kennedy she said 
the pocono pilot had been instructed to land after the twa 
plane which was scheduled behind an air france jetliner she said 
the air france jet had just landed when the pocono plane flew by 
the twa jet bergen said 
bergen said the twa pilot did not take evasive action the 
pocono merlin sw4 was ordered to abort its landing so the twa 
flight could land first 
bergen did not know where pocono flight 7636 originated and 
there was no answer sunday night at the airlines new york office 
the other near miss occurred near westchester county airport and 
involved a pan am jet flying laguardia airport to boston and a 
small cessna plane bergen said 
the pan am boeing 727 had been cleared by air controllers to 
climb to 17000 feet and had just passed 10000 feet when the 
captain reported that the cessna was 400 yards away and had a 
vertical separation of 200 feet said bergen 
the pan am plane turned and climbed in the opposite direction to 
avoid the cessna 414 bergen said 
she said the captains reports will be studied along with tapes 
and other materials to determine who erred she said officials have 
the cessnas registration number and have determined the plane was 
headed for bedford pa it was not under the direction of the 
traffic controllers 
bergen said she did not know how many people were aboard the 
planes in the two incidents 
in fayetteville the piedmont jetliner left the terminal then 
made an abrupt stop a passenger said dave shipley spokesman for 
usair group inc which owns piedmont said a crew member informed 
the pilot of smoke in the passenger compartment 
shipley said the smoke came from smoldering loose oil in the 
planes duct system near an auxiliary power unit mounted in the 
tail section heat from the unit may have caused the oil to 
smolder he said 
there was no fire but there was some smoke coming out of 
it shipley said the smoke intensified enough that he felt it 
was prudent to stop the airplane and disembark the passengers down 
the evacuation chute 
the boeing 727200 was headed to pittsburgh 
one passenger suffered broken bones in his back and another 
complained of chest pains and lower back pains said relatives and 
officials 
shipley said three chutes were used and that one of them was 
deflated after it was punctured by a sharp object carried by a 
passenger

a black minister stepped down after 
church members relentless attacks for his hiring of a white former 
sheriff acquitted in the slaying of three civil rights workers 25 
years ago 
for his last sermon at golden grove missionary baptist church in 
meehan the rev evan e mcdonald chose the topics of gods love 
and forgiveness qualities he said he showed in hiring former 
neshoba county sheriff lawrence rainey as a guard in his meridian 
security service 
the killings were depicted in the movie mississippi burning 
for 17 years i didnt have any kind of problem with that 
church and boom mcdonald said before sundays service some 
of the people real close to me said as long as that man was working 
for me there would be no peace in that church i told them id 
leave for peace sake 
we teach love we teach forgiveness here are people who 
profess to be christians and they behave like heathens mcdonald 
said adding that he had received threatening telephone calls and 
his security business is not flourishing like it should 
hervy spinks chairman of the churchs deacons declined to 
comment 
thats between him and god he said of mcdonalds 
resignation 
rainey was among 18 men indicted by a federal grand jury after 
the 1964 slayings of 21yearold james chaney who was black and 
20yearold andrew goodman and 24yearold michael schwerner who 
were white he was acquitted in 1967 of violating their civil 
rights by depriving them of life

of his working for a black the article preceded the release of 
mississippi burning

said much of the contention has been directed toward him and his 
mcdonalds security service

be blamed for mcdonald losing his church 
i love him but he made a mistake tanksley said im not 
saying he should fire him all of us have to work evan should have 
used better action he should never have hired him 
he rainey was associated with something thats a smear on 
mississippi a scar on the pages of history tanksley said 
if his goal was to be more christian mcdonald should have tried 
to get rainey to give speeches at black churches to defuse the 
racial tension said tanksley pastor of st paul missionary 
baptist church in philadelphia

the resignation of the leader of the 
countrys powerful teachers union could help end a weekold 
strike but the striking teachers are still demanding higher wages 
their leaders say 
in a twoparagraph statement issued sunday the presidential 
palace said carlos jonguitud barrios told president carlos salinas 
de gortari he was stepping down as head of the national education 
workers union 
teachers had accused him of corruption and called for his ouster 
the strike was called by the national coordinate a dissident 
faction in the union that accuses union leaders of political 
patronage corruption and of neglecting the rankandfile 
the union with a membership of more than 1 million is among 
the largest and most powerful in latin america the national 
coordinate claims about half the membership 
the government news agency notimex on sunday quoted dissident 
teachers as saying that jonguituds resignation should help 
negotiations but that they would not give up their demands for a 
100 percent salary increase and union reforms such as free 
elections teachers now earn about 142 a month 
the strike talks were to resume today after a weekend recess

the salinas administration reacted to the strike by organizing 
talks between the union and its dissident wing and by offering a 10 
percent salary increase 
jonguitud was closely allied to the governing institutional 
revolutionary party and had been rewarded with a relatively free 
hand in union matters

the african american summit 89 cant be 
judged by its lowerthanexpected attendance says the chairman of 
the threeday gathering of black leaders over the weekend 
the real test will be whether there are some things that come 
out of here that have a relationship and meaning for the lives of 
millions of people in this country who right now are in crisis 
said richard hatcher former mayor of gary ind 
summit participants issued a call for greater government action 
on education housing black employment and drugs among other 
things 
jesse jacksons saturday speech and louis farrakhans fiery 
sunday morning address drew the conferences largest and most 
enthusiastic crowds estimated at 1000 at the new orleans 
convention center 
but only a week before organizers predicted a crowd of at least 
2000 and 17 years earlier 2700 came to a similar meeting 
hatcher organized in gary 
delegates however expressed little disappointment at the 
turnout 
the significant thing is that we came together said sheldon 
king a delegate from chicago 
the summits invitation to farrakhan a controversial black 
muslim minister prompted at least one black republican leader 
fred brown of new york to boycott the conference 
conservative blacks who boycotted because of farrakhan lost a 
chance to have their voices heard said king 
the meeting ended sunday with distribution and discussion of the 
summits social and political agenda for the next decade 
several delegates complained during the closing session that the 
sevenpage document failed to address all problems with specific 
solutions but hatcher stressed that the agenda was far from 
finished and that the summit steering committee would continue to 
work on it 
the preliminary agenda included calls for 
preservation of black family life 
more government involvement in providing housing for the poor 
including a reduction in red tape in making federally 
foreclosed housing available for private ownership by the poor 
a call for increased government spending on education and a 
halt to the rush to implement testing certification schemes and 
other devices designed to basically eliminate black teachers from 
the public school systems 
support for government and private programs designed to 
increase black employment and business investment opportunities 
work to end apartheid in south africa including support for 
economic sanctions against that nation 
reparations to compensate blacks for hundreds of years of 
slave labor and poor economic conditions what form such 
reparations should take was not specified 
a fullscale attack on drugs that should not begin and end 
at the borders of the african american communities

a 15yearold girl escaped from abductors who 
held her captive for six days and raped her repeatedly then she 
was raped again by a man who picked her up as she pleaded for help 
police said 
two city park rangers discovered the teenager at early saturday 
in rose hill park after she had been raped by a man whom she had 
asked for help said lt sergio robleto 
the allegations that this young lady has made are probably 
some of the more heinous allegations that ive heard in quite some 
time said robleto 
the attack in the park followed a horrifying week that began 
april 16 while the girl was shopping at the greyhound bus terminal 
during a stopover on a trip home from a friends house in corona 
said robleto 
corona is 45 miles east of los angeles and she was returning to 
her home in thousand oaks 40 miles northwest of downtown los 
angeles 
two men holding knives approached the girl forced her into a 
car carrying at least three other men and drove her to a house in 
the southcentral area robleto said 
over six days the girl was held prisoner while at least two men 
and possibly more raped her several times the lieutenant said 
late friday the girl convinced one of her captives to let her 
go robleto said outside she quickly flagged down a gold 1976 
buick regal carrying three men asking them to take her to police 
instead she was driven to rose hill park and allegedly raped 
before two park rangers arrived robleto said 
thats the only good thing in this whole terrible story 
robleto said the chances of those rangers being at that place at 
the time were a thousand to one 
an 18yearold los angeles man was arrested for investigation of 
sexual assault and his two companions were held for questioning 
said robleto 
the girl was examined at white memorial hospital and released to 
her parents who had reported her missing he said

down down factories in dhaka news reports said

of the countrys public transportation system did not show up for 
work and that many car owners stayed off the roads for fear of 
violence

plo chairman yasser arafat will make his first 
official visit to france next month meeting with president 
francois mitterrand and other government officials on may 2 
mitterrands spokesman announced today 
the spokesman hubert vedrine did not provide other details and 
did not say whether arafats visit would last more than one day 
the principle although not the date of an official visit had 
been announced two weeks ago leading to criticism from israel and 
french jews who contend the plo remains committed to israels 
destruction 
foreign minister roland dumas interviewed sunday on french 
television said france remains a close friend of israel 
but prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel later said that he 
sees the planned visit with gravity 
president mitterrand presents himself as a friend of israel 
but what he does today totally opposes any friendly treatment of 
israel shamir said in an interview with israel army radio 
dumas said france takes into account israels concerns but also 
what he called the reality of the palestinian people 
he said the actions of the palestine national council last 
november in algiers and statements by arafat in geneva accepting 
the right of israel to exist and renouncing terrorism made the 
visit possible 
dumas noted that arafat already has made official visits to 
greece spain and italy and has been received by pope john paul ii 
dumas and other french foreign ministers have met with arafat on 
several occasions but never before in paris 
after arafats statements in geneva the united states dropped 
its ban on all contacts with the plo 
since then representatives of the group in tunis tunisia where 
the plo is headquartered have met several times with us

professors 
forty to 50 protesters the last of up to 100 who had occupied 
the student services center since april 12 left the building

im happy but i also know that what was done here is not 
necessarily the end of what must be done to correct injustices to 
members of my race said walter boykin a sophomore from detroit 
the university granted the students amnesty for the takeover and 
allowed them to complete missed course work said wayne state 
spokesman vern foss 
dalmas taylor dean of liberal arts and the schools chief

of what they set out to do 
the students presented the university with a list of 17 
proposals among them was some that brought our attention to 
serious needs taylor said some of them we were aware of

taught only by blacks a requirement officials said would be 
illegal

financial aid registration and records it was closed during the

the university agreed to create 10 new fulltime scholarships 
for blacks and increase the number of black faculty members from 99 
to 113 within three years

percent which officials said was three times the national average 
for universities

black studies to a full department and budget 452500 for the

blowing snow forced alaska and soviet 
officials to meet over the telephone instead of on the bering sea 
ice for a symbolic gesture aimed at easing travel restrictions on 
us and soviet eskimos 
gov steve cowper and his counterpart from the magadan region of 
the soviet far east vyacheslav i kobets signed a protocol sunday 
urging soviet and us officials to allow regular visits between 
eskimos in the two countries 
cowper and kobets had planned to sign the document on the 
international dateline but bad weather grounded the mayor in nome 
he used a telephone to communicate with kobets whose delegation 
made it by helicopter to little diomede island on the us side of 
the dateline little diomede is 2 miles from big diomede island on 
the soviet side 
about 40 people jammed into a small office of a telephone 
company switching station to watch cowper sign the protocol cowper 
and kobets who had been sent a copy of the document earlier 
talked through translators 
the protocol calls for a border commission to oversee travel 
between the two countries eskimos would not be required to obtain 
visas only to check in with the commission before traveling 
eskimos from alaska and siberia routinely visited each other 
under a 1938 agreement but the socalled bering bridge was closed 
at the onset of the cold war 10 years later 
even though this is perhaps not the best way to make this 
agreement it is a very significant step we think said cowper 
apologizing for the weather we believe it is a great and 
important event 
cowper said that he is uncertain when us and soviet diplomats 
might complete their negotiations on the matter but that it could 
be by summer 
the signing was to have taken place at the site of the dateline 
crossing sunday by a ussoviet team of adventurers on a 60day 
trek aimed at calling attention to the common cultural heritage of 
bering natives 
the group of six soviets and six americans is using skis 
dogsleds and eskimo skin boats to travel 1200 miles through 
the soviet far east and alaska the expedition began in midmarch 
in the siberian city of anadyr 
cowper told kobets he would like to visit the magadan region in 
september and asked should i bring my fishing rod 
you can bring your own but well give you one replied 
kobets suggesting they swap poles 
that is what we would call a deal cowper said 
its what we call a good deal kobets responded

the communist party chief of the soviet 
republic of georgia acknowledged today that some victims of a clash 
between protesters and soldiers died of gas poisoning 
in moscow troops on sunday dragged away dozens of demonstrators 
protesting the violent crackdown on dissent in georgia two weeks 
ago the official tass news agency said 47 demonstrators were 
arrested 
givi gumbaridze chief of the georgian communist party 
acknowledged widespread reports today that soldiers used a harmful 
gas to crush proindependence demonstrations in tbilisi 
the fact that gases were used is the truth yes some people 
died from poisoning he told reporters taken to the southern 
republic by the soviet foreign ministry 
his remark was the first by a top official acknowledging that 
some protesters were killed by gas used april 9 to help break up a 
crowd of thousands of demonstrators in tbilisi the georgian 
capital 
at least 19 people were killed as soldiers using clubs shovels 
and gas dispersed the demonstrators and official accounts said one 
man was shot later georgian activists previously had charged that 
gas killed some protesters 
the defense ministry newspaper krasnaya zvezda on saturday 
identified a chemical used against the protesters as an 
incapacitating agent dubbed cheremukha 
its main ingredient is chloroacetophenone the newspaper said a 
western military attache in moscow said the substance was similar 
to but stronger than tear gas 
gumbaridze said officials were trying to determine who ordered 
the use of the chemical he did not say how many people died from 
its effects 
members of a citizens commission formed by the government to 
investigate the attack said a second gas was used as well 
officials have not identified it 
symptoms of poisoning by the second gas include vomiting memory 
loss headache and nausea said nino djavakhisheili a morphologist 
and member of the 40member commission he said the symptoms are 
permanent 
malkahz zaalisheili a molecular biologist and member of the 
commission said light concentrations of the first chemical 
substance act like tear gas but in bigger concentrations it 
becomes very poisonous 
another substance was used that paralyzes central nervous 
systems the structure of the second gas they refuse to tell us 
he said 
the citizens commission said 700 people were injured in the 
demonstrations 
gumbaridze former kgb head for the republic replaced dzhumber 
patiashvili as georgian party chief patiashvili resigned after 
accepting responsibility for the violence 
the 44yearold gumbaridze said the decision to send soldiers to 
break up the demonstration was made by a few georgian leaders and 
that he did not know about it until moments before it occurred 
this was a very serious mistake he said not everyone 
participated in this decision the law should be enforced but this 
law should be enforced without victims 
protests began in tbilisi on april 4 against a call by some 
ethnic abkhazians a minority in georgia to be separated from the 
republic protests grew and many of the demonstrators began 
demanding full independence for georgia 
soldiers were called and 19 people died in the melee on 
tbilisis main avenue one young man was shot and killed for 
violating a curfew that was imposed 
demonstrators arrested in sundays protest in moscow were to 
appear in court today could be fined or sentenced to jail for 1015 
days said yuri mityunov spokesman for the independent democratic 
union which organized the protest 
thousands of protesters in moscow gathered in the sunday 
afternoon drizzle and some raised white blue and red banners the 
flag of czarist russia before marching about a mile to the 
georgian cultural center 
the demonstrators pushed past police barricades spilling onto 
pushkin square and across tverskoy boulevard 
police stood by in lines while a special interior ministry unit 
waded into the crowd singling out protesters and dragging them to 
waiting buses 
moscow authorities had banned the protest and warned it would 
not be tolerated they accused the democratic union of trying to 
stir up tension

the real george washington surely didnt have to 
answer questions about star wars baseball and bad teeth the way 
his standin did at ceremonies marking the 200th anniversary of the 
first presidents inauguration 
as history buffs and tourists looked on washingtons arrival in 
new york was reenacted sunday at south street seaport several 
blocks from where the real washington arrived for festivities 
preceding his swearingin on april 30 1789 
william sommerfield of philadelphia an expert on the nations 
first president stepped off a boat in a tricorner hat and cape 
amid skyscrapers and the roar of traffic that he made a point of 
ignoring 
the ceremony kicked off a week of events marking the 
bicentennial 
a bold new experiment in government was launched on that day 
in this great city mayor edward i koch said he welcomed 
george washington reincarnated back to new york city 
two centuries ago the real washington alighted from a barge via 
carpeted steps as church bells pealed and cannons blasted 
eschewing a fancy coach he strolled up narrow wall street bowing 
and tipping his hat to cheering admirers who leaned out of windows 
and looked down from rooftops 
on sunday many in the crowd applauded as the mock washington 
walked by and some asked the whitehaired gentleman for an 
autograph but not 72yearold monte schreck who wanted to know 
where washington would take his wife 
are you going to take her to shea stadium for a mets game 
schreck asked 
im sorry sir i am not familiar with your term is that a 
political party sir asked sommerfield 
later someone asked how do you feel about star wars 
are you from another country sir im only a poor virginia 
farmer you have to speak my language sommerfield said 
when one impertinent reporter asked how are your teeth at 
this point sommerfield took the opportunity to remind listeners 
that the old tale of georges wooden teeth was a fallacy 
they are made of bone and ivory 
with that a mock presidential aide stepped in and said 
gentleman thats a rather personal question for the president 
a few people tested sommerfield on controversial issues 
what about slavery are you against slavery a man shouted 
i am totally against the trading of human species 
sommerfield said and during my terms in office i will work 
toward the elimination of slavery under the law 
the most difficult question may have had to do with the 
presidents seemingly poor eyesight 
did the skyscrapers and cars surprise you at all someone 
asked 
skyscrapers sir the playfully bewildered sommerfield asked 
minutes later he was driven away in a dented old plymouth

herbert von karajan an internationally acclaimed 
conductor who sold 150 million albums worldwide resigned today 
after 34 years as director of the berlin philharmonic 
karajan whose chronic back problems have made it difficult for 
him to walk to a podium cited frail health as his reason for 
resigning said anke martiny west berlins culture senator 
she said she received a letter today from karajan informing her 
that he was stepping down immediately 
karajan was appointed conductor for life of the berlin 
orchestra in 1955 and his resignation leaves open one of the most 
coveted conductors posts many leading conductors have been 
mentioned as possible successors since karajans health began to 
deteriorate but his resignation letter made no recommendation 
karajan who turned 81 on april 5 was born in salzburg and 
keeps a residence in the austrian resort a child prodigy who made 
his piano debut at age 5 he now earns an estimated 62 million 
annually from his recordings 
he joined the nazi party while a rising young musical star 
during hitlers reign and his involvement was still drawing 
criticism more than 40 years after the end of world war ii 
because of his nazi links the allies banned karajan from 
performing for two years after the war and required him to undergo 
a denazification program in an interview karajan once said 
he had joined the nazis so his would not be jeopardized but 
insisted he had no sympathies for the group 
in his letter of resignation read by mrs martiny karajan said 
i kindly ask you to note that as of todays date i am ending my 
work as artistic director and permanent conductor of the berlin 
philharmonic 
the results of the medical examinations which now have 
stretched for weeks make it impossible for me to fulfill my 
obligations the letter said 
mrs martiny whose department in the west berlin legislature is 
in charge of the orchestra said i respect this decision by 
herbert von karajan which comes for health reasons 
berlin thanks herbert von karajan for his longtime excellent 
and successful work she said 
i hope that karajans friends in berlin will have one more 
opportunity to see him conducting the berlin philharmonic in a 
farewell performance mrs martiny said 
karajan had major back surgery in 1976 and had to learn again to 
walk properly after crushing nerves in his back two years later 
when he collapsed at the podium in berlin 
his frail health forced him to cancel several performances with 
the orchestra and earlier this year he said he was reducing his 
1989 performances from 12 to six 
his last performance in the united states was feb 28 1988 at 
carnegie hall with the vienna philharmonic

an international team of scientists will take 
to the ocean in may to study the role played by sulfur gases in 
changing the earths climate 
researchers from the united states and the soviet union will 
take part in the study focusing on sulfur gases released from the 
water in the eastern pacific ocean the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration said today 
sulfur gases are oxidized in the air and the resulting chemicals 
are thought to influence the reflectivity of clouds in the sky 
according to dr timothy bates of noaas pacific marine 
environmental laboratory in seattle 
scientists are trying to determine the overall effect of clouds 
in climate that is because clouds reflect some of the energy from 
the sun back into space but at the same time they trap some of the 
heat the earth itself would radiate away the balance of heat 
trapped and that reflected varies with the reflectivity of the 
clouds 
the 12day research trip aboard the noaa ship mcarthur will 
allow the scientists to measure the sulfur and nitrogen particles 
in the air and better calculate their influence on clouds 
at the same time measurements of clouds themselves will be made 
by aircraft from the national aeronautics and space administration 
the university of washington and battelle pacific northwest 
laboratories 
other research organizations participating in the study include 
the national science foundation department of defense department 
of energy monterey bay aquarium research institute university of 
arizona georgia institute of technology university of miami the 
soviet institute of atmospheric physics and the soviet institute of 
applied geophysics

here are remarks delivered by president bush 
at the memorial service monday for victims of last weeks explosion 
and fire aboard the uss iowa 
we join today in mourning for the 47 who perished and in fact 
for the 11 who survived they all were in the words of a poet 
the men behind the guns they came from hidalgo texas 
cleveland ohio tampa florida costa mesa california they came 
to the navy as strangers served the navy as shipmates and friends 
and left the navy as brothers in eternity in the finest navy 
tradition they served proudly on a great battleship the uss iowa 
this dreadnaught built long before these sailors were born 
braved the wartime waters of the atlantic to take president 
roosevelt to meet winston churchill in casa blanca and anchored in 
tokyo harbor on the day that world war ii ended the iowa earned 11 
battle stars in two wars october of 44 off the coast of the 
philippines i can still remember for those of us serving in 
carriers in halseys 3rd fleet having iowa nearby really built our 
confidence i was proud to be a part of the recommissioning 
ceremony in 1984 
and now fate has written a sorrowful chapter in this history of 
this great ship let me say to the crew of iowa i understand your 
great grief i promise you today we will find out why the 
circumstances of the tragedy but in a larger sense there will 
never be answers to the questions that haunt us we will not 
cannot as long as we live know why god has called them home 
but one thing we can be sure this world is a more peaceful 
place because of the uss iowa the iowa was recommissioned and her 
crew trained to preserve the peace so never forget that your 
friends died for the cause of peace and freedom 
to the navy community remember that you have the admiration of 
america for sharing the burden of grief as a family especially the 
navy wives who suffer most the hardships of separation youve 
always been strong for the sake of love you must be heroically 
strong now but you will find that love endures it endures in the 
lingering memory of time together in the embrace of a friend in 
the bright questioning eyes of a child 
and as for the children of the loss throughout your lives you 
must never forget your father was americas pride your mothers and 
grandmothers aunts and uncles are entrusted with the memory of 
this day in the years to come they must pass along to you the 
legacy of the men behind the guns 
and to all who mourn a son a brother a husband a father a 
friend i can only offer you the gratitude of a nation for your 
loved one served his country with distinction and honor 
i hope that the sympathy and appreciation of all the american 
people provide some comfort but true comfort comes from prayer and 
faith and your men are under a different command now one that 
knows no rank only love knows no danger only peace may god 
bless them all

near the main powerhouse overturned cars blew manholes into the 
air and tore holes 20 feet to 30 feet in diameter in the parking 
lot said ford spokesman bill carroll

outside company were missing a few ford workers were slightly 
injured in the blast and were treated at a medical center in the

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that a federal judge may overrule federal environmental officials 
and permit use of an allegedly dangerous pesticide 
the justices without comment rejected an appeal by 
environmentalists and organized labor in a case of particular 
importance to farmers in idaho oregon and washington state 
the environmental protection agency invoked emergency powers in 
1986 to suspend use of the pesticide dinoseb because of potential 
health risks to workers exposed to it 
federal officials were concerned particularly that the chemical 
could cause birth defects in the unborn children of pregnant women 
farmers and food processors in the pacific northwest sued in 
federal court to block the epa order 
they said dinoseb is the only pesticide available to protect 
their crops such as berries beans cucumbers and other members of 
the gourd family oregon state officials supported the suit 
us district judge james a redden in oregon ruled in favor of 
the farmers and food processors 
he said the farmers may use dinoseb if they meet 12 conditions 
among them a requirement that female workers of childbearing age 
be barred from exposure to the chemical 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last year upheld reddens 
authority to overturn the epas emergency ban on dinoseb 
crop losses of over 39 million may look like small potatoes 
from washington dc the appeals court said butsuch 
losses would cause very serious economic hardships to the people of 
the northwest 
the appeals court however said redden does not have the power 
to impose conditions for dinosebs use 
the appeals court sent the case back to the judge to decide 
whether he would permit unrestricted use of the pesticide 
the aflcio the natural resources defense council and others 
appealed to the supreme court they said the appeals court ruling 
threatens the epas authority to act decisively when the use of 
pesticides threatens to create a public health emergency 
the bush administration agreed that the appeals court 
misinterpreted federal law in granting federal judges power to 
overturn such epa decisions but justice department lawyers told 
the high court to reject the appeal by the environmentalists and 
organized labor 
they said the impact of the appeals court ruling is speculative 
the case is aflcio vs love 881255

the governmentbacked presidential 
candidate has angrily accused washington of blatant interference in 
panamas affairs after reports president bush approved more than 
10 million for the opposition 
carlos duque said in a speech sunday that the reported aid was 
brazen intervention in the campaign that ends with nationwide 
elections on may 7 he said he thought the actual amount of aid was 
much higher than 10 million 
duque is backed by de facto ruler gen manuel antonio noriega 
with whom the us government has long been at odds 
the may 1 issue of us news and world report said bush in 
february signed the secret intelligence directive to give 10 
million to the panamanian opposition 
the magazine quotes unnamed sources as saying bush personally 
lobbied the plan through the congressional intelligence committees 
and won approval for the cia to provide more than 10 million in 
aid it says the money was to be used for printing advertising 
transportation and communications for candidates opposing noriega 
reagan set a similar program in motion a year ago the magazine 
said the new york times reported today that the reagan 
administration plan was intended to dislodge noriega without 
violence failing that the plan called for a coup by a 
ussupported rebel force led by col eduardo herrara a 
panamanian exile in miami the times said quoting government 
officials 
the plan which was created by executive branch agencies was 
rejected by the senate intelligence committee apparently because 
of the possibility that noriega might be assassinated the times 
said a presidential order bars american participation in 
assassinations 
asked about the us news report saturday white house 
spokeswoman alixe glen said i cant comment on intelligence 
matters 
she added that the us official position remains opposed to 
noreiga but the government does not back any candidates there 
our position remains the same we want to return democracy to 
the panamanian people she added however its the panamanian 
people that vote 
on may 7 panamanians will chose a new president two vice 
presidents 67 legislators and 510 local representatives 
the opposition democratic alliance coalition has emerged as the 
strongest competition for the governmentbacked national liberation 
coalition in the upcoming election 
it is backing guillermo endara who has called the election a 
plebiscite on noriegas de facto rule 
last spring the united states imposed economic sanctions 
against panama in an attempt to force out the powerful leader of 
the defense forces 
the sanctions were imposed after noriega was indicted by two 
federal grand juries in florida on drug trafficking charges and he 
orchestrated the ouster of president eric arturo delvalle delvalle 
had tried to fire noriega after the indictment 
noriega denies the us criminal charges 
bush this month extended the sanctions which include sharp 
restrictions on us companies that do business in panama a hold 
on assets of the panamanian government in the united states and a 
prohibition on tax payments by us organizations to panama 
us officials have raised the possibility that the sanctions 
could be eased if the may 7 elections are deemed to be fair but 
the officials have expressed pessimism that that will be the case 
during his sunday campaign speech in chorrera 25 miles west of 
panama city duque told thousands of supporters that the opposition 
plans to create violence and chaos during the elections

that way because of the impact that drugs are having 
they have it on the morale of teachers they have it on 
discipline in the classroom they have the adverse impact on 
the areas that need help the most 
bush said the nation must find some way to signal to teachers 
that we respect those who choose that profession and find ways 
to encourage more to do it 
but he said he didnt really know the answer to the question of 
how to reward teachers and acknowledged that theyre never going 
to have it made in a financial sense 
on another education matter mudd asked if it is fair for a 
child in a ghetto high school in camden nj to have less than 
4000 spent on him while 7000 is spent on a child in affluent 
princeton nj is that not a violation of civil rights he 
asked bush 
no it is not a violation bush replied is it fair that 
football coach makes 10 times as much as a high school teacher is 
it far that a television announcer on the network news every night 
makes 20 times or 30 or 40 times as much as a teacher thats trying 
to keep your kid and mine out of narcotics 
im not sure everything is equitable and i am sure though 
that the federal government cant smooth out everything like this 
the president said the situation would improve if parents were 
able to choose the public school their child attended they might 
not be able to move from camden to princeton but if we have this 
choice take hold they can move into a school that is less heavily 
impacted by drugs he said 
mudd also told bush that at least two governers democrat bill 
clinton of arkansas and republican james thompson of illinois have 
run into opposition when they have tried to get their legislatures 
to approve new taxes for education improvements 
the interviewer attributed the legislative stone wall to bushs 
success running against new taxes last fall 
bush replied that the federal government should hold the line 
on taxes and not create taxes that take away from the states 
resource base and so i would let each state governor obviously 
make his own decision or her own decision but i will not 
criticize nor extend the readmylips no new taxes syndrome to 
every governor that is mandated to balance budgets

the supreme court today left intact a 101 
million refund the nations telephone companies were ordered to pay 
customers for excessive charges in 1978 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the federal 
communications commission overstepped its authority in ordering the 
refunds 
the commission in 1976 allowed american telephone amp telegraph 
co to set phone rates designed to yield a rate of return of up to 
10 percent a year 
atampts earnings in 1978 exceeded the 10 percent figure by 101 
million the commission ruled in 1984 
by that year atampt had divested itself of its regional operating 
companies in settling a federal antitrust lawsuit 
the commission therefore ordered the regional companies to 
reduce their phone rates so their customers would receive the 101 
million refund 
the us circuit court of appeals here in a 21 ruling in 1987 
upheld the commissions orders the appeals court rejected 
arguments that the reduced rates are a retroactive refund in 
violation of federal law 
the telephone companies also said ordering refunds is unfair 
because atampts rate of return in 1976 was only 925 percent yet 
the phone companies were not permitted to raise customer rates to 
make up the shortfall 
the appeals court said the rate of return approved by the 
commission is not designed to assure a certain minimum level of 
earnings for the companies each year 
the companies are entitled only to earn an overall reasonable 
return the appeals court said the commission has concluded 
that a guaranteed minimum annual return is not essential to protect 
that right that conclusion is a reasonable one 
in addition the appeals court upheld the commissions decision 
that the companies also refund interest earned on the 101 million 
we perceive no inequity in requiring the companies to pay 
full interest on earnings they had no right to retain in the first 
place the appeals court said 
the communications satellite corp comsat supported the phone 
companies position the satellite communications company was 
ordered by the commission last year to refund 388 million to its 
customers 
the cases are southern bell vs fcc 881249 and new england 
telephone vs fcc 881250

the flintstones cartoon characters filled in 
for one morning television program today and silence greeted many 
radio listeners as thousands of british broadcasting corp workers 
went on strike for higher pay 
the 24hour walkout by 18000 of the bbcs 25000 employees 
forced nearly all live programs on the corporations four national 
radio networks and two television channels to be canceled or 
shortened this affected half the nations noncable television and 
all national radio stations 
the bbc radio canceled its world service which broadcasts all 
over the globe with morning news commentary programs financial

birmingham and other major cities 
the strike began at midnight to demand a 16 percent pay rise 
that would bring salaries in line with those in commercial 
broadcasting the bbc has offered an average 7 percent increase 
at the lowest levels bbc pay is quite simply abysmal 
wrote simon gallimore a bbc union representative in a letter to 
the daily independent he said the publicly funded service was 
suffering a hemorrhage of experienced and skilled staff to 
commercial networks because of the low wages

29000 a year compared with 41000 in commercial radio or 
television network gallimores union said 
at the bbc a radio engineer earns up to 18210 a year while a 
cameraman earns up to 20280

twenty years after rotc was driven off 
the harvard university campus the student council wants it back 
in a 4124 vote sunday the undergraduate council asked the 
university to negotiate with the military to bring back reserve 
officers training corps programs which prepare students for 
appointments as military officers 
the military left harvard in 1969 after the university withdrew 
academic credit for rotc and decided it should be an 
extracurricular activity with no special privileges the edict 
followed a building takeover and a student strike 
now the 150 or so harvard students who take part in rotc 
programs do so at the nearby massachusetts institute of technology 
harvard spokeswoman marjorie heffron said a return by rotc would 
have to be approved by the faculty 
if they try to get that through the faculty there would be 
quite a fight dr warren ec wacker head of the universitys 
health services told the harvard crimson the student newspaper 
the student council vote followed two hours of heated debate 
the resolution was sponsored by two rotc candidates and had the 
backing of the councils leadership the newspaper said 
joel hornstein a freshman who supported the measure said it 
wasnt intended as an endorsement of the military 
i dont think theres anyone in rotc who blindly supports 
everything our government or our military does he said 
army navy and air force rotc programs provide financial aid to 
participants

the supreme court today agreed to review a 
judges order raising property taxes to help pay for racially 
desegregating public schools in kansas city mo 
the justices said they will hear arguments that the judge 
overstepped his authority when imposing the tax hike for all 
property within the citys school district 
a series of orders by us district judge russell g clark that 
would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to implement was 
challenged in appeals by state and county officials and school 
district taxpayers 
most of the judges orders were upheld by the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals last aug 19 
the funding controversy dates back to a 1977 lawsuit seeking to 
correct the physical decline of predominantly black schools in 
kansas city 
before 1954 missouri law required schools to be racially 
segregated from 1954 to 1984 the percentage of black students in 
kansas citys school district climbed from 225 percent to 677 
percent 
in a 1987 ruling clark found that the city school districts 
physical facilities have literally rotted and ordered the 
state and school district to upgrade them 
in upholding most of the judges order the 8th circuit court 
said there are still vestiges of the dual school system 
lingering in the city school district and the district and the 
state have not met their obligations to disestablish that system 
the judges orders called for two major remedies 
a magnet school plan providing that by the 199192 school 
year every high school and middle school in the city and about 
half the elementary schools will feature distinctive themes such 
as foreign languages performing arts or math and science 
a capital improvements program costing some 260 million to be 
completed by the fall of 1990 
to enable the city school district to pay its share of the 
desegregation plans costs the judge imposed a 15 percent income 
tax surcharge and hiked school district property taxes to 4 per 
100 assessed valuation through the 199192 fiscal year 
the states appeal granted review today says the 4 per 100 
levy represented a doubling of the local property tax 
clark ordered the tax increases because no money was available 
to finance the construction of new schools between 1970 and 1983 
school district voters had turned down six proposals to increase 
taxes for education 
he also authorized the school district to issue 150 million in 
20year capital improvement bonds 
the appeals court upheld the property tax hike but struck down 
the income tax surcharge which had raised some 30 million before 
being invalidated 
the state was ordered to pay 75 percent of the desegregation 
costs the school district the remaining 25 percent 
the state appeal acted on today said the lower court rulings 
rest upon an unwarranted extension of this courts desegregation 
cases 
the appeal said the magnet school remedy was as ordered by 
clark overbroad unlike any ever ordered by a federal court 
the appeal also said that the order imposing a tax increase is 
outside the bounds of judicial authority 
in a brief order the justices rejected two appeals filed in the 
case and limited review of the states appeal to the validity of 
the ordered tax increase 
the cases are missouri vs jenkins 881150 clark vs jenkins 
881194 and jackson county vs jenkins 881228

whaling supporters welcomed home the mother ship of 
japans whaling fleet today after a fourmonth hunt in the 
antarctic in which it dodged protesters and killed 241 whales 
the nisshin maru no 3s return marked the end of the second 
year of japans research whaling program which it launched after 
officially ending commercial whaling in 1987 to comply with a ban 
imposed by the international whaling commission 
in a welcoming ceremony on the ships long rusted deck 
officials promised the 120 crew members they would seek an end to 
the ban which is to be reevaluated in 1990 
i understand that you had many difficulties on your voyage 
fukujiro kikuchi a parliament member told the crew were doing 
our best in the hope that sometime somewhere japan will be able to 
resume commercial whaling 
below the 23000ton ships deck were 241 minke whales already 
prepared into meat in the vessels processing plant 
when japanese whaling was at its peak in the early 1960s whales 
provided 23 percent of all meat consumed in the country declining 
supplies since then have turned whale meat into a delicacy but 
japan is still the worlds largest consumer of whale flesh 
under the international whaling commission charter member 
nations may conduct research whaling at any time without permission 
from the commission and then use the meat japan says it hopes to 
show through its research that some whale species are plentiful 
enough to allow a resumption of limited commercial whaling 
estimates of the current number of minkes a smaller species 
range from 400000 to 700000 
but international environmental groups such as greenpeace have 
charged that japan is using the research provision as a ploy to 
continue whaling and that nonlethal research methods are 
available 
greenpeace members used a ship and rubber rafts to try to block 
the nisshin maru and its three catcher boats during their hunt in 
the antarctic and had one minor collision with the mother ship 
hidehiro kato director of research on board the nisshin maru 
said the voyage had shown that the random sampling methods used in 
the research could be applied to a broader research program 
id prefer to use nonlethal methods but they arent able to 
tell us age reproductive status or condition of the whales he 
said at this point the best approach is a combination of lethal 
and nonlethal research 
japanese officials have said at least 825 whales must be caught 
each season to make the research program scientifically accurate 
but because of strong international opposition they reduced this 
years goal to 300 
kato said bad weather was primarily responsible for the fleets 
falling short of the goal but that the protests had some 
effect 
the research whaling was approved by the japanese 
government said hideyoshi yoshida a crew member so i wish 
people opposed to it would discuss it with the government rather 
than confronting us while were whaling 
yoshida sats he took a year off from a fisheries college for a 
chance to work on the ship and visit the antarctic

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether the government may tax as income the deposits that utility 
companies demand from customers to insure payment of future bills 
the court said it will hear a bush administration appeal in a 
case involving an indiana electric utility 
administration officials said a considerable amount of money 
could be at stake the internal revenue service estimated that more 
than 150 such cases involving over 300 million in potential taxes 
are pending in the courts or before the irs 
the case acted on today stems from a deposit policy of the 
indianapolis power and light co 
the policy as amended in 1976 required some electricity 
customers to deposit up to twice their estimated monthly bills with 
the company 
the company required the deposits from new customers whose 
creditworthiness was in doubt and from existing customers with a 
record of late payment of their bills 
the utility paid 6 percent annual interest on the deposits to 
customers if it held the money for at least a year the deposit was 
refunded if the customer met a credit test or if the customers 
bill was paid on time for nine straight months or for 10 out of 12 
months 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals last september upheld a 
ruling by the us tax court that the deposits were not a form of 
advance payment and thus the utility did not have to pay federal 
income tax on them 
the appeals court accepted the tax courts interpretation that 
the money was meant as security for the utility not advance 
payment of a customers bill 
justice department lawyers in urging the high court to overturn 
the 7th circuit court ruling noted that another federal appeals 
court has ruled the opposite way the governments appeal urged the 
justices to resolve the conflict 
the case is commissioner of irs vs indianapolis power 881319

business owners are griping about tough new 
antismog measures that could transform the way southern 
californians live and work 
they say the regulations are too costly and in some cases rely 
on technology that is unavailable 
the new antismog plan by the south coast air quality management 
district touches virtually every aspect of everyday life from 
underarm deodorants and swimming pools to cars drivethrough 
restaurants and backyard barbecues 
oliver coury who operates coury amp son dry cleaners in redondo 
beach said he wants more time to make changes 
we all contribute to air pollution so we dont know who is 
doing what to what coury said i believe in everybody 
tightening up but within limits of the equipment and costs we can 
afford but theyre pushing the little people more than the big 
people 
the agency would require dry cleaners to buy new allinone 
machines to keep fumes from escaping when clothes are transferred 
from washers to dryers coury said the machines cost up to 70000 
those changes are in the first stage of a farreaching proposal 
approved in general march 17 by the aqmd each of the plans three 
stages still must be approved by the 12member board after hearings 
later this year 
stage one requires that readily available air pollution controls 
be imposed over the next five years 
stage two to go into effect by 2000 would require significant 
technological advances mostly to control motor vehicles and 
producers of paint and solvents 
stage three could be implemented in the next century with 
longrange technological breakthroughs that are unavailable now 
such as advances in solar cells and superconductors 
don burns a lobbyist for the swimming pool and spa industry 
said many people see the demands as unrealistic for example 
adding solar panels to heat pools and spas could add up to 14000 
to the price of a pool he said 
re robinson of the southern california paint and coatings 
association said his industry doesnt know how to make paints and 
other coatings that are as low in volatile organic compounds as the 
district wants 
we obviously dont know how to do that or how its going to be 
done right now but who knows whats going to happen in 10 or 20 
years he said 
sandra burton of the barbecue industry association said her 
industry cant reformulate charcoal starter fluid to give off lower 
emissions 
auto spray paint shops worry about rules that would require them 
to use lessvolatile paints and improve nozzles so less paint is 
blown into the air 
its going to be difficult theres no denying that most 
everyone is going to have to reformulate their paint said ray 
poulin who supervises five earl scheib shops its going to be 
expensive changing equipment we already have like spray guns

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating the death sentence of a convicted oklahoma killer whose 
jury was told to avoid any influence of sympathy 
the justices said they will review a ruling that the jury 
instructions deprived robyn leroy parks of a fair sentencing trial 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals by a 64 vote last oct 
20 said parks is entitled to a new sentencing trial 
the october ruling however did not disturb parks murder 
conviction for the aug 17 1977 shooting death of abdullah 
ibrahim an oklahoma city gas station attendant 
at parks sentencing trial the presiding judge told jurors 
among other things you must avoid any influence of sympathy 
sentiment passion prejudice or other arbitrary factor when 
imposing sentence 
the 10th circuit court said that instruction undermined the 
jurys consideration of the mitigating evidence factors 
suggesting life imprisonment rather than death as the appropriate 
punishment 
the supreme court in 1987 upheld a california murderers death 
sentence even though jurors in that case were told they should not 
be swayed by mere sympathy 
the justices by a 54 vote said in the california case that a 
reasonable juror would understand the instruction not to rely on 
mere sympathy as a directive to ignore only the sort of sympathy 
that would be totally divorced from the evidence adduced during the 
penalty phase 
in parks case the appeals court noted that the antisympathy 
instruction is not modified by the word mere which the 1987 
supreme court decisions considered crucial 
in the appeal acted on today oklahoma prosecutors argued the 
constitution does not require sympathy in capital sentencing 
they added no reasonable juror would interpret the admonition 
to avoid the influence of sympathy as a secret code designed to 
denigrate the defendants case in mitigation 
the case is saffle vs parks 881264

the supreme court today refused to hear an 
appeal by a labor union seeking to limit pension benefits for one 
of its retired officers 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the retired 
official did not wait too long to file a federal lawsuit in san 
francisco seeking increased benefits 
the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers iam amended its retirement benefit plan effective jan 1 
1977 
the change designed to save money and protect the plans 
future eliminated a socalled living pension feature 
it had guaranteed retired union officials they would receive 
pension increases equal to any future salary hikes for the position 
from which they retired 
the union as employer funds the pension plan 
the elimination of the living pension feature was challenged by 
frank meagher who had been a union officer for 20 years when he 
reitred july 1 1977 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled last september that 
meagher is entitled to the benefits of the living pension feature 
the appeals court said the the elimination of the feature has 
not taken legal effect under the federal employee retirement income 
security act because it never has been approved by the us 
secretary of the treasury 
therefore the appeals court said meagher did not miss the 
deadline for suing over the features elimination even though he 
did not sue until may 13 1986 
the appeals court said meagher is entitled to any pension 
increases that would take effect under the living pension feature 
from may 13 1983 onward 
iam officials who said meagher is receiving a monthly pension 
check of about 2700 said the ruling could be extremely costly 
and damaging for pension plans generally 
pension benefit plan changes made in good faith could be the 
subject of expensive litigation decades after they were made the 
union said 
the appeal acted on today was supported by several business 
groups including the us chamber of commerce 
the case is international association of machinists vs meagher

rockets hit 15 miles north of the power plant at zouk 
despite the attack no casualties or damage was reported as the 
french naval vessel the penhors unloaded the desperately needed 
fuel oil at the zouk port 
earlier christian army commander gen michel aoun ordered two 
cypriot ferries to stop sailing to lebanon today suspending the 
christians only escape route while the penhors unloaded its 
precious cargo 
an aide to aoun said france demanded ferry service be halted 
while the penhors unloads the fuel needed to restore electricity to 
beirut after a nineday blackout 
thats the deal worked out by france to strip the syrian army 
and its druse allies from any pretext for shelling the christian 
enclave said the aide who spoke on condition of anonymity 
aoun ordered the ferry service halted sunday night as the 
cypriotflagged baroness m headed to the port of jounieh 12 miles 
north of beirut an associated press reporter aboard the 4000ton 
ferry said the vessel turned back to larnaca cyprus 
baroness m and another cypriot ship the larnaca rose have 
shuttled about 15000 people from lebanon since the latest round of 
fighting began march 8 
at least 270 people have been killed and 975 wounded in fighting 
between aouns 20000strong army and allied syrian troops and 
druse militiamen residential areas in beirut have been bombarded 
by rocket and artillery attacks most of those killed or wounded 
have been civilians 
asked how long the ferry service would be suspended aouns aide 
said that depends on how long the penhors will stay in lebanese 
territorial waters 
the french ship unloaded 2000 tons of fuel at the zahrani oil 
harbor 30 miles south of beirut on sunday to restart a power 
plant in nearby drusecontrolled jiye 
the tanker docked today at zouk in the christian heartland north

mitri nammar the electricity authority director said it would 
take penhors nine hour to unload the fuel at zouk

the supreme court today set aside 720000 in 
awards won by the families of five uraguayans who were among the 
154 people killed in a 1982 airline crash in kenner la 
the justices ordered a federal appeals court to restudy the case 
in light of their decision last week that international airline 
passengers do not have to be warned about the 75000perperson 
liability cap for death or injury 
pan american world airways flight 759 crashed outside of new 
orleans shortly after its takeoff from moisant international 
airport on july 9 1982 investigators concluded that a wind shear 
contributed to the accident 
more than 50 of the crash victims were foreign tourists 
pan am never has contested its liability for the accident and 
the numerous lawsuits stemming from the crash have been limited to 
the question of what damages should be paid 
the two families of the five uraguayans luis and electra 
trivellonilorenzi sara lopez de pampin amparo pampin lopez and 
irma lopez de alvarez were awarded a total of 720000 by a 
federal jury in new orleans 
the trial was held only after pan ams request that it be 
allowed to defend against the two suits in uraguay was denied 
us district judge adrian g duplantier noted that the federal 
government likely would become a defendant after administrative 
maneuvers were completed and that the government could not be 
forced to defend itself in uraguayan courts 
he also ruled that pan am could not invoke the warsaw 
convention a treaty covering international airplane travel to 
limit its liability to 75000 for each death 
duplantier said pan am could not benefit from the treaty because 
the limited liability was discussed on passenger tickets in too 
small a size of print 9point rather than 10point 
his ruling was upheld by the full 5th us circuit court of 
appeals last july 21 
on april 18 the supreme court ruled in a similar case stemming 
from the soviet downing of a korean air lines jet that claimed 269 
lives in 1983 
the justices ruled that kal cannot be penalized for its failure 
to use the proper size type on its tickets to alert passengers to 
the 75000 limit 
the kal tickets used 8point type even smaller than that used 
on the pan am tickets in the case acted on today 
the case is pan am vs lopez 87750

entered the factional fighting during the weekend the sinyoras 
named for a song performed by south african singer brenda fassie 
reportedly fought united democratic front followers who were 
protesting the fatal stabbing of a colleague 
on sunday inkatha leader and kwazulu black homeland leader 
mangosuthu buthelezi called for a foreignfunded peace campaign to 
end fighting between his followers and militant antiapartheid 
groups the united front and allied african national congress view 
buthelezi as a conservative who weakens the struggle for black 
rights 
both inkatha and the democratic front oppose the apartheid 
policies that enable south africas 5 million whites to dominate 28 
million blacks but their strategies differ markedly 
in its early stages the factional feud focused on allegations 
that inkatha engaged in forced recruitment drives and that 
democratic front followers sometimes coerced people into joining 
antiapartheid boycotts more recently killings have been revenge 
attacks or preemptive strikes

an increase in drugrelated arrests and 
stricter sentencing requirements have brought about a 74 percent 
hike in the number of inmates in federal and state prisons but 
prison capacity hasnt kept up according to the justice department 
at the end of 1988 a record 627402 men and women were 
incarcerated nationwide but the most optimistic estimate of prison 
capacity said there was room for 566898 while the prison 
population was increasing by 74 percent the prison capacity was 
increasing by just 55 percent 
the 1988 increase translates into a nationwide need for more 
than 800 new prison bed spaces per week said the report written 
by lawrence a greenfeld corrections unit chief for the 
departments bureau of justice statistics 
the fbi meanwhile announced that serious crimes nationwide 
rose 3 percent between 1987 and 1988 the total number of violent 
crimes reported to law enforcement agencies increased 5 percent 
paced by a 7 percent jump in aggravated assaults in the last year 
according to preliminary results of the 1988 uniform crime report 
the report said motor vehicle thefts increased 11 percent from 
last year 
the 1988 crime index increased 4 percent in the northeast and 
south but registered no change in the midwest the index the 
total number of crimes reported to state and local authorities 
increased 3 percent in the west 
the report released sunday said the 42967 additional prisoners 
in 1988 were about 3500 more than the number added during 1987 
there had been a 72 percent hike in 1987 over the previous year 
the report attributed the increases both to the heightened 
likelihood that a serious offender will receive a prison sentence 
and a 113 percent increase in the number of adults arrested for 
drug trafficking or manufacturing 
and the bureau of prisons expects the increases to continue 
obviously the increased efforts of law enforcement to combat 
drug problems will hike the population as well as the new 
sentencing guidelines under which inmates will be serving longer 
sentences said greg bogdan 
the federal prison population which stood at 49928 at the end 
of 1988 a 34 percent increase over the 48300 at the end of 1987 
is expected to reach some 83500 by 1995 bogdan said 
the report said that nationwide state prisons were operating at 
7 percent to 23 percent over capacity while federal prisons were 
estimated to be between 33 percent and 72 percent over capacity 
bogdan said the federal prisons were operating at an average of 55 
percent over capacity 
during 1988 total state and federal prison capacities increased 
by 28000 to 31000 beds depending on how the various 
jurisdictions rated capacities the report found 
the report which calculated prison population based both on all 
prisoners and on those sentenced to more than one year called 
sentenced prisoners found that since 1980 the district of 
columbia and the federal prison system have more than doubled the 
number of sentenced prisoners 
alaska california new hampshire and new jersey have 
experienced a threefold increase since 1980 when total prison 
populations in those states were 29725 to 1988 totals of 93597 
the states that have more than doubled the number of such 
prisoners since 1980 were arizona colorado delaware hawaii 
kansas massachusetts missouri nevada new mexico new york 
north dakota oklahoma pennsylvania and utah 
the incarceration rate based on the number of people sentenced 
to more than one year in prison reached 244 per 100000 residents 
nationwide in 1980 the rate was 139 per 100000 
the western states had the highest increase in total prisoners 
115 percent while the northeast had a 92 percent increase the 
midwest 86 percent and the south 47 percent 
the 10 states with the biggest percentage increase in total 
prison population from 1987 to 1988 were rhode island 335 
percent colorado 247 percent new hampshire 175 percent 
michigan 161 percent california 137 percent arizona 111 
percent missouri 108 percent kentucky 106 percent nevada 
101 percent and minnesota 99 percent 
but the prison population actually declined in seven states the 
report found the states with declines were south dakota down by 
10 percent washington down 51 percent maine down 23 percent 
tennessee and alabama down 17 percent north carolina down 09 
percent and west virginia down 02 percent 
although men in prison still vastly outnumber the women 
incarcerated the number of women inmates increased at a faster 
rate during 1988 125 percent than the men 71 percent the 
number of women in state and federal prisons grew from 29064 at 
the end of 1987 to 32691 at the end of 1988 while the number of 
men in prison increased from 555371 to 594711

won independence from france in 1960 until he was ousted in a coup 
14 years later has died officials said today he was 73 
the moroccan government officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity provided no cause of death 
before independence diori founded the niger progressive party 
that favored close ties with france he was the clear choice to 
lead the nation among french officials who banned competing 
political parties 
diori was elected to three fiveyear terms his rule was

corruption and the catostrophic sahelian drought of the 1960s and 
early 1970s

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether an indian tribe can prosecute members of other tribes for 
crimes on its reservation 
the court said it will review a ruling that gives the salt river 
pimamaricopa community in arizona authority to prosecute a 
california man accused in the fatal shooting of a 14year old boy 
the accused man is albert duro 30 who is a member of a mission 
indian band 
the victim phillip fernando brown was a member of a third 
tribe the gila river indian tribe the boy was shot to death on 
june 15 1984 on the salt river reservation near scottsdale ariz 
duro originally was charged with murder by the federal 
government but those charges were dismissed 
the salt river tribe then accused him of illegally discharging a 
gun on its reservation 
a federal judge threw out the tribes charge but the judge was 
overruled last year by the 9th us circuit court of appeals which 
said the salt river tribal court has jurisdiction in the case 
the appeals court noted that in 1984 duro was living with his 
girlfriend on the salt river reservation and was working for picopa 
construction co which the tribe owns 
these contacts justify the tribal courts conclusion that duro 
is an indian subject to its criminal jurisdiction the appeals 
court said we stress that this is not purely a racial 
determination 
extending tribal court criminal jursidiction to nonmember 
indians who have significant contacts with a reservation does not 
amount to a racial classification the appeals court continued 
we further find that this policy is reasonably related to the 
legitimate goal of improving law enforcement on reservations 
the appeals court noted that the supreme court in 1978 ruled 
that an indian tribe may not prosecute nonindians for crimes on 
the reservation 
but the 9th circuit court said that decision left unanswered 
whether a tribe would have authority to prosecute a member of 
another tribe in such cases 
the appeals court noted that tribal courts generally handle 
petty crimes by indians against indians leaving federal courts to 
prosecute major crimes 
duros lawyers said he is living in california and denied 
charges by the salt river tribe that he is a fugitive 
the case is duro vs reina 886546

president bush today consoled grieving 
friends and relatives of the 47 crewmen killed in the uss iowa 
explosion saluting the sailors as americas pride 
we will not cannot as long as we live know why god has 
called them home but one thing we can be sure this world is a 
more peaceful place because of the uss iowa bush said at a 
memorial service at the norfolk naval air station 
among the 6000 people jammed into the hangar for the service 
were victims relatives and scores of sailors and officers in dress 
blues a bouquet of red roses was placed in front of the podium 
behind were an american flag and the battleships banners outside 
2000 listened to the service on loudspeakers 
the service came a day after the world war iiera battleship 
eased into its home port its gun barrels scorched and its 1500 
crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memory 
of their dead shipmates 
the president himself a world war ii navy pilot said he was 
proud to recommission the iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11 
battle stars in two wars 
but with the fire and explosion last week in the battleships 
no 2 gun turret he said fate has written a sorrowful chapter 
in the history of this great ship 
they came from hidalgo texas cleveland ohio tampa fla 
costa mesa california the president said they came to the 
navy as strangers served the navy as shipmates and friends and 
left the navy as brothers in eternity 
to the navy community remember that you have the admiration 
of america for sharing the burden of grief as a family bush said 
you must be heroically strong now to all who mourn a son 
a brother a husband a father a friend i can only offer you the 
gratitude of a nation for your loved one served his country with 
distinction and honor he said 
he said to the children of the lost crewmen you must never 
forget that your father was americas pride 
capt fred p moosally commander of the iowa said the men who 
died made the ultimate sacrifice for us the men of turret two 
will be part of the spirit of the iowa forever 
we shared the good the bad the comedy and now the tragedy 
moosally said 
after the service the president and his wife barbara moved 
through the crowd as the navy hymn played offering words of 
consolation shaking hands and hugging mourners many of them in 
tears the victims families then met with the ships commander 
privately 
on sunday night about 3000 family members and friends greeted 
the ship on its arrival at norfolk naval base exchanging tearful 
embraces with loved ones 
when the 887foot warship moved into sight of the dock families 
let out scattered cheers but as tugs pushed the ship into its 
berth the crowd fell silent all that could be heard were the 
cries of gulls that circled the iowas wake 
the barrels of the threegun turret were in the same position as 
when the explosion occurred off puerto rico on wednesday 
reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or the 
crewmen 
fiftyeight crewmen were in the turret when it exploded during 
gun exercises eleven sailors in the lowest level of the turret 
six decks below the guns survived 
the navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion 
which damaged only the inside of the turret 
but navy teams said it appeared that the blast occurred while 
the powder bags were being loaded into the big gun the new york 
times reported sunday 
the navy on sunday released a videotape made by an officer on 
the bridge who wanted to record the firing of the guns 
the explosion appears to blast away the gasketlike rubber that 
seals the gun slits and is followed by a jet of fire and thick 
smoke from the gunhouse

the supreme court today agreed to judge the 
validity of a federal law allowing the use of abandoned rail line 
rightsofway for nature trails 
the court said it will decide in a case from vermont whether the 
law unconstitutionally deprives some property owners of the use of 
their land without providing just compensation 
vermont railroad inc in 1975 discontinued service over a 
17mile stretch of its north burlington branch rail line in 
chittenden county vt 
part of the rail lines rightofway crosses property j paul 
and patricia preseault say they own vermont officials say the 
state owns the land at issue 
if the preseaults do own it they have the right under state law 
to use the property once rail service is discontinued and the 
railways easement automatically discontinued 
but the national trails system act as amended in 1983 allows 
for the maintenance of railroad rightsofway for possible future 
railroad use socalled railbanking while permitting such 
rightsofway to be used as nature trails 
vermont entered into a lease with the city of burlington under 
which the city will maintain the rightofway as a trail while 
preserving it for possible rail use 
citing the statecity agreement the interstate commerce 
commission rejected the preseaults attempt to have the rail line 
declared officially abandoned 
the preseaults appealed the commissions action but the 2nd 
us circuit court of appeals rejected their arguments that the 
federal trails act violates the constitutions fifth amendment 
which bars the taking of private property without just 
compensation 
the justices were told that some 10000 miles of railroad 
rightofway have been abandoned since 1985 
the case is preseault vs icc 881076

soldiers wounded 17 palestinians in the 
occupied lands today hospitals reported and arab residents said 
jewish settlers smashed windows in the west bank city of hebron 
after their buses were stoned by youths 
an army spokesman confirmed a couple of israelis attacked 
cars and shops in hebron after the settlers buses were pelted by 
stones during a visit to a jewish religious site in the area 
arab reporters said windows were smashed in at least 15 cars 
and a hebron shopkeeper marwan abu ghalyoun said six stores in 
the city were damaged by settlers 
some youths stoned the bus and most of the settlers in the 
buses got out carrying clubs and iron bars and started smashing the 
cars parked in the street he said i went to one settler and 
tried to stop him from smashing my car but one soldier ordered me 
back to my shop so i turned back 
an army spokesman who is not identified under military 
regulations said soldiers tried to break up the confrontation and 
were themselves attacked by the israelis he said several israelis 
were arrested 
there were no injuries in the incident he said but the army 
declared a curfew on the city of 79000 
most of the gunshot wounds reported by arab hospitals today came 
from clashes in five refugee camps in the occupied gaza strip 
six of the injuries came in early morning clashes and the rest 
later in the day hospital officials and arab reporters said the 
confrontations with soldiers followed a day of widespread clashes 
sunday in which 53 palestinians were reported shot and wounded 
military officials could not confirm any of the injuries today 
but reported that soldiers killed a palestinian late sunday during 
a raid on a west bank village the army confirmed four of the 53 
wounded reported sunday by arab hospital officials 
in jerusalem a cabinet minister from the leftleaning labor 
party today praised the plo for blocking efforts by radical 
palestinian factions to further incite last weeks rioting in 
neighboring jordan 
moshe shahal minister for energy told army radio today that 
the plo blocked the distribution of leaflets aimed at undermining 
king hussein eight people were killed in jordan during four days 
of rioting over government price increases 
shahal said the action shows the plo plays a central role in the 
occupied lands and in jordan and lebanon and called on israel to 
formulate a clear response to the aims of the palestinians 
his comments reflect a split in israels coalition government 
over whether to negotiate with the palestine liberation 
organization 
prime minister yitzhak shamir says israel will never hold talks 
with the plo but several labor party ministers recently have urged 
a change in israels stand 
shamir has called for holding elections in the west bank and 
gaza to choose palestinians to negotiate an interim peace treaty 
with israel 
the plo reportedly has countered with a proposal for elections 
in the occupied lands for members of the palestine national 
council the plos parliamentinexile 
this would amount to indirect recognition of the plo 
the army today confirmed the death of 24yearold amjad 
elmamani from the village of deir sudan near ramallah arab 
reporters said he was killed sunday night when soldiers fired on 
youths throwing stones 
an army spokesman said there was a search for weapons and 
people engaged in terrorism three were captured and escaped and 
in the course of recapturing them one was killed 
the death brought to 444 the number of palestinians killed in 
the uprising eighteen israelis also have been killed

moslem guerrillas appear not to be 
gaining any ground in their siege of jalalabad and diplomatic 
sources say the insurgents pakistani backers had been deeply 
divided on whether to mount the offensive 
the guerrillas battled government forces in four provinces on 
sunday and fired rockets into kabul the capital the government 
said nearly 280 people were reported killed in the fighting 
including 12 in kabul it said 
the guerrillas meanwhile claimed soviet aircraft were dropping 
napalm on insurgent positions and said 300 government troops 
defected to the guerrillas on saturday 
in neighboring pakistan a foreign ministry official denied a 
report in sundays editions of the new york times that pakistan 
directs the guerrillas operations and had ordered them to attack 
jalalabad 
the city is 40 miles west of pakistan where most afghan 
guerrillas are based and 75 miles east of kabul 
pakistan ordered the attack on jalalabad following a march 5 
meeting attended by us ambassador robert oakley the times quoted 
a pakistani participant and other officials as saying jalalabad 
was attacked march 6 
oakleys office on sunday referred all questions to kent obee 
chief of the us information service in islamabad obee refused 
comment 
there is no truth in the report said a senior diplomat in 
the pakistan foreign ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity 
afghans are very independent people they do not take 
orders from anyone regarding their own affairs much less about the 
conduct of fighting in their country the official said 
but diplomats in kabul speaking on condition of anonymity said 
there were deep divisions within pakistans military and government 
on whether the guerrillas should have tried to take the city which 
government troops have successfully defended 
the diplomats said up to 8000 guerrillas have died in the 
battle for jalalabad compared to 2000 government soldiers 
one diplomat termed the offensive a suicide mission he said 
there were 12000 guerrillas around the city compared with 20000 
government soldiers the times reported that no afghans were 
present at the march 5 meeting of senior pakistani military and 
civilian officials guerrilla sources said sunday they were unaware 
of any such meeting 
pakistan is headquarters for a sevenparty guerrilla alliance 
and its inter services intelligence agency has distributed billions 
of dollars in us military aid to the insurgents over the past 
decade 
the guerrillas began fighting after marxists took control of the 
afghan government in a 1978 coup soviets troops intervened a year 
later and stayed for nine years to prop up the communists 
shortly after soviet forces completed their withdrawal on feb 
15 several rebel commanders said jalalabad would be their first 
offensive 
president najib of afghanistan has repeatedly accused pakistan 
of violating the unsponsored accord that led the way for the 
soviet withdrawal 
defense minister shah nawaz tanai in remarks released sunday 
said the pakistani side should keep in mind that its soil will 
come to lie under afghanistans rocket strikes 
a foreign ministry spokesman said at least 265 people were 
killed most of them guerrillas and 123 injured sunday in 
jalalabad khost kandahar and herat at least 12 people died in 
rocket attacks in northern kabul official radio kabul reported 
the claims could not be independently verified 
heavy fighting in jalalabad khost and kandahar also was 
reported by the guerrillarun afghan news agency in islamabad 
pakistan although it gave no casualties 
the agency did claim today that soviet aircraft were dropping 
napalm and other bombs on guerrilla positions in the afghan 
province of badakshan it said there were heavy civilian losses 
guerrillas previously have reported the use of soviet and indian 
pilots by afghanistan kabul moscow and new delhi all have denied 
the charges 
the guerrilla leaders also claimed that two regiments comprising 
300 men of the afghan army defected to the guerrillas with a large 
quantity of arms in northwestern badghis province on saturday 
the agency also said guerrillas friday attacked the large bagram 
afghan air force base about 30 miles north of kabul killing 25 
government soldiers

more than 1000 united mine workers 
blocked two mines and a coal plant today as the union escalated its 
3weekold strike against the pittston coal group the union also 
walked off the job at a second company 
umw officials said miners their spouses and retirees who began 
blocking the pittston mine and plant entrances before dawn would 
remain until removed by police 
were going to let our rear ends touch the asphalt and were 
not going to move said marty hudson executive assistant to umw 
vice president cecil roberts were going to let the county feed 
us awhile 
also today about 750 miners stopped work at westmoreland coal 
co by opting en masse to take days off allowed in their contract 
the union said 
umw district 28 president jackie stump said union president 
richard trumka called the work stoppage at westmorelands virginia 
mines in part because the company is suspected of filling coal 
orders for strikehobbled pittston 
some 1400 pittston employees in virginia and 300 in west 
virginia went on strike april 5 accusing the company of unfair 
practices during contract talks the miners had been working 
without a contract since february 1988 
each and every company is going to be looked at whether or not 
theyre filling pittstons orders stump said if they are we 
consider it to be a conspiracy to break the union 
steve anderson spokesman for westmoreland said the mass use of 
personal days was unfortunate he denied westmoreland was 
filling pittston orders 
we and pittston are highly highly competitive with each 
other anderson said its highly unlikely that pittston would 
ask us to fill their contracts 
the union said the stoppage at westmoreland would last through 
wednesday as each miner takes three personal days off under their 
contract each worker gets 10 a year 
outside the pittston plant and mines many strikers rid 
themselves of all forms of identification to prepare for arrest 
state police and company guards looked on from across the street

only one of four helium balloons in 
an 83yearold distance race founded by an adventureloving 
newspaper publisher remained aloft today floating over wyoming 650 
miles from the starting point 
the silvery jura piloted by karl spenger and roland schuler 
was spotted at 11000 feet at 540 am 20 miles from rock 
springs wyo race spokesman harlan jost said 
last years winner the bright yellow rosie ogrady touched 
down at 5 am in evanston wyo about 600 miles from the starting 
point while the other two entries gave up sunday afternoon in 
california and arizona jost said 
but jost said a winner will not be declared until all the 
balloons have landed because winds might blow the balloon back

the remains of burnt cars and shattered 
window frames are being cleared from the streets of jordans 
riotswept southern towns 
but people say the anger that brought four days of violence last 
week because of governmentimposed austerity measures will not 
disappear so easily 
jordan has in recent years escaped most of the middle easts 
turmoil so last weeks outbreak of discontent came as a shock 
the rioters want things to get better in jordan said a 
25yearold man from the city of kerak who said he was among the 
stonethrowers who attacked government buildings and banks 
residents interviewed during a twoday tour of the south said 
they want a rollback on the price increases that set off the riots 
a new government and an investigation into corruption 
they blame prime minister zaid rifai for the economic crisis and 
have called for his ouster sources said rifai offered to step down 
and king hussein today accepted his resignation there was no 
official announcement 
the riots in which least eight people were killed started in 
maan the citys downtown area is now a blight of twisted 
electricity pylons severed tree limbs and burnt rubber tires 
soldiers in armored personnel carriers enforce the calm there 
have been no recent confrontations and a 24hour curfew has been 
eased to allow people to buy food 
but authorities are still cautious 
vehicles passing on the main northsouth desert highway are all 
flagged down and a reporter who turned off the road was escorted 
back 
elsewhere in the region soldiers riding jeeps mounted with 
machine guns patrol the streets of the larger towns 
government institutions at even the smallest crossroads were not 
spared in the outbreak of violence the eightroom schoolhouse in 
the hamlet of athween was sacked its little desks spread out in 
the dirt courtyard outside 
in buysara a burned toyota land cruiser and dirt roadblocks 
marked the village entrance 
the roads around the town of shobak were studded by uprooted 
roadsigns and boulders rolled into place by protesters 
residents of shobak said they were particularly angered when 
local press reports passed off the first riots in maan on tuesday 
with a onesentence reference to a demonstration by taxi drivers 
against the 25 percent increase in the price of gasoline 
the government first said it was just the drivers problem 
the drivers problem is one out of 100 said ibrahim a 
government employee who did not want to use his family name 
the government raised prices between 10 percent and 50 percent 
on cigarettes gasoline and other commodities as part of an 
agreement with the international monetary fund to help reschedule 
jordans 6 billion foreign debt 
shobak residents said the riot started with three or four 
villagers on the main street denouncing the price increases the 
three or four swelled to three or four hundred and the anger 
mounted 
town headman hussein tayat expressed the citizens feelings this 
way they the government are thieves 
in the town of about 14000 at least 40 percent of the people 
are without a regular source of income he said adding how can 
they live 
young men gathered behind the headman chimed in as he talked 
put the embezzlers before the judge 
bring the money back from geneva 
we are not against the king just the corrupt policies 
said ibrahim we had so much money coming into the country 
where did it go 
residents discount charges that the riots were fomented by 
underground opposition to the government 
the beginning of the riots were from the people not political 
movements said the kerak resident 
there was no need to organize said a telephone clerk in 
buysara the prices went up in all places 
he said government employees living on an average of 100 dinars 
185 a month were painfully aware of each price increase 
the rioters are a little ashamed of the damage but as the kerak 
man put it it was necessary to scold the government 
elsewhere in jordan shock was mixed with support 
its strange for jordan its a small country its all one 
family said abdul razak tubeshat mayor of the northern town of 
irbid we discuss we dont destroy 
but an amman man who would not give his name enumerated his 
grievances at living on 80 dinars 148 a month 
i feel like rioting he said

vice president dan quayle leaving on a whirlwind 
trip to australia and southeast asia said today the united states 
intends to remain a pacific power despite arguments by 
declinists that the nation must pull back from our global 
commitments 
rather he told the annual meeting of the associated press the 
challenge for the united states is to advance our strategic and 
economic interest in asia while maintaining our continuing 
commitments to europe 
he said that in the united states and its pacific allies there 
is an undercurrent of gloominess with some observers he did not 
name any predicting a grim future for the united states 
the united states they say is a nation in decline the 
budget deficit and the trade deficit are symptoms of a deeper 
malaise if we are to avoid disaster we must pull back from 
our global commitments 
in a nutshell this is the argument of the socalled 
declinists 
so quayle said an important purpose of his 12day trip is to 
address these concerns headon i will be reminding our asian 
friends that the current wave of declinist thought in the united 
states is hardly a new phenomenon 
yet quayle said when americans express doubt about the health 
of the american society its usually a sign of renewal not of 
decline by recognizing the countrys problems the united states 
is spurred to take remedial action he said 
as for defense quayle said the united states will continue to 
pursue a vigorous security role in asia 
he said the soviet union recognizing the failure of its 
economic system is looking toward asia soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev is due to visit china next month for the first 
sinosoviet summit meeting in 20 years 
we recognize the soviet interest in sharing in asias economic 
boom and in increasing its access to the region but moscow has a 
long way to go to achieve this goal he said 
he said moscow continues to modernize its military force 
capabilities in asia and the pacific where the largest of the 
soviet fleets remains stationed 
with the emergence of asian nations quayle said the challenge 
to the united states is to advance our strategic and economic 
interests in asia while maintaining our continuing commitments to 
europe 
he said im going to the pacific because the united states is 
a great power because the united states is a pacific power and 
because we intend to play an important role in the pacific 
he told the ap meeting that like the president i recognize 
that our future and the future of the pacific rim nations are 
closely entwined that is why the united states is focusing on the 
region as never before 
he noted that the asian nations have thriving free enterprise 
economies with the members of the association of southeast asian 
nations making up what would be the united states seventh largest 
trading partner 
quayle said the united states will engage in bilateral efforts 
necessary for opening foreign markets to us goods and services 
open and free trade are the hallmark of a us policy needed to 
promote our competitiveness and the welfare of the american 
people he said 
answering questions after his speech quayle said his biggest 
surprise since taking office was how much he enjoys overseas travel 
the vice president who visited central and south america soon 
after he was inaugurated said most of his trips as senator had 
been back home to indiana 
he also said he had been in daily close contact with president 
bush i see how he formulates his policies quayle said im 
there to give my opinion 
and asked if embattled house speaker jim wright should step 
down while fighting ethics charges quayle answered jim wright 
will make that decision 
on his trip to asia quayle will mix substantive policy 
discussions particularly dealing with trade and defense with 
ceremonial duties and tourism 
flying to asia he wil pay a courtesy call on former president 
reagan in los angeles on the return trip the vice president plans 
to tour alaskas wildliferich prince william sound to see for 
himself the cleanup efforts following the exxon valdez oil spill 
besides australia quayle will visit indonesia singapore and 
thailand 
quayle accompanied by his wife marilyn will spend five days 
in australia representing president bush at this years celebration 
of australianamerican friendship week 
in talks with australian officials in canberra the vice 
president will explore bilateral issues such as trade defense and 
space cooperation aide david beckwith said said as chairman of 
the national space council quayle is charged with promoting 
advancement of the us space program 
the quayles will also do some sightseeing visiting the great 
barrier reef the coral reefs that abound with marine life off 
australias northeast corner the site is one of the countrys most 
popular tourist attractions 
the visit to jakarta indonesia is mostly a chance for quayle 
to get acquainted with the heavily populated island nation which 
like singapore and thailand is a member of the association of 
southeast asian nations beckwith said 
trade issues are at the top of quayles list in talking with 
leaders of the asean nations beckwith said in the past the 
united states has urged asian nations to end the high tariffs and 
import restrictions that stifle free trade 
the vice president also plans to meet with prince norodom 
sihanouk cambodias former head of state and leader of one of four 
factions vying for power in that country in his 1 days in jakarta 
indeed a key theme on quayles agenda is cambodia a 
warravaged country whose future remains uncertain the united 
states is weighing whether to provide military assistance to 
noncommunist factions after vietnam ends its 10year occupation of 
the country this fall 
were talking cambodia heavily in thailand and to some extent 
in all the countries because if there is any policy development 
its going to be in the cambodia position because its wide open 
now beckwith said 
in thailand the vice president will tour a cambodian refugee 
camp populated by people who fled their country some during the 
brutal khmer rouge regime between 19751978 
earlier this year quayle a former indiana senator visited 
several countries in latin and central america on his first foreign 
mission

marovitz who performed the same service for the late richard j 
daley six times 
the younger daley campaigned on a promise to operate a more 
accessible government in the nations thirdlargest city than did 
his father who as mayor ran a political machine powered by 
democratic patronage he died in 1976 
you dont hand down policies from generation to generation 
the younger daley said but you do hand down values he said 
his father had instilled in him a love for this city and a zest 
for public service

a former democratic leader who switched to the gop 
at todays ceremony sawyer congratulated daley and offered a 
suggestion one thing that chicago needs more than anything else 
and that is your strong aggressive leadership to make this one 
city one people working together 
paul green a political science professor at governors state 
university said that because of patronagelimiting court 
decisions the younger daley would not be able to run things as his 
father did even if he wanted 
hes not going back to the golden era of the machine because 
that era and the machine are dead green said 
the vote for daley was largely split along racial lines with 
some blacks warning that daley would revive machine politics but

and of course i think of the man i served for eight years 
ronald reagan his commitment to his beliefs his great faith in 
the american people and the unshakable optimism he brought to the 
job 
the opportunities open to us today were made possible by the 
peace and prosperity ronald reagan left as his legacy 
we used to hear a lot about the presidency being too big for one 
man 
that talk stopped with ronald reagan 
different men different methods different circumstances proof 
as i see it that the presidency is ample enough to accommodate 
the strengths and styles of our nations rich political history 
in the past three months these thoughts have framed my own 
approach in dealing with the pressing problems that confront us 
some of them decades in the making and in working to put the 
united states on a steady course for the decade ahead and the new 
century beyond it 
the first step in every initiative ive undertaken is to square 
our actions with enduring american principles 
whatever the problem we can count on public support so long 
as our policy and principles share a common root 
those principles are 
freedom for individuals for nations selfdetermination and 
democracy 
fairness equal standards equal opportunity a chance for each 
of us to achieve and make our way on our own merits 
strength in international affairs strength our allies can 
count on and our adversaries must respect and at home strength 
and a sense of selfconfidence in carrying forward our nations 
work 
excellence as the underlying goal in the collective efforts we 
undertake and accountability for the work we do and in the 
workings of government a firm sense of the responsibilities and 
powers of government and the private sphere that lies beyond its 
limits 
my starting point has been a respect for american institutions 
for congress for the dedicated civil servants of the executive 
branch for state and local governments for the concept of public 
service and a firm belief in the powers of the presidency 
each has its role each can be enlisted in the work at hand 
the emphasis is on cooperation not confrontation as the 
surest route to progress 
ive read more than a few news stories before and after the 
election that said the president and the congress wouldnt be 
able to work together that the bitter campaign had made 
cooperation impossible 
i didnt believe that then and were proving it wrong now 
when i took office i told the congress that the american people 
hadnt sent us to washington to bicker 
they sent us to govern to work together to solve the urgent 
problems that confront us and to shape the longterm strategies to 
ensure peace and prosperity in the future

two top west german officials ran into stiff 
us resistance today as they met with secretary of state james a 
baker iii and defense secretary dick cheney to press for an early 
round of negotiations with the soviet union aimed at reducing 
shortrange nuclear missiles 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and defense minister 
gerhard stoltenberg held hurriedly arranged talks at the state 
department on the touchy issue of nato missile deployment 
as they met margaret tutwiler the department spokeswoman 
quoted baker as saying it would be a mistake to hold such 
negotiations and that he thought the problem should be worked out 
with the west germans before the north atlantic treaty organization 
summit meeting in brussels at the end of may 
president bush who will meet in the belgian capital with the 
western leaders said he had appealed to west german chancellor 
helmut kohl that we keep nato together that we stay together 
bush who was traveling outside washington said kohl who has 
sought a delay in modernizing the usbuilt lance missiles 
knows my view that there must not be any unilateal fait accompli 
here 
the presidents national security assistant brent scowcroft 
attended the talks baker and cheney held with the two west german 
ministers bush spoke with kohl by telephone last friday 
the united states and britain are concerned that negotiating the 
missiles issue with the soviets could lead to stripping the nato 
allies of their groundbased nuclear weaponry leaving them at the 
mercy of stronger warsaw pact conventional forces 
baker was expected to underscore this position to the west 
germans while british prime minister margaret thatcher will fly to 
bonn on sunday to try to dissuade kohl 
the idea of holding talks on the missiles has gained favor 
recently in west germany where the government coalition headed by 
kohl is facing an erosion of popularity and is under extreme 
pressure to push for the talks 
the missiles are a subject of irritation in west germany 
because of their short range the nucleartipped missiles are 
designed to be used almost exclusively on west german territory 
also the german public has been expressing waning interest in 
deploying a new generation of missiles while soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev has been cutting back his forces in eastern europe 
diplomatic sources told the associated press that the german 
officials had requested a meeting with bush because of the 
importance of their mission 
bush however went today to norfolk va for the uss iowa 
memorial service so a quickly arranged luncheon with the secretary 
of state was sought instead 
the diplomatic sources who asked not to be identified by name 
said the request for the meetings was made on friday the 
announcement that the meeting had been scheduled came just a few 
hours later 
the request came one day after north atlantic treaty 
organization defense ministers in brussels ended a twoday session 
by sidestepping the shortrange missile quandary 
the united states and britain argued in favor of producing and 
deploying a more modern version of the missile while the several 
european nations pressed for early negotiations with the sovietled 
warsaw pact 
kohl wants nato to postpone a decision on modernizing the 
missiles until after his countrys national elections in december 
1990 
us officials agreed to delay such a decision but want to move 
forward on research and development of the newer version 
officials on both sides of the atlantic are expressing fears 
that the alliance will not be able to forge a common approach on 
the matter prior to the summit of nato leaders scheduled to be held 
in may 
a clash over the issue is expected to come to a head soon 
because few want a crisis to mar president bushs debut session 
with the leaders of the alliance which is also celebrating its 
40th anniversary this year 
the may 2930 session in brussels is designed to forge a 
blueprint for the 16nation pacts future arms control strategy 
the missile decision is also an issue of vital domestic 
political importance to the kohl government 
the state department meeting comes in the wake of talks held 
among the leaders of the west german governments governing 
coalition parties at that meeting the leaders of bavarias 
conservative christian social union party agreed to drop their 
longstanding opposition to early talks on the missiles 
the group also supported kohls view that the west german 
government need not decide on the deployment of the modernized 
weapons until 1991 or 1992 
kohls christian democratic union has suffered badly in recent 
local elections and has been trailing the leftleaning social 
democrats since the first of the year in nationwide polls

i think the work weve done these past three months demonstrates 
the value of tough principled negotiations between this 
administration and the congress 
the bipartsian budget agreement we worked out 10 days ago is a 
key example 
that agreement ahead of schedule on target with grammrudman 
and with my no new taxes pledge intact is a strong first step 
towards dealing with the deficit problem and keeping our economy 
76 straight months of expanding uninterrupted growth on track 
difficult decisions lie ahead but an important agreement has 
been achieved 
and of course there is the accord we reached on central america 
the people of nicaragua like their neighbors in the region 
like people everywhere deserve to live in peace with freedom 
the united states is now speaking with one voice and standing 
behind a plan that will put the sandinistas to the test 
and this unity has encouraged leaders like president arias to 
give strong support to us policy 
and in three short months weve made a good start coming to 
grips with issues demanding urgent attention and decisive action 
and weve taken that action action to stabilize the troubled 
savings and loan system 
the reform plan i sent to congress will restore stability and 
put the sampl system back on its feet in sound fiscal order 
my plan guarantees that depositors will be fully protected 
the sampl system must be reformed so that the questionable 
practices and outright illegalities that caused the crisis will not 
happen again and those sampl officials found guilty of criminal 
actions will be punished for the losses they have caused 
last week the senate passed my plan 91 to 8 
i urge the house to act promptly and pass this sampl reform bill 
with its central provisions intact 
action to strengthen ethics in government the ethics reforms 
ive sent to capitol hill this month will uphold honesty and 
integrity in government service and apply an evenhanded ethics 
standard across all branches of government 
action in the war on drugs where were advancing on all fronts 
education treatment interdiction and tougher law enforcement 
the antidrug effort will receive almost 1 billion in 
additional funding in 1990 a 21 percent increase in outlays over 
what well spend in 1989 
weve imposed a temporary ban on the import of certain 
semiautomatic rifles weapons all too often used in drugrelated 
killings 
and were tackling the drug epidemic in the district of 
columbia a test case for a full range of innovative antidrug 
measures 
of course dealing with problems that demand immediate attention 
is only part of the picture 
we need to look to the long term as well to focus now on the 
kind of future we want to see for ourselves and our nation 
investing in that future is high on our national agenda

president bush said monday he has 
not talked with anyone about whether he would pardon fired white 
house aide oliver north and that any suggestions about what hell 
do are stupid and idiotic 
bush said he has not had any conversations direct or indirect 
about whether he would pardon north who is awaiting a verdict from 
jurors on charges stemming from the diversion of iran arms sales 
profits to the icaraguan contras 
the president made the comments in a questionandanswer session 
with five reporters accompanying him on a flight from norfolk va 
to chicago 
in the past bush has called north a hero and said he hoped 
north would be acquitted 
he was asked about a report in newsweek magazine quoting sources 
close to him as predicting he would never pardon north onetime 
aide on the national security council in ronald reagans white 
house 
thats interesting speculation bush said it shows how 
stupid some reports are because that matter has never been 
discussed with me by anybody including my wife 
it shows you how idiotic speculation is if it was given any 
credence as having come from me or as if somebody had discussed it 
with me they simply havent he said 
told that the report quoted sources as merely predicting what 
bush would do he said oh well thats a different story 
i havent discussed it nor shared my thoughts with anybody i 
dont have any thoughts until i get the facts bush said 
a reporter suggested that as a practical matter the president 
might be reluctant to get involved while the legal process was 
going forward 
thats got it youve got it he said 
asked if he would talk about the matter after a verdict bush 
said maybe when everythings over

a woman who says drinking during pregnancy caused 
birth defects in her son is suing the makers of jim beam bourbon 
for not putting warning labels on its bottles 
jury selection in the lawsuit filed by candace and harold thorp 
began today in federal court 
the couples 4yearold son michael was born mentally 
retarded neurologically impaired developmentally stunted with 
facial and other body malformations according to the lawsuit 
the thorps sued the james b beam distillery co of deerfield 
ill claiming it should have provided labels warning that alcohol 
can cause birth defects 
twentynine potential jurors were called today by late morning 
at least five had been dismissed including two men who described 
themselves as former alcoholics and a woman who said she had been a 
bartender for many years 
mrs thorp said in court documents she drank up to a half a 
fifth per day of jim beam bourbon while she was pregnant and didnt 
know her drinking would damage her child 
attorneys for the company said beam does not concede that 
maternal alcohol consumption causes birth defects or that michael 
thorpes alleged birth defects were caused by alcohol 
the company also asserted in court papers that washington state 
law governing product liability does not require manufacturers to 
issue warnings of risks that are considered generally known by 
the community 
beam had no duty to warn candace thorp that drinking during 
pregnancy might injure her unborn child the defense attorneys 
stated 
a federal law effective in november will require labels on all 
beer wine or hard liquor that alcohol can cause health problems 
and birth defects 
an estimated 30000 children are born each year nationwide with 
fetal alcohol syndrome according to a 1982 study by researchers at 
the university of washingtons alcohol and drug abuse institute

herbert von karajan the renowned 
conductor of the berlin philharmonic for 35 years announced monday 
he was resigning because of failing health 
in a letter to west berlin authorities the 81yearold maestro 
said his medical problems make it impossible for me to fulfill my 
obligations and complained that berlin officials had failed to 
make clear what they expected of him 
berlins cultural affairs senator anke martiny said karajan 
informed her of his decision in a letter received monday from his 
home in salzburg austria where the conductor has been confined by 
his illnesses 
the results of the medical examinations which now have 
stretched for weeks make it impossible for me to fulfill my 
obligations he said in the letter released in salzburg where he 
was born 
karajans resignation leaves open one of the most coveted 
conductors posts in the world 
i respect this decision by herbert von karajan which comes 
for health reasons ms martiny told the associated press 
i hope that karajans friends in berlin will have one more 
opportunity to see him conducting the berlin philharmonic in a 
farewell performance ms martiny said 
karajans letter said that despite repeated requests the former 
berlin administration had failed to make clear what his rights and 
responsibilities as conductor for life involved 
i must also point out that for years i have asked your 
predecessors to finally make clear my duties and rights karajan 
wrote to ms martiny a social democrat who has been cultural 
senator for two months although i have asked repeatedly to date 
this has not come forth 
ursula vogel an aide to ms martiny said the decision on a 
successor would be made by the orchestra administration with the 
choice to be confirmed by berlin officials 
no one at the berlin philharmonic office was available to 
discuss possible replacements for karajan said a man who answered 
the telephone monday 
two names karajan himself has mentioned as potential successors 
are sovietborn semyon bychkov and italys carlo maria giulini 
karajan has long been in poor health having suffered a stroke 
failing vision chronic back problems and circulatory problems he 
has undergone at least five operations in the past 12 years and has 
been visibly hindered since undergoing surgery in 1983 
he walks with difficulty and has required a supporting chair 
behind the conducting pulpit for more than two years 
he has canceled a number of performances over the past few years 
and become increasingly reclusive venturing from his salzburg home 
infrequently 
the absences exacerbated criticism of the conductor who has 
long been the subject of controversy because of his nazi party 
membership during adolf hitlers third reich and the reputedly 
lavish terms of his contract 
the west german weekly magazine der spiegel has said karajan 
earns more than 6 million a year from his recordings as well as 
his salary from the statesupported berlin philharmonic 
karajan wrote to berlin authorities in february asking that they 
ease his contractual obligations because of his poor state of 
health 
the cultural affairs department agreed to reduce the conductors 
schedule from 12 concerts per year to six but karajan has not 
returned to berlin to conduct the orchestra since the revision was 
agreed to

the united states must seize opportunities to strengthen and 
support developments that advance the cause of freedom and we 
will 
weve made a good start these first three months and theres 
more to come 
the completion of our defense and foreign policy reviews in late 
may draft legislation for a new clean air act a new strategy to 
curb the increased use of lethal weapons by drug dealers and other 
criminals and new initiatives to combat the problem of 
homelessness in america all are on the near horizon 
you know some of my toughest critics arent members of the 
media quite often theyre the children who write to me at the 
white house 
i want to share with you a letter from a young fellow a 
seventhgrader from torrance calif 
he wrote asking me to take action on pollution toxic waste 
smog littering a very detailed list of environmental concerns 
he says in his letter i am not saying youre doing a bad job 
but could you put a little more effort into it 
now i want you to know when that letter was written jan 20 
1989 inauguration day 
i dont know whether ive managed to satisfy the young man who 
wrote that letter but i can say i got his message 
as ive said before i am a practical man i like whats real 
im not much for the airy and abstract 
i like what works 
theres a running debate on what it takes to move a nation 
forward 
some say its ideology that matters 
some say its a question of competence 
others say that issues are the issue 
but the fact is what it takes to move a nation cant be 
captured in one word 
its a matter of principles and performance ideology and 
action on the issues 
this administration understands that the american people expect 
all of these and something more 
they expect results 
so while im pleased with all weve accomplished in these three 
months theres a long road ahead of us 
im optimistic that our reforms will produce lasting results 
that the longrange planning we do today will pay off in the future 
but most of all this nation is ready to move forward to meet 
the central challenges we face keeping america free prosperous 
and at peace tomorrow and into the century ahead

students at most beijing colleges exuberantly 
began a class boycott monday to press for sweeping democratic 
reforms and they tried through speeches and posters to enlist 
workers in the cause 
authorities took no open steps to interfere but sources said 
more than 10000 soldiers from outlying counties moved into beijing 
over the weekend in preparation for an eventual crackdown 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
troops had been used in the past to quash civil unrest some 
student leaders said they feared imminent arrest 
the exact number of participants in the boycott was not known 
but students at a dozen schools with total enrollment of more than 
50000 said virtually all their classmates were striking 
the boycott was the largest in 40 years of communist rule even 
though there were no reports of students joining in other cities as 
the student activists hoped 
now is the time for all students in beijing and nationwide to 
united to fight for democracy a student speaker at qinghua 
university yelled from a bannerstrewn dormitory balcony to about 
1500 wildly cheering listeners he proclaimed the balcony a free 
speech platform and invited orators with all views 
students from several schools marched around campus and on 
nearby streets gave speeches on street corners and plastered 
copies of the first edition of their own newspaper on lampposts and 
trees to publicize their demands for press freedom an end to 
official privileges and corruption and respect for human rights 
the boycott marks a new phase in the campaign after a week in 
which the students mourning the death of former reformist party 
chief hu yaobang tried to confront the leadership directly they 
marched repeatedly to central beijings tiananmen square and tried 
to storm communist party headquarters 
top officials who have begun marketstyle economic reforms but 
insist china is not ready for democracy refused to meet with them 
student leaders stressed monday they wanted their protest to be 
peaceful and legal and that they were not seeking to overthrow the 
government or party 
however many students said they want premier li peng to resign 
along with other officials they consider inept or too old several 
posters even called for the complete retirement of senior leader 
deng xiaoping 84 who still wields power from behind the secnes 
we havent really thought about who would take their places 
said an english student at beijing normal university 
several posters attacked nepotism listing the names of 
relatives of top leaders who have been given government jobs one 
referred to dengs son head of the china welfare fund for the 
disabled as prince deng pufang 
at qinghua university known as a training ground for chinas 
technocrats a school announcement carried over loudspeakers said 
officials opposed the boycott and wanted students to calm down 
it added we want to make clear that the school has always 
cherished the students even though some are engaging in activities 
of which it does not approve 
the staterun xinhua news agency sought to minimize the strike 
saying teaching and studying at most of the citys colleges and 
universities remained normal it did not mention the reason for 
the boycott 
however the neighborhood in northwestern beijing where the 
largest universities are located was turned monday into a huge 
debating ground with clusters of students distributing leaflets 
and earnestly telling passersby about police beatings of student 
protesters last week 
efforts to enlist the support of workers begun sunday were 
stepped up 
workers listen to us shouted one philosophy student to a 
crowd of about 500 people we are fighting for the rights of all 
chinese 
at the peoples university one student put a tape player in his 
dormitory window overlooking the street and played political 
speeches made in recent days including one criticizing li peng as 
inept a crowd of nearly 1000 people formed to listen blocking 
traffic 
about 1000 students from the beijing foreign languages college 
marched from school to school to encourage fellow strikers more 
than 1200 students from the central college of minorities marched 
to nearby peoples university to read posters there 
chen mingyuan a wellknown researcher at the chinese academy of 
social sciences spoke at qinghua and beijing universities to 
encourage the students 
maybe there are some plainclothes police here he told a 
qinghua crowd if they are trying to take down the names of all 
of us then their lot is hard indeed the crowd roared with 
laughter 
most students said they planned to boycott classes until may 4 
the 70th anniversary of chinas first student movement that 
campaign also fought for democracy while galvanizing the entire 
nation in opposition to japanese encroachments on chinese soil 
but the current student movement also showed serious 
organizational weakness monday when student leaders at beijing 
university began quarreling openly during a rally of about 5000 
students they disagreed on whether sitins and other 
confrontational tactics should be resumed 
there were no reports of new student activities in other cities 
monday foreign sources reported new looting sunday night in the 
central city of changsha in hunan province where young toughs 
mixed in with a student protest saturday and went on a rampage 
nonstudents also rioted after a student gathering saturday in 
the northwestern tourist city of xian

psychiatrists are up in arms about a new law 
allowing the military to train its psychologists to prescribe 
powerful drugs for depression and mental illness 
its the newest battlefield for a longrunning dispute over who 
is qualified to write prescriptions psychiatrists who have 
medical degrees say their qualifications are indispensable but 
psychologists who dont have mds suggest money is really at 
the heart of efforts to keep them out 
currently no state permits psychologists to prescribe 
psychotropic drugs which range from mild tranquilizers to 
antipsychotic medications that can affect the cardiovascular and 
motor systems 
the new provision on military psychologists pushed by sen 
daniel k inouye dhawaii was included in a housesenate 
conference report on the fiscal year 1989 appropriation for the 
defense department congress approved the measure sept 30 1988 
and it was signed by thenpresident reagan the next day 
given the importance of addressing battle fatigue the 
conferees agree that the department should establish a 
demonstration pilot training program under which military 
psychologists may be trained and authorized to issue appropriate 
psychotropic medications under certain circumstances according 
to a legislative report accompanying the provision 
courtney welton an army spokesman said the service is 
considering the issue including training procedures but he did 
not know when such a program might be begun 
inouyes efforts on behalf of psychologists have been spurred by 
his administrative assistant patrick deleon a trained 
psychologist and member of the board of the american psychological 
association 
deleon in a written presentation last december said it is 
absurd to put it mildly to proclaim that one needs to go to 
medical school and take all of their courses in order to write 
prescriptions for psychotropic drugs 
in a telephone interview deleon said the defense department 
seems a perfect place for this expansion of psychologists 
authority to prescribe drugs because of its training facilities and 
a high incidence of mental health problems in the military 
thats not how the medical community sees it 
to attempt to provide military psychologists with prescribing 
privileges without accredited medical education and postgraduate 
clinical residence training trivializes medical diagnosis and 
judgment said dr melvin shabshin medical director of the 
american psychiatric association 
dr donald bennett director of the drug division at the 
american medical association said simply we think it is 
inappropriate for psychologists to prescribe psychoactive drugs 
these drugs are not to be used lightly added dr donald 
klein a professor of psychiatry at columbia university one 
hazard he said is the potential interactions between the 
psychiatric drugs and medical drugs those interactions at times 
can be dangerous 
the group that represents the nations 50000 licensed 
psychologists the american psychological association says 
americas roughly 34000 psychiatrists oppose the measure for 
selfish monopolistic reasons 
they dont even want it studied said bryant welch 
executive director of the psychological associations professional 
practices division the reason they are doing this is to protect 
their own pocketbooks 
meantime deleon who has worked for inouye for 16 years and 
also holds a law degree has been a key person in the drive to 
broaden the role of psychologists 
the bottom line of what we are trying to do is basically to 
improve the quality of mental health care he said everything 
is coming back to that 
as an active member of the psychological association deleon has 
traveled and given speeches at the groups expense according to 
his 1987 financial disclosure form the latest ones available 
he visited hawaii new orleans and new york that year with the 
association picking up the tab for lodging and meals the group 
also paid air travel between washington and hawaii and new orleans 
deleon also collected 2500 from the association for editing a 
journal 
inouye said he wholeheartedly supports deleons activities on 
behalf of the psychological association 
i not only approve but encourage pat deleons membership on 
the apa board inouye said in a statement i am proud that his 
talents and expertise in the field of psychology are recognized by 
his peers 
deleon wrote last year that the top priority for our 
profession in 1989 is to enact a bill that would enable 
psychologists to receive direct payments from medicare for 
services the measure similiar to one introduced by inouye last 
year is expected to cost 10 million 
inouye who lost an arm fighting in world war ii is a member of 
the senate appropriations subcommittees on defense and labor 
health and human services

president bush in a television interview 
broadcast monday night said the three most pressing problems 
facing americas school are drugs drugs and drugs 
i hope thats not a frivolous answer he said but i want 
to say it that way because of the impact that drugs are having 
they have it on the morale of teachers they have it on discipline 
in the classroom they have the adverse impact on the areas 
that need help the most 
bush was interviewed for the fifth and last segment of 
learning in america a television series that concluded monday 
night on most public broadcasting service stations 
bush said he intends to be the education president despite 
limited federal resources mainly by giving moral support to the 
teachers parents states and cities that run the nations schools 
a lot of what a president can do is hortatory encourage the 
people that have the main responsibility for education bush 
told pbs correspondent roger mudd 
the president said he is trying to leave his mark on education 
despite the limits on federal aid and authority in the area because 
education holds the key it holds the key to a better life for 
our young people and it holds the key to the united states being 
competitive in world markets and it holds the key to whipping the 
problem of drug abuse 
bush said that teachers are never going to have it made in 
a financial sense but added that the nation must find some way to 
show them that we respect those who choose that profession and 
find ways to encourage more to do it 
in response to other questions bush promoted his education 
agenda which calls for greater accountability on the part of 
schools more liberal teacher certification policies and letting 
parents choose which public school their children attend he said 
giving parents that choice could help eliminate inequities that 
affect children in disadvantaged areas 
bushs comment came after mudd noted that a child in a ghetto 
high school in camden nj has less than 4000 spent on him 
while 7000 is spent on a child in affluent princeton nj 
the federal government cant smooth out everything like 
this bush said but he added that parental choice is one answer 
to such inequities they might not be able to move from camden to 
princeton but if we have this choice take hold they can move into 
a school that is less heavily impacted by drugs he said 
mudd also told bush that his presidential campaign slogan of 
read my lips no new taxes has been picked up by state 
legislators he said at least two governors have hit a stone wall 
in seeking new taxes to pay for education improvements 
so now we have the phenomenon of an education president being 
used as a cover to refuse to raise taxes to improve education 
mudd said 
bush replied that the federal government should hold the line 
on taxes and not create taxes that take away from the states 
resource base and so i would let each state governor obviously 
make his own decision or her own decision but i will not 
criticize nor extend the readmylips syndrome to every governor 
that is mandated to balance budgets

the university of utah chemist who claimed 
to have achieved nuclear fusion in a jar of water said he and his 
british colleague plan a new round of experiments to expand on 
their findings 
b stanley pons said one experiment will be five times larger 
than the tabletop apparatus he and martin fleischmann used 
i think this round of experiments will bring up a host of new 
data pons said before leaving for washington where he and 
fleischmann were to address a congressional committee about their 
work 
the two stunned the scientific world and provoked deep 
skepticism march 23 when they announced they had developed a fusion 
apparatus that produced four times the energy needed to power it 
fusion the process behind the sun and the hydrogen bomb 
releases energy by fusing atoms together nuclear fission the 
process used in nuclear reactors splits them apart 
scientists have long believed that fusion requires staggeringly 
high temperatures if pons claim of room temperature fusion is 
borne out it could open the door to a cheap and virtually 
unlimited source of energy 
groups of scientists around the world have claimed to have 
duplicated at least part of the experiment 
pons said up to 20 experiments would begin over the next two 
weeks among them will be tests of different metals than the 
palladium used in the original experiments and new designs for the 
apparatus

four people were arrested monday after 
they chained themselves to a concrete slab poured over the weekend 
in an effort to build a permanent toilet on universityowned 
peoples park 
the protesters were cited on misdemeanor charges of entering 
property with the intent to cause damage said sgt leroy pereira 
of the university of california at berkeley which owns the 
23acre lot 
campus workers later tore up the slab and carted it away there 
was no resistance by those arrested although officers had to use 
bolt cutters to remove them said pereira 
on thursday 50 people commemorating the 20th anniversary of the 
founding of the park started building the toilet only to have it 
torn up the next morning by campus workers and police they 
returned over the weekend 
the park had its beginning on april 20 1969 when activists 
began occupying the empty lot which had been bought by the 
university 10 months earlier the school intended to build student 
housing there 
a month later riots erupted as the campus fenced the lot and 
tore up shrubs and grass sod planted by the activists during the 
riots one man was killed an artist blinded and hundreds of others 
wounded by authorities 
the fence was torn down in 1972 by protesters and the 
university since then has allowed limited use of the land by the 
public with the condition that nothing permanent be built on it

new zealand prime minister david lange said 
monday he is not willing to buy an invitation to the white 
house at the expense of compromising his countrys antinuclear 
policies 
lange on a sixday visit to the united states said from new 
haven conn that he is not coming to washington because the 
us administration has been very straightforward its said that 
the price of coming to washington is having nuclear vessels in new 
zealand ports 
lange speaking on nbctvs today show before speaking at 
yale university said new zealand would welcome a political 
contact but not so as to buy our route to the white house we will 
not pay the price of having a nuclear policy in new zealand we 
wont have nuclear weapons in new zealand 
new zealand has banned visits by ships carrying nuclear weapons 
or powered by atomic reactors leading the united states in 1986 to 
suspend security guarantees for the pacific nation under terms of 
the anzus alliance between australia the united states and new 
zealand 
the united states refuses to confirm or deny the existence of 
nuclear weapons on its ships and planes a policy which has 
strained its relations with several allies including denmark 
lange said he was certain the us measures toward new zealand were 
designed to deter other countries from adopting similar 
antinuclear policies 
im sure that that was the concern of the united states 
lange said 
the united states continues to view new zealand as a friendly 
country but not an ally said a state department official who 
requested anonymity 
in addition to the diplomatic cooling lange said the united 
states has stopped sharing military intelligence information with 
new zealand 
but at most practical levels we have an extraordinarily good 
relationship with the united states i relish coming here a lot of 
americans relish going to new zealand lange said 
in fact trade between the two countries including us 
military sales has increased he said figures provided by the 
state department show us exports to new zealand rose from 933 
million in 1986 to 119 billion in 1988 imports rose from 908 
million to 123 billion in 1988 
but department officials said the increase was independent of 
strains in diplomatic relations and the united states had made a 
point of not allowing general relations to be soured by the 
political disagreement 
asked for his explanation of the strengthening economic ties 
between new zealand and the united states lange said you dont 
have to have the blessing of the united states and approval of your 
defense policies to make a living in this world i think the soviet 
union has demonstrated that

bipartisan agreements on the budget and contra aid but that 
difficult decisions lie ahead

period of remarkable change in international affairs and he 
referred to upcoming highlevel meetings with moscow a foreign 
policy review which some had hoped would be completed far earlier

during an address to publishers gathered for the annual luncheon of

service in norfolk va for the 47 sailors killed in the gun

president said 
we will not we cannot as long as we live know why god has 
called them home but of one thing we can be sure this world is a 
more peaceful place because of the uss iowa 
bushs voice cracked momentarily as he declared may god bless 
the uss iowa and all who walk her deck 
for most of the halfhour service bush and his wife barbara 
sat somberfaced among the families of the victims some of whom 
sobbed openly seated to bushs left was elbia martinez widow of 
seaman apprentice jose luis martinez jr of hidalgo texas seated 
to mrs bushs right was lisa everhart widow of seaman apprentice 
leslie allen everhart jr of cary nc 
afterwards the bushes walked among the families shaking their 
hands and offering condolences he gently kissed one woman mourner 
on the forehead and caressed another womans head in a tender hug 
bush smiled occasionally as he consoled the relatives and he 
explained to reporters later the bush familys not very good at 
that kind of thing anyway but youve got to deal with it youve 
got to show them some concern you know how you do it pray for 
strength 
i did choke up at the end but i did feel a kind of inner 
peace about the thing i felt i had to represent our country this 
one was tough 
despite the tragedy bush said the nation still needs 
battleships theyre a useful platform for our missiles he 
said theres a hell of a lot of firepower there i dont think 
the guns are obsolete the firepower is enormous and the accuracy 
is supposed to be pretty good 
beginning a fourday trip bush also planned stops today in 
bismarck nd and san jose calif the 100day mark of his 
administration falls on saturday and bush was expected to beat the 
drum for his presidency in a succession of outofwashington

one man bush said in his speech that talk stopped with ronald 
reagan

budget plan with congress designed to reduce the deficit 
difficult decisions lie ahead but an important agreement has 
been achieved he said 
moreover he noted the accord with capitol hill to continue the 
flow of humanitarian aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
of course dealing with problems that demand immediate 
attention is only part of the picture bush said we need to 
look to the longterm as well to focus now on the kind of future 
we want to see for ourselves and our nation

of remarkable change in international affairs change more 
wideranging and rapid than at any time in the postwar period

horizon 
pronouncing himself pleased with the first three months bush 
said theres a long road ahead of us im optimistic that our 
reforms will produce lasting results that the longrange planning 
we do today will pay off in the future 
in the text of his remarks at te norfolk naval air station bush 
said let me say to the iowa crew i understand your grief i 
too have stared at the empty bunks of lost shipmates and asked 
why however in delivering the speech he omitted the latter 
sentence

king hussein accepted the resignation of 
prime minister zaid rifai and his government today following bloody 
rioting over price increases 
the monarch did not name a new prime minister the official 
jordan television said 
the tv report carried an official statement saying hussein 
assigned secretariesgeneral of government ministries second in 
rank to appointed ministers to run the departments until a new 
government is formed 
sources said earlier today that rifai prime minister since 
1985 had offered his resignation and that hussein accepted it 
the four days of riots in which at least eight people died 
began tuesday in the southern city of maan and spread to dozens of 
cities and villages throughout the kingdom 
the official jordan news agency reported sunday that hussein had 
expressed his intention to deal with the roots of the problem and 
all the reasons and causes of the latest incidents within a short 
period of time 
many rioters chanted slogans calling for rifais ouster they 
also shouted their support for the king 
rifai has been widely blamed for falling living standards in 
jordan the annual per capita income has slumped from about 2000 
in the mid1980s to about 1200 
the government last year imposed import controls and austerity 
measures to help deal with mounting payments on a 6 billion debt 
the rioting was triggered by 10 percent to 50 percent increases 
in the prices of gasoline cigarettes and other commodities the 
price increases were carried out under an agreement with the 
international monetary fund to pave the way for rescheduling the 
debt payments 
rifai 52 was a boyhood friend of king hussein who became one 
of his most trusted advisers 
no jordanian prime minister served longer than rifai besides 
the term that began in april 1985 he also was prime minister from 
1973 to 1976 
educated at columbia and harvard rifai earlier served as 
ambassador to britain and as chief of the royal court 
his father samir served six terms as prime minister in the 
1940s 1950s and 1960s for a total of less than four years

the flintstones and old documentaries replaced 
sports and talk shows and the halfhour midday news shrank to 
eight minutes on bbctv and radio as thousands of employees staged 
a 24hour strike monday over pay 
half the nations noncable television two channels and all 
four of its national radio channels were disrupted by the 
cancellation or shortening of live programs said the publicly 
funded british broadcasting corp 
the three unions jointly organizing the strike estimated that 
19000 of the corporations 25000 employees stayed away from work 
in the first walkout at the bbc in four years 
they demanded a 16 percent pay increase to bring them in line 
with commercial broadcasting salaries the management has said it 
cannot give them more than a 7 percent raise 
we say to the management that if you care about public service 
broadcasting then pay the rate for the job deputy general 
secretary jake ecclestone told a rally of 400 strikers in west 
london 
the bbc is underpaying its staff because it chooses to 
underpay its staff he said 
demonstrations also were called for glasgow manchester 
birmingham belfast and other major cities and picket lines were 
set up in london 
the strike began at midnight silencing hourly radio newscasts 
between 1 am and 5 am on the light entertainment station radio 
2 top disc jockey chris stuart stayed away and the newscast was 
reduced to between two and five minutes 
on the 24hour radio 4 the main news station a repeat talk 
show replaced the popular today program a documentary was 
broadcast instead of a live consumer affairs show and an old 
program on cuba filled in for part of the midday news 
the walkout caused the cancellation of the world service radios 
global broadcasts of news commentary programs financial reports 
and daily review of the british press 
on television the flintstones cartoon anchored an eclectic 
lineup including a food show and a program on stuntman evel 
knievel instead of the main morning show breakfast time on 
bbc1 
bbc1 also showed wildlife footage instead of the world snooker 
championships and reduced its midday and evening halfhour news 
shows to eight minutes the strike was the second story on the 
evening news 
unions say the national average pay for a bbc journalist is 
29000 a year compared with 41000 in commercial radio or 
television radio and television pay grades at the bbc are the same 
a bbc radio engineer earns up to 18210 a year while a 
cameraman earns up to 20280 officials said star newscasters 
negotiate their pay individually 
but the bbc insists that because it exists on compulsory public 
subscriptions it cannot afford to pay raises of more than 7 percent 
the annual governmentset license fee for a blackandwhite tv 
is about 43 and about 113 for a color tv the bbc management 
says the fee has not risen in line with inflation and has left the 
corporation short of funds 
the strikers included 1200 journalists 3000 technicians 
about 1000 electricians and 13000 members of the broadcasting and 
entertainment trades alliance also represented were members of the 
association of cinematograph television and allied technicians

here is a transcript of president bushs remarks 
monday at the annual luncheon of the associated press 
thank you bill 
thank you all ladies and gentlemen 
thank you very much continued applause 
thank you all for that warm welcome 
and my friend bill keating friend from congress days thank you 
for that most generous introduction 
i also want to thank your able i dont know whether i should 
say leaders or deputies at the associated press lou boccardi 
sitting over here and jim tomlinson and thank them and you for 
including me in this ap luncheon given at the time of the 
newspaper publishers association meeting 
and i also want to say how pleased i am to be with you once 
again 
ive just come from norfolk a very moving ceremony paying 
tribute to the 47 young men that died in the turret aboard iowa 
and it was indeed moving and it made me once again realize how 
precious human life is and how sometimes you cant control things 
the way youd like 
and that leads me to just say a word about terry anderson 
because in a meeting just now in the greeting by lou and bill 
keating they brought up with me once again with this sense of 
urgency that all in the associated press feel about terry anderson 
the question of the hostages 
and i just want to say without being able to give you any good 
news that we are concerned 
we will follow every intelligence lead 
we will go the extra mile to do what we can 
and i vowed when i came into the presidency not to talk about 
the burden of the presidency the loneliness of the job or the 
great toughness that nobody understands 
i learned that from my immediate predecessor 
eight years and i never once heard a call for call for 
sympathy or a call for understanding along those lines 
but i will say that when you do take that oath of office you 
do feel perhaps a disproportionate concern for a fallen sailor or 
an individual held hostage against his or her will anywhere in the 
world 
and so we will continue to keep this question of these hostages 
on the front burner 
i know the news business is a serious and sometimes 
extraordinarily dangerous business 
mark twain liked to recall that napoleon once shot at a magazine 
editor 
he missed him but killed a publisher laughter 
twain says it seems his aim was bad but his intentions were 
good laughter 
you all know jeffersons tribute to the importance of the press 
were it left for me to decide whether we should have a government 
without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should 
not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter 
and now despite the fact that there are days when i think that 
all we really need is the sports page laughter both of us 
government and the news media need one another 
we owe each other a measure of respect honesty and integrity 
equal to the work were engaged in 
and its been a little over three months since i took the oath 
of office and i am very pleased with the progress weve made in 
that short time 
and ill say more about that shortly but before i do id like 
to speak for a moment about my impressions of these past three 
months 
people often ask me understandably what its like how the 
presidency compares to the expectations you bring to it 
i can sum up the thing thats made the deepest impression on me 
so far in one word and its history a sense of history all around 
you 
and you cant live in the white house you cant sit at that 
desk in the oval office or upstairs in the office i have now right 
next door to the lincoln bedroom without constantly experiencing 
the history of the place without thinking of the presidents we 
all know but perhaps in a different light 
and i think of washington working to define the presidency to 
mix power and restraint in a way that created a chief executive 
consistent with democratic government 
this sunday i will be in new york to join in the ceremonies 
marking the 200th anniversary of washingtons swearingin 
each of those 200 years is lasting testimony to the solid 
foundation laid by washington 
and i find myself thinking a lot of teddy roosevelt his 
limitless energy his mental moral and physical toughness 
i want the record to show its not just that he was an elitist 
like me scattered laughter i think of his dedication to serve 
his nation a dedication instilled in earliest childhood this 
sense of service and then i guess most of all his love of nature 
his passion for reform and preservation 
i think of harry truman a man who spoke his mind a practical 
problemsolver and a fighter who never gave up and i learned that 
the hard way because im old enough to have bet 10 bucks on tom 
dewey back in 1948 
and theres ike dwight eisenhower hero to a generation a man 
who once he became president didnt appear to seek the spotlight 
but he understood the value of quiet steady leadership and led 
this nation through a decade of growth and progress and 
prosperity

one of two young skiers who ignored 
danger warnings on mount washington was swept about 100 yards by an 
avalanche and was trapped under a layer of snow for four hours but 
survived 
the guy is extremely lucky usually avalanche victims have 
less than a 5050 chance of survival after one half hour stu 
hoyt a snow ranger with the us forest service said monday he 
probably survived because of his low level of consciousness so he 
wasnt demanding all that much oxygen 
ken hawkins 17 was in serious condition monday with multiple 
injuries a hospital spokeswoman said 
hawkins and his friend david hathaway 16 both of greenland 
were on mount washington on sunday to ski tuckerman ravine 
the ravine on the east side of the mountain is a popular 
spring skiing spot for those intrepid enough to hike the 2 miles 
up and into the ravine and then brave its sheer pitch which at 
some points reaches 65 degrees the ravine is about twothirds of 
the way up the 6288foot peak the tallest in the northeast 
hoyt said he passed the two on the trail to the ravine at about 
8 am and warned them that the ravine had received about 5 feet of 
snow saturday night and the avalanche danger was high 
mount washington is known for some of the most changeable 
fiercest weather in the world the worlds highest wind speed 231 
mph was recorded on the mountain snow has been recorded in every 
month lists compiled by the forest service and other groups 
indicate that about 103 people have died on or around the mountain 
since 1849 
they had gone past my warnings they went past the signboard 
at hermit lake that posted all the conditions so theyd gone past

forest fires last summer followed by a wet 
winter mean a big mushroom crop and the us forest service says 
its working to forestall mushroom wars among pickers lured by 
the potential of 600 a day 
we are expecting anywhere from 3000 to 5000 pickers to show 
up said mike johnson a forest service employee at the kootenai 
national forest in the remote northwest corner of montana 
an experienced picker who finds a good stand of the popular 
morel mushroom can take in up to 120 pounds of them a day and gets 
about 5 per pound with that kind of money as a draw officials 
say trouble is possible 
when the umatilla national forest in oregon had a good mushroom 
crop two years ago for example grant county deputies investigated 
shotup vehicles threats and fights said grant undersheriff jim 
mcnellis 
it turned into a real zoo in some places he said 
to keep the same thing from happening in montana this year 
kootenai and flathead national forest officials said they will have 
more patrols out and issue permits for mushroom pickers 5 and 
buyers 500 who set up shop in the forest 
permits will give us a little control over what is going on 
and help pay for some of the increased patrols we are planning 
johnson said 
mushrooms should start sprouting in the next two to three weeks 
and the peak of the season is the end of may the season can wrap 
up as early as june but if if its a wet summer it can extend 
into fall johnson said 
forest fires act as catalysts for production of edible 
mushrooms primarily morels he said a fire in the kootenai forest 
last summer burned 13000 acres near here while another fire 
burned about 10000 acres in the nearby flathead forest

four years into mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
the communist party leadership must decide how to handle restive 
nationalities how much power to give a new legislature and other 
questions perestroika has raised 
some of them including the fate of political maverick boris n 
yeltsin may come up at a central committee meeting that begins 
tuesday 
gennady i gerasimov spokesman for the foreign ministry told a 
reporters no agenda had been announced for the central committee 
which has more than 300 members but said the nationalities issue 
would not be on it a western diplomat said the question probably 
would come up however at least briefly 
at least 20 people were killed in ethnic violence this month in 
soviet georgia and more than 90 were killed last year in armenia 
and azerbaijan neighboring republics in the caucasus region 
gorbachev 58 has said an entire central committee meeting this 
summer will be devoted to policy toward the more than 100 
nationalities in the soviet union 
he indicated in a meeting jan 8 with scientific and cultural 
figures that a separate plenum would focus on conception of 
socialeconomic development of the country gorbachev may have 
been referring to the session that begins tuesday 
tass the official news agency said tuesday a central committee 
panel meeting monday worked out ways to increase the effectiveness 
of capital investment and management in the socialeconomic area 
it gave no details 
this will be the first full central committee meeting since the 
march 26 elections when at least three dozen top local officials 
across the country lost bids for seats in a new parliament that 
will choose a smaller legislature 
among the losers were yuri solovyev a candidate member of the 
ruling poltiburo the premiers of lativa and lithuania the mayor 
and party chief of kiev and the mayor and no 2 party leader of 
moscow 
defeats in elections to the congress of peoples deputies were 
particularly embarrassing for communists who ran unopposed 
multiplecandidate races were the first since the bolshevik 
revolution 70 years ago 
the central committee could dismiss members who lost campaigns 
for parliament but that would not affect ukrainian party boss 
vladimir v shcherbitsky the only politburo holdover from the 
leadership of leonid i brezhnev shcherbitsky 71 won his seat 
another winner was yeltsin who ran an antiestablishment 
campaign and got 89 percent of the vote at its last meeting the 
central committee opened an investigation of yeltsin who was 
dismissed as moscow party chief after saying gorbachevs reforms 
had not accomplished enough 
vadim a medvedev the communist partys chief ideologist has 
said a committee examining the charges would report at the next 
plenary meeting the central committee has the power to discipline 
yeltsin who still is a member 
gorbachev portrayed the march election as a referendum on 
reform he said party and government officials lost because they 
were restructuring slowly 
central committee members laid the foundation for gorbachevs 
overhaul of the economic political and social systems at a meeting 
april 23 1985 six sweeks after he became party chief 
the western diplomat who spoke privately said tuesdays 
meeting might focus on political reform and plans for the 
2250seat parliament whose first meeting is scheduled for may 25 
it is to elect a president as well as a fulltime legislature

conductor who would orchestrate harmony in the city his father led 
for 21 years 
the old ways of doing things simply arent adequate to cope 
with the new challenges we face said daley whose victory over 
two black politicians earlier this year split voters sharply along 
racial lines 
mondays ceremony was at orchestra hall and daley used the 
setting as a theme for his speech he said the patchwork of a city 
is like a collection of instruments that can make beautiful music 
only when working together 
today i have been handed the conductors baton and to the 
people of chicago wherever you live let me assure you that your 
voices will be heard he said 
daley was sworn in by senior us district judge abraham lincoln 
marovitz who performed the same service for the late richard j 
daley six times before the elder daley died in office in 1976 
daley a democrat later took a congratulatory call from 
president bush who was in the city to address the annual meeting 
of the associated press

patronage but daley said those days are gone 
you dont hand down policies from generation to generation 
he said but he said he shared with his father a love for our 
city and a zest for public service 
black civil rights leader jesse jackson who warned while 
campaigning for sawyer and evans that daley would revive machine 
politics said daley struck a positive chord in his inaugural 
speech and in naming a multiracial group last week as his first 
cabinet nominees 
he appears to be using a reconciling approach as opposed to a 
polarizing daley acknowledged that he faces challenges includeing 
the tasks of providing affordable housing and running the city on a 
thin budget 
we cant in two years solve every problem or cure every social 
ill he said we can only begin approach and that is 
good jackson said 
daley and his wife have three children nora 15 patrick 13 
and elizabeth 5 a fourth child kevin died of the crippling 
defect spina bifida when he was 2

one of the jurors deliberating irancontra 
charges against oliver north has high blood pressure and will be 
examined by a doctor the trial judge said today 
us district judge gerhard a gesell identified the juror as 
jean johnson and said she has been experiencing high blood pressure 
during the jury deliberations which began friday 
mrs johnson is a 53yearold cashier whose husband is disabled 
i would like to arrange for a doctor to take a look at 
her gesell said in court she will be examined in the presence 
of a deputy us marshal 
meanwhile gesell said nbc news left unsigned letters at the 
homes of jurors in the north case inviting them to do interviews 
after the trial is over he said the letters had been picked up by 
deputies from the us marshals service 
i think its most inappropriate said gesell quite 
disrespectful of the situation we are dealing with 
peggy hubble nbc network news spokeswoman in new york said 
the jurors are sequestered so theyre not at their homes it 
was intended for them to see them when they got home after they 
made their decision after the trial and the letter specifically 
requested an interview after the trial 
she said the network was sorry if there was any inconvenience 
or misinterpretation 
meanwhile today president bush told reporters on a 
crosscountry trip that it was stupid and idiotic to 
speculate about whether he would pardon north should the former 
white house aide be convicted 
told that newsweek magazine was quoting sources close to him as 
predicting he would never pardon north the president said 
thats interesting speculation it shows how stupid some reports 
are that matter has never been discussed with me by anyone 
including my wife 
he said it shows you how idiotic speculation is 
the jury resumed resumed deliberations today after a oneday 
leisure break and quickly complained that we did not receive 
paper clips they had requested saturday 
the note sent to the judge was the fourth to date all 
concerned office supplies sharpened pencils highlighters note 
pads 
the nine women and three men were brought from their downtown 
hotel in a van for their third day of meetings shortly before 9 am 
the marshals taped television shows for them over the weekend 
and cut out anything that might refer to the north trial or the 
irancontra affair and the guards remained nearby while the jurors 
spent a leisurely sunday with their families to ensure that there 
be no discussion about the case 
meanwhile today an alternate juror dismissed thursday when the 
case went to the jury said on cbs this morning that i just 
felt for north 
i had a sense that higherups was involved linda brown 
clark said asked whether president bush or former president reagan 
should have been asked to testify she said 
i think it might have helped you know to find out if they 
was actually behind it or if they was telling him what to do 
if it was his job you know it would have been easier for him 
and it might not even have come to trial if someone would have 
spoke up 
north subpoenaed both bush and reagan us district judge 
gerhard a gesell set aside the bush subpoena and quashed the one 
for reagan 
north is charged with lying to congress illegally converting 
4300 travelers checks to hiw own use conspiring to commit tax 
fraud in the irancontra scandal 
the jurors spent about three hours in the jury room saturday 
before taking off the rest of the weekend they are being housed in 
a downtown hotel and are accompanied by marshals to make sure there 
are no outside influences about the trial 
the jurors are forbidden to talk about the case even among 
themselves when they are not in deliberations their families were 
allowed to visit them during sundays day off 
north is charged with 12 criminal counts that include lying to 
congress obstructing congressional and presidential inquiries and 
making personal use of irancontra funds

vernon a walters a veteran diplomat 
with a reputation for candor took over as us ambassador to west 
germany on monday as the two nations try to work out thorny 
disagreements 
walters refrained from mentioning one of the most pressing 
issues ruffling uswest german relations shortrange nuclear 
weapons 
but foreign minister hansdietrich genscher heightened debate on 
that issue by insisting washington change its mind and begin early 
negotiations with the soviets on reducing the shortrange weapons 
a military honor guard welcomed walters at villa hammerschmidt 
the palatial residence of president richard von weizsaecker 
walters entered the villa without talking to reporters 
walters is viewed as more experienced and outspoken than his 
predecessor richard burt and west german observers have predicted 
that could heighten disputes between the two countries 
in a copy of an address by walters to von weizsaecker during the 
ceremonies in which he officially became ambassador walters 
refrained from directly mentioning the shortrange missiles 
but he said natos nuclear weapons must be kept up to date and 
warned against any move to abandon the weapons as a key part of the 
alliances defense strategy 
at a time when eastwest relations are changing for the 
better nato will still continue to require conventional and 
nuclear forces that are effective and credible said walters 
genscher and defense minister gerhard stoltenberg flew to 
washington on monday to state their case for talks on the 
shortrange weapons even though us officials a day earlier 
indicated they wont be changing their position 
officials in bonn also want nato to postpone making a decision 
to modernize the shortrange weapons 
the united states fears new negotiations might lead to 
elimination of the weapons and says that would increase the threat 
to western europe from superior warsaw pact conventional forces 
before leaving for washington genscher said nato already has 
decided there should be negotiations on the shortrange arsenals 
and that this decision should be carried out 
we would like to see this intention put into practice 
genscher said on deutschlandfunk radio 
in his address walters referred to some other issues that have 
troubled uswest german relations such as complaints by west 
germans of nato ground and air maneuvers 
there has been increasing resentment among west germans to the 
400000 foreign troops stationed on their soil amid a growing 
perception that the soviet bloc is no longer a military threat 
but us officials have warned that nato cannot afford to let 
its guard down and new developments in the east bloc such as 
disarmament initiatives should be viewed with caution 
on the issue of nato maneuvers walters said i well understand 
that the presence of nearly 1 million soldiers german and allied 
means a special burden for the german population 
he added we are working continually with your government to 
seek ways to minimize the disruption of the daily lives of germans 
we will continue to do this 
walters did not mention what those measures were 
the 72yearold walters last served as chief us delegate at 
the united nations

the supreme court on monday refused to grant 
deposed philippine president ferdinand marcos and his wife imelda 
access to most of their alleged vast wealth 
the justices without comment rejected the marcoses appeal to 
overturn a court order freezing their assets 
left intact is a ruling that also requires the couple to defend 
themselves in a lawsuit filed by the philippine government 
the suit is one of several legal battles civil and criminal 
facing the ailing marcos 71 and his wife 59 
marcos is being treated in a honolulu hospital for heart and 
respiratory ailments us prosecutors have conceded he is too ill 
to stand trial on criminal charges but are proceeding with a 
criminal case against mrs marcos 
a federal grand jury last year indicted the couple and six 
others on racketeering charges saying that they looted more than 
100 million from the philippines to buy art and real estate in new 
york city 
the appeal turned down monday by the supreme court is in a case 
separate from the criminal charges it stems from a suit filed by 
the philippine government of corazon aquino in federal court in 
california after the marcoses were exiled to hawaii in 1986 ending 
marcos 20year rule 
the aquino governments suit against the marcoses and an aide 
ramon azurin seeks 50 billion in punitive damages 
the marcoses are accused of taking billions of dollars in public 
money and using it for their personal benefit 
a federal judge refused to throw out the suit and that ruling 
was upheld in december by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court rejected arguments that acts by a former head 
of a foreign nation are outside the jurisdiction of american courts 
deposed dictators will find it difficult to deploy the 
headofstate defense successfully our courts have had no 
difficulty in distinguishing the legal acts of a deposed ruler from 
his acts for personal profit that lack a basis in law the 
appeals court said 
the aquino government says it has statements from swiss bank 
authorities that marcos and his family have accounts there worth 
more than 15 billion 
the 9th circuit court also upheld a federal judges order that 
bars the marcoses from using any of their assets except to pay 
their lawyers and for daily living expenses 
the appeals court said the injuction was imperative to 
prevent the marcoses from putting their property beyond the 
reach of the us courts hardship to the philippine republic 
would have been great and irreparable the appeals court said if 
the judge had not taken prudent amply justified action to keep 
the marcoses assets from disappearing

a small population of the worlds rarest 
rhinoceros has been found in a warravaged region of vietnam not 
far from ho chi minh city officials said monday 
the javan rhinoceros somehow survived decades of war and 
defoliation in the eastern part of vietnams song be province said 
george schaller director of wildlife conservation international a 
division of the new york zoological society 
the rhinos had been thought extinct in vietnam since the 1960s 
except for about 50 living on the western tip of the island of java 
it was suspected that some still survived in indochina but 
there was no definite evidence of them schaller said in a 
telephone interview 
the dark gray javan rhinoceros is roughly similar to the african 
black rhinoceros but is chunkier and has heavy skin folds that 
give it an armored look an adult weighs 3500 pounds stands 5 
feet tall and is up to 11 feet long 
live animals themselves were not sighted but a dead one was 
found and there were fresh tracks schaller said 
the size of the rhino population is not known but my guess 
would be no more than 10 to 15 schaller said 
schaller who has tracked endangered animals all over the globe 
most recently in china and tibet found the rhinos tracks during 
an expedition to vietnam in february and march 
he was there with vo thanh son of the university of hanoi and 
nguyen yuan dang and le dinh thuy of vietnams national research 
council to make the first wildlife survey of vietnams southern 
forests 
the tracks were found along the dong nai river about 75 miles 
northeast of ho chi minh city formerly saigon 
the find is important not only because it improves the survival 
odds for the javan rhinoceros but also because the rhinos can be 
used to encourage preservation of wilderness in vietnam schaller 
said 
you may well say that the rhino is a national treasure of 
vietnam he said but the real treasure is the habitat there 
the forest 
many of these charismatic species are in effect symbols 
flagship species in that they arouse emotions they motivate a 
government to protect an area because they get popular support 
the region where the rhinos were found is a hot humid patchwork 
of forest native tribesmens fields and huge expanses of bamboo up 
to 40 feet tall schaller said 
the vietnamese are real conscious of conservation and i think 
theyll make an effort to protect the rhinos schaller said 
he recommended stiff penalties for killing rhinos and selling 
them and the enlargement of a wilderness reserve near where the 
rhinoceroses were found in vietnam as elsewhere in asia rhino 
horn is used as a constituent of many different medicines he said

capt dionysis palanicoloatos took 
his ferry toward the coast of lebanon where hundreds of people 
were waiting to escape their daily dose of fear 
with the big baroness m just 25 miles away from the 
battlescarred christian heartland a call came in from the ships 
agent in the port of jounieh 
turn around and go back the agent told the skipper 
its frustrating not to go in after coming all this way but 
we cant put anybody at risk papanicolatos a 45yearold greek 
said as he turned the vessel around sunday 
what the agent did not say is that a french tanker was 
delivering muchneeded fuel oil to the christian enclave north of 
beirut earlier it made a similiar shipment to the moslem sector 
the christian cabinet led by army commander gen michel aoun 
had ordered the ferry service suspended while the fuel was unloaded 
at journieh which has been the target of steady shelling by syrian 
forces 
the interrupted journey of the baroness m was a momentary cut in 
the only escape route for the beleaguered christian residents 
whose enclave is surrounded on three sides by hostile forces and 
the fourth by the sea 
the baroness m is one of two cyprusbased ferries making the 
regular 112mile trip from the island nation to lebanon they have 
carried out an estimated 13000 christian refugees in the past six 
weeks as fighting between christian forces and syrian and druse 
allied troops has intesified 
in recent days the ferries have had to anchor outside lebanons 
12mile territorial waters because of the syrian shelling 
papanicolatos had planned to move in to within 15 miles to pick 
up around 1000 christians coming out of fishing boats under cover 
of darkness if the shelling didnt look too bad 
but the way it turned out the christian families were left 
stranded not knowing when they will be able to flee to safety 
leaving lebanon can be as treacherous as living there shipping 
sources in larnaca cyprus said a syrian shell hit a fishing boat 
carrying people to the other ferry the larnaca rose on saturday 
night the sources said there were many fatalities 
sources in jounieh said they had no information to authenticate 
that report 
but artine himidian a lebanese aboard one of the fishing 
smacks said we were shelled all the way out to the larnaca rose 
the skipper steered a zigzag course so it would be more 
difficult for the gunners radar to track us women and children 
were screaming as the shells crashed around the boat he said 
walid barake another of the lebanese on the larnaca rose said 
he spent several hours hiding from the bombardment in a casino 
basement in jounieh before they managed to get to the ferry 
he said about 4000 christians were waiting to be evacuated from 
jounieh which the syrians are shelling daily to make the 
ninehour voyage to cyprus 
we were waiting for the bus to take us to a small port to get 
on the fishing boat the shells were falling almost continously 
he said 
about 70 passengers who left larnaca aboard the baroness m 
sunday morning mostly businessmen going to lebanon to see their 
families had to return to cyprus 
i dont how ill get back to beirut if the ships arent 
running im worried about my wife she gets very anxious in the 
bombing said jeanpierre burat a french national who runs a 
shipping company in beirut 
most passengers seemed relaxed as they sunbathed and chatted or 
leafed through magazines some played blackjack for hours in the 
ships casino 
as the baroness m sailed off the southern coast of cyprus three 
musicians played lebanese songs and some passengers danced until 
the early hours 
its always the same theyre sad for an hour then theyre 
dancing said purser irma hage

pleased with the progress weve made in 100 days in office and 
said he will soon make key arms control and foreign policy 
decisions that will chart a course for the future 
in three short months weve made a good start coming to grips 
with issues demanding urgent attention and decisive action he 
told newspaper publishers attending the associated press annual 
luncheon 
he ticked off his savings and loan legislation ethics 
proposals the beginning of a war on drugs and agreements with 
congress on the federal budget and contra aid 
at the same time he said defense and foreign policy reviews 
environmental legislation and a program to deal with homelessness 
are all on the near horizon 
bush spoke at the luncheon a short while after vice president 
dan quayle told the associated press annual meeting that the 
biggest surprise of his first 100 days in office is the enjoyment 
he receives from foreign travel the publishers who attended the ap 
functions were also in town for the annual meetings of the american 
newspaper publishers association 
quayle setting out on a trip to australia and asia also said 
he had an opportunity to work closely with the president every day 
to see how he formulates his policies 
the bushquayle team took office on jan 20 and marks 100 days 
on saturday 
before reciting his own report card bush pledged to follow 
every intelligence lead in the effort to win freedom for terry 
anderson the aps chief middle east correspondent has been held 
hostage since disappearing in beirut more than four years ago the 
president said he was not able to provide any good news on 
andersons prospects for freedom but said we will go the extra 
mile and do what we can 
chicago was a brief stop and a long day for both quayle and the 
president bush started in norfolk va where he attended a 
ceremony marking the deaths of 47 sailors killed in a gun turret 
explosion aboard the uss iowa last week from chicago he was flying 
to bismarck nd and then on to california 
we made a good start in these first three months and theres 
more to come the president told the ap luncheon 
on his list of accomplishments he touted the agreement with 
congress to provide nonlethal aid to the contra rebels as well as 
the broadbrush budget agreement that he said would reduce the 
deficit while leaving his notax pledge intact 
he urged the house to follow the senates lead in enacting his 
legislation to bail out the savings and loan industry and noted he 
had recommended stronger ethics legislation 
he also cited his administrations war on drugs in the district 
of columbia and his decision to ban the import of certain 
semiautomatic weapons as achievements in his first three months in 
office 
he also mentioned an initiative to deal with the problem of 
third world debt and his announcement last week of fresh help for 
poland 
the president made no mention of any setbacks and did not refer 
to the senates defeat of former texas sen john tower to be 
defense secretary 
looking to the future the president said he would conclude a 
broad defense and foreign policy review late next month he 
predicted a period of remarkable change in international affairs 
change more wideranging and rapid than at any time in the 
postwar period 
i have already made some decisions he said others 
including on arms control will be forthcoming soon and he noted 
that secretary of state james a baker iii would soon be meeting 
with his soviet counterpart 
on other subjects the president said he would soon submit draft 
legislation for a new clean air act as well as new proposals to 
deal with the increased use of lethal weapons by drug dealers and 
new proposals to combat homelessness 
he pledged continued consultation with congress and said the 
results of the last three months demonstrate the value of tough 
principled negotiations between this administration and the house 
and senate 
quayle devoted most of his remarks to his forthcoming trip to 
asia he said the declinists who are predicting a diminished 
standing for the united states will be proven wrong just as they 
were in the 1950s when the soviet union orbited the first earth 
satellite 
the point that i will stress to my asian hosts is that when 
americans express doubts about the health of american society its 
usually a sign of renewal not of decline he said

federal safety officials will consider changes 
in air traffic control for much of southern california on tuesday 
after investigation of incidents in which airplanes were flown too 
close to each other 
the national transportation safety board is meeting to consider 
the results and recommendations from a staff investigation into the 
loss of standard separation between a british airways jumbo jet 
and an american airlines jetliner on feb 13 over westminster 
calif 
the planes came within 19 miles of each other both at 9000 
feet and federal aviation administration officials at the time 
said the british airways pilot had to make a hasty turn to avoid a 
collision 
although the planes were not close enough for the incident to be 
considered a near miss faa rules say they should have been at 
least three miles apart horizontally and 1000 feet vertically 
the british jet a boeing 747 was carrying 286 people from los 
angeles to london the american airlines plane a british aerospace 
146 with 70 people aboard was landing at ontario international 
airport after being diverted from john wayne international airport 
at santa ana which had been closed due to a power failure 
the investigation was expanded to cover seven other operational 
errors over the past year at the coast terminal radar approach 
control facility at john wayne the traffic control operation 
handles about half a million flights a year in the area between los 
angeles and san diego one of the busiest flight areas in the 
country outside major airport control zones 
the safety boards inquiry is its first major investigation into 
an air traffic control operation since it recommended upgrading at 
chicagos ohare international airport after operational errors 
increased in 1986 ohare had more than 30 flighthandling errors 
in 1988 and the faa has ordered several changes including the 
hiring of additional controllers 
the staff report on the feb 13 california incident recommends 
several changes at the santa ana facility 
among proposals to be voted on by the board are increases in 
staffing and training of personnel some improvements and expansion 
of the facility itself and several technical changes according to 
a board source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the board meeting on southern california air traffic control 
problems comes two days after two reported near collisions 
involving airliners in the new york area 
a twa jumbo jet coming in from london and a commuter plane were 
reported to have come within about 100 feet as they approached 
kennedy international airport on sunday and 45 minutes later a pan 
am boeing 727 en route from laguardia airport to boston reported 
coming within 400 yards of a small plane near westchester county 
airport 
the fivemember board could expand its recommendations to cover 
other facilities if it decides any problem is widespread but only 
conditions at the santa ana facility are on the agenda

president bushs decision to develop both the 
mx and midgetman nuclear missiles drew a mixed reaction monday on 
capitol hill with some lawmakers faulting the administration for 
failing to make a choice while others called the plan the nextbest 
option 
its the same thing the all of the above choice said 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a member of the house armed 
services committee they never have the guts to make a decision 
defense secretary dick cheney had recommended moving the 
nations 50 multiplewarhead mx missiles from silos to deployment 
on railroad cars rather than developing the singlewarhead 
midgetman but bush opted for quick deployment of the mx and 
researchanddevelopment for the midgetman 
congressional republicans over the years have favored the mx 
while many democrats prefer the midgetman 
cheney in a television interview sunday announced the 
presidents decision as well as administration plans to cut 
spending on star wars to 46 billion from the 59 billion 
proposed by former president reagan for fiscal 1990 and a proposal 
to delay work on the b2 stealth bomber 
the defense secretary is expected to detail the cuts tuesday 
when he appears before the house armed services committee 
the ranking republican on that panel rep bill dickinson of 
alabama said he urged bush and cheney to choose the mx and ignore 
the midgetman but they felt they had to placate the liberal 
democrats and keep this thing alive he said 
the main thing is to preserve and protect the assets we got 
which is mx in silos and then go forward and make them mobile 
said dickinson who described the mxmidgetman decision as his 
second choice 
but another republican sen pete wilson of california said he 
was disappointed with bushs decision citing the cost of 
researchanddevelopment of the midgetman 
pentagon officials have indicated that funding for the midgetman 
would come out of the mx budget which is 24 billion in the 
current proposal 
this will be the fourth year in a row that the defense budget 
has been cut in real terms said wilson a member of the senate 
armed services committee further development of the 
midgetman wastes funds that are sorely needed for other defense 
programs 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the 
committee and a backer of the proposal said it was his opinion the 
plan will move through the hill reasonably smoothly because 
of its support in both parties 
sen nunn and i and congressman aspin have been of like mind 
on this issue it goes way back to last year when the three of us 
urged president reagan to retain enough money in the budget so 
bush could make a choice said warner 
sen sam nunn dga is chairman of the senate armed services 
committee rep les aspin dwis is chairman of the house armed 
services committee 
warner said the decision now on the mx and midgetman avoided a 
serious deadlock that would have left other defenserelated 
issues unresolved 
its the axle around which other decisions will be made 
warner said

president hussain muhammad ershad on 
monday ordered his people to pray for rain to end a 2monthold 
drought that has wiped out much of the countrys important rice 
crop 
ershads order calls for 15 minutes of mass prayers to be held 
nationwide wednesday on playgrounds and in mosques said press 
secretary toab khan 
the drought that has parched bangladesh follows heavy floods 
late last year that submerged threefourths of the nation and 
killed hundreds of people 
ershad plans to attend the prayer session of dhakas main moslem 
congregation an estimated 100000 people are to recite verses from 
the koran the holy book of islam 
rains which were expected around the first week of march are 
not likely for another week the weather office said 
the drought has destroyed rice crop in more than 15 districts in 
northern bangladesh the most severely affected area officials at 
the agriculture ministry said 
nearly half of the boro variety rice crop will be lost this 
season said an official speaking on condition of anonymity he 
said the loss may multiply if the drought persists 
the country annually produces 17 million tons of foodgrains to 
feed its 110 million people the target of boro rice crop this year 
was set at 46 million tons 
crops in bangladesh depend mostly on rains for irrigation some 
areas have irrigation pumps but most were dry as groundwater levels 
had plunged news reports said 
bangladesh imports about 2 million tons of foodgrains a year to 
meet the shortfall of 15 million tons in production and build an 
emergency reserve 
the drought followed devastating floods last year that claimed 
more than 1400 lives and washed away about 25 million tons of 
grain 
the floods forced the government to plan an import of 3 million 
tons of food grains this year and the droughtinduced loss may push 
the imports further up the agriculture ministry said 
crop losses has sparked a steep hike in food prices in several 
remote areas of northern bangladesh united news of bangladesh news 
agency said 
but the government ruled out a possibility of famine saying it 
had a reserve stock of more than 800000 tons of food grains 
two years of natural disasters have inflicted damage totalling 
11 billion in damage to the country according to a joint 
estimate by the united nations and aid group for bangladesh 
the aid group at a meeting wednesday in paris committed 22 
billion in new aid for fiscal year 1990 to bangladesh donors 
include britain france japan the united nations the 
international monetary fund and the united nations development

foreign doctors challenged a soviet diagnosis that 
children in a ukrainian city lost their hair after being exposed to 
a chemical used in rat poisons tass reported monday 
dr gerar de groot of the toxicological center in the 
netherlands told the official news agency the quantities of 
thallium found in patients could not have caused the reported 
consequences but he and other experts said they did not know what 
made more than 160 children in the city of chernovtsy to lose their 
hair since autumn 
in february tass quoted soviet doctors as saying the chemical 
might have been carried to the city in the form of acid rain from a 
nearby romanian chemical plant chernovtsy is near the soviet 
border with romania 
as a result town streets were washed more frequently and only 
local drivers were allowed into the city center traffic was banned 
altogether one day a week tass reported in february 
the mysterious ailment the last case of which was discovered in 
november afflicted primarily children under 14 tass said the

the newspaper industry suffering from falling 
readership must shine a journalistic spotlight on illiteracy 
new york times co chairman arthur ochs sulzberger told a 
publishers meeting monday 
but sulzberger outgoing chairman of the american newspaper 
publishers association said in a keynote speech to the anpas 
103rd annual meeting that the longrun battle must be waged by 
school boards state legislatures and governors 
let us shine a journalistic spotlight on the problems and 
focus our citizens attention on a national disgrace said 
sulzberger speaking in a city whose schools were labeled the 
nations worst by former education secretary william bennett 
let us hold those who claim to be accountable to account 
sulzberger added 
sulzbergers address kicked off the threeday meeting of the 
nations newspaper executives who also heard monday from president 
bush and vice president dan quayle the president and vice 
president spoke as part of the annual meeting of the associated 
press held in conjunction with the anpa 
sulzberger called on publishers to make their newspapers 
attractive to readers 
if the product isnt compelling if the reader doesnt need 
it then there is little that your association can do to help he 
said 
in his wideranging address sulzberger touched n several other 
issues facing the newspaper industry including racial imbalance in 
the workforce and declining markets and advertising 
a recent survey found that only 7 percent of newspaper managers 
and executives come from minority ranks the anpa and other groups 
have tried to change that he said citing an anpa hotline to make 
minority applicants aware of jobs 
were not yet running but we have passed the babystep years 
and our industry goal of racial diversity throughout our workforce 
would seem at last to be attainable he said 
the 63yearold publisher of the new york times also sounded a 
call for a strong independent free press citing hysteria over 
the satanic verses 
the novel by british author salman rushdie was almost 
incomprehensible but the response of irans ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini and other critics was terrifying sulzberger said 
khomeini declaring the novel blasphemous called for rushdies 
death 
undoubtedly the book is offensive to many moslems 
sulzberger said but he told more than 800 people during a morning 
session that civilized people have long abandoned burning at the 
stake as a response to blasphemy 
this is 1989 not 1589 he said 
we need your help in maintaining a strong and independent free 
press sulzberger told the group

the united states on monday urged israelis and 
palestinians to keep open minds about an evolving plan for 
elections in the israelioccupied territories and to stop a recent 
escalation of violence between them 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the united 
states is deeply concerned over the increase in casualties over the 
past few days in clashes between israeli troops and palestinians 
protesting israels rule of the west bank and gaza strip 
the increase in tensions runs directly counter to the cause of 
peace she said we strongly urge both sides to exercise 
restraint we remain determined to work with all parties to break 
out of the current confrontation and to replace violence with 
political dialogue and accommodation 
discussing the possibility of palestinian elections as a first 
step toward a peace settlement ms tutwiler said the united states 
will work closely with all parties in the region 
the goal she said is to create conditions for direct 
negotiations and peace 
if elections are to fulfill their potential in this regard it 
will be essential that they be free and fair in the best tradition 
of democracy all those truly committed to peace should demonstrate 
that commitment by keeping an open mind to proposals that can 
advance the process she said 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir has proposed a plan for 
elections in the west bank and gaza to choose palestinians to 
negotiate an interim peace treaty with israel 
the palestine liberation organization has been reported to have 
countered with a proposal for elections in the occupied lands for 
members of the palestine national council the plos 
parliamentinexile 
shamir says israel will never hold talks with the plo but 
several labor party ministers recently have urged a change in that 
stand 
tutwiler cautioned that discussions of an election format had 
just begun in the middle east following presentation of the plan 
to the bush administration during shamirs visit here this month 
obviously during the course of these discussions there will 
be many and varied views on the issue some workable some not 
she said 
ms tutwiler also defended the state department against 
accusations by some lebanese christian leaders and us editorials 
that the united states is ignoring the suffering in lebanon 
she said the government has for the past two years been 
supplying 14 million in food annually to some 135000 lebanese 
families both christian and moslem although supplies have been 
interrupted by the heavy syrian bombardments of christian enclaves 
in beirut in recent weeks 
president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii have 
issued several statements expressing their concern over the 
deteriorating situation in lebanon she said and baker attended a 
church service sunday in washington to show his support for the 
suffering of the people in lebanon 
the fact that the united states has not sent ships or personnel 
to lebanon as france has done does not mean that the united 
states does not care she said

attitude of the leftist sandinista government in managua 
the rebels and political opposition have been suspicious about 
whether the sandinistas will allow the national election commission 
and the countrys news media to function impartially 
the sandinista party controls both the government and the media 
in nicaragua 
however the rebels and political leaders on monday expressed 
their commitment to participate in the election 
this is an opportunity to rebuild the nation said bosco 
matamoros another contra leader 
the contra and nicaraguan political leaders did not discuss 
specific proposals after their meeting with de soto 
but they said they want the united nations to verify that the 
campaign is free and fair matamoros stressed what he called the 
necessity of international support guarantees and verification 
perez de cuellar has said his aides are reviewing whether to 
send observers to nicaragua he has notified the general assembly 
to be ready to approve funds if the mission is approved 
about 12000 contra fighters are believed to be in honduran 
border camps us military aid to the contras ended 11 months ago 
and they now receive only humanitarian aid 
in april the contras declared a truce until the february 
elections

the mother ship in japans controversial research 
whaling fleet returned home to a quiet welcome monday after a 
fourmonth hunt in the antarctic where it dodged protesters boats 
to kill 241 whales 
about 20 whaling officials and parliament members greeted the 
nisshin maru no 3s 120 crew members at a ceremony on its long 
main deck 
your whaling is crucial for maintaining japans food 
culture tatsuo shinmori a parliament member told the crew 
you struggled against the protesters and now we should follow 
your example by doing our best to protect whaling 
stored beneath the ships 23000ton deck was the meat from 241 
minke whales already processed by a shipboard factory scientists 
estimate stocks of minke whales at between 400000 and 700000 
in the early 1960s whales provided 23 percent of all meat 
consumed in japan but declining supplies have turned it into a 
delicacy and the nisshin maru with its rusty paintmarked sides 
is the only remaining mother ship 
japan still the worlds largest consumer of whale meat 
officially stopped whaling commercially in 1987 following a 
worldwide ban by the international whaling commission 
but the ban allows socalled research whaling under which 
countries can capture whales to test stocks then may consume the 
meat the research is to see whether there are sufficient stocks of 
some species to allow limited commercial whaling when the ban is 
reevaluated in 1990 
international environmental groups such as greenpeace have 
charged that japan is using the research provision as a ploy to 
continue whaling and that alternative nonlethal research methods 
are available 
greenpeace members used a ship and rubber rafts to try to block 
the nisshin maru and its three catcher boats from whaling in the 
antarctic waters and collided once with the mother ship 
theres a basic difference between us in ideology and 
philosophy they want to protect all whales so a conflict is 
inevitable said hidehiro kato director of research on the 
nisshin maru 
id prefer to use nonlethal methods but they dont tell us 
age reproductive status or condition of the whales he said 
at this point the best approach is a combination of lethal and 
nonlethal research 
japanese whaling officials initially said at least 825 whales 
had to be caught each season to make the research program 
scientifically accurate but following strong international 
opposition they reduced this years goal to 300 
kato said the fleet did not reach the goal primarily because of 
bad weather but that the greenpeace protests had some effect 
crew member hideyoshi yoshida said he was in a catcher boat that 
narrowly missed being hit by the greenpeace ship 
the research whaling was approved by the japanese government 
so i wish people opposed to it would discuss it with the 
government rather than confronting us while were whaling he 
said

a judge acquitted a union 
leader and four other black activists of subversion monday 
describing boycotts they organized as legal protests of poor living 
conditions 
jubilant supporters lifted moses mayekiso leader of a metal 
workers union on their shoulders and carried him from the supreme 
court to the nearby central methodist church 
police ordered the crowd to stop singing and chanting they also 
told journalists to leave the area 
mayekiso said at a news conference later he and the other his 
defendants would resume their activities and rebuild the community 
organizations authorities had alleged were subversive 
were going to start where we left mayekiso said the 
message we have been given is that the structures are legal 
mayekiso 48 was charged with attempting a political takeover 
in 198586 of alexandra an impoverished black township adjoining 
some of johannesburgs most luxurious white suburbs 
he had been jailed for 30 months until judge pj van der walt 
freed him on bail in december 
van der walt said monday the state presented no direct evidence 
that the defendants their alexandra action committee or the 
outlawed african national congress had planned unrest attacks on 
police the resignation of township council members or the 
establishment of peoples courts 
the judge said he had toured the township and seen the poor 
conditions he said the community had developed a lack of faith and 
trust in authorities 
according to van der walt the boycotts were intended to improve 
living conditions not make the township ungovernable 
international attention was attracted to the trial because 
because mayekiso leads the national union of metalworkers of south 
africa the countrys largest union of metal workers and because 
many activists viewed the prosecution as an attempt to stifle 
peaceful antiapartheid activity 
in the united states united auto workers president owen bieber 
called the prosecution malicious and outrageous 
the south african authorities knew all along that mayekiso had 
committed no crime but they jailed him for 901 days and subjected 
him to a long and costly trial bieber said in a statement 
van der walt criticized the state for first charging the 
defendants with treason after acknowledging treason could not be 
proved prosecutors substituted the lesser charges of subversion 
and sedition 
in the trial van der walt asked the prosecutor whether rent and 
consumer boycotts were illegal in 19856 the prosecutor 
acknowledged they were not but the government has imposed 
emergency decrees since that outlaw the organization of boycotts 
during that period in alexandra dozens of people were killed in 
clashes with security forces and in attacks by crowds on township 
council members and black policemen the entire council resigned 
and most black policemen moved out of alexandra 
since then the government has detained or restricted leaders of 
the alexandra action committee and undertaken a 45 million 
redevelopment program to provide sewage electricity and paved 
streets to most of the 100000 residents 
those acquitted with mayekiso were paul tshabalala 38 obed 
bapela 30 richard mdakane 30 and mayekisos brother mzwanele

each citizen feel we are in a period of complete reorganization 
he did not say when a replacement would be named for rifai a 
52yearold boyhood friend of the king who was educated in the 
united states and had been prime minister since 1985 
hussein assigned secretariesgeneral of government ministries 
second in rank to appointed ministers to run their departments 
until a new government is formed 
four days of riots in which at least nine people were killed 
began april 18 in the southern city of maan and spread to dozens of 
cities and towns many rioters called for rifais ouster but also 
shouted support for the king 
officials said the toll rose to nine with the death monday 
evening of an air force major shot during riots in the town of 
mazar 
many jordanians blame the prime minister for declining living 
standards annual per capita income has fallen from 2000 in the 
mid1980s to about 1200 
last year the government imposed import controls and austerity 
measures to help deal meet payments on a foreign debt of 6 billion 
riots were precipitated by price increases of 10 percent to 50 
percent on gasoline cigarettes and other goods decreed as part of 
a debtrescheduling plan worked out with the international monetary 
fund 
the king who cut short a foreign tour expressed his intention 
sunday to deal with the roots of the problem and all the causes 
and reasons within a short period of time the official 
jordan news agency reported 
hussein appeared to refer to the rioters complaints when he 
urged the secretariesgeneral in his statement to put an end to 
abuse and misuse but also praised rifai and his government for 
carrying your responsibilites with honesty and your honest 
efforts to achieve the goals we set for our country 
he hinted that economic belttightening would continue but also 
at an effort to spread the impact of the hardships 
we have to divide the responsibility and the burden until we 
stand solidly on our feet hussein said 
no jordanian prime minister has served longer than rifai since 
independence from britain in 1946 besides the term that began in 
april 1985 he also was prime minister from 1973 to 1976 
educated at columbia and harvard rifai earlier served as 
ambassador to britain and as chief of the royal court 
his father samir served six terms as prime minister in the 
1940s 1950s and 1960s for a total of less than four years 
last weeks eruption of violence was the worst in jordan since 
the army crushed palestinian guerrillas in 1971 
various jordanian groups have demanded reforms new economic 
policies parliamentary elections and action against official 
corruption 
more than 100 people have been arrested in recent days to 
prevent further demonstrations said laith shubeilat head of the 
council of presidents of jordans professional associations 
he said most were communist party members but several members 
of the popular and democratic fronts for the liberation of 
palestine also were arrested he said others outside of those 
groups including former parliamentary deputy riad nawaiseh of 
kerak were also arrested 
shubeilat said the associations planned to send a cable to the 
king urging the government to withdraw an arrest warrant against 
george haddadin head of the geologists union and a member of the 
democratic front of jordan allied to the marxist democratic front 
for the liberation of palestine 
haddadin said he believed he was wanted because he was among the 
association leaders who signed a petition to the palace saturday 
calling for a new elected government

a federal judge on monday blocked the district 
of columbias curfew law from taking effect for at least 10 days 
because of questions about its constitutionality 
the curfew passed by the city council april 4 in an attempt to 
keep youths from becoming involved in drugs and crime had been set 
to start at 11 pm edt monday and continue for 90 days 
there are serious first fourth and fifth amendment concerns 
raised in this issue us district judge charles h richey said 
before issuing a temporary restraining order which he said he 
would extend for another 10 days if necessary 
im happy today my clients are happy today said arthur b 
spitzer legal director for the american civil liberties union 
representing 15 young people who contended the curfew threatens 
their constitutional rights 
this law will do essentially nothing to solve the problem of 
drugs in the district while having harmful effects on the rights 
of our youth he said there is no reason to put juveniles 
under house arrest every night he added 
the judge said he would hold a hearing in the near future to 
reach a final decision on the curfew law 
richey struck down the citys original curfew law on march 20 
the latest version while still requiring those under age 18 to 
be off the citys streets sidewalks and other public areas by 11 
pm sunday through thursday and midnight friday and saturday 
contains several exceptions 
exempt from the curfew would be minors accompanied by a parent 
those returning home from an activity sponsored by a church school 
or nonprofit organization those traveling in a motor vehicle and 
those employed during curfew hours or on an emergency errand 
police would take violators to the nearest police station and 
call their parents there would be no fine for a first violation 
parents would be fined 100 for the second violation and 300 for 
all subsequent ones 
if the parent didnt come for the violator the youth would be 
in the custody of the human services departments child protective 
services office until 6 am then sent home 
spitzer said the curfew law discriminates against poorer 
juveniles because many come from broken homes or have parents 
working odd shifts and unable to accompany them 
he said youths living in public housing could not step out the 
door during the curfew while youngsters in more affluent 
neighborhoods have private property surrounding their homes 
assistant city lawyer victor long said that the council had 
adopted the least restrictive measure it could to deal with 
juvenile crime the law did not infringe on constitutional rights 
but sought to place reasonable restraints for a valid 
reason he said

organizers of a news conference said monday 
they had deferred to walter cronkite and wound not show a film he 
narrated as they had planned to do because cbs cronkites 
employer for 35 years would be attacked at the same news 
conference 
as a result of the objections by cronkite and the films 
producer a conservative consumer group consumer alert showed 
only snippets of interviews with scientists from the 30minute film 
big fears little risks produced for the american council on 
science and health 
the council is a new yorkbased group frequently supported by 
industry the film argues that most chemical carcinogens in food 
pose small or trivial risks when compared with natural food 
substances and lifestyle causes of cancer like smoking 
according to the producer frank powers consumer alert last 
week distributed a news release implying youre going to see a 
freeforall over alar the apple growth regulator that was the 
subject of a 60 minutes segment on cbs in february with reed 
irvine chairman of accuracy in media using the film to attack the 
television program 
cronkite worked for cbs for 35 years before his retirment in 
1981 he is a cbs director 
betty furness an nbc reporter sent a copy of the release by 
facsimile to cronkite traveling in europe according to ms 
furness who attended the consumer alert news conference as a 
reporter mr cronkite does not have any problem with the film 
the problem was the juxtaposition of the two events the film and 
a criticism of cbs handling of the alar story she said 
he said he was asking that the film be withdrawn from the 
news conference she said 
irvine showed the film to a reporter in his office it does not 
mention alar contains only a brief reference to pesticides in 
apple sauce and says nothing about 60 minutes 
the press release was withdrawn after objections by cronkites 
attorney and a version was issued that said irvine after the film 
will discuss how the media particularly 60 minutes was a 
willing partner in transmitting erroneous information about alar 
a copy of the original release was not available monday 
in new york 60 minutes spokesman ray brunett said the 
program was putting together another report which will address 
questions raised since the first broadcast 
irvine said powers told him it was his objective to preserve 
his relationship with mr cronkite powers said that was true 
but not the only reason he refused to permit the film to be shown 
at the news conference 
the purpose of the film was not to get into this controversy 
or that controversy it would be counterproductive we have an 
important public health message here he said by telephone from 
new york 
as the copyright holder we were within our rights he said 
barbara keatingedh president of consumer alert said great 
pressure was brought on her not to show the film and she 
believed she had to defer to elizabeth whelan president of the 
american council on science and health not to show it 
irvine praised the film and the message conveyed by cronkite 
as surprising as it may seem there is increasing evidence that 
the presence of trace amounts of chemicals in the environment pose 
no threat to human health 
irvines criticisms of the 60 minutes segment echoed those 
made by the environmental protection agency and others that the 
program greatly overstated the risks of cancer produced by a 
lifetime of exposure to apples to which it had been applied 
it was wrong to frighten the public about the presence in 
apple juice of traces of a chemical that pose no more danger to 
human health than the traces of the carcingen chloroform that is 
found in chlorinated tap water he said

one of the jurors weighing oliver norths fate 
complained monday of high blood pressure and the judge said 
there is a cold virus running through other jurors but 
deliberations in norths trial continued through a third day 
in midafternoon the jury sent a note to us district judge 
gerhard a gesell that people are complaining of being too close 
too tight and asked can you help with a bigger room 
gesell did he made his courtroom available with us marshals 
at the front and back doors until then the jury had been in an 
18by12 room and had the use of a similarsize adjoining room as a 
lounge 
the jurors spent about six hours in their task before quitting 
for the day they have deliberated a total of 15 hours since they 
began on friday 
in her note jury foreman denise m anderson asked for a dozen 
yellow legal pads and said in a footnote that right now we are 
reading no talking through documents that pertain to charges 
she said too we will always take lunch at 1200 noon for one 
hour suggesting that the jurors were settling in for an extended 
stay 
none of these people are complaining they cant go forward 
said gesell after he received the note about the jurors blood 
pressure he summoned lawyers for both sides into the courtroom for 
the first time since the jury received the case last thursday 
but gesell said there is potentially a health problem with 
these jurors 
there was no discussion in court of what course would be 
followed if any of the jurors were forced to drop out court rules 
state that if it becomes necessary to excuse a juror during 
deliberations in the discretion of the court a valid verdict may 
be returned by the remaining 11 jurors 
north the former reagan administration aide was not in court 
monday he has been on trial since jan 31 on 12 criminal charges 
that include lying to congress obstructing congressional and 
presidential inquiries and making personal use of funds involved 
in the secret effort to help the nicaraguan contra rebels at a time 
when official us aid was banned 
he could be sentenced to as much as 60 years in prison and fined 
up to 3 million if convicted on all counts 
meanwhile president bush said he hasnt discussed with anyone a 
possible pardon for north if he should be convicted 
bush commenting aboard air force one on his way to a speech in 
chicago said speculation about what hell do is stupid and 
idiotic and uninformed since i havent discussed it nor 
shared my thoughts with anybody i dont have any thoughts until i 
get the facts 
he was responding to a question about a report in newsweek 
magazine quoting sources close to him as predicting he would never 
pardon north 
in washington gesell came into the courtroom after receiving a 
note from the foreman that said could you please send for nurse 
for jean johnson recheck blood pressure 
mrs johnson 53 registered a blood pressure of 160over98 
when she was checked by the courthouse nurse gesell said he got 
the lawyers permission to summon her own doctor and have her 
examined in the presence of a us marshal 
apparently the juror had a blood pressure problem and the 
blood pressure elevated perhaps in part because her diet while 
the jury is sequestered is richer than she is accustomed to 
gesell said 
two of the other jurors reported that they were suffering from 
chest colds they were given nonprescription medications by the 
nurse 
gesell also told the lawyers that nbc news left unsigned letters 
at the homes of the north case jurors inviting them to be 
interviewed after the trial is over 
i think it was most inappropriate improper conduct quite 
disrespectful of the situation we are dealing with he said but 
he said it was too late to do anything about it 
the nbc letters were slipped under doors at the jurors homes 
one was discovered by a us marshal who went to one of the homes 
to pick up a jury members mail 
my impression is that the juror was angry the judge said 
other jurors showed a similar concern and said they didnt want 
anything to do with it 
nbc news spokeswoman peggy hubble in new york said it was 
intended for them to see them when they got home after they made 
their decision after the trial i think once people understand 
what happened theres not much of a problem with it really she 
added were sorry if there was any inconvenience or 
misinterpretation 
as for the possibility of one or more jurors being unable to 
continue washington lawyer richard ben veniste said that since 
1983 the rules of criminal procedure have said that in such cases a 
verdict may be returned by the remaining 11 
losing two members of a 12member jury however would result in 
a mistrial ben veniste said 
gesell dismissed all alternate jurors when the regular jurors 
began deliberation and two of the alternates have appeared on 
television commenting on the case

gov gerald l baliles proposed an overhaul 
monday for the state income tax exempting all pensioners making 
less than 16000 a year but imposing taxes for the first time on 
state goverment retirees making more 
a us supreme court decision last month in a michigan case 
barred states from treating federal pensioners differently from 
retirees of state and local government agencies prompting baliles 
to call a special legislative session to amend virginias laws 
it is an unprecedented circumstance that has obliged me to 
call you back into special session the firstterm democratic 
governor told the general assembly the legislature has until 
thursday the end of the special session to take action 
virginia is one of 24 states that is affected by the march 28 
supreme court ruling because they impose income taxes on federal 
retirement pensions while exempting pensions paid to retired state 
and local public employees with nearly 200000 federal civilian 
and military retirees virginia is potentially hardest hit of all 
states 
in all baliles proposal would cost the state treasury about 
46 million the governor said the loss could be covered by reserve 
funds without cutting existing state programs 
the supreme court didnt spell out how states much tax their 
federal and state government pensioners only that the two groups 
must be treated equally 
baliles said he considered a number of options but chose the 
16000 cutoff because he believed it to be the most fair to 
retirees and state taxpayers 
he said his desire for fairness also prompted him to propose 
exempting retirees of private employers from the income tax if 
they make less than 16000 the high court decision did not cover 
private pensioners 
recognize this one fact whatever tax relief we give to one 
group of taxpayers in this case retirees will be at the expense 
of other virginia citizens baliles said that is unavoidable 
the supreme court said treat all public retirees the same 
he said i believe this plan does that and at the same time 
reaches out to grant private retirees identical tax relief 
baliles acknowledged his plan would not be liked by government 
retirees with higher incomes such as highranking military 
officers but if the plan had been in effect in 1987 baliles said 
four out of five retirees who filed a tax return would not have 
paid state income taxes 
social security benefits would be taxfree the governor said 
the pension tax would apply to people age 55 and over

social scientists are debating what turns english 
soccer fans into tribal mobs as a shattered nation buries its dead 
from the sheffield stadium tragedy and awaits its share of the 
blame for an earlier disaster 
researchers are trying to explain why soccer stadiums become 
breeding grounds for racism and violence and why bluecollar males 
are attracted to hooliganism the way youngsters in los angeles are 
drawn to innercity gangs 
they also are exploring why many young fans shun the comfort of 
seated areas and choose to stand for hours on a cold crowded 
concrete terrace the scene of the april 15 crush that killed 95 
liverpool fans in sheffield 
days after that tragedy england is readying itself for another 
reminder of the stains on its image of polished civility a belgian 
judge will issue his verdict friday in the case of 26 liverpool 
fans accused of causing the 1985 heysel stadium riot in which 39 
people died 
the sheffield disaster was caused less by outright hooliganism 
than by overcrowding but it quickened the debate on such questions 
as what causes a crowd to become belligerent or to stampede 
whether the game itself is to blame and whether outdated stadiums 
turn people into animals 
violence by sports fans is not new chariot race hooligans 
caused a riot in sixth century rome that reputedly led to 30000 
deaths 
today political scientists are focusing on the unequal 
distribution of wealth and jobs in england particularly in 
industrial cities such as liverpool and the role that class 
distinctions play in treatment of crowds 
commentators are accusing the soccer establishment of showing 
contempt for fans by providing inadequate facilities and neglecting 
safety 
social scientists are concentrating on human behavior and the 
way it reacts to the environment they point to degrading 
conditions on the terraces of 19thcentury stadiums in which 
comfort and sanitation are ignored 
the more you treat them like animals the more its likely to 
be a selffulfilling prophecy said criminologist eugene 
trivizas a specialist in hooligan behavior 
psychologist david canter accuses clubs of almost literally 
getting away with murder for the last 10 years or so by skimping 
on stadium facilities 
despite the discomfort on the terraces researchers say young 
urban males prefer the shared ordeal of packing together like 
sardines because it offers them anonymity and a sense of power 
young males in urban populations lack any kind of group 
identity and this is what football soccer gives them said 
desmond morris author of popular anthropological studies like 
the naked ape 
it offers them a chance to belong to a group and express their 
joys and fears through that group young males need to express 
themselves in some way that involves risktaking and honor he 
said in an interview 
bolstered by alcohol and machismo they press their bodies 
against one another and sway to team songs just as their fathers 
and grandfathers did they yell racial epithets at players crude 
insults at women 
working classes are less likely to express emotion in subtle 
verbal forms said canter whose book football in its place 
is to be published in may its more likely to be some sort of 
physical representation such as jumping up and down and shouting 
trivizas said absorption in a crowd dismisses personal 
inhibitions because fans believe it is difficult to be held 
responsible or to be identified if they misbehave 
there is an impression of universality if other people are 
doing what you are doing then you think what youre doing cannot 
be wrong people think they can behave with relative impunity 
in his 1981 book the soccer tribe morris likened soccer 
fans to religious zealots and warned that the tribal element could 
be eradicated by forcing fans to sit comfortably and quietly in 
stadiums and turning this symbolic event into disneyland fun 
perhaps the greatest dilemma facing the soccer tribe today is 
the question of whether its main activity is a sacred ritual or a 
social entertainment he wrote should the ancient traditions 
of spartan suffering give way to theater comforts and modern 
razzmatazz

nearly a third of those needing heart 
transplants eventually may be candidates for new surgery in which a 
flap of back muscle is wrapped around the ailing heart to help it 
pump doctors said monday 
the candidates ideally will be people who are heading toward 
a heart transplant but still have enough reserve left said dr 
george magovern chairman of surgery at allegheny general hospital 
the experimental procedure was performed last month using a 
special pacemaker that stimulates the transplanted back muscle in 
multiple bursts unlike conventional singlepulse pacemakers the 
muscle is thus able to contract with the heart over longer periods 
of time 
it was the first time the 3ounce cardiomyostimulator 
manufactured by medtronic inc of minneapolis had been implanted 
into a patient in the united states magovern said allegheny 
general is the only hospital with us food and drug administration 
approval to use the device in clinical trials 
the patient ralph beilstein 57 an interior decorator from 
nearby sewickley said he feels marvelous he had suffered from 
chronic heart failure since 1964 
his left latissimus dorsi muscle was partially removed march 20 
and wrapped around his heart three days later the pacemaker was 
implanted during the march 23 operation below the left side of his 
rib cage and turned on march 31 he was discharged wednesday 
i just generally feel better psychologically as well as 
physically beilstein said at a hospital news conference attended 
by his wife virginia and their four daughters and eight 
grandchildren 
he was able to avoid a heart transplant a riskier procedure 
that can involve lengthy waits because of the scarcity of donor 
organs 
the muscleflap operation was first performed in the united 
states by magovern in 1985 the procedure had been performed only 
once before about six months earlier in paris 
by jan 1 the muscleflap operation had been performed about 40 
times around the world six of them at allegheny general said dr 
ignacio christlieb who assisted in beilsteins operation 
the cardiomyostimulator was used in about threequarters of the 
cases all overseas 
in each case doctors detach the left latissimus dorsi muscle 
from the patients back except for a small portion remaining 
attached by an artery and nerve under the arm about 2 inches of 
one rib is removed and the muscle flap is pushed through and 
wrapped around the heart 
a 1footlong wire woven through the muscle flap is attached to 
the implanted pacemaker which is run by a lithium battery 
one system of insulated wires sends signals from the heart to 
the pacemaker another sends signals to electrodes in the muscle 
flap enabling the muscle to beat in tandem with the heart 
skeletal muscle such as the latissimus dorsi lacks the natural 
electrical conduction system of heart muscle and therefore requires 
a precisely timed and controlled burst of pulses to stimulate 
contraction 
beilstein said he is not limited physically as a result of his 
removed muscle the muscle has been removed and used in the past in 
breast reconstruction and repairing leg fractures 
its a muscle the body can spare heckler said 
doctors say theyre not sure how long the muscle will be able to

iran on monday urged the un security council to 
pressure iraq for concessions in the floundering peace talks aimed 
at a permanent settlement of the persian gulf war 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran made the call after 
both sides reported no progress in their fourth round of 
unsponsored talks which ended sunday in geneva 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he will seek 
a new meeting between velayati and his iraqi counterpart tariq 
aziz in june 
however velayati told a news conference monday that it is 
difficult to continue such a situation 
he called on the five permanent security council members 
including the united states and the soviet union to put pressure 
on iraq 
they should help the secretarygeneral otherwise i dont 
know what will happen he said 
for his part aziz said iran refrained from the correct manner 
of conducting negotiations but did not elaborate 
there has been little progress since the talks began last aug 
25 five days after a unsupervised truce took effect 
at least 1 million people were killed or wounded in the war 
which began with several border skirmishes and an iraqi invasion of 
iran in september 1980 iran has demanded a full withdrawal of 
iraqi troops from its territory iraq has said the shattalarab 
waterway its only sea outlet must first be cleared of war debris 
and silt 
perez de cuellar who chaired the latest round of talks said 
both sides renewed their commitment to the ceasefire and to more 
talks

us attorney general dick thornburgh denied 
monday that the city is being shortchanged on federal funds and 
resources to fight violent street gangs and drug trafficking 
do you have enough no will you ever have enough never 
thornburgh said 
he was in town to be briefed on the los angeles gang drug task 
force a multiagency group organized six months ago to target major 
drug distributors affiliated with street gangs 
we have become the principal center for distribution of 
cocaine in the united states said us attorney robert bonner 
los angeles right now is distributing more than half of the 
nations cocaine 
the gangs are responsible for distributing crack or rock cocaine 
to 47 cities outside los angeles and are the prime suppliers to the 
washington dc area bonner said 
thornburgh recently chose the nations capital for a test 
project in which federal law enforcement will focus efforts there 
to curb its rampant drug problem 
at a news conference later thornburgh was asked why los angeles 
wasnt chosen for the experiment since authorities here say its 
the nations major drug center 
the problem is not confined to los angeles i assure you it is 
a major priority he said 
thornburgh added that 24 prosecutors have been added to the us 
attorneys office here and the government has tripled its 
allocations to local and state governments to fight the growing 
national drug problem 
we never have enough in terms of resources the notion that 
were writing off this effort is nonsense he said stressing 
that the national and international drug problem is the priority of 
federal law enforcement 
john zienter head of the drug enforcement administration office 
in los angeles said that within the last six months the task force 
arrested more than 150 people and seized more than 5 million worth 
of drugs cash weapons and property including exotic cars and 
expensive houses

confessed twa hijacker mohammed ali hamadi drew to a close monday 
and final arguments are to begin later this week 
hamadi is charged with murder and air piracy in the june 1985 
hijacking of a trans world airlines jet in which us navy diver 
robert stethem was killed and 39 americans were held hostage 17 
days 
hamadi 23 has admitted participating in the hijacking but 
denied he shot stethem 
final arguments are set for friday in the trial that began last 
july 
during a brief session monday british broadcasting corp 
reporter john simpson told the court what he observed when twa 
flight 847 was forced to land in algiers algeria during the ordeal 
during the hijacking of the athenstorome flight the jetliner 
was forced to land in beirut three times and twice in algeria 
simpson 44 told the court he was in algiers with a bbc 
televison crew on june 14 1985 but police prevented them from 
filming the hijacked twa plane from the airport tarmac 
we were detained for about 30 minutes later we were allowed 
to film the plane from a waiting room at the airport simpson 
said 
he said the waiting room provided only a view of the right rear 
side of the aircraft so there was no chance to film the left side 
of the plane where the boeing 727s doors are located 
defense attorneys had called simpson to testify hoping to show 
that no passengers were threatened while the plane was on the 
ground in algiers 
a west german federal investigator said earlier that the 
hijackers opened one of the planes doors and held a gun at the 
head of a passenger to force algerian officials to provide fuel for 
the jetliner 
hamadi denied that any passengers were threatened to obtain fuel 
in algiers 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem claims his accomplice in the 
hijacking identified in court records as hassan ezzeddine killed 
stethem 23 ezzeddine remains a fugitive 
after simpsons testimony hamadis defense lawyers asked the 
court to view videotape they said showed military attacks carried 
out by israel in lebanon in 1982 
attorney hansburkhardt steck said the video was obtained from a 
group in the area and would show the conditions that motivated 
hamadi to take part in the hijacking he did not give the name of 
the group 
the court allowed the tape to be played and it showed scenes 
from wartorn beirut and from palestinian refugee camps 
prosecutor peter korneck objected after the tape was shown 
calling it propaganda and saying it should not be entered into 
evidence 
if it is then i would like a video of terrorist attacks in 
paris to be shown korneck said referring to bombings in the 
french capital including five in september 1986 that killed eight 
people 
the court did not rule immediately on the objection

guerrilla rocket and artillery attacks 
on jalalabad took the lives of four people and return fire by 
government soldiers killed 54 insurgents the government said 
monday 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani also reported 
fighting in three other provinces during the previous 24 hours he 
gave the casualties as 32 dead and six wounded 
at the united nations in new york afghan foreign minister abdul 
wakil on monday said his government will retaliate against pakistan 
if it does not stop supporting afghan rebels 
he told the security council in a 90minute speech if the 
security council fails to adopt necessary measures for defusing the 
present tense situation and if pakistani aggression and 
intervention against our contry is continued we will have no 
choice but the firm and patriotic defense of our country 
wakil said the pakistani side must understand that its territory 
was as vulnerable to rocket attacks as afghanistan bombarded by 
rockets transported across the afghanpakistan border 
none of the casualty figures reported monday could be verified 
both the marxist government and moslem guerrillas generally 
exaggerate the other sides losses 
amani said guerrillas fired from two directions on jalalabad 
which they have besieged for seven weeks he said four civilians 
were killed and 12 wounded 
soldiers returned the fire the spokesman said and he gave 
enemy casualties as 54 killed and 35 wounded amani claimed 
pakistani and saudi advisers were among the dead 
two soldiers were wounded and three houses and a marrket 
destroyed by the guerrilla shelling he said 
jalalabad is a provincial capital 75 miles east of kabul and 
once had a population of 64000 it has been under heavy rocket and 
artillery attack since the siege began march 6 
capturing it would give the insurgents a base for the exile 
government they formed in pakistan two months ago and help them 
gain momentum to for an attack on the capital jalalabad is near 
the afghanistan end of the khyber pass about 45 miles from the 
pakistan frontier 
when the offensive began guerrilla leaders predicted jalalabad 
would fall within days but the afghan army is equipped with 
sophisticated soviet weapons and has repulsed the attacks 
diplomats in kabul say both sides have suffered heavy casualties 
the soviet union completed withdrawal of its military forces 
from afghanistan under a unmediated agreement on feb 15 but 
continues supplying afghanistans army 
pakistan the united states saudi arabia and china are among 
major supporters and suppliers of the insurgents who began 
fighting after a communist coup in april 1978 soviet soldiers 
entered the war in december 1979 and an estimated 115000 were in 
afghanistan when the withdrawal began 
in reports monday on the other fighting amani said guerrillas 
shelled kandahar in the south wounding two civilians he said 
soldiers killed at least 27 insurgents and captured 10 
amani said three civilians were killed in paktia province in the 
south and two insurgents were killed and four wounded in herat a 
wetern province 
in a dispatch from kabul on the fighting the soviet news agency 
tass said the afghan foreign ministry sent three new notes to un 
representatives complaining of pakistani violations of the geneva 
accords 
tass also reported that the new indian ambassador to 
afghanistan muhammed hamid ansari on monday presented his 
credentials to president najib stressing friendly ties between the 
indian and afghan nations

a czechoslovakian rock band whose 
leaders were jailed in the 1970s is touring the united states in 
what its guitarist calls a sign of better times for eastern 
europe 
initially denounced as moral filth by the governmentrun 
czech press the band endured two decades of legal trouble before 
obtaining official status last may and changing its name from 
plastic people of the universe to pulnoc the czech word for 
midnight 
the threeweek american tour which began saturday in chicago 
is the groups first opportunity to perform abroad and an 
incredible turn of events that no one could have dreamed of even a 
few years ago said timothy w ryback a harvard university 
lecturer and expert on eastern european rock 
although little known in the west the group has attracted an 
enormous following in czechoslovakia through underground recordings 
and small concerts under its original name ryback said 
for 20 years the plastic people have been unquestionably the 
premiere underground rock band in czechoslovakia and probably all 
of eastern europe he said 
at a nightclub here sunday night the bands lead singer and 
only female member michaela nemcova traced haunting melodies over 
a background of guitars keyboards drums and cello 
the crowd mainly students from nearby mount holyoke and smith 
colleges responded with three encores even though the czech lyrics 
were incomprehensible to most 
were not touring just for ourselves but for everyone back 
home guitarist milan hlavsa 39 said after the show its a 
sign of better times of hope for our country 
hlavsa one of the bands original members dedicated sundays 
show to dissident playwright vaclav havel and the bands former 
manager ivan jirous who are both in czech prisons for political 
crimes 
but hlavsa who also spent six months in jail during a 
government crackdown on rock bands in 1976 insisted the groups 
message was not political 
to us rock n roll means life joy and creativity and to 
our fans it means they can unwind they can feel some sort of 
freedom he said through an interpreter but i know it can be 
dangerous even if its not political 
hlavsa and guitarist jiri kabes formed plastic people in 1968 
shortly after soviet tanks rolled into the czech capital to crush 
the democratic social and political movement known as prague spring 
at first they were tolerated by the authorities but in 1970 
their official status was revoked and they emerged as leaders in 
what jirous termed czechoslovakias second or unofficial 
culture 
despite their popularity all of the band members must work at 
other jobs to support themselves keyboardist josef janicek is a 
school janitor drummer petr kumamdzas a hospital orderly cellist 
tomas schilla an xray technician 
ryback the harvard expert said the bands recent acceptance of 
official status has eased their circumstances allowing them to 
obtain topquality equipment to perform openly and perhaps in the 
future to issue albums through the state record company 
but he said the move was controversial 
i think they have alienated some of their fans because it 
looks like they cut a deal with the state he said but thats 
probably unfair because they have gone through a hell of a lot 
the band also planned to go to new york knoxville tenn 
washington san francisco seattle and boston performing mainly in 
nightclubs with a capacity of 100 to 400

a un relief convoy safely reached 
rebelheld torit on monday six days after a deadly ambush halted 
the united nations first overland effort to deliver food to the 
southern sudanese town 
the 31one truck convoy carried nearly 440 tons of corn on its 
14hour trip from the rebel sudan peoples liberation army base of 
kapoeta 100 miles to the west said spokesman paul mitchell of the 
un world food program 
attackers ambushed the first un convoy from kapoeta to torit 
last tuesday killing eight rebel escorts and destroying the lead 
vehicle mitchell said organizers of the un operation lifeline 
sudan hoped the overland route now would be used regularly 
the 132 million un operation is trying to to prevent 100000 
famine deaths in southern sudan by stocking food and supplies in 
the wartorn region before heavy annual rains begin in midmay 
un officials say they probably will fail to meet their goal of 
moving 115500 tons the amount needed to stave off widespread 
starvation last year as many as 500000 southern sudanese died 
because of flood and warinduced famine 
the united nations on friday began airlifting relief supplies to 
torit which it says has a swelling population now numbering 25000 
people a recent visitor however estimated only about 3000 
people were taking refuge in the town with many others farming 
normally on its outskirts 
mitchell said a frenchfinanced transall c160 cargo plane on 
monday joined the c130 already delivering food and that a second 
transall funded by the west germans was expected to join the 
airlift this week 
operation lifeline sudan began april 1 after the rebel army and 
sudans government agreed to allow the relief supplies move 
unhampered to both rebelheld and governmentcontrolled towns 
the sudan peoples liberation army took up arms against sudans 
moslemdominated government in 1983 demanding greater autonomy and 
economic development for the predominantly christian and animist 
south

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
monday that sensationalism and misleading news stories about food 
safety can hurt consumers when accurate information is needed most 
yeutter speaking to a meeting of the national association of 
agricultural journalists cited recent cases involving chemicals in 
the food supply one of those was about chemicals such as alar used 
in apple production 
a recent study by a private environmental group the natural 
resources defense council suggested that children may be exposed 
to dangerous levels of carcinogenic chemicals in fruits and 
vegetables because they eat large amounts in proportion to their 
weight 
the councils study singled out alar and alarms were raised 
throughout the country about the possible hazards of eating apples 
government regulatory agencies including the environmental 
protection agency food and drug administration and the agriculture 
department said there was no need to panic and that there was no 
reason for parents to keep apples from children 
we need to make sure that these volatile issues are handled as 
well as possible from a communications standpoint he said 
obviously we have freedom of the press in this country and the 
media can do what it wishes in this area just as it does in other 
areas 
yeutter added and if folks choose to provide coverage for 
misleading research studies or choose to distort or sensationalize 
theyre privileged to do so thats the price we pay for a 
democratic society 
in the meantime yeutter said he hoped we can do an effective 
job of keeping these issues in proper balance 
one reporter asked what yeutter meant by proper balance in 
news reports 
that means making sure that the facts are out and not simply 
someones distorted interpretation of what they read see or 
hear he said 
the agriculture department which sometimes in the past has been 
accused of sticking up for farm interests at the expense of 
consumers and environmentalists needs to have a spotless 
reputation on such sensitive issues yeutter said 
were going to play it straight in the department in these 
areas and i hope we can establish a reputation for credibility on 
all fronts he said if we say something about an alar 
situation or we say something about any other food safety 
question my intent is that we do it in such a way that it will 
command the respect of everyone who views that issue or evaluates 
it in any way 
yeutter said he wants usda to have the respect of both sides 
of an issue

advocates for the homeless have accused the 
bush administration of violating a federal court order to make 
surplus government property available for the homeless 
the national coalition for the homeless filed a motion late 
friday with us district judge oliver gasch in washington charging 
that the department of health and human services is refusing to 
accept or process applications for properties the coalition 
contends are suitable for the homeless hhs was designated as the 
agency to process the applications the coalition said 
gasch ruled in a suit by the group last december that the 
federal government must review hundreds of surplus federal 
properties across the country for possible use by the homeless 
the coalition contends that under the 1987 mckinney homeless 
assistance act passed by congress properties determined suitable 
by the department of housing and urban development must be made 
available to states local governments and nonprofit groups to use 
as facilities to shelter or assist the homeless 
the motion charges that hhs has limited its review to properties 
designated excess by the agency holding the property 
regardless of huds determination that excludes 87 percent of the 
1415 properties hud has determined suitable it contends 
amy brown spokeswoman for the justice department said the 
government will file a response next week the government 
believes that it has been in compliance with the december 1988 
court order and the mckinney act she said 
maria foscarinis counsel for the homeless coalition said it 
asks the judge to order hhs to immediately accept and process 
applications and to freeze any sales or transfers while the 
applications are being reviewed 
the coalition said local groups have unsuccessfully sought to 
use buildings and land in los angeles huntsville ala st paul 
minn and seattle

three months ago the whos pete townshend 
inducting the rolling stones into the rock and roll hall of fame 
took a swipe at the mercenary side of the stones upcoming reunion 
tour 
it wont be easy for the stones the next time around and if 
it wasnt for the vast sums of money they can make they might not 
bother at all townshend jibed at least mick probably 
wouldnt its lucky for us fans that he has such expensive 
tastes 
now its mick jaggers turn 
two generations after my generation townshend roger 
daltrey and john entwistle announced monday they were reuniting for 
a 25th anniversary tour their first since 198283s farewell 
tour the band also appeared in a oneshot reunion at live aid 
daltrey said they had decided against making an album to be 
released while theyre touring 
we felt like we werent trying to resurrect the band this is 
a celebration of the music we created after all these years he 
said one of the reasons we stopped is we were on that 
albumtouralbumtour rat race of the rock n roll industry to 
come back and do all that again we thought was a mistake 
the tour will include two fulllength performances of the rock 
opera tommy with guest stars in new york city and los 
angeles the latter concert will be videotaped those concerts and 
the video will be benefits for the nordoffrobbins music therapy 
foundation for autistic children 
the british band last performed tommy by townshend in its 
entirety 17 years ago in chicago 
townshend acknowledged he has suffered a hearing loss saying he 
has a ringing in the ears at the kind of frequencies at which i 
play guitar if i expopse myself to loud electric guitar 
particularly my own my hearing suffers 
im still very nervous about how i can work on stage without 
further damage to my hearing he said but then drew a laugh by 
adding were going to play very very quietly 
the return of the stones and the who to the stage highlights 
what seems to be a trend in rock n roll today jefferson airplane 
and the stray cats are reuniting in recent months david crosby has 
taken part in a pair of reunions with exbandmates the byrds and 
with stephen stills graham nash and neil young 
as townshend indicated such gettogethers are lucrative 
rolling stone magazine reported the stones are guaranteed more than 
65 million for a 50date north american tour ticket sales for 
their 1981 tour hit 54 million 
or maybe the reasons are more friendship than financial stray 
cats leader brian setzer says he just missed bandmates lee rocker 
and slim jim phantom 
theres another motivation in most cases the sum of the bands 
has proved greater than its parts 
lead singers jagger and daltrey have both released poorly 
received solo albums the most recent jaggers primitive cool 
peaked at no 41 on the album charts while daltreys voice missed 
townshends songs 
guitarists keith richards and townshend have both released 
critically praised albums although the latter has put most of his 
effort into working parttime as an editor for the london 
publishing firm faber amp faber 
the reunions also demonstrate that you cant believe everything 
you hear from rock stars richards who threatened jagger with 
bodily harm if he toured minus the stones repeatedly badmouthed 
his bandmate before the stones reunited 
as for the who consider this from townshend in 1985 two years 
after the bands decision to go its different ways i think ive 
had it with rock it wasnt growing old that was the problem 
with me in the who it was growing up

the government pledged monday 
to crack down with an iron fist on a banned antiapartheid 
group involved in black factional fighting that killed 13 people 
over three days 
the battles have been fought mainly between the banned united 
democratic front and members of inkatha which backs kwazulu black 
homeland leader mangosuthu buthelezi the front is the countrys 
largest antiapartheid coalition and a political ally of the 
outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement 
residents around kwazulu near durban and pietermaritzburg in 
natal province have accused both black groups of firebomb attacks 
on homes mob beatings and killings 
but law and order minister adriaan vlok said in a speech to 
parliament monday that security forces would concentrate on the 
united democratic front 
we know that alternative structures such as street 
committees peoples courts civic associations are chiefly 
responsible for the unrest and violence we are going to root 
them out 
all those groups are associated with the united democratic front 
in the process we will be acting against people against 
activists and radicals we will grab them and they are going to 
kick up a big fuss again we will not be deterred i want to warn 
we are going to use the iron fist regardless vlok said 
his only reference to inkatha was his report that he had spoken 
to buthelezi he said the homelands leader was just as concerned 
about the violence as he is 
factional fighting has killed 1000 zulu tribesmen in that 
homeland over the past year the whiteled government set up the 
network of black homelands to relieve pressure from domestic and 
international critics 
the front and inkatha both oppose the apartheid policies that 
enable south africas 5 million whites to dominate 28 million 
blacks however the front views buthelezi as a conservative who 
weakens the struggle for black rights 
one opposition leader accused the government of taking sides in 
its reaction monday 
by heaping blame on one side only the minister places in 
doubt the neutral role of the police said peter gastrow the 
democratic partys member from central durban mr vlok presents 
a onesided and oversimplified version of what is happening on the 
ground in natal 
he blamed the violence on a complex mixture of factors involving 
the two groups gangs vigilantes warlords poverty and a loss of 
confidence in authorities 
vlok said a police general and teams of senior detectives were 
being sent to the area he said security would be stepped up with 
more vehicles and semipermanent police stations spread over a 
wider area he said the army would be called in to assist if 
necessary 
in reporting on the fighting from friday through sunday police 
said monday three people were injured in addition to the 13 men who 
were killed in black townships near kwazulu 
monitoring groups say more than 4000 blacks have been killed in 
clashes with police and between rival black groups since 1984 
violence has subsided under emergency regulations imposed by the 
government nearly three years ago but fighting has persisted 
between inkatha and the united democratic front

their central nervous systems asked the government monday for an 
antidote to whatever chemical soldiers used when dispersing a 
proindependence demonstration 
foreign ministry spokesmen in moscow have denied accusations by 
georgian activists that troopers used chemical weapons in the 
confrontation april 9 but the georgian communist party chief 
confirmed monday some of the 20 deaths were caused by gas 
the leader givi gumbaridze spoke to some of the the first 
foreign correspondents allowed into georgia since the demonstration 
in tbilisi capital of the southern republic 
several dozen of the approximately 120 people still hospitalized 
signed a letter containing the appeal to president mikhail s 
gorbachev for an antidote 
nodar notadze a literary scholar and one of 40 members of a 
commission investigating the attack on the protesters said 
georgian representatives would take the plea to a meeting of the 
communist party central committee that begins tuesday in moscow 
nino djavakhishvili also on the commission said at least 700 
people were injured iza ordzhonikidze a third commission member 
said 600 of them were poisoned 
ms ordzhonikidze a poet and museum director said half of 
those still hospitalized were children from a contaminated school 
next to the demonstration site who became ill days after the clash 
dr vakhtang bochurishvili who teaches at tbilisi medical 
school said monday it is a crime that the military still will 
not tell us what substances were used 
he was interviewed at hospital no 2 of health ministry 
department no 4 where most victims are being treated the 
hospital usually is reserved for the georgian elite 
bochurishvili said the army and interior ministry soldiers who 
broke up the protest were like nazi troops the ss 
on saturday the defense ministry newspaper krasnaya zvezda 
identified one chemical used on the protesters as an incapacitating 
agent called cheremukha whose main ingredient is 
chloroacetophenone a western military attache in moscow said the 
substance was similar to tear gas but stronger 
malkahz zaalishvili a molecular biologist on the commission 
said the gas becomes poisonous in high concentrations 
he and several other doctors said another gas used causes 
irregular paralysis of the central nervous system memory loss 
blackouts headaches and nausea 
djavakhishvili a morphologist said military officials refuse 
to acknowledge nerve gas was used ms ordzhonikidze said 14 of the 
20 people who died did not appear to have been seriously beaten and 
were believed killed by the gas but a decision would await 
autopsies 
shota gamkrelidze a pharmacologist said he wants to help but 
his hands are tied 
i cannot prescribe any psychotropic drugs because i dont know 
what the chemical was and what will happen with these drugs he 
said 
discharged patients return with the same problems because proper 
treatment cannot be administered commission member notadze said 
and the consensus is that there is no effective treatment of the 
gases 
no soldiers were hurt by the gas and doctors believe they had 
taken an antidote they now refuse to give to the injured said 
gamkrelidze the pharmacologist 
gilo oniani a 34yearold factory worker and mother said 
soldiers clubbed and kicked her even though she was weak from four 
days of a hunger strike to demand that georgia secede from the 
soviet union 
she said she remembered something being sprayed into her mouth 
and nose then she blacked out and awoke in the hospital with lungs 
that felt scorched and could not eat because of pain in her abdomen 
mrs oniani said she cannot sleep because like other victims 
she becomes extremely agitated for hours on end 
her hospital roommate 14yearold tamriko chekradze said a 
batterysized canister of gas hit her on the head and burned her 
hair then she blacked out from pain 
gumbaridze appointed chief of the georgian party 10 days ago 
said the decision for troops to break up the demonstration was a 
serious mistake and several members of the republics ruling 
politburo were not informed about this operation about the 
methods to be used 
i learned about the decision only a few minutes before the 
clash the 44yearold former georgian kgb chief told reporters 
he replaced dzhumber patiashvili who resigned as party leader 
after accepting responsibility for the violence 
an investigation will determine who ordered the gas used 
gumbaridze said 
the fact that gases were used is the truth he declared 
yes some people died from poisoning 
asked how authorities would respond to future protests 
gumbaridze said what happened on the ninth of april cannot 
happen again

a coalition of black health care 
professionals educators and community leaders monday recommended a 
series of steps to improve the health of blacks and other 
minorities including a uniform and expanded medicaid program and a 
reallocation of healthcare dollars 
dr david satcher president of meharry medical college in 
nashville tenn said members of the coalition were concerned 
about the gap in the health status of minorities compared with 
white americans 
the infant mortality rate for blacks is twice the rate for 
whites and the life expectancy of blacks is declining while it is 
increasing for whites satcher said citing recent studies 
we feel its a crisis we face in this nation satcher said 
at a news conference where he was joined by rep louis stokes 
dohio 
satcher said about 40 members of the coalition presented their 
recommendations to health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan satcher described the secretary as very receptive very 
concerned 
the recommendations included 
making the medicaid program uniform throughout the states and 
expanding it so that anyone within 200 percent of the federal 
poverty level is eligible 
reallocating health care dollars by shifting funds from some 
procedures and organ transplants that are not proven effective into 
disease prevention and primary care they did not recommend a 
specific amount of money 
making sure that blacks and other minorities are 
appropriately represented at hhs agencies whose dealings affect 
minorities disproportionately such as agencies that deal with aids 
and substance abuse 
allocating more aid for black and other minority students in 
the health care fields because they are more likely than white 
americans to work in lowincome areas 
in comments before his meeting with the coalition members 
sullivan reiterated his intention to give special emphasis to 
closing the gap in health status between white americans and 
black and minority americans

in a chilly airplane hangar president bush 
choked back tears monday as he comforted griefstricken relatives 
of the 47 sailors killed on the battleship iowa and offered the 
sympathy and appreciation of all the american people 
greeting relatives one by one the president wore a nervous 
smile as he shook hands moving briskly from person to person 
waiting along rows of foldingback chairs 
some of the relatives showed him a picture of their lost ones 
this was our only son this was our only boy bush recalled one 
couple as saying several women stopped him for a comforting hug 
it was an emotional beginning to the presidents fourday swing 
across the country as he nears the 100day milestone of his 
administration 
later addressing the annual luncheon of the associated press 
bush spoke of the loneliness of the office when it comes to dealing 
with situations like the deaths of us military personnel or the 
holding of americans hostage abroad 
i vowed when i came into the presidency not to talk about 
the burden of the presidency the loneliness of the job or the 
great toughness that nobody understands bush said i learned 
that from my immediate predecessor 
but said bush when you do take that oath of office you do 
feel perhaps a disproportionate concern for a fallen sailor or an 
individual held hostage against his or her will anywhere in the 
world 
on air force one en route to chicago bush told reporters that 
the norfolk ceremony had been one of those difficult moments 
tough day down there it was so moving bush said 
explaining that his smile had belied the emotions he felt 
the bush family is not very good at that kind of thing 
anyway this was tough he saidbut youve got to deal with it 
youve got to show them concern 
bush said you know how you get through it you pray for 
strength 
although i did choke up at the end there i did feel kind of 
an inner peace about the thing i had to represent our country 
accompanied by his wife barbara the president flew to norfolk 
at the start of a long travel day with stops later in chicago for 
a speech before the associated press annual luncheon a 
treeplanting ceremony during a centennial celebration in bismarck 
nd and an overnight in san jose calif 
the 100day mark of his administration falls on saturday and 
bush was expected to beat the drum for his presidency in a 
succession of outofwashington engagements before returning to 
washington on thursday bush will make appearances in california 
texas and florida 
in chicago bush defended the progress of his administration and 
took time to telephone newly installed chicago mayor richard daley 
to wish him well and congratulate him on his april 4 victory 
during a questionandanswer session aboard air force one en 
route to chicago bush addressed a number of issues including 
speculation about whether he would pardon fired white house aide 
oliver north now awaiting a jury verdict in the irancontra 
affair in the past bush has called north a hero and said he hoped 
north would be acquitted 
a newsweek magazine report quoting sources close to him as 
predicting he would never pardon north shows how idiotic 
speculation is bush said if it was given any credence as 
having come from me or as if somebody had discussed it with me 
they simply havent 
bush also refused to discuss a published report that he had 
authorized spending 10 million for the panamanian opposition in 
the may 7 elections the united states has been frustrated in its 
efforts to oust strongman manuel antonio noriega 
i dont discuss intelligence matters bush said were 
involved in encouraging the elections to be free and fair and 
open 
on another matter bush said he had expressed concern to west 
german chancellor helmut kohl who has been reluctant to modernize 
shortrange missiles in europe 
my appeal to the germans has been that we keep nato together 
stay together bush said kohl knows my view there must not be 
any unilateral fait accompli 
on a personal note bush complained that he was two or three 
pounds overweight and was going to do something about it he said 
his wife barbara who is suffering from an overactive thyroid was 
doing well he said there was nothing out there any different 
than what youve been told 
but the emotional peak of the day clearly was norfolk where 
bush a former navy pilot said the sailors had served the navy 
as shipmates and friends and left the navy as brothers in eternity 
cameramen with telescopic lenses said bush had tears on his 
cheek as he returned to his aircraft 
bush told the gathering at the norfolk naval air station i 
hope that the sympathy and appreciation of all the american people 
provide some comfort but true comfort comes from prayer and 
faith 
in delivering his remarks bush omitted a line of his speech 
that said as a navy veteran he had stared at the empty bunks of 
lost shipmates and asked why he explained later that i 
thought it was a little too subjective 
the norfolk ceremony was marred by a foulup about the relatives 
that bush was supposed to personally greet after consoling people 
in the first four rows of the audience bush turned and left 
ignoring three rows of family members 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater explained later 
that a military escort had turned bush aside after four rows 
saying he had greeted all members of the immediate family 
fitzwater said bush was distressed by the episode he said 
thats really a tragedy fitzwater said he could see they 
were distressed 
in bismarck bush planted a 12foot elm tree during a ceremony 
to mark the states centennial 
around the world there is a growing recognition that 
environmental problems respect no borders bush said 
he said we do not have to accept as inevitable the spoiling 
of our air our rivers our wetlands and our forests

the army said monday it had grounded its 
entire fleet of vietnam era uh1 huey transport helicopters for a 
safety inspection of main rotor bolts 
the service in a statement said the grounding order was issued 
late friday and was keeping about 3100 choppers on the ground 
lt col john reitz an army spokesman said the grounding order 
was prompted by an incident last week in which a huey was being 
moved manually across a tarmac and two of the bolts in the main 
rotor pillow block suddenly snapped 
he said that further inspection showed cracks and stress 
corrosion in the bolts 
in this case there was no accident and no loss of life 
reitz said but you would have a big problem if this happened in 
flight so a grounding order was issued immediately to ensure 
safety 
the bolts at issue sit atop the main rotor hub and help hold the 
main rotor blades to the shaft 
according to reitz army aviation units are being advised the 
hueys can return to operation as soon as the onetime safety check 
of the bolts is conducted 
in all likelihood most of the fleet will be back up in the 
air very quickly he added 
the 3100 huey helicopters assigned to activeduty units include 
three variants of the chopper the basic uh1h transport a uh1v 
medevac variant and an eh1h electronic warfare variant the hueys 
are deployed with army units around the world 
the grounding order did not affect another variant of the 
chopper used exclusively by national guard units

two senior west german officials urged the 
united states on monday to negotiate reductions in battlefield 
nuclear weapons with the soviet union but the bush administration 
said such talks would be a mistake and instead stressed the 
need for nato unity 
the quickly arranged meeting was held at the state department at 
the behest of west german chancellor helmut kohl whose political 
future could hinge on the outcome of the dispute it also is 
causing strains in the western alliance 
for nearly four hours west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher and defense minister gerhard stoltenberg 
debated the merits of keeping and improving usbuilt lance 
missiles in their country with secretary of state james a baker 
iii secretary of defense dick cheney and brent scowcroft the 
national security assistant to president bush 
the issue could disrupt the summit meeting bush will attend with 
the leaders of the 15 other north atlantic treaty organization 
countries in brussels at the end of may unless it is resolved 
before then 
kohl is concerned that his political career could be imperiled 
unless he deters the strong drive by the united states britain and 
france to maintain the lances on west german soil the west german 
electorate is turning more toward disarmament and the leftleaning 
social democrats and greens are gaining ground 
kohl is closely watching local elections to be held in june 
as they left the state department genscher and stoltenberg gave 
no indication if they made any headway good afternoon 
stoltenberg said to waiting reporters declining to stop he and 
genscher then climbed into their black limousine they were 
scheduled to return quickly to bonn 
baker meanwhile issued a brief statement that described the 
meeting as useful and friendly he said the two sides explained 
their positions 
as a result baker said we understand their position 
better and they understand ours better 
he did not suggest the gulf between the two had narrowed we 
will continue our discussions in an effort to reach an agreement 
within the alliance baker said 
earlier as west germans met with the senior us officials 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokesman said 
secretary baker has said many times that it would be preferable 
if we could move to modernize our shortrange nuclear weapons 
although we understand the federal republics problem regarding the 
timing of any such decision 
and he has said that we think it would be a mistake to engage 
in arms control negotiations on snf shortrange nuclear forces 
ms tutwiler said bakers message to the west german visitors 
was that we should make an effort to work this out through 
negotiations with the federal republic and our allies before the 
summit 
bush said he had appealed to kohl that we keep nato together 
that we stay together 
he said the west german leader who arranged the trip by 
genscher and stoltenberg in a telephone call to bush last friday 
knows my view that there must not be any unilateral fait accompli 
here 
and cheney speaking at the national defense university before 
the meeting said negotiating now with the soviets over the 
missiles would be a mistake because of the soviets overwhelming 
superiority in nonnuclear forces 
for the forseeable future certainly as long as there is 
overwhelming soviet conventional superiority cheney said 
theres absolutely no rationale at all for us to talk about 
eliminating or significantly reducing those shortrange forces 
the united states britain and france are concerned that 
negotiating the missiles issue with the soviets could wind up 
depriving the nato alliance of groundbased nuclear weaponry 
leaving the west europeans vulnerable to stronger warsaw pact 
conventional forces 
opponents of the missiles are concerned that having an arsenal 
of lances spurs their possible use and that a nuclear conflict 
could not be confined to the battlefield but would spread to a 
worldthreatening war 
british prime minister margaret thatcher will fly to bonn on 
sunday to try to persuade kohl to suspend his campaign for 
ussoviet negotiations on the issue kohl has support among 
several of the smaller nato countries including norway belgium 
the netherlands and denmark 
in another matter relating to nato cheney disclosed monday that 
about half of the troop cuts he has ordered for the army in fiscal 
1990 will involve soldiers deployed to europe 
the defense chief who delivered a speech at the national 
defense university monday afternoon said the cuts should not be 
perceived as any significant change in the us commitment to 
europe 
cheney explained he had ordered the army to pare its ranks by 
about 7900 slots and that about 4000 represented troops that 
have been previously assigned to intermediaterange nuclear 
forces 
the armys pershing ii nuclear missile force is being withdrawn 
from europe and destroyed under terms of the inf treaty with the 
soviet union 
there will be a reduction of a few thousand but its 
basically in connection with bringing home the pershing ii 
deployments cheney said

animal rights activists on monday began a week 
of demonstrations nationwide against biomedical experiments on 
laboratory animals medical and scientific researchers defended 
their work as lifesaving 
the last week in april traditionally has been a week of activism 
by groups that oppose use of animals in research experiments and 
civil disobedience is definitely on the ticket across the 
country this week said ingrid newkirk national director of 
people for the ethical treatment of animals 
the groups who have billed this as world laboratory animal 
liberation week are calling on the federal government and 
universities to stop animal experiments and use research money 
instead on other medical needs including developing preventive 
medicine strategies 
at a time when there are so many human needs to be playing 
around with animals in the basements of universities seems not only 
cruel to the animals but wasteful of dollars newkirk said 
she estimated the federal government spends as much as 6 
billion a year on research using animals and said the results of 
this research could be derived in ways that dont harm or kill 
animals 
animal research advocates said other methods such as computer 
models can supplement animal experimentation but will not replace 
it any time soon 
in defense of animal research advocates say that most 
experiments are not painful and that about 90 percent of the 
animals used in such research are rodents bred specifically for lab 
experimentation 
mondays protests focused on the national institutes of health 
in the washington suburb of bethesda md protesters said nih is 
the worlds largest source of financing for animal experimentation 
police arrested 50 or so of the 200 demonstrators after they 
blocked traffic for about 30 minutes officers dragged many across 
the road ginger redmon who said she had been arrested in two 
other animal rights protests said the civil disobedience shows 
we have a strong commitment 
although their ultimate goal is to stop all research 
experimentation on animals animal rights activists say that for 
the immediate future they are seeking an end to the most blatant 
cruelties such as amputation of an animals toe for the purpose of 
identification 
to defend their research medical and scientific experimenters 
are using this week as an opportunity to speak out in support of 
the use of animals in medical research pointing to the medical 
breakthroughs such research has brought from coronary bypass 
surgery to cataract removal from vaccines to antibiotics 
theres no such thing as anybody not having received some 
benefit from animal research said frankie trull president of 
the foundation for biomedical research a nonprofit group that 
supports animal research 
in a letter to president bush and members of congress dr david 
h hubel president of the society for neuroscience called for 
researchers to make our case heard by the mass of sensible people 
in this country 
hubel said that while he and his fellow researchers strongly 
condemn any unnecessary suffering of experimental animals 
research on monkeys cats and other animals in labs has produced 
many medical advances that have cured diseases and saved lives 
with tuberculosis polio diphtheria and a host of other 
diseases largely solved can we risk losing the opportunity to 
discover cures for heart disease cancer and aids hubel asked in 
the letter 
dr louis sullivan the secretary of the health and human 
services said in a speech last week that he would do everything 
possible to ensure the humane treatment of animals in the lab 
but i will not let the integrity of our public health research 
efforts be compromised by well organized efforts run by animal 
rights activists he said

police used tear gas monday to 
disperse thousands of angry miners protesting plans to close 
belgiums two remaining coal pits 
a police official not identified in line with regulations said 
28 policemen were injured and nine were hospitalized he said 
several miners also were injured but he had no figures 
the miners were protesting plans to close the two mines by 1993 
earlier plans would not have shut down the mines until 1996 
miners said early closings would endanger their social benefits 
the protesting miners first went to the headquarters of the ks 
coal firm where some entered the building and smashed windows and 
furniture 
later they blocked a main road in the mining region of the 
eastern province of limburg and fighting erupted when police moved 
in to disperse them 
many miners were armed with iron bars stones and chains police 
used tear gas and water cannons 
as the miners retreated one policeman standing beside an 
injured colleague drew his pistol and fired into the air 
about four shots were fired but nobody was injured in the 
incident the police official said

university of utah chemist b stanley pons 
said monday that he and british colleague martin fleischmann plan a 
new round of experiments to expand their research on 
roomtemperature nuclear fusion 
one experiment will be five times larger than the tabletop 
experiment the scientists used to produce what they claim is 
nuclear fusion 
pons declined to detail the new experiments but said he planned 
to begin up to 20 over the next two weeks to supplement the four 
currently operating 
among them will be tests of different metals than the palladium 
used in the original experiments and new designs for the apparatus 
pons and fleischmann have used electrically charged rods of 
palladium in a beaker of deuterium oxide which they said produced 
up to eight times the energy consumed 
i think this round of experiments will bring up a host of new 
data pons told reporters at a briefing before his departure for 
washington dc where he and fleischmann will address a 
congressional committee about their controversial experiments 
the larger experiment could be another step toward a practical 
application for the heat and therefore energy of fusion pons 
said 
he estimated it might take 20 years to design and build a pilot 
plant for usable fusion energy which scientists say would be 
cheaper and cleaner than the fission that currently fuels nuclear 
reactors 
pons and fleischmann stunned the scientific world march 23 when 
they announced the results of their experiment which was conducted 
in a university laboratory several laboratories around the united 
states and abroad have since claimed to duplicate or approximate 
the results although other experts remain skeptical 
university spokeswoman pam fogle said sunday the two researchers 
were asked to appear wednesday before the house science space and 
technology committee to discuss their fusion process and answer 
questions 
a congressional delegation also will visit the utah campus in 
midmay

an astronaut scheduled to command a space 
shuttle flight next year and two high nasa officials announced 
their resignations monday with two saying their decisions were 
prompted by new federal retirement regulations 
astronaut jon a mcbride 45 announced he will retire from nasa 
on may 12 and will retire from the navy in the near future 
noel w hinners the thirdranking executive in nasa said he 
will retire on may 14 the day before new postretirement 
regulations for government employees go into effect 
james b odom 55 chief of nasas space station program 
announced he is retiring next sunday and blamed the sudden decision 
on the impact of some upcoming changes on government retirees 
mcbride a captain in the navy was scheduled to command the 
sts35 space shuttle mission set for launch next march nasa 
announced that veteran astronaut vance d brand would take over 
that job 
mcbride was selected as an astronaut in 1978 and flew into space 
one time as pilot on an october 1984 shuttle mission he had been 
scheduled to command a mission in march 1986 but the flight was 
deferred when the shuttle fleet was grounded following the jan 28 
1986 explosion of space shuttle challenger 
ive spent an extremely rewarding 25 years with nasa and the 
navy mcbride said in a statement released by the johnson space 
center in houston this move has been a very difficult decision 
for me but in the final analysis i felt it was time to make a 
career change and return to west virginia 
hinners blamed his decision to retire on what he called 
uncertainty in interpretation of new postemployment laws 
a geologist and geochemist hinners served as chief scientist 
for nasa he began his space career in 1963 by helping to plan the 
scientific exploration of the moon during the apollo program he 
later served as director of the national air and space museum in 
washington and director of the goddard space flight center hinners 
joined the nasa senior management team in washington in 1987 
odom a 33year veteran of nasa has headed the space station 
program for a year the agency is in the midst of a major push to 
persuade congress to budget funds for starting construction on the

president bush in a letter released monday 
said it would be imprudent to tinker with the medicare 
catastrophic insurance plan even in light of an unexpected surplus 
in the programs revenues 
the letter released by rep dan rostenkowski dill said that 
based on the most recent projections financial reserves for the 
program are not excessive and may actually be too thin the 
projections bush said are based on estimating uncertainties in a 
program that is only a few months old 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee last week raised the possibility of a reduction of up to 
16 percent in the surtax paid by many older americans to finance 
the insurance program which provides extended coverage for a major 
prolonged illness 
bentsen said that revised revenue estimates from the 
congressional budgt office and the joint committee on taxation show 
the government may be collecting more money than it needs for the 
program the figures he said indicate a 49 billion surplus for 
the period 19891993 
bush confirmed that the revenue estimates project more money 
than had originally been anticipated but he noted uncertainties in 
the program remain including a projection by the reagan 
administration that the portion of the program that will pay for 
drug benefits was underfunded the cost of that portion of the 
program is to be reestimated this summer he said 
it would be imprudent to tinker with medicare catastrophic 
insurance literally in its first few months of life bush said in 
the letter we should not now reopen the legislation 
rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and means 
committee embraced bushs statement and urged his colleagues to 
carefully consider the points raised by the president before 
pursuing legislation to amend the act 
he noted that premiums collected under the program are used to 
pay only for benefits in the program or to reduce premiums in 
future years 
if premium collections do exceed our original expectation the 
amounts collected will still go to serve the beneficiaries and for 
no other purpose he said

the foreign office complained to south africa on 
monday over allegations that a south african diplomat was involved 
in trying to trade british missile secrets for weapons for northern 
ireland protestant extremists we take an extremely serious view 
of the facts so far disclosed foreign secretary sir geoffrey 
howe told the house of commons discussing fridays arrest by 
french police of three northern ireland protestant extremists 
the three were caught in a paris hotel room with an american 
businessman and a parisbased south african diplomat while 
purportedly delivering parts of a british blowpipe missile to the 
south african 
the shoulderfired blowpipe sometimes compared to the usmade 
stinger weighs about 45 pounds and fires 76mm guided 
surfacetoair missiles 
press association the british domestic news agency quoted 
government sources as saying concern existed over the possibility 
that south africa supplied arms to the extremists in return for 
information about the missile which is manufactured in belfast 
the northern ireland trio noel little 40 samuel quinn 41 
and james king 50 and the american douglas bernhart were 
charged in paris on sunday with illegal transport and possession of 
arms and terrorist conspiracy british officials said monday 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
daniel storm a south african embassy staff member in paris 
claimed diplomatic immunity and was released after brief 
questioning 
the northern irish who are british subjects were held in 
custody a british embassy spokesman in paris said the american 
described in some british reports as a swissbased arms 
adviser was also ordered held the paris newspaper liberation 
reported monday 
in dublin the government announced its own protest to the south 
africans after irish foreign minister brian lenihan studied a 
report sent from the irish embassy in paris 
he also said he was seriously concerned at the ability of 
protestant paramilitaries to obtain weapons and sensitive military 
material in northern ireland 
gerald kaufman foreign affairs spokesman of the opposition 
labor party asked howe to consult with other european foreign 
ministers for united action to expel all south african intelligence 
agents and arms purchasers posing as diplomats 
kaufman said south african weapons already were used in killings 
in northern irelands sectarian conflict and south african grenades 
were thrown at police in the province howe said he could not 
offer any concluded judgment on that today 
howe said south african ambassador rae killen was called in and 
told of the grave view taken by the british government 
howe said he could not confirm a suggestion by lawmaker menzies 
campbell that south africa was apparently ready to pay 17 million 
for a blowpipe missile 
it goes without saying that the south african authorities are 
prepared to go to very considerable lengths to try to outwit the 
united nations arms embargo on south africa he said 
south africa under international arms embargo because of its 
racial segregation policies has developed its own sophisticated 
armsmanufacturing capacity british news reports say the south 
africans agreed to supply multimilliondollar smallarms shipments 
or money to the protestant extremists in return for blueprints of 
sophisticated british missiles which armscor the south african 
state arms manufacturer would then copy 
in pretoria south africa foreign minister pik botha and 
defense minister magnus malan said monday that the south african 
government is not supplying arms to any terrorist organization but 
must consider offers of weapons technology because of the arms 
embargo 
one london newspaper the independent ran a front page story 
monday saying south africa delivered a major arms shipment to 
protestant militants in northern ireland in january in return for 
blowpipe technology 
the independent quoting unidentified police sources said south 
african arms were used by a protestant who attacked an irish 
republican army funeral in march last year killing three people 
the independent and other london newspapers said that in return 
for the arms the protestant extremists promised blueprints of 
missile technology 
short brothers the stateowned manufacturer of the blowpipe 
reported several thefts in recent months belfast police also said 
a display model of a blowpipe without working parts was stolen 
from a british army center in newtownards county down this month 
the arrested protestants belonged to ulster resistance a 
shadowy organization formed in 1986 in opposition to an angloirish 
accord granting the irish government a say in northern irelands 
affairs on behalf of the provinces catholic minority

meeting with drug enforcement administration officials in los

secretarygeneral manfred woerner of nato said 
monday the alliance must modernize its shortrange nuclear 
missiles an issue that has divided the members but he also said 
compromise is possible 
a british official said privately that president bush telephoned 
prime minister margaret thatcher and that they discussed the 
question for 20 minutes 
he said bush telephoned on saturday a day after west germany 
urged early negotiations between the superpowers on eliminating 
shortrange missiles foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of 
west germany and gerhard stoltenberg the defense minister flew to 
washington on monday for talks with us officials 
a spokesman in mrs thatchers office at 10 downing st gave no 
details of her conversation but said she and bush concentrated on 
the shortrange missile issue 
woerner a former west german defense minister said at a 
luncheon meeting of the american correspondents in london that 
natos nuclear and conventional weapons have to be kept up to 
date 
possible compromises between west german resistance and us and 
british pressure to modernize include a reduction by nato in its 
nuclear artillery shells after the shortrange missiles are 
modernized he said 
that could be part of a solution woerner told the 
journalists but im not pleading now for negotiations on nuclear 
artillery 
polls in west germany where the shortrange lance missiles are 
based show strong opposition to modernizing them 
woerner also confirmed in answer to a question that mrs 
thatchers government is considering deployment in britain of more 
us f111 bombers which are capable of firing airlaunched cruise 
nuclear missiles 
that would help compensate for the removal of landbased cruise 
and pershing 2 rockets under a ussoviet agreement to remove 
intermediaterange missiles from europe 
in an apparent reference to fears by chancellor helmut kohls 
centerright coalition government of losing the 1990 election if it 
agrees to modernize the missiles woerner said it is the task of 
a government not to follow public opinion but to lead it 
he was the west german defense minister in the early 1980s when 
nato deployed the cruise and pershing 2 missiles despite much 
public opposition 
bushs call to mrs thatcher underlined us and british concern 
about the latest west german move 
agreement to modernize with a delay was reached in brussels 
last week by the alliances nuclear planning group a few hours 
later west germany urged that the united states and soviet union 
negotiate the elimination of shortrange nuclear missiles 
britain and the united states say there can be no eastwest 
negotiations on shortrange missiles until agreements are reached 
on conventional and chemical weapons

novel by british author salman rushdie and said monday he will 
personally deliver a copy to the iranian embassy on tuesday 
death threats i couldnt care less jeanedern hallier told 
a news conference 
some moslems say rushdies novel blasphemes islam because it 
includes a brothel scene in which the prostitutes take the names of 
the prophet mohammeds wives and because it suggests mohammed wrote 
the holy koran instead of receiving it from god 
on feb 14 irans revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini called for rushdie to be put to death the indianborn 
author has been in hiding since then

satanic verses opposition and liquidation was to include a

hallier who distributed typed copies of the book to reporters

a soviet official said monday the soviet 
union plans to sign an accord that would allow its citizens to take 
human rights complaints to international investigators 
moscow will sign the optional protocol to the international 
covenant on civil and political rights later this year or early 
next year said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
accepting that pact would mean soviet citizens could appeal to 
the unaffiliated human rights committee in cases involving 
emigration torture forced labor arbitrary arrest or detention 
freedom of thought and conscience and peaceful assembly 
the official said the soviet government has been considering 
signing the pact for some time and various government ministries 
have been reviewing the effect it would have 
there is an intention he said 
some of the agencies studying the matter are the ministry of 
justice the public prosecutors office and the ministry of the 
interior he added 
soviet acceptance of the protocol would be a dramatic extension 
of president mikhail s gorbachevs declaration last december that 
human rights should be given new emphasis in international affairs 
in march the soviet union said it would accept the world courts 
jurisdiction in the international covenant on civil and political 
rights and five other human rights treaties that bar slavery 
prostitution torture and genocide and guarantee womens rights 
that decision reversed a soviet postworld war ii policy of 
resisting outside scrutiny of its practices 
however only governments can appeal to the world court at the 
hague 
when nations sign the optional protocol their citizens can file 
complaints with the human rights committee an international body 
of legal specialists with the power to order compensation 
hungary ratified the protocol last year joining 40 other 
nations 
of the six major human rights treaties the united states has 
ratified only one outlawing genocide and has not accepted world 
court authority in that treaty 
acceptance of the optional protocol should help the soviet 
effort to hold a human rights conference in moscow in 1991 as one 
of several followup meetings to the 1975 helsinki agreements on 
european security and cooperation

eastern airlines would slash daily service by 29 
percent and sell 18 billion in assets under a new business plan 
presented to creditors of the strikecrippled airline monday 
the proposal which must be approved by creditors and a federal 
bankruptcy court calls for eastern to reduce its fleet size to 157 
aircraft from the present 255 and the number of cities served to 77 
from a prestrike 102 
the number of daily scheduled flight hours would be cut to 1473 
from 2076 under the plan 
eastern has been flying substantially reduced schedules since a 
march 4 strike by its machinists which was joined by easterns 
pilots and flight attendants unions the company sought bankruptcy 
court protection from creditors on march 9 
frank lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air corp said 
last week he would reorganize the airline by slashing prestrike 
operations and selling a substantial number of assets 
eastern president phil bakes would not specify all the cities 
where eastern would cut service but he told a press briefing the 
company would sell its philadelphia hub a total of 117 unspecified 
airport gates and 28 landing slots eastern would also deemphasize 
some foreign routes 
bakes said eastern would keep its atlanta hub which accounts 
for 35 percent to 40 percent of total revenue in addition to 
traditional northeasttoflorida routes it would also maintain 
some service to the caribbean 
employment at the scaleddown eastern would total some 17000 
workers down from a prestrike 30000 bakes said the total would 
include 1700 pilots down from 3600 before the strike he said 
paul dombroski a spokesman for the machinists in miami said 
the plan was similar to one used by texas air carrier continental 
airlines in 1983 and it didnt work over there we in the 
machinists union dont feel they can make it work at eastern 
airlines either 
eastern indicated that by yearend under the plan it would have 
18 billion in net cash from asset sales giving it a net cash 
balance of 774 million 
lorenzo has insisted he no longer is interested in selling all 
of eastern following the collapse of a proposed 464 million deal 
with a group led by former baseball commissioner peter v ueberroth 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland and easterns unions 
have been pushing for a sale 
separately a bankruptcy examiner said monday that further bids 
to acquire eastern could be made as early as this week by suitors 
who include hotel executive jay pritzker and trans world airlines 
chairman carl c icahn 
examiner david i shapiro said at a bankruptcy court hearing 
that he had numerous interviews with parties interested in 
buying the airline from texas air and confirmed earlier reports 
that pritzker had been given access to confidential financial data 
concerning the airline 
shapiro also said twa officials had expressed interest in 
getting access to the financial data 
shapiro told lifland at a hearing that in addition to pritzker 
and icahn two major financial institutions had emerged as new 
serious bidders for eastern but he declined to give details 
the two institutions could submit bids this week or next 
shapiro said 
lifland postponed until may 3 a hearing scheduled for monday on 
why eastern shouldnt be sold in its entirety in an open auction 
such a deal would include easterns northeast shuttle service 
which the company already has agreed to sell to developer donald 
trump for 365 million 
the delay was intended to give potential buyers more time to 
examine easterns financial data and to give parties involved in 
the airlines bankruptcy case more time to negotiate over a 
possible reorganization plan 
the delay also was intended to give shapiro more time to study 
documents submitted by eastern management and unions regarding 
previous financial transactions between miamibased eastern and 
texas air

a circuit court jury convicted donnie blankenship 27 of five 
counts of seconddegree murder and one count each of robbery 
unlawful use of a weapon and receiving stolen property 
blankenship faces a maximum sentence of 205 years in prison 
sentencing was scheduled for june 8 
prosecutors had sought firstdegree murder convictions which 
could have resulted in a death sentence 
blankenships attorney linda murphy said she would appeal but 
said she considered the verdict a victory she said the jury 
apparently believed her client was involved in the robbery but was 
not the triggerman 
special prosecutor garrett l randall agreed the jury must have 
had some doubt about blankenships role in the slayings 
in his closing argument randall called blankenship a 
coldblooded killer who deserved the death penalty 
the jury reached its decision late monday morning after 
deliberations that began saturday the panel did not meet sunday 
on sept 4 1987 two men entered the national supermarket after 
closing time apparently by posing as a cleaning crew police said 
six store employees and a security guard were forced to lie on the 
floor then were shot the two who survived testified at 
blankenships trial 
the other gunman marvin jennings 27 was convicted last 
september of 16 felony counts including five counts of first 
degree murder he was sentenced to five consecutive life prison 
terms without parole 
chris brown whose mother head cashier rose m brown 49 was 
among those slain expressed satisfaction about mondays verdict 
i think all of us are more or less glad its over now brown 
said the verdict is in and we know that donnie blankenship like 
marvin jennings will be off the street for quite some time

amnesty international appealed tuesday to 100 
countries including the united states and iran to abolish the 
death penalty calling it an arbitrary judicial lottery that 
does not deter crime 
the human rights group in a study of capital punishment 
worldwide says it is slanted against the poor ethnic minorities 
and political opponents of the government 
amnesty international recorded 15320 executions in 90 countries 
in the past decade but said they often are done in secret it said 
other estimates put the number as high as 40000 
victims ranged in age from 14 to 76 with the united states 
among six countries that have executed juveniles under age 18 the 
group said 
however it cited only cases in which us authorities executed 
adults for crimes committed when they were juveniles 
of the 100 men and women executed in us prisons since the 
supreme court in 1976 allowed states to resume capital punishment 
three died for murders committed when they were 17 
the death penalty is used in some countries not just to punish 
murder but also adultery prostitution showing pornographic 
films bribery corruption embezzlement kidnapping rape robbery 
and drugtrafficking amnesty said victims include nonviolent 
political prisoners and the mentally ill 
amnesty international said most governments justified the death 
penalty as a deterrent but this is not borne out by facts 
nowhere has it been shown that the death penalty has any 
special power to reduce crime or political violence it said 
because those who commit murder dont always count the consequences 
beforehand 
amnesty international said thousands have been put to death in 
20 countries after unfair trials methods of execution sometimes 
akin to torture include hanging shooting gassing electrocution 
poisoning beheading and stoning and amnesty international said 
it is a particularly cruel calculated and coldblooded form 
of killing it is imposed to punish prisoners for their 
political beliefs and when inflicted for criminal offenses it often 
becomes a judicial lottery 
it cited the case of a thai construction worker who took more 
than nine minutes to strangle to death in 1981 because he wasnt 
heavy enough to cause the noose to break his neck 
in the state of georgia it said alpha otis stephens survived 
the first twominute charge of electricity in 1984 and struggled 
for breath for eight minutes before being killed by a second charge 
the report said even the newest american method of execution 
lethal injection has caused prolonged agony it said the tube 
attached to the needle began to leak during the 1988 execution of 
raymond landry and the chemical being injected spurted out because 
the pressure in the hose was greater than his veins could absorb 
it said witnesses reported hearing groans in the 17 minutes before 
landry died 
amnesty international which opposes execution as cruel and a 
denial of the right to life said it also objects to the unique 
horror experienced by condemned prisoners awaiting an unknown 
execution date 
its survey found some prisoners were executed within minutes of 
sentencing while political prisoners in indonesia waited 25 years 
amnesty international said the death penalty has arbitrary and 
discriminatory features that are inherent while blacks are 12 
percent of the us population they account for 40 percent of the 
record 2182 prisoners on death row as of december 
the evidence suggests that race especially that of the 
victim has an important bearing on the likelihood of a death 
sentence being imposed particularly in the southern states the 
report said 
in south africa it said death sentences are imposed 
disproportionately on black defendants by the almost allwhite 
judiciary and that the vast majority of the 1250 people executed 
there in the past decade have been black 
the report said unfair trials and executions often occur in 
countries where the death penalty is an instrument of political 
repression 
it singled out iran where thousands of people including 
children were reported executed for political reasons in the early 
1980s and another 1200 in the second half of 1988 it said it 
knows of no case in which a defendant before an iranian islamic 
revolutionary court on a political charge was allowed a lawyer or 
an appeal 
hundreds of executions after unfair trials were also reported in 
iraq turkey ethiopia ghana jordan cambodia and somalia it 
said 
unfair trials have been reported in china where unofficial 
sources say up to 30000 were executed between 1983 and 1987 it 
said 
amnesty international said death penalty statistics in the 
soviet union have been secret since 1934 but it recorded 63 
executions by shooting there between 1985 and mid1988

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini named a 
20man committee monday to amend irans constitution tehran radio 
reported a move that could have farreaching implications 
including the question of who will succeed the 88yearold khomeini 
when he dies 
the committee included president ali khamenei prime minister 
hussein musavi and parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani it was 
given two months to rectify the defects in the islamic 
republics 1980 constitution 
the radio monitored in nicosia said khomeini announced the 
committees formation in a letter to khamenei 
after 10 years of experience in governing the country many 
authorities and officials are of the opinion that the 
constitution contains defects and problems he wrote 
rectifying these defects is an unavoidable necessity for our 
islamic and revolutionary society and delays could cause 
catastrophies and bitter results for the country and the 
revolution 
khomeini said officials had asked him to correct the 
constitutions flaws and clarify its ambiguities the radio said 
this month 160 members of the 270seat parliament urged 
khomeini to make constitutional changes the supreme judicial 
council later endorsed that call 
khomeini said the constitutional amendments will be put to 
irans electorate in a referendum he did not say when 
among issues khomeini said should be discussed were the 
leadership question and the powers of the judiciary and executive 
branches 
khomeini removed his designated successor ayatollah husseinali 
montazeri last month saying montazeri had been duped by enemies 
of the revolution 
montazeri 64 demanded wider freedoms following the end of the 
war with iraq and asked that widespread executions of political 
dissidents be halted 
political analysts believe no single individual but a committee 
of three to five leaders will run iran in the postkhomeini era 
the new committee is to make the constitutional changes needed 
to accommodate such a council 
khomeini is widely believed to favor this in the absence of 
anyone of his stature or authority to take his place 
another major issue is executive branch power an unclear 
division of power exists between the presidency and the premiership 
rafsanjani has announced his candidacy for the presidency in 
elections to be held in late summer he reportedly wants the prime 
ministers post abolished and the presidency strengthened to 
eliminate competing power centers that have paralyzed the 
decisionmaking process 
the committee appeared to be more or less split evenly between 
hardliners and socalled pragmatists 
others prominent figures chosen included chief justice musavi 
ardebili deputy parliament speaker mehdi karrubi chief justice 
ayatollah musavi ardebili and prosecutorgeneral musavi khoeiniha 
absent however was interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
leader of the hardline faction now in the ascendancy in iran 
khomeini also asked the committee to clarify the role of the 
expediency council he formed that body in 1987 to resolve 
differences between parliament and the council of guardians a 
conservativedominated watchdog body with the power to veto 
parliamentary legislation it considers violate islamic law 
radicals criticized the expediency council for sidestepping 
parliament by initiating and passing bills not approved by 
parliament 
these included harsh new antinarcotics laws that mandated the 
death sentence for possession of small quantities of drugs 
khomeini also asked the committee to review the powers of the 
management of the staterun islamic republic radio and television 
network this may mean the broadcast services face curbs because 
hardliners believe they promote certain political leaders such as 
rafsanjani and exclude others 
rafsanjani once considered the no 2 man in iran after 
khomeini has slipped from favor as the radicals strengthened their 
grip 
he sought to build bridges with the west to end irans 10 years 
of isolation a move bitterly opposed by hardline antiwestern 
rivals

vice president dan quayle embarking on a 12day 
trip to australia and southeast asia vowed monday to address 
headon concerns that the united states is a nation in 
decline 
before leaving the united states on his second trip abroad since 
taking office quayle addressed the annual meeting of the 
associated press 
he told the newspaper publishers his trip to asia was designed 
to underscore the us commitment to the pacific rim and gain 
firsthand familiarity with the area 
moreover he said some american and asian observers wonder if 
the united states is really a great nation in decline with 
high budget and trade deficits a sign of malaise 
those observers ask themselves can we the united states 
still be relied on to play a leadership role in the pacific and 
if not who else is there to replace us 
an important purpose of my trip is to address these concerns 
head on quayle said the united states is focusing on the 
region as never before 
he said he intends to remind the asian allies that the current 
wave of declinist thought in the united states is hardly a new 
phenomenon 
elaborating the vice president said books predicting 
americas imminent fall from world leadership have made the 
bestseller list and prophets of american decline have become 
virtual academic celebrities 
all of this naturally arouses a good deal of apprehension 
among our friends and allies in asia 
he did not identify any declinists by name 
periodically he said waves of pessimism have swept the united 
states yet he added such national introspection is healthy 
because its usually a sign of renewal not of decline 
quayle said the overall purpose of his whirlwind trip which 
will take him and his wife marilyn to indonesia singapore and 
thailand as well as australia is to show that the united states 
intends to play an important role in the pacific 
in a questionandanswer session with the ap group quayle said 
one of the things hes most enjoyed about his first 100 days in 
office is his involvement in foreign policy 
the vice president who visited central and south america soon 
after he was inaugurated said most of his trips as senator had 
been back home to indiana 
from chicago quayle flew to los angeles to meet with former 
president ronald reagan before he left for australia 
quayle and his wife met briefly with reagan and his wife nancy 
at reagans office in a los angeles skyscraper posing for 
photographers quayle presented a wrapped american flag to reagan 
the same flag that had flown over the american embassy in kabal 
afghanistan until the soviet troops invaded in 1979 
when the soviets announced their attention to leve afghanistan 
the flag was once again hoisted above the embassy on may 15 1988 
im very proud to have thisi have a feeling this will find 
its way into the ronald reagan library said the smiling former 
reagan 
reagan also said he thought president bush had done a good job 
in the first 100 days he is there to keep in progress the things 
we did for eight years reagan said 
later in the evening quayle was to receive an award presented 
by reagans financial backers at a republican fundraiser 
on his return to the united states quayle will tour alaskas 
prince william sound to see for himself cleanup efforts after the 
march 24 grounding of the tanker exxon valdez which dumped 101 
million gallons of crude oil in the sound 
trade space defense environmental pollution and chemical 
warfare were issues quayle said he would bring up with us allies 
his journey in which he will combine substantive talks with 
sightseeing and social events is taking place shortly before the 
first sinosoviet summit in 20 years soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev is visiting china in may 
we recognize the soviet interest in sharing in asias economic 
boom and in increasing its access to the region he said 
but moscow has a long way to go to achieve that goal he 
said 
however he said the soviets continue to modernize military 
forces in asia and has one of its largest fleets stationed in asia

when noboru takeshita arrived at the pinnacle of 
japanese politics in november 1987 he was known as the best 
moneyraiser the liberal democratic party had ever known now he 
has been taken down by his field of expertise 
takeshita buffeted by a scandal over political donations that 
sent his opinionpoll ratings to rock bottom decided tuesday to 
resign as prime minister chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi said 
in an announcement on live national television 
the decision came after takeshita was forced to acknowledge that 
he had received even more money than he had previously admitted 
from recruit co the conglomerate at the center of a 
moneypolitics scandal that has brought the resignations of three 
of his cabinet ministers and the arrests of 14 people on charges of 
bribery and securities law violations 
takeshita 65 had admitted to parliament that he received more 
than 1 million in what he called legal donations from recruit 
then news reports over the weekend said he also had borrowed 
381000 from recruit in 1987 takeshita on sunday said the report 
was true 
at the time of the loan takeshita was finance minister and 
campaigning to succeed yasuhiro nakasone as president of the 
governing liberal democrats and prime minister 
takeshita was regarded as a quiet political operator in 
contrast to nakasones flamboyant internationalism his strengths 
have been in patience administration and backroom politics 
consensusbuilding japanese style 
some doubted his underthetable political methods would serve 
japan well in an international context but he defeated his rivals 
in a campaign that left him with a reputation as the best 
fundraiser the conservative party had 
he embarked on a continuation of nakasones policy of opening 
japan to outside influences and imported goods plus an expansion 
of the domestic economy to reverse the countrys dependence on 
exports 
under his administration japan announced a vast expansion in aid 
to underdeveloped countries surpassing the united states as an aid 
donor tokyo won an improved reputation as a responsible and 
concerned member of the international community 
but last summer takeshita came under increasing fire as the 
recruit scandal unfolded with revelations that he and other 
politicians as well as bureaucrats and business and media leaders 
had profited from transactions in recruit shares 
takeshitas name however was not on the transactions which 
were done in the names of an aide and a relative the profit on the 
12000share transactions was estimated at a total of 192000 
the conglomerate allegedly seeking favors and influence had 
offered bargainpriced shares in a real estate subsidiary to the 
public figures who profited handsomely by selling after the 
subsidiarys shares went on public sale in late 1986 and the price 
skyrocketed 
in recent years the device of such sales became a way for 
companies to give money to politicians in excess of legal limits 
another way was to buy tickets to politicians fundraising 
parties and recruit was a major donor to takeshitas affairs 
with all the revelations takeshita was forced back to a posture 
of political reform and he said repeatedly he knew that politics 
had to change and he would lead the liberal democrats through the 
painful process 
in the end it wasnt enough and he was forced to step aside so 
that the party could head into this summers elections for half the 
upper house of parliament and general elections next year with a 
leadership untainted by recruit money 
takeshita was born feb 26 1924 as the eldest son of an old 
sake brewing family in shimane prefecture in western japan after 
service as a pilot trainee toward the end of world war ii he 
finished his university studies and taught english and social 
studies for several years before turning to politics 
he was elected to the shimane prefectural assembly at age 27 
and then won a seat in the powerful lower house of parliament in 
1958 when he was 34 
his political skills advanced him in a succession of key offices 
including chief cabinet secretary and construction minister he 
became finance minister in 1979 under prime minister masayoshi 
ohira continuing to hold that high post under nakasones 
administration

religious practices states members of the air force are free to 
express religious beliefs in a manner that is consistent and fair 
to all

openminded said ms hutchins i was surprised they did it 
but im very grateful 
ms hutchins also will be allowed to observe days marking the 
changes of the seasons 
as far as were concerned wicca is not a hostile type of 
faith said macnaughton her being a witch has not presented 
any problems for her in her working place or anywhere else

oct 31 and days marking the changes of the seasons hutchins 
traces her faith to celtic ireland

openminded and have at least read about wiccans

a court convicted a confessed north 
korean agent tuesday and sentenced her to hang for the 1987 bombing 
of a south korean airliner that killed all 115 people on board 
however government officials have said privately they expect a 
pardon to be granted later 
the agent kim hyon hui burst into tears when the seoul 
district court found her guilty of violating national security and 
aviation laws and sentenced her to death by hanging 
relatives of the plane victims sat quietly in court as they 
heard the verdict 
the court ruled kim was guilty of planting a bomb aboard a 
korean air boeing 707 that disappeared nov 29 1987 on a flight 
from baghdad iraq to seoul it was lost over the andaman sea as 
it approached the burmese coast 
kim a 27yearold north korean had confessed to planting a 
bomb on the plane and said she wanted to die to atone for the

a woman climbed to the top of the right field 
foul pole at empty shea stadium on monday and jumped 120 feet to 
her death on the playing field police said 
police said the woman clad only in a plain flannel shirt

near the orange pole to get to the top according to two 
groundskeepers who saw the incident

spokeswoman officer janice swinney 
the rest of the womans clothing was found outside the stadium

found and the woman left no note

stadium in the early 1980s someone jumped from a ramp near gate 
c and landed outside the stadium horwitz said

about 150000 striking teachers and 
supporters crowded the citys main plaza monday shouting slogans 
carrying banners demanding pay raises and union democracy and 
celebrating the resignation of their union boss 
the departure of carlos jonguitud barrios who ran the union for 
17 years was a major demand of the dissident teachers however 
their leader teodoro palomino said the walkout will continue 
until all demands were met including a 100 percent raise 
he said the turnout at the march despite threats of 
dismissals shows the determination of the teachers to keep 
fighting 
the national education workers coordinate claims the support of 
500000 of the 11 million members of the national education 
workers union the largest and one of the strongest in mexico and 
all latin america 
among the thousands of banners that teachers carried were ones 
reading respectable salary increase and democracy 100 
percent salary increase several key members of jonguituds 
faction including union secretarygeneral jose refugio araujo 
stepped down after jonguitud resigned sunday after a meeting with 
president carlos salinas de gortari 
salinas ousted the oil workers union boss in january 
government sources said on condition of anonymity that salinas 
planned for months to squeeze out jonguitud but waited for the 
proper moment they said jonguituds resignation was a first step 
toward cleaning up the union 
the union has developed a certain life style over the last 17 
years that wont be easy to change the sources said 
jonguitud was probably the most important union boss remaining 
from a clique that held labor in line and turned out the vote for 
the governing institutional revolutionary party in exchange for 
political office and the power that goes with control of the 
coffers of large labor organizations 
jonguitud retains his post as a federal senator 
the unions national council on monday chose elba esther 
gordillo morales as new secretarygeneral 
many dissidents complained she is aligned with the old guard 
loyal to the institutional revolutionary party but palomino said 
she signifies a change the possibility of deepening democracy 
within the union 
the dissidents demand free union elections as well as a raise 
they rejected government offers of a 10 percent salary increase and 
an 18 percent benefits raise 
ten percent ha ha ha marchers shouted some of them 
shielding themselves from the hot sun with umbrellas 
teachers take home an average of 142 a month 
it is common for teachers to hold two jobs to make ends meet 
working in public schools during one session in a private school 
during the other many drive taxis 
talks between the union factions will resume following a weekend 
recess palomino said 
the departure of jonguitud is a triumph of the dissident 
movement but not the solution to the conflict which will only be 
overcome when the salary and union demands are met 
satisfactorily the coordinates negotiating commission said 
the strikers ignored a warning from the education department 
that sanctions would be taken against those not in the classroom on 
monday 
salinas has cracked down on union bosses ordering oil workers 
boss joaquin hernandez galicia to jail in january on weapons 
charges and orchestrating the removal of musicians union leader 
venus rey 
unlike hernandez galicia who was open in his dislike for 
salinas jonguitud cooperated with the administration following 
party tradition and had been considered safe from the union 
cleanup campaign

president bush promised monday to go the extra 
mile to seek the release of us hostages held in lebanon 
bush speaking before the annual luncheon of the associated 
press introduced the topic by saying he wanted to say a word 
about terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of the ap 
who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
i just want to say without being able to give you any good 
news that we are concerned we will follow every intelligence lead 
we will go the extra mile to do what we can he said 
we will continue to keep this question of the hostages on the 
front burner the president said 
anderson the longest held hostage is among nine americans the 
state department says are held in lebanon the others are thomas 
sutherland frank reed joseph james cicippio edward austin tracy 
jesse turner robert polhill alann steen and william higgins 
anderson 41 has been seen or heard from only in pictures and 
videotapes released by his captors and in news from freed hostages 
at a ceremony in washington last month marking the fourth year 
since his kidnapping the state department issued a statement 
saying the hostage holders should release their captives 
immediately and unconditionally and we call on all countries with 
influence over the hostages such as iran to use that influence to 
obtain freedom for all the hostages 
andersons sister peggy say who has led private efforts on his 
behalf said in march he was frustrated tired and lonely and 
tired of being caged like an animal 
officials say the hostages are held by various factions but that 
all are elements of the umbrella group hezbollah over which iran 
exhibits control 
reacting to bushs statement monday ms say said its a 
difficult place to be to hear that we have no good news after more 
than four years its a little disheartening at the same time i 
can only hope that the hostages will be a major priority of this 
administration 
i think one of the hardest tings for the families to accept is 
that there doesnt seem to be any sense of urgency she said

two soviets defected while government officials were 
signing a protocol aimed at easing travel restrictions between 
alaska and siberia the us immigration and naturalization service 
said monday 
the ins issued a brief news release that said the soviets 
approached an alaska national guard eskimo scout and asked for 
political asylum just hours before the signing ceremony on sunday 
the scout notified his commander who contacted the ins in nome 
said ins spokesman gary johnson the ins gave the soviets 
permission to stay on little diomede island and they spent the 
night in the national guard armory there 
johnson said the soviets would be flown to nome and on to 
anchorage when weather permitted 
there was no word on whether the rest of the soviet delegation 
raised any objections to what took place nor was it clear whether 
the delegation had returned home telephone service to the remote 
island in the bering strait was disrupted by bad weather monday 
the soviets were on little diomede for a ceremony involving 
alaska gov steve cowper and his counterpart from the magadan 
region of siberia the protocol they signed urged the us and 
soviet governments to approve a border commission to handle visits 
by eskimos between alaska and siberia 
the eskimos would not need visas to make the trip under the 
terms of the protocol 
the fog and blowing snow had prevented cowper from reaching 
little diomede on sunday and the signing ceremony was conducted by 
telephone 
the ceremony was held in conjunction with the bering bridge 
expedition a skiing and sled dog journey from siberia to alaska 
the expedition consists of six soviets and six americans two of 
the soviets and two of the americans are eskimos 
a number of eskimo families were separated when the soviets 
closed the border in the bering strait at the onset of the cold war 
in the late 1940s 
there was no word whether the defectors were eskimos 
the soviet island of big diomede three miles across the strait 
from little diomede is a military installation the eskimos who 
once lived there were relocated to the siberian mainland in the 
1950s

lane kirkland sees the sanctification of 
greed he attributes to the reagan years beginning to crumble 
bringing favorable winds to the sails of the movement he often 
refers to as a ship 
i think there is perhaps the beginning of some change in 
climate the aflcio president said in an interview last week 
weve been beating against some fairly strong winds but i think 
the ship is sound and seaworthy and winds change 
his is a view cautiously shared by other labor leaders who in 
recent weeks have found themselves awash with good news a rare 
tiding in a decade the american labor movement would prefer to 
forget 
few labor leaders expect a sudden turnaround of the decline of 
the 1980s during which membership in unions has dropped by 3 
million to 17 million and the percentage of workers who are union 
members dropped from 23 percent in 1980 to 168 percent last year 
but many believe the passing of the reagan administration and 
labors recent high profile may help unions halt their slide and 
improve their public standing 
i think the american people are listening to what we are 
saying and yes i think things are progressing united auto

if barometric pressure has you baffled if the 
dow jones average has you dizzy if youre likely to lie about 
having read that 550page report still sitting on your desk youve 
got it bad pal information anxiety 
though it sounds like a mel brooks satire author richard saul 
wurman believes thousands perhaps millions suffer from the 
condition 
its saying i just cant keep up its that feeling of 
pressure said wurman you know it i know it admit it 
everyone does says the fasttalking author of information 
anxiety doubleday 1995 
its that feeling that jerry smith down the street can put 
together the bicycle and you dont know how that they can program 
their vcr to record things 14 days ahead of time and you cant 
that hes read the big fat report sitting in your box and you 
cant because it just doesnt make any sense so you have to lie 
and say oh yeah that was a pretty good report 
that says wurman is what societys latest hightech malady has 
done turned humans into masses of lying quivering jelly brains 
too afraid to admit they dont know or dont understand 
wurman argues that information anxiety is a result of the 
societal demand that everyone become a wellrounded cultural being 
coupled with the fact that much of the information being dispersed 
does not really inform 
its just stuff or data and i refer to it as the 
noninformation explosion 
wurman blames the education system he says schools teach that 
its better to say i know than i dont know its better to 
answer a question than ask a question a longer report is a 
better report 
his new book is aimed at calming anxiety sufferers by providing 
such downtoearth commonsense ideas as 
allow that pile of periodicals stack up so high before ripping 
out individual articles of interest thereby reducing a 
preponderant pile to small stacks of what wurman calls interest 
shards the idea less to look at less anxiety 
make a list of terms you use or hear often but dont really 
understand barometric pressure the dow jones industrial average 
and make a point to learn what they mean one at a time 
never nod your head at something you dont understand 
practice saying i dont understand in front of a mirror the 
sooner you admit you dont know the sooner you can actually learn 
the book admits wurman is full of a lot of things that people 
always knew but having them written in a book gives it the kind 
of justification to say it out loud for the first time 
wurman who has an office in san francisco and a loftoffice in 
manhattan is an architect by training but is better known as an 
architect of information 
i realize how ignorant i am he said im more 
knowledgeable about my ignorance than perhaps anybody i know 
when i dont understand things i often do a book about 
them says the 53yearold writer who has turned his thirst for 
knowledge into a thriving business 
the result has been 26 access books that include guides to 
the 1984 olympics medical terms and his latest a guide to the 
wall street journal which walks readers through a jungle of 
financial jargon 
he also is responsible for revamping the pacific bell yellow 
pages listing goods and services other than alphabetically by 
neighborhood and category for example 
though pessimistic about ending information anxiety wurman 
believes that within a decade the nations data dilemma will spawn 
a new multibillion dollar industry the understanding business 
newspapers will begin hiring people not just to style their 
newspapers but to make them understandable he said some bold 
news program on television will do that and well actually have a 
weather map that you can understand 
and business reports wont talk about m1s m2s and m3s which 
everybody thinks are bus lines it will be information that people 
can use 
because he understands this hes gotten a jump on the 
competition and created a new business venture the understanding 
business 
now thats using common sense which is what wurman says his 
books his business and his life is all about 
i already told you he says smiling im not that smart

canada has built a new embassy in washington and 
the architect says it is designed to carry a message 
our mandate from external affairs was that the building was to 
demonstrate good neighborliness and openness friendliness 
architect arthur erickson said in an interview we really took 
them as the basic theme for the building 
canada is the only nation to have an embassy on pennsylvania 
avenue the thoroughfare between the us capitol and the white 
house prime minister brian mulroney will attend the inauguration 
may 3 
as for the location erickson said i think in light of the 
new trade agreement and everything else its becoming even more 
significant 
a freetrade agreement with the united states went into effect 
jan 1 
the canadian maple leaf flag already is flying over the embassy 
across the street from the new east building of the national 
gallery of art 
the architect is a native of british columbia who maintains 
offices there in los angeles and in toronto he is the only 
canadian who has received the gold medal of the american institute 
of architects 
the washington site was acquired more than a decade ago during 
an early stage of pennsylvania avenues revival 
erickson said he intended the embassy to get across the idea of 
welcoming as well he added that he wanted to demonstrate not only 
canadas unique qualities but also its close relationship with the 
united states 
you acknowledge the similarities of cultural background and 
that sort of the thing but at the same time indicate the 
differences he said 
the architect said the enormous span that is the most visible 
feature of the building was intended to bring to mind the vastness 
of spaces in canada the worlds secondlargest country 
its a very generous span and that to me represented the 
sweep and generosity of i hate to say the canadian landscape but 
i guess thats really what i mean he said 
the 12 pillars on the embassys rotunda represent canadas 10 
provinces and two territories a final touch for the entrance due 
to be ready in about a year will be an 18foot by 12foot spirit 
canoe sculpture by artist bill reid of the haida people native to 
british columbias queen charlotte islands 
not all comment on the highly visible embassy has been positive 
the canadian news weekly macleans in a report from washington 
critical enough to prompt erickson to write a letter to the editor 
said the building was drawing praise and raising eyebrows 
objections and arguments 
erickson who was born in vancouver in 1924 said he wrote his 
response because he considered the article an example of typical 
canadian sour grapes about anything a canadian accomplishes 
derek burney canadas new ambassador to the united states told 
macleans the new embassy is a strong and confident building for 
a strong and confident canada it conveys the message that i 
want to convey canada counts

from its rundown headquarters in a lusaka 
alleyway the african national congress maintains a powerful hold 
on south africas blacks despite its failure to gain political 
power after 77 years of trying 
founded in 1912 the anc has the reputation of being the worlds 
oldest liberation movement but it says it is stronger and more 
effective than ever although its imprisoned leader nelson 
mandela recently acknowledged that the realization of our 
fondest dreams may not be at hand 
anc officials live modestly but in relative comfort in lusaka 
and work in a weatherbeaten onestory building in the alley just 
off the main downtown throughfare 
no special security is evident at the headquarters no sign of 
guns or military uniforms the cramped offices with cluttered 
desks and bulging file cabinets resemble the offices of auto 
repair shops that share the same neighborhood 
the atmosphere is relaxed and the dress casual and the officials 
who sometimes wear jackets and ties look slightly out of place 
tom sebina the spokesman said no more than 1000 anc members 
are based in lusaka the organization refuses to divulge its 
membership but it is estimated at 14000 including about 8000 in 
its military wing umkhonto we sizwe which means spear of the 
nation 
the anc managed a steady stream of political successes 
throughout the 1980s but it currently faces several major 
challenges that have left it in a somewhat defensive position 
the international pressure on the south african government has 
eased since it signed a peace treaty with angola and cuba and 
agreed to grant independence to namibia as part of the treaty 
angola agreed to shut down anc training camps leaving the 
guerrillas with no acknowledged military bases in southern africa 
the soviet union which is the ancs main arms supplier has 
said that black revolution appears unlikely now and that a 
negotiated settlement should be sought 
the south africans have scored diplomatic victories but these 
will be only temporary advances said james stuart a member of 
the ancs national executive committee its policymaking arm 
there have been no fundamental changes to apartheid and this is 
the issue they cannot evade 
anc president oliver tambo visited moscow earlier this year and 
the organization has denied widespread reports that it is under 
pressure to call off its guerrilla attacks 
the soviets accept the direction we have chosen and there is 
no change in their level of support said sindiso mfenyane 
another member of the national executive committee 
but in many eyes the anc has lost the initiative in its 
struggle against south africas whiteled government 
after 28 years of limited guerrilla warfare the anc still vows 
to intensify its armed struggle but the military threat is limited 
the main benefit to the anc of the armed struggle is that 
exploding bombs and shootouts with the security forces keep its 
profile high in the black townships said the south african 
political analyst stanley uys but he maintains that the impact on 
white civilians is marginal since they are seldom targets or 
victims 
south african police say the number of anc attacks has risen 
steadily and topped 200 last year but its bombing and sabotage 
campaign has been largely inactive of late 
anc leaders deny the organization is in retreat but many have 
spent more than a quartercentury in exile and hold out little hope 
of making an imminent return to south africa as triumphant 
revolutionary heros 
we know that change wont come overnight in south africa and 
that some of us may not be around when it happens said mfenyane 
who has spent 27 of his 49 years in exile but we know that the 
change will come 
the ancs endurance more so than its limited successes is one 
of the main reasons it still has the loyalty of many of south 
africas 28 million blacks 
the organization bridges both generational gaps and tribal 
differences elderly black men will speak of the reserved dignity 
of tambo a lawyer while militant youths are drawn to the 
organizations commitment to violent revolution 
almost all leading antiapartheid groups in south africa vow 
allegiance to the organization and it is widely believed the anc 
would win national elections if blacks were allowed to vote 
but the ancs support is far from universal recent polls 
including one this year by the independent newspaper of london 
indicate that there is no black consensus on the ancs violence or 
its campaign for comprehensive sanctions against south africa 
the anc also has had differences with allied antiapartheid 
organizations in south africa 
the internal antiapartheid movement harshly denounced mandelas 
wife winnie earlier this year and accused her controversial 
bodyguards of terrorizing other blacks but the anc at a march 
meeting in norway said winnie should be given the opportunity 
to continue to be the symbol of our struggle 
the anc based abroad since it was banned in 1960 bristles at 
talk that it has lost touch with black south africans after so many 
years in exile 
there is more contact now than ever before because of the 
continuous flow of traffic from south africa said sebina we 
couldnt have survived this long if the people didnt support us

the anatomy lab at khartoum universitys 
medical school was washed away by flood and no money is available 
to build a new one 
the library in the college of engineering cant afford to buy 
more than one professional journal for each of its 2250 students 
sudans ailing economy is taking a toll on khartoum university 
and seven other governmentrun universities 
but even more serious is the toll it is taking on students after 
graduation they cant find jobs 
educators say all of that adds up to a threatening situation in 
a country that not only has serious economic problems but also is 
bogged down in civil war in the south 
the cycle for the crisis in education begins early every year 
45000 high school students graduate with grades high enough to 
enter university but room can be found for only 5000 
at the same time the universities annually graduate around 
7000 students into a job market in which 33000 university 
graduates in khartoum alone are unemployed 
we demanded 300 million pounds 25 million for the 
university this year but the government only gave us 128 million 
pounds 106 million said abdelbaset mohamed ali of khartoum 
universitys planning and development division 
we inherited these universities from colonial times the 
buildings are old and need refurbishing he added in an interview 
and we need to review our degree structures according to the 
needs of labor but that kind of change means innovation and that 
means expense that we cannot afford so the degree structure has 
not changed to be able to cope with the new demands of the labor 
market 
the lack of money has caused a multiplicity of related problems 
mohamed omar beshir a professor at khartoum universitys 
institute for african and asian studies said nearly half the 
universitys 1200 professors had left for betterpaying jobs in 
the persian gulf states 
a beginning university professor at khartoum university gets the 
equivalent of about 165 a month much more than government 
bureaucrats but less than what a teacher earns in a private 
secondary school 
a senior university lecturer can make double the starting 
salary but in saudi arabia or other gulf countries he can earn 20 
times as much and live a much more comfortable life 
facility and resource renewal and updating are other problems 
exacerbated by the university systems money woes 
abdelrahman abuzayd former dean of juba university in southern 
sudan and now head of omdurman national college said library 
reference books 30 years old are common and some are even as old as 
50 years 
the books are no longer up to date he said but books are 
expensive all over the world and we have almost no foreign 
exchange 
instruments and equipment are in severely short supply in 
institutions specializing in the practical sciences 
at khartoum universitys medical school torrential rains in 
august triggered floods that ruined the anatomy laboratory the 
university has appealed to the international community 
specifically the united nations educational scientific and 
cultural organization unesco for money to build a new laboratory 
but so far without success 
such shortcomings have limited the numbers of students who can 
be accommodated in disciplines like medicine and engineering which 
means that potential students usually find themselves studying 
arts whether they like it or not on graduation they find no 
market for what theyve learned except possibly as poorly paid 
teachers turning out more unneeded arts graduates 
some pioneers are trying to make that change 
abuzayd said he is introducing at omdurman national courses that 
teach technical skills 
were producing people who will find jobs he said we 
train them to be assistants in medical laboratories computer 
studies executive secretaries dental technicians in 
environmental studies 
for example instead of offering a fiveyear engineering 
degree where we only teach engineering we also offer a threeyear 
program in which the student learns engineering and decorating and 
studies on electric appliances these engineering assistants find 
much more work than engineers 
such innovations are possible for abuzayd because his university 
is private and tuitions are the sudanesepound equivalnt to 416 to 
500 a year 
education is free in the governmentrun universities

politicians have an uncanny knack for stepping 
on their own lines and for speaking when silence would serve them 
best its a gold mine for consultants who charge big fees for 
telling their candidates to be quiet 
republicans at least most of them figured it out for 
themselves when house speaker jim wright was hauled up on ethics 
charges with the nations top democratic office holder facing 69 
charges of violating house rules no comment could improve upon the 
issue for the gop 
wrights democratic defenders argue the whole case is a matter 
of partisan politics even though the charges came from an ethics 
committee evenly divided between the parties six members apiece 
since that is a central message of the defense republicans 
attempts to capitalize on the wright case right now would be 
counterproductive 
so the gop theme has been judicious righteousness leaving the 
democrats to stew over their own problems the minority leader 
rep bob michel of illinois counseled his colleagues to exercise 
extraordinary restraint and patience until final action is 
taken 
president bush has been careful to avoid the wright case the 
last thing i want to do is involve myself in any way he has said 
one school of political thought has it that republicans will use 
the wright ethics case to retaliate against democrats for senate 
rejection of the bushs nomination of john g tower to be secretary 
of defense bush doesnt like that thought i simply wouldnt 
condone that at all and i would condemn it 
even rep newt gingrich of georgia the new republican whip 
kept his profile and voice uncharacteristically low for a while 
avoiding public comment when the ethics committee charges were 
announced 
that couldnt last and didnt gingrich who lodged the 
accusations that led to the wright investigation spoke up last 
week repeating that he believes the speaker will be out by summer 
i dont see how the guy survives gingrich said at luncheon 
with reporters he said he doubted the charges ever would reach the 
house floor suggesting that democratic leaders would press wright 
to resign as speaker in return for some lesser punishment 
gingrich then insisted republicans are carefully avoiding any 
intrusion on the ethics committee process 
we have been saying this ought to be done in a careful and 
judicious way and jack brooks and charlie wilson have been running 
around publicly threatening members of the ethics committee he 
said 
brooks and wilson are texas democrats and leaders in the wright 
defense 
rep vin weber of minnesota an activist conservative of the 
gingrich school claimed the democrats have made a nonpartisan 
issue into a political firestorm 
in commentary he wrote for the new york times weber said 
while most republicans have been waiting to judge the case on the 
facts virtually all prominent democrats have declared the speaker 
innocent before hearing the evidence 
we republicans are not attacking the gentleman from texas 
rep dan burton of indiana told the house we are taking a 
waitandsee attitude until all the facts are out until we all 
read the report until it is brought before the house 
well sort of gingrich praised the ethics committee findings as 
solid and remarkably thorough although he acknowledged he had only 
skimmed the documents he said hed lived with the wright case long 
enough to know serious work when he sees it 
republicans can afford political piety on this one because they 
assume that wright is on a hook he cannot get off and the 
democratic majority that made him speaker will ultimately have to 
figure out what to do about it 
gingrich suggested a way out short of an embarrassing showdown 
on wright although he insisted he wasnt offering a deal he said 
they could cut their losses if wright were to resign as speaker and 
majority leader thomas s foley of washington succeeded him 
there would be a very large effort on both sides of the aisle 
i think to have a period of bipartisanship if you had foley as 
speaker and to try to heal some of the wounds gingrich said

bigtime smugglers are using 
south africa as a major transit point for shipping poached ivory 
and rhinoceros horns out of africa 
the development which is attributed in part to south africas 
eagerness for international trade has infuriated local 
conservationists who say it tarnishes the nations reputation as a 
leader in wildlife preservation 
they have urged the government to tighten customs inspections 
intensify police investigations and stiffen penalties 
until this can be achieved south african conservationists 
must hang their heads in shame wrote john ledger director of 
the endangered wildlife trust in a recent magazine editorial we 
have been blind to the criminals in our midst 
ledger and his colleagues say south africans and foreigners 
collaborate in operating vast international smuggling rings they 
are among the paymasters of poachers who in the past two decades 
have played the main role in cutting africas rhino population from 
about 70000 to 4000 and the elephant population from 13 million 
to about 450000 
the toll of elephants has prompted many countries to closely 
control the trade in ivory 
typically ivory and rhino horns are smuggled into south africa 
by truck from countries such as zambia zaire angola or 
mozambique experts say the contraband usually is flown to the far 
east where the biggest markets are 
rhino horn is sold in powdered form in the far east and other 
countries as an aphrodisiac 
many far eastern countries have increased trade with south 
africa over the past few years as western nations imposed trade 
sanctions to protest its apartheid policies 
esmond bradleymartin a kenyanbased expert on the illegal 
trade in rhino horns says the biggest demand for rhino products is 
in taiwan which has close economic and political ties with south 
africa 
encouraged by the government taiwanese businessmen have 
established scores of factories in south africa in recent years 
and hundreds of taiwanese have moved here 
thus the perfect opportunity has been provided for chinese 
businessmen to purchase rhino horn and hide from illegal south 
african dealers and take these supplies from jan smuts airport in 
johannesburg to taipei bradleymartin wrote last year 
ledger said customs workers at jan smuts lack the resources to 
investigate all outgoing cargo especially shipments that appear to 
have proper permits 
at highway border posts he said customs officials checking 
incoming goods from neighboring states search more intensively for 
weapons and explosives than for elephant tusks or rhino horns 
also in a bid to encourage regional trade south africa has a 
customs agreement with several of its neighbors and this means many 
vehicles enter without thorough searches some containers pass 
through south africa without ever being inspected 
weve developed a good network of trading because of our 
political isolation said clive walker a prominent johannesburg 
conservationist weve been used by smugglers who have found a 
convenient way of doing business with a good degree of safety 
ledger said the problem lies with light penalties for smugglers 
who face no more than a 2000rand 800 fine if found in 
possession of contraband rhino horns 
its an easy option for a crook he said in an interview 
the penalties are a fraction of what theyd be for drug 
smugglers 
parliament is considering legislation that would increase the 
maximum penalty to a 100000rand 40000 fine or 15 years in 
prison 
in a recent documentary the staterun south african 
broadcasting corp said 50 tons of ivory was exported from south 
africa last year accompanied by seemingly proper permits however 
the broadcast said only 14 tons could be accounted for officially 
seven tons legally brought into south africa and seven tons culled 
from elephants killed in a populationcontrol program at kruger 
national park 
a us environmental group the conservation environmental and 
animal welfare consortium alleged last year that the south african 
military had helped organize an ivory smuggling racket intended to 
provide funds for antimarxist guerrillas in angola and mozambique 
a south african board of inquiry rejected charges of largescale 
military involvement although it said the army did help angola 
rebels transport elephant tusks in 197879 
two south african army officers were among six people indicted 
last year in connecticut on charges that they smuggled rhino horns 
skins of other endangered animals and ak47 rifles into the united 
states 
ledger wants to declare war on all ivory and horn smugglers 
while we have proudly extolled to the world the righteousness 
of south africas conservation achievements these evil people have 
destroyed our reputation and our pride he wrote in the 
editorial they have to be stopped

in business and economics it is sometimes 
difficult to find the real world and thereafter to figure it out 
so often is a dream world depicted that it poses as the real thing 
in the consumer economy for instance personal finance 
publications offer endless tips on how to pick the best mutual 
fund how to find hidden stock values how to cut debts with ease 
and how to slash taxes 
those who live in the real world know there are no easy ways to 
pay bills virtually no stock tips that are worth the risk no 
newly discovered ways to lower taxes and certainly no way to 
slash them that is acceptable to uncle sam 
in the dream world a happy family of four is depicted with 
smiling faces after having negotiated a home equity loan now they 
can afford the things they want a car a boat a vacation a life 
of comfortable ease and luxury 
in the real world however you begin paying interest on the 
equity loan in the very next month and you may struggle to meet 
the payments and struggling of course is not compatible with 
ease luxury boating or carefree vacations 
business is as bad in construction to name just one industry 
it is a certainty that good times will produce overbuilding 
followed soon after by abandoned commercial projects condos that 
wont sell and distressed lenders 
the dream world has little to do with the amount of money or the 
alleged acumen of the dreamers some of the most highly financed 
manufacturers live in the world of dreams and their big bucks do 
nothing to bring them around 
almost every economic recession for example is preceded by a 
buildup of inventories a consequence of producers convincing 
themselves that good times are here to stay and that they must go 
all out to meet the demand 
in fact that tendency has been even more observable in recent 
years produce heavily carmakers say because we can always 
institute a program of rebates or belowmarket interest rates to 
move the goods 
in the real world of course rebates and low interest rates 
amount to the same thing as a price cut and everyone knows it 
the securities industry fades in and out of either world when 
times are good they can only get better and when they turn bad 
they can only grow worse according to the dreamers but when do 
booms begin when the dreams are bust 
securities forecasters often decline even to recognize the real 
world preferring instead to poke their heads far out into the 
future which cannot be understood or described big things are 
always happening out there in space 
what happens in those dreams of the future however seldom 
descends to the daytoday world as seen by the dreamers the 
future changes each week before it ever arrives before it is even 
created it is different from what it was 
one of the current oddities in the securities market is the 
assertion by many that junk bonds socalled because of the risk 
involved are as good as other bonds and to those who live in king 
midas land maybe as good as gold 
and to the realists who have lived through boom and bust on wall 
street there is no one phrase that describes the confusion of 
dream world and real world better than this things have changed 
the old rules dont apply anymore 
they have heard that phrase at the beginning and just before the 
end of every bull market of the century and one of the few 
certainties on wall street is that it will be heard into the next 
century at least

hey kids youve heard ice ts records seen 
dj jazzy jeffs videos now pick up your phone and talk to them 
well sort of 
they talk you listen and your parents pay 
welcome to the latest teen craze telephone hot lines to the 
stars by dialing a number with a 900 prefix listeners can hear a 
prerecorded message from their favorite rock stars talking about 
whatever happens to enter their minds it all costs about 250 for 
two minutes 
kids are calling by the thousands thats bringing smiles to the 
faces of entrepreneurs prescient enough to tap into this holy 
trinity of marketing teenagers telephones and rock n roll 
the markets right there said andrea west who manages the 
telephone service for american telephone amp telegraph co if 
youre a teenager you know music and you certainly dont have an 
aversion to the telephone 
the reigning kings of the phone lines are teenage rap stars 
dj jazzy jeff and the fresh prince their goodnatured 1988 hit 
parents just dont understand was the type of song youngsters 
could understand and parents not resent 
their telephone line opened nearly a year ago and at its peak 
fans were calling at the rate of 50000 per day its approaching 
the landmark of 3 million calls said michael omansky vice 
president for marketing at rca records 
other teen faves have followed suit including bobby brown 
samantha fox al b sure lita ford and new kids on the block at 
varying degrees of success 
its a great way for the fans to continue to get to know the 
artists that they like said donnie wahlberg one of the five new 
kids on the block i think its great you call bobby browns hot 
line and its almost like hes talking right to you in a way he 
is 
few of the messages are particularly weighty one recent day on 
the jazzy jeff line the two rap stars talked about which nintendo 
computer games they liked to play they said they were embarrassed 
when they tried to buy some and handed a clerk the wrong credit 
card just the kind of daily triviality teenagers love to tell 
their friends on the phone 
the musicians have a fresh message every day recording them in 
bunches like the producers of television game shows 
we think of a subject and just wing it wahlberg said we 
dont sit down and write out what were going to say we try to 
talk just like the way we talk as if the caller was right there in 
the conversation 
most messages are accompanied by a commercial for some 
starrelated product youngsters can get a free autographed picture 
of ice t provided they send in a copy of their phone bill proving 
theyve called his phone line 
its the personal touch thats made the phone lines such a smash 
even if it is on tape 
cory eisner vice president of phone programs inc can easily 
say i told you so he approached several record companies for 
his outfit which sets up the phone lines and was routinely turned 
down before omansky took a chance 
its a wonder it took so long for record companies its a 
great deal the phone lines help sell records and the records help 
sell the phone lines both make money 
record companies are reluctant to say how much but simple 
addition paints a rosy picture the phone company takes about 65 
cents for a 2 call with the remainder split between the record 
company the artist and gobetweens such as phone programs 
thats more than 4 million generated by jazzy jeffs phone line 
alone minus expenses for advertising and recording the messages 
there is a business objective behind all of this said west 
of atampt if you can involve the audience more know who your 
audience is youll be able to be better at what you do 
the rock hot lines are direct descendants of atampts phone lines 
that allow americans to eavesdrop on the conversations of shuttle 
astronauts 
rick springfield was the first musician to tap into the 
technology back in 1984 west said but it wasnt until rap 
itself a musical style that values talking over singing embraced 
the phones that they exploded in popularity 
not everyone is happy about that 
a lot of families have been learning the hard way how 
appealing the 900 lines are for teenagers or even younger kids 
said nancy larraine hoffman a new york state senator and mother of 
teenage children 
kids dont know anything about a phone bill it could have a 
pretty devastating effect on a familys budget 
shes proposed legislation in new york that would require phone 
companies to give parents the options of putting a block on 
their phone lines to prevent children from calling the 900 lines 
more than half the states require phone companies to offer such 
blocks although they differ on whether or not this is a free 
service said debby bernau spokeswoman for the national conference 
of state legislators the proliferation of pornographic phone lines 
and party lines instigated the actions 
although new york state doesnt require the blocks new york 
telephone which services more than 90 percent of the phones in the 
state already offers the option free of charges 
but west said parents shouldnt be too worried the rock phone 
lines are hot right now just like hula hoops pet rocks and 
streaking were in the past 
for the same reason it will go away she said

in britains past women movers and shakers 
mainly were monarchs for the past decade the dominant figure has 
been margaret thatcher the commoner and she has put the firm 
stamp of thatcherism onto british history a correspondent who 
has covered the prime minister since she came to office here 
describes the thatcher decade 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
many britons barely remember life before margaret 
thatcher and many more cant imagine what britain will be like 
after shes gone 
in the decade since she came to power on may 4 1979 something 
of a curiosity as europes first female prime minister she has 
become in her own words an institution 
having begun with uncertain prospects for survival she has now 
had the longest uninterrupted tenure in 160 years of british 
politics 
she dominates national life more than any prime minister since 
winston churchill in world war ii she was asked once what she had 
changed 
everything she replied 
so allembracing is the freemarket crusade called 
thatcherism that even the name of her conservative party has 
become something of a misnomer 
conservatism columnist alan watkins wrote in the liberal weekly 
observer means preserving the old but mrs thatcher has not 
only refused to put the clock back she has put it forward turning 
the hands furiously so that bells chime unpredictably and 
clockwork jangles 
she has quelled the labor unions she has sold off vast segments 
of the stateowned sector turning traditional moneylosers like 
steel into profitable enterprises and in the process has built an 
army of new shareholders she has shifted the entire political 
agenda rightward she has achieved the international 
recognizability of a superpower leader 
now after a third consecutive election victory in 1987 she is 
trying to carry the revolution into the heartland of the old 
britain by shaking up the 40yearold national health service the 
traditioncloaked legal profession and the education system 
it has been says hugo young her latest biographer an era in 
which an ordinary politician laboring under many disadvantages 
grew into an international figure who did some extraordinary things 
to her country 
it is a formidable legacy and most analysts agree much of it 
will endure 
there will never again be moribund nationalized industries 
said robert worcester head of pollsters market opinion and 
research international said in an interview 
there will never again be trade union baronies there will 
never again be the working class rejection of middle class values 
by the majority 
the election may 3 1979 with the final results declared early 
on may 4 followed a winter of strikes that left the dead unburied 
and garbage piled in cities and spelled the end of james 
callaghans labor government 
she began with a prolonged spell of bitter medicine high 
unemployment as lossmaking heavy industries were pared state 
spending curbs then an onslaught against heavyspending 
laborcontrolled local governments 
if miners and steelworkers were heroes of the labor party small 
businessmen were the heroes of margaret thatcher inspired by her 
father in whose grocery she helped out while growing up in the 
north england town of grantham taxes were cut currency controls 
abolished and an enlarged police force deployed to deal with strike 
pickets now illegal under her unioncurbing laws 
by 1981 she was rated the most unpopular prime minister since 
opinion polls began but the following year came victory in the 
74day falklands islands war against argentina her popularity 
soared and she was reelected in 1983 with an increased majority 
it enabled her to carry on the revolution and the fruits are 
beginning to appear in a higher growth rate a budget surplus and a 
sustained consumer boom 
male average earnings at 273 pounds 466 a week have risen by 
nearly onethird in real terms since 1979 
twothirds of britons are homeowners up from 50 percent in 
1979 trade union membership down by onethird is equaled by the 
some nine million stock holders 
but the number living on welfare has doubled to 94 million or 
17 percent of the population official statistics indicate 
unemployment is nearly 7 percent higher than in most other 
industrialized countries and inflation nags away at 79 percent 
forcing interest rates to stay high at 13 percent 
opinion polls indicate that while britons dont like her they 
respect her now she is often accused of going too far 
change and reform have become ends in themselves comments 
the leftwing political scientist ben pimlott in the weekly new 
statesman and society 
this is a government and above all a prime minister that 
now believes it can break any convention dispatch any sacred cow 
to the abbatoir with absolute impunity 
critics argue that mrs thatcher has stayed in power on only 42 
percent of the popular vote because opposition parties are divided 
the division between the prosperous south and 
unemploymentstricken north also has widened in mrs thatchers 
decade 
its not all her fault the north has always been poorer than 
the south the thatcher era happens to coincide with the decline of 
heavy industry the norths traditional mainstay and the souths 
closer proximity to the lucrative markets of continental europe

but although the state spends more on the north than the south 
the predominant feeling among northerners is that mrs thatcher 
cares little for regions that are not natural conservative 
constituencies thus the conservative vote has plummeted in the 
north and in scotland separatist nationalism is at its strongest 
in 10 years 
mrs thatcher has made the language of debate more combative and 
divisive she declares she wants to bury socialism in britain and 
some opponents adopt the trappings of east european dissidents the 
latest antithatcherite organization calls itself charter 88 
modeled on czechoslovakias dissident charter 77 
labor legislator kim howells acknowledges that when mrs 
thatcher came to power the left was largely bankrupt of ideas 
about what to do about british industry it did not come to terms 
with the things thatcher was talking about in a sense we became 
the reactionaries 
its not only the left that thatcherism has upset 
her policies have brought her into conflict with large parts of 
the establishment church of england bishops the british 
broadcasting corp the universities even queen elizabeth ii the 
queen was said to be upset over discord in the commonwealth the 
association of former colonies at mrs thatchers refusal to 
impose tough economic sanctions on south africa 
the prime minister is also accused of being obsessed with 
official secrecy and too eager to use the courts to gag disclosures 
involving sensitive areas 
mrs thatcher is also widely accused of undermining free speech 
with such measures as the banning of broadcast interviews with the 
irish republican army and its supporters and the revision of the 
78yearold official secrets act to make it even harder to report 
news that the government feels should be suppressed 
her governments protracted and ultimately fruitless battle to 
keep the retired secret service operative peter wright from 
publishing spycatcher his memoirs fuelled charges that she is 
obsessed with secrecy 
she argues that the ban on broadcasts of ira interviews is 
essential to fight terrorism and that the wright case was meant to 
bind secret agents to their lifelong secrecy oaths 
but the results sometimes go palpably against the liberal 
british grain an issue of harpers magazine with an article by a 
former intelligence operative is banned in britain a bbc studio is 
raided by police over a documentary on a secret spy satellite 
she is destroying or going a good way to destroy some of our 
finest institutions said james cornford former professor of 
olitics at edinburgh university who heads a new leftwing think 
tank the institute for public policy research 
i dont think she saved us from anything he added in an 
interview and she has cost us a great deal 
the frustration of the intellectual left is compounded by the 
existence of an entire generation that knows only thatcherism 
its become sort of normal cornford said recalling a 
recent talk he gave to a group of high school seniors it was 
clear they really couldnt conceive of anybody else being prime 
minister 
to her admirers the iron lady a name given her by the soviets 
is a national savior who ended britains postwar cycle of 
confrontation and decline but the balance sheet remains 
inconclusive 
she has no clearly defined challenger in her own party while 
the opposition split between labor and the small moderate center 
parties looks incapable of toppling her 
plans to privatize the national water supply and revamp property 
taxes are arousing widespread suspicion doctors and lawyers 
ordinarily a conservative constituency are deeply hostile to her 
proposals for reforming health and the legal profession 
critics point to britains creaking infrastructure congested 
roads a poorly run railway system sewers dating to victorian 
times nd insist that mrs thatcher is wrong to place the burden 
of renewal on private investment 
this happily married mother of twins is already talking of 
beating all records by running for a fourth term in the 1990s 
i think i have become a bit of an institution she said 
after her third election victory and the place wouldnt be quite 
the same without this old institution people seem to think she 
isnt so bad is she this maggie

while she has reshaped britain at home margaret 
thatcher has also put a forceful imprint on the international scene 
her strong personality coupled with britains economic 
comeback has won her country a newfound measure of respect in 
foreign capitals 
mrs thatcher scored her first foreign policy imprint soon after 
coming to office in 1979 when her government settled the seemingly 
intractable rhodesiazimbabwe question in africa a treaty with 
china resolving the future of hong kong followed in 1984 
in 1982 she waged war with argentina to recapture the falkland 
islands a british colony and in 1986 she allowed the united 
states to bomb libya with aircraft based in britain both were 
lonely decisions that gave some credence to the title the kremlin 
had given her the iron lady 
with president ronald reagan she found an instinctive affinity 
of shared background and ideology and britain is the most devoted 
us ally in the western world and there is no sign of any change 
now that george bush is in the white house 
she was also the first major western leader to gauge mikhail s 
gorbachevs mettle when he visited britain in 1984 as the kremlins 
no 2 official she called him a man i can do business with 
the relationship has blossomed through mutual visits gorbachev 
clearly knows that the road to western hearts and minds runs 
through mrs thatcher wh is staunchly anticommunist for her 
part she remains an unswervingly believer in nuclear deterrent and 
sees herself as a brake on any western temptation to succumb to 
gorbachevs charm and drop its nuclear guard 
in the middle east and africa her visits win warm receptions on 
both sides of the respective divides and she has won a degree of 
trust by operating carefully impartial policies that could 
ultimately win britain a brokering role 
meanwhile governments are eagerly studying the 
privatization policy mrs thatcher adopted to rid the state of 
lossmaking industries britain happily exports its privatization 
knowhow to western as well as marxist governments 
we are not posing as a superpower says foreign secretary 
sir geoffrey howe 
the days of rule britannia may be gone forever but in the 
weekly economists view mrs thatcher has regained for britain 
the chance to suggest and shape policies rather than to react to 
them

for many the drought of 1988 is a fading 
nightmare but to some farmers in the nations heartland it 
remains a reality in iowa county iowa which had its driest year 
on record last year and the states lowest corn yield farmers are 
apprehensive as they begin planting the 1989 crop the ground is 
dusty creeks are dry and the mood is tense in a twopart package 
the associated press profiles iowa county farmers living with the 
lingering drought and one who finally called it quits 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
linda yoder keeps a wary eye on grain 
prices and she tracks the nations weather patterns waiting and 
wondering if disaster will strike her land once again 
the drought that turned her crops into shriveled stumps last 
summer has not yet loosened its grip on her iowa soil and 
apprehension has replaced the anticipation she normally feels at 
planting time 
im usually optimistic in the spring mrs yoder said im 
usually gungho to get out in the fields to smell the fresh 
dirt put the crops in and watch them grow its like im renewed 
im not too renewed now i sit here and i see no rain i have 
to say im a little nervous 
the drought to other people in this country is pretty much 
over the sixthgeneration farmer said but im sitting here 
and it isnt 
this patch of eastern iowa and several other areas mostly in 
the corn belt and great plains have not rebounded from last years 
dry spell that rivaled the desperate dust bowl days pockets of 
westcentral illinois the missouriiowa border kansas the 
dakotas montana and wyoming are among the areas considered by 
experts to be in the severetoextreme drought category 
in the south and west the drought has either receded or it 
wasnt as dramatic rising poultry profits and beef prices also 
helped those areas 
concern about tough times prompted president bush to announce a 
speedup of about 850 million in crop payments to help farmers 
early in the year 
in iowa gov terry branstad has declared six counties 
droughtdisaster areas and top lawmakers are seeking a drought 
master plan as government reports say 94 percent of iowa soil 
is short of moisture 
nowhere is that more evident than iowa county where only half 
the normal rainfall has fallen in the first three months of 1989 
following the driest year on record in 1988 many farmers say they 
need four to six inches of rain to replenish the soil this spring 
though its premature to predict doom there are some early 
worrisome signs the soil is dusty brown and some creeks are dry 
forcing many farmers to pump well water for cattle 
it looks like august around here said farmer don cronbaugh 
ive never seen a spring where we just didnt have water 
everywhere 
it has the potential where 89 could make 88 look like a 
monsoon he said 
hyperbole perhaps considering 1988s bleak legacy in this 
rural county of 15000 
precipitation was 1518 inches short of the 35inch normal the 
countys 32 bushelsanacre corn yield was iowas lowest the 
county produced 31 million bushels compared with 142 million 
bushels in 1987 
across iowa corn yields averaged 84 bushels an acre last year 
compared with 130 bushels in 1987 precipitation statewide is about 
half the normal amount this year following iowas seconddriest 
year on record in 1988 
some losses have been offset by the 39 billion federal 
disaster aid program about 1048 million has been distributed to 
1247 county producers some applications still are being processed 
everyone who farms got some kind of drought assistance said

payments were provided to those who lost more than 35 percent of 
their crop in iowa county they ranged from a few hundred dollars 
to the 100000 maximum the average was 1000020000 
for many farmers that wasnt enough to make 1988 profitable 
but it helped pay some of last years debts and buy chemicals and 
seed for this year mrs omeara said 
mrs yoder who farms about 500 acres with a neighbor said 
about 17000 in disaster payments they shared helped her keep her 
cattle and buy feed 
but because she lost most of her crop her income still was less 
than half of what it would be in a decent year 
accepting drought aid from the government doesnt make me 
happy said mrs yoder whose husband works as an appliance 
designer but she compared it to an insurance policy 
farming and producing food are basic necessities of life ive 
heard people call it welfare and a free giveaway she added i 
think thats wrong 
already mrs yoder who lives outside marengo is watching 
weather patterns and hoping theyll be better than 1988 when her 
pastures were burned up by june and her corn averaged nine bushels 
an acre compared with her average 135 bushels an acre 
she also lost about twothirds of her soybeans 
mrs yoder who has two daughters captured her misery on 
videotape so my children will have something to remember if 
i told you 30 years from now i averaged nine bushels are you going 
to believe me the corn was 3foot tall ive never seen 3foot 
tall corn in my life i hope i dont have to do that again 
but i may 
there have never been two consecutive drought years but if that 
happens some farmers say that could doom them 
if its dry this year theres going to be a lot of farmers i 
might be one included that are not going to make it said leslie 
slaymaker who has 240 acres near victor on the countys western 
edge 
slaymaker and others worry because they have no cushion to fall 
back on like they did a year ago much surplus has been sold off 
and the ground is drier than it was in the spring of 1988 
its a bigger risk planting crops and trying to get something 
out of them slaymaker said theres no way we can catch up 
even in the growing season 
its going to have to be an extraordinarily good year to be an 
average crop year said cronbaugh who said government aid 
about 8000 and good livestock prices eased some of his losses 
in a year when more than 80 percent of his corn was wiped out 
some farmers already are considering alternatives if 1989 is 
dry some will switch to more soybeans which have a later planting 
season and tend to be more resilient others may participate in a 
program that allows farmers to idle corn acreage and receive 
socalled deficiency payments 
some though remain philosophical 
you cant lose any sleep over it cronbaugh said you take 
care of it the best you can and you do the best you can 
and after 15 years of farming mrs yoders not giving up 
dont ask me why she said theres no moisture no extra 
money why because were optimists and because we enjoy 
doing it its a way of life

for the first spring in 19 years duane 
schaefer starts his workday with a darkofnight drive past quiet 
moonlit fields this is the season of rebirth and hes on his way 
to a new life 
at 42 the thirdgeneration farmer has called it quits no more 
crops to plant no soil to till no more weather worries either 
there were enough of those in the great drought of 88 when 
schaefer decided to make the break 
i guess it pushed me over the edge the burly proud 
exfarmer said of the dry spell that followed years of debt and 
decline last spring he still hoped to hang on to the only career 
hed ever known 
i wanted to give it one more good try said schaefer who 
now works overnights at an auto parts plant we gave it our all 
and it forgot to rain 
when i decided to quit i felt like a failure he said 
the farther i get away the less i feel that way i feel 
better now than i have in the last 20 years im more optimistic i 
can make something of myself 
experts dont yet know what impact the drought will have on the 
80s rural exodus that already has seen more than 1 million people 
leave the land and 273000 farms go out of business but they say 
americas heartland parts of which remain parched will likely see 
the greatest thinning of ranks 
we do anticipate some exiting of farmers particularly in the 
northern plains and part of the western corn belt said gregory 
hanson an agriculture department economist he said the rate will 
be higher than in droughtrecovered areas such as the south 
what we saw in 1988 was a tightening of the noose around the 
necks of some of the more heavily indebted farmers explained 
neil harl an iowa state university economics professor 
the most vulnerable farmers he said had little or no crop and 
no surplus prospects were even bleaker for those without crop 
insurance 
a recent agriculture department report said the drought put 
1000015000 of 550000 commercial farmers on the ropes that 
number would be doubled if not for a 39 billion federal aid 
package the report said 
still experts dont expect widespread flight because 1986 and 
87 were good crop years and the 80s farm crisis already had 
forced out many on the edge 
risks remain for farmers in still dry areas such as eastern 
iowa a second straight bad year in 1989 could force them out 
schaefer who was renting 1450 acres didnt wait 
he sold out in december after losing 75 percent of his corn and 
35 percent of his soybeans 
you could compare it to being unemployed he said there 
isnt any income coming in 
schaefer sold surplus grain and received a substantial disaster 
payment 52000 but he wasnt close to breaking even about 
twothirds of his grain proceeds paid a government loan and the 
disaster aid went toward bank debts schaefer said 
whats more he added his rent and planting costs were about 
250000 a year 
a guy getting a paycheck for 2000030000 thinks this 
guy got 52000 from the government he said people dont 
understand the amount it takes to operate a farm it goes back to 
debt and land its not net money the farmer doesnt see it 
very long 
still he said without aid i would have had the banker 
breathing down my neck i probably would have declared bankruptcy 
schaefer said he tired of living with too much stress and 
unsteadiness and too little satisfaction 
he endured four droughts since 1976 1988 was the worst 
you make money for three years then a drought comes along 
he said then you lose everything you made in the last three 
the last few years it was more of a pain than enjoyment 
schaefer said i could see people coming home with a paycheck my 
paycheck was a gamble everytime i remotely start thinking 
about farming i think of a paycheck on friday night its a sure 
thing 
thats some solace for schaefer his wife susan a parttime 
substitute teacher and their two children 
im 42 im looking at 65 schaefer said if im doing 
this every twothree years theres not going to be anything there 
i want to get to a place where i can set money aside 
mrs schaefer said she too was tired of the uncertainty i 
wanted him to get out of it but in the back of my head i said 
hes good at this 
schaefers boomtobust tale started in 1971 when he began 
farming after earning an accounting degree gradually he bought 
tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment rented more acres 
and purchased a house 
everyone was borrowing he said you didnt want to say no 
if it was offered when you walked out the door of the bank 
they said is that enough 
but in the 80s interest rates soared land values fell and 
schaefer amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt in 1985 
he averted foreclosure but lost his house and farm in a settlement 
with the federal land bank his land once worth 2700 an acre 
dropped to 800 an acre 
the schaefers moved nearby and continued farming despite the 
hard times schaefer said his banker urged him to continue in 1989 
with a little creative financing we could have survived he 
conceded all youre doing is borrowing yourself more trouble 
youre borrowing against the future i got tired of that 
hes very honorable said irene omeara county agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service director her husband owned 
some of the land schaefer rented 
a lot of farmers will stay in a year or two and take 
bankruptcy the creditors dont get paid she said he said 
ill quit while i can still pay everybody off 
he deserved better mrs omeara added but then what can 
you do you go on hope for a few years after a while you 
dont feel its fair to your family 
schaefer works the midnight8 am shift at an auto stamping 
plant 21 miles away 
i feel like im starting closer to the bottom than id 
planned he said i didnt expect to get a 30000ayear job 
but i didnt expect trouble getting a 1500016000 a year job 
theres a lot of young stallions out there 
the upside schaefer said is that for the first time in 22 
years he has paid most of his debts using proceeds from the sale 
of machinery and assets 
its going to bother me when someone farms the ground i was 
farming he said but the fact i dont have to worry about it 
is a relief if it dries up this summer ill laugh

editors note twenty years ago a catchy country song put a 
colorful oklahoma town on the map as a place where nobody smoked 
marijuana burned draft cards or wore hippie sandals to the 
homefolk the song was an inaccurate joke however they remain 
today proud to be okies from muskogee but for other lesserknown 
reasons 
</TEXT>

according to police chief gary sturm 
most of the robbings and thievings and shootings in this town as 
in towns large and small across america are accountable to the 
drug trade 
whoa now chief havent you heard the song 
anyone over 35 who owns a radio and has an ear for country music 
has to believe that if there is one drugfree zone anywhere in the 
land it has to be muskogee okla 
twenty years ago has it been that long merle haggard the 
songwriter and guitar picker put muskogee on the map as a place 
where true americans lived and had their red white and blue values 
well in hand 
muskogee he sang during that era of protest was where nobody 
smoked marijuana burned draft cards or wore hippie sandals 
instead they waved old glory pitched woo and wore manly leather 
boots 
sing along with ol merle 
im proud to be an okie from muskogee 
a place where even squares can have a ball 
what went wrong chief 
well the song didnt describe muskogee then or now carl 
sturm was saying the other day sturm and has lived here all his 
life he was just out of high school when the song was sweeping the 
charts and making everybody in town a bit dizzy 
sturm is indeed proud of his hometown and believes its people 
are as trueblue as any americans 
but he shakes his head at the irony that muskogee of all 
places would be singled out for the sake of a clever rhyme as the 
sort of town that might inspire a norman rockwell 
of course people smoked marijuana in muskogee he says 
i didnt but i knew you could buy it in bars and nightclubs 
around town it was sold in matchboxes 5 a box i believe you 
could also get amphetamines and barbiturates 
but marijuana wasnt grown around here all that stuff was 
imported 
i think merle haggard understood that oklahoma has always been 
slow about picking up on trends from the east and west coasts even 
something as innocent as the price of gasoline when gas went up to 
125 in la it was still 80cents in muskogee when it got to 
125 in muskogee it was back to 80cents in la 
today theyve gotten around to growing some of the best 
marijuana in the united states near here now that cocaine is big 
everywhere else 
we busted some guys recently with some crack that the los 
angeles police department identified as coming from there so now 
we have crack here in muskogee and it has become a major problem 
were catching guys setting up laboratories out in the backwoods 
garys right says jim east a boyhood friend of the police 
chief what we resented was being pictured as behind the times 
although we were we hated that song 
jim east graduated in 1972 two years after the town fathers 
perhaps sensing a national trend finally merged the allblack 
manual high school with the allwhite central high school into one 
muskogee high school jim east now is a reporter in tulsa 
back then he says the term okie was a putdown like 
hick or redneck merle haggard changed that ill say that for him 
but at the time people taunted us with the song i was on the 
muskogee high wrestling team i remember one outoftown match that 
wound up in a fistfight when the other guys called us okies from 
muskogee sang it at us 
when they put the damn song on the cafeteria jukebox we yanked 
the cord and shoved the box down a flight of stairs when we heard 
that merle haggard was coming to muskogee for a performance we 
plotted to hide in the bed of a pickup and waylay him on highway 
69 we didnt but i didnt go to the performance either 
we were prouder of muskogee being the onetime stomping ground 
of ma barker and pretty boy floyd and other bad people that was 
its real heritage 
after 20 years any bitterness over the song seems to have 
mellowed 
now muskogeeans traveling out of the state smile benignly when a 
desk clerk says oh a real okie from muskogee being original 
i used to tell people i was from tulsa says jim east 
now muskogeeans regard the song as something best forgotten from 
long ago like a broken indian treaty it was after all just 
another episode in the life of a town that doesnt require a catchy 
country parody to define its personality and style 
was muskogee really the stomping ground of desperadoes 
yes it was says chief sturm and take a look at this 
he took from a file cabinet a copy of men magazine with a 
feature titled muskogee sin mill of the southwest the story 
detailed wideopen gambling bootlegging and prostitution 
the edition was dated 1953 that would have been four years 
after the feds put away muskogee sheriff eddie briggs known as the 
kingpin of muskogees bootleggers and two years after leslie scott 
was elected constable despite three arrests for running gambling 
operations 
even during the 60s muskogeeans didnt seem to have much truck 
with reformers in 1964 somebody dynamited police chief earl 
newtons car in 1968 somebody shot up police chief george spences 
home he quit and his successor was chased out of town along with 
the city manager and a reformminded city councilman whose music 
store was bombed that was the real muskogee 
heres another keepsake sturm says fetching a device with 
dice enclosed in a plastic bubble its called a jiggler 
hundreds of them were made in a garage here in muskogee we raided 
one place that had a 300pound magnet under the dice table 
jigglers made sure nobody could switch the dice or even touch them 
theres no more regular backroom gambling now though too 
risky 
our criminals are more inept too not long ago a couple of 
guys lay in wait for a big winner in a poker game shot him and 
got away with about 20 bucks they reached in the wrong pocket he 
had several thousand in the one they didnt turn inside out

as for prostitution we closed down our last brothel last 
year it was run by an old classmate of mine john lyman a 
massage parlor in the bambi motel since then the motel burned 
down i think the neighborsprobably are glad 
moonshine a muskogeean gov j howard edmondson put an end to 
it by persuading oklahoma voters to legalize liquor in 1960 the 
second to last state to do so a step ahead of mississippi 
theres still a little moonshining going on says chief 
sturm but just for home consumption you know for tradition 
is muskogee finally catching up to the song after 20 years 
getting straightlaced a nice thought says sturm 
even at the time of the song at least one potential pot 
purchaser didnt believe the business about marijuana 
as lonzo slick smith recalls it a kid came into his 
barbecue joint and asked where he could get some grass 
slick has been in business at the same spot on shawnee boulevard 
for 28 years his barbecue can hold its own with any in the 
southwest but it is his only product 
i had some old ratty mexican cigarettes somebody had given 
me he recalls they were terrible to smoke and worse to look 
at i handed the kid a few of them and he handed me 5 
he never came back but the word got out that i was dealing 
the stuff 
over the years muskogees politics have been as rollicking as 
muskogees vice on one election day a ballot box was tossed into 
the arkansas river lest it be counted 
of all the towns politicians john monks would win the prize 
although the vote would be close 
other candidates would include for example a muskogee 
watchmaker named wilbur wright not a bad name for a politician 
in 1970 the year the song was at its peak of popularity wilbur 
paid the filing fee and entered his name for labor commissioner an 
obscure state office long since without purpose but somehow left on 
the ballot 
wilbur won unopposed 
soon he was caught padding his expense account he pleaded 
guilty and resigned 
not to be dismayed next election he filed again his primary 
opponent this time was a former state trooper named will rogers 
not a bad oklahoma name either 
in a battle of names the revered airplane inventor dead 62 
years won over the sainted humorist dead 39 years 
at length oklahoma voters found a sensible solution they 
abolished the job 
incidentally if you should notice an elderly gent wheeling 
around muskogee in a blue pickup with a big yellow palomino horse 
for a hood ornament that will be wilbur wrights brother orville 
john monks is a horse of another color 
monks is a big man with a big voice square jaw rusty hair 
flashing eyes he laughs easily and loud he feels that he 
represents a majority of muskogeeans hell they elected me ten 
times didnt they 
voters have never had a doubt where john monks stands on issues 
hes against 
hes against the feminists against their equal rights 
amendment against the seatbelt lawi know seat belts save 
lives but people should have the freedom to choose hes against 
perverts and pantywaists but insists he is impartial i 
include both sexes 
above all john monks a member of three veterans 
organizations is against communism 
his brightest moment in 20 years in the legislature his hazel 
eyes light up when he recalls it was his speech against a bill to 
outlaw cockfighting in oklahoma 
after expounding on the history of the manly sport he paused 
for effect and delivered his peroration 
the first thing the communists do when they take over a 
country john monks thundered is to outlaw cockfighting 
simultaneously he switched on a tape recording of roosters 
crowing in the gallery his muskogee supporters waved little 
american flags on sticks and crowed along cockadoodledo 
the bill went down to hilarious defeat 
no john monks confesses muskogee wasnt the way the song 
said it was but that was the way it ought to have been 
while muskogeeans were sending john monks to the legislature 
they were also sending mike synar to congress rep synar is rated 
by americans for democratic action to be the most liberal of the 
ninemember oklahoma delegation 
if you try to categorize our voters youre on a fools 
errand says gene wallace rep synars aide in muskogee 
ninetysomething percent of the voters in this district have 
lived in the same house for 20 years home ownership here is higher 
than in most places in the united states our people understand 
their values if others dont they like where they live and how 
they live and see no contradictions in the way they vote 
muskogee at the confluence of three rivers grew out of one of 
the territorys oldest trading posts it was the agency for the 
five civilized tribes the old building still stands now a museum 
when the us drove those hapless souls out of the east gave 
them the eastern half of oklahoma then took great chunks of it 
back including muskogee the towns population of about 42000 
hasnt changed much in decades 
the states first governor whose name charles nathaniel 
haskell is largely forgotten here was from muskogee merle ronald 
haggard whose name is widely remembered was not 
in fact haggard an orphan at 9 spent more time in his youth 
in san quentin two years for armed robbery pardoned by gov 
ronald reagan than he ever spent in muskogee 
haggards father was born in checotah 20 miles south of here 
he was a dust bowl refugee and his son was born in 1937 in a boxcar 
in bakersfield calif 
the songwriter vacationing aboard his houseboat on californias 
lake shasta was unavailable to talk about muskogee however his 
road manager and drummer the past 21 years biff adams recalls 
well the origin of the song 
merle had the idea in his mind a song practically written 
about smalltown america and people who were not hippies or 
protesters adams recalls it might have been any town and it 
didnt have to be literally accurate 
he recalls the day in 1969 when the band bus was headed north 
out of texas on highway 69 on the way to a gig they stopped 
briefly in checotah where haggard visited an uncle 
you wouldnt expect him to write that he was proud to be an 
okie from checotah would you said adams it doesnt fit 
but just out of town we saw a sign that said muskogee 20 
miles 
i bet they dont smoke marijuana in muskogee merle haggard 
said reaching for his guitar 
the rest of the lines came easy

editors note innocent victims of the years of war in vietnam 
are millions of children without enough to eat many being treated 
in hospitals without enough medicine and supplies inadequate 
medical care is one of the legacies of the communists who won the 
war but didnt know how to manage the country in peacetime the

the vietnamese mothers stand 
patiently in the bare overcrowded wards of pediatric hospital no 
1 holding their babies in their arms trying to soothe the 
onslaught of illness and pain 
in these wards are the innocent victims of five decades of war 
and a failed economy that has left vietnamese hospitals drained of 
even simple supplies such as sutures xray film and anesthesia 
the signs of malnutrition are everywhere shriveled children 
weighing only half what they should their bellies swollen their 
muscles wasting away their skin peeling and scabbed their eyes 
blinded 
in the burn ward tiny bodies wrapped in gauze soaked with 
ointment writhe in pain their hands tethered to keep them from 
contracting and deforming their faces fixed with fear 
these children were born into a political and economic schism 
that has isolated vietnam from most of the western world and the 
aid it needs so badly the vietnamese government spent years 
subsidizing war against the french japanese americans chinese 
and cambodians instead of investing in medicine science education 
and the care of its 64 million people 
north vietnam won the war in 1975 two years after us military 
forces left south vietnam for good but its aging communist 
leadership lost the battle to manage the country in peacetime 
after the war vietnam closed itself off from the outside world and 
did little to improve its socialistic lot 
indeed many hospitals such as pediatric no 1 are old and 
illequipped inviting infections plaster roofs are caving in 
airconditioners are covered with rust and water seeps across the 
floors most hospitals havent received any new equipment since the 
end of the war 
a typical provincial 400bed general hospital in tay ninh west 
of ho chi minh city has a budget of only 32500 a year to treat 
more than 100000 patients and pay a staff of nearly 500 people 
despite a 100bed surgical ward it has less than half of the 
surgical tools it needs forcing patients to wait for surgery 
surgeons earn a base pay of only 6 a month what an american 
teenager makes in an hour or two at mcdonalds 
the most important problem for us is the problem of 
equipment says dr nguyen huy phan a plastic surgeon and 
leading member of the state committee for science and technology 
its desperate says dr john constable a plastic surgeon 
at massachusetts general hospital in boston who was in vietnam on 
his 11th visit to study the effects of agent orange and to teach 
vietnam was distracted from building its economy its trade and 
its institutions in 1978 when its armed forces invaded and occupied 
cambodia and later fought china in a northern border war 
western nations including the united states ostracized vietnam 
for its occupation of cambodia the united states refuses to 
establish diplomatic relations with vietnam and give it aid until 
it pulls all of its forces out of cambodia elections are held and 
cambodia is neutral and nonaligned 
vietnam claims it has withdrawn all but 50000 of its troops and 
will have those out by sept 30 acknowledging its economic 
policies have failed vietnam is courting the united states and its 
capitalism as a prelude to what it hopes will be the lifting of an 
american trade embargo and the return of economic medical and 
management aid 
vietnam now survives on aid from the soviet union and some 
humanitarian aid from some western countries some assitance comes 
from nongovernment charitable organizations and individuals in the 
united states including the american friends service committee in 
philadelphia a quaker group and world vision a monrovia calif 
christian agency increasingly vietnam veterans are lending a hand 
seven american plastic surgeons and two other physicians the 
first group of american doctors to work in vietnam since the end of 
the war operated on 101 children in february to correct mouth 
deformities including cleft lips as part of operation smile 
a norfolk va based charitable agency 
every time i come i bring them a couple of thousand dollars 
worth of sutures says constable of massachusetts general they 
go very fast 
its a social economic problem not only a medical problem 
says dr tran ngoc manh a vice director of pedatric hospital no 
1 which cares for children from birth to age 15 in ho chi minh 
city and 14 provinces to the south

vietnam is so poor that most babies have never known the taste 
of cows milk barely surviving on a steady diet of water and rice 
many so helpless they are unable to escape the companions of 
malnutrition pneumonia bronchitis diarrhea and too often 
death 
if they are malnourished they can have pulmonary diseases 
says dr tran tan tram another vice director of pediatric hospital 
no 1 where you have pulmonary infections you can have 
malnourishment 
a 2monthold child reared on rice soup since birth is unable to 
open its eyes in our country many patients are blind because of 
a lack of vitaman a manh says 
unicef the united nations childrens fund estimates that about 
40 percent of vietnams 9 million children under age 5 are 
suffering from malnutrition vietnamese medical experts report that 
despite education programs there has been no substantial 
improvement in the last 25 years 
eighteen percent of vietnams children are born underweight at 
5 pounds or less and are more likely to be malnourished and 
vulnerable to other diseases this is a very high figure very 
dramatic one of the highest of any country in the world says leo 
goldstone a senior adviser at unicef in new york 
the country is short of food because of a series of crop 
failures and some natural disasters like cyclones the people dont 
have enough incentive to grow food the first people to suffer are 
the mothers and children 
worse yet vietnams infant mortality rate is seven times that 
of the united states of every 1000 children born in vietnam 91 
die before age 5 and 65 die before age 1 in the united states of 
every 1000 children born 13 die before age 5 and 10 die before 
age 1 
unrelenting infectious diseases ambush the malnourished and 
unvaccinated children of a medically indigent country pneumonia 
polio measles diphtheria diarrhea tuberculosis rabies plague 
leprosy tetanus a major killer is pneumonia responsible for 
onethird of childhood deaths the huge river basins of vietnam 
spawn fatal doses of malaria 
the antiquated medical system short of hospitals vaccine 
antitoxin antibiotics and vitamins is unable to launch an 
effective counterattack only half the children and their mothers 
are immunized a 15 series of shots could save lives but who can 
afford them in a country where the per capita income is not much 
above 100 a year 
so short of everything are the hospitals that they sometimes 
gamble with antibiotics outdated in the united states such as 
streptomycin ignoring its possible side effects of deafness and 
dizziness sometimes the treatment of a patient may depend on the 
family bringing in its own drugs vietnamese children are still 
stricken with poliomyelitis and rickets that vaccines and vitamins 
vanquished long ago in the united states 
even those who are lucky enough to recover from meningitis 
encephalitis and poliomyelitis are often left deaf blind 
retarded paralyzed or disfigured requiring repeated surgery and 
longterm therapy 
thousands of disabled children 7to15 years old have lost their 
arms or legs in accidents to disease and to mines and unexploded 
shells left over from the war so dirtpoor are the children they 
are willing to risk the dangerous task of rummaging through old 
american bases for valuable shell casings which can be sold for 
scrap metal

to do this the hospital staff conducts classes for mothers

editors note law enforcement journals are describing a 
satanic threat in america and seminars on occult crime are 
attracting hundreds of police officers in cities across the 
country while some experts insist the threat has been exaggerated 
the matamoros slayings have rekindled the debate

the ritual slayings of 15 people by a 
drugsmuggling ring in northern mexico underscore the need for 
police to be trained to recognize the signs of all kinds of occult 
crime according to a growing group of cult cops 
while the matamoros slayings apparently had nothing to do with 
devil worship satanism has become a hot topic in law enforcement 
circles 
law enforcement officials nationwide note an increase in reports 
of satanic grafitti animal mutilations and signs that occult 
rituals have taken place but some say the threat is being 
exaggerated 
nonetheless a seminar on satanism and crime sponsored by the 
connecticut state police last month attracted more than 300 police 
officers from all over new england who wanted to learn how to 
distinguish serious satanists from teenage pranksters and how to 
respond to each 
sober law enforcement journals are running articles describing a 
satanic threat and telling police how to spot evidence at crime 
scenes that might be overlooked by those unfamiliar with cult 
practices 
among the new breed of cult cops sometimes derided as 
ghostbusters by their colleagues is detective sgt alan l 
alves of freetown alves has never made an arrest for a satanic 
crime and has found no evidence of human sacrifices but hes 
convinced such ritual murders are occurring 
the organized satanists leave absolutely no evidence alves 
says theyre killing thats what they believe in they have to 
make sacrifices theyre killing babies 
the matamoros killings were not related to satanism according 
to thomas wedge a former union ohio deputy sheriff and the 
author of the satan hunter wedge makes his living lecturing 
about satanism mainly to law enforcement groups 
wedge reached in baton rouge la where he was conducting a 
seminar for the state police said the matamoros killers were 
practicing a black magic version of brujeria an afrocaribbean 
religion 
this is not an isolated case by any means he said adding 
that he knows of at least one other ritual killing by drug dealers 
wedge said brujeria is practiced by many cuban criminals who 
came to the united states on the mariel boat lift 
other experts dispute wedges contention that brujeria was to 
blame 
among them is robert d hicks a criminal justice analyst for 
the state of virginia and a former police officer in tucson 
ariz where he had firsthand experience with drug smugglers and 
brujeria which gets its name from the spanish word for witch 
brujo 
brujo who are found in the caribbean mexico and in hispanic 
communities all over the united states are witch doctors or wise 
men who may also practice some magic hicks says but the vast 
majority are peaceful and lawabiding 
hicks says the matamoros killers may have drawn on elements of 
the religion to promise their followers magical immunity to 
bullets or the cult leaders including alfonso de jesus 
constanzo a cubanamerican may have just had an appetite for 
blood and wanted to terrorize competitors and police 
in northern mexico drug trafficking is intensely 
competitive hicks says nobody knows at the moment if 
constanzo actually has some deep abiding faith that pushed him to 
commit these crimes or if he was just a slick operator who made it 
up as he went along 
hicks who is writing a book critical of the satanism scare 
in law enforcement circles says the real danger is that police may 
begin trampling on the religious freedoms of those who practice 
nonchristian beliefs even though there is no evidence of 
criminality 
the fbis chief expert on cult crime kenneth v lanning and 
other law enforcement officials contacted around the country said 
there is no solid evidence that crimes committed by satan 
worshipers are on the increase in america 
i question whether there is a true increase says lanning 
supervisory special agent at the fbis behavioral sciences unit in 
quantico va who is frequently contacted by local officials 
seeking help on cases with cult overtones 
but wedge insists satanists have been thriving on police 
ignorance and disbelief 
it doesnt really matter what you or i believe wedge says 
its what they believe thats dangerous 
connecticut state police have noticed an increase in the number 
of phone callers reporting satanic activity particularly around 
halloween 
weve only had incidents of things that could be classified as 
a bona fide satanic ritual and those things did not involve any 
criminal acts except minor things like criminal trespass or illegal 
bonfires says sgt scott omara 
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP890424-0241 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
omara says the reports may be the result of increased media 
attention 
anytime a bunch of kids got together and built a bonfire in an 
isolated area someone a few years ago would have called and said 
there are a bunch of rowdy kids behind my house with a bonfire 
he said now they call and say there are a bunch of kids 
practicing satanism behind my house 
there is no doubt that occult trappings are in vogue among some 
teens who can be seen wearing pentagram earrings listening to 
heavy metal music with ominous lyrics or even staging mock black 
masses 
what is in dispute is whether the fad is inspiring crime 
lanning says teen satanists true believers or imitators 
probably are responsible for some of the animal mutilations and 
occult grafitti police have discovered 
but though devil worship is also blamed for teen suicides and 
some homicides it is not clear how many of the people who say the 
devil made them do it are actually cultinfluenced 
if thats a satanic crime then what do we call the hundreds 
of crimes committed by people who say god told them to do it jesus 
told them to do it an angel told them to do it lanning says 
are we going to call them christian crimes 
lanning and others point to other unsubstantiated allegations 
made at some police seminars allegations that satanic cults are 
engaged in the widespread ritual abuse of children that women are 
being bred to produce babies that are sacrificed in satanic 
rituals and that cultists are encouraged even driven to murder 
cops who are usually cynical and skeptical and have to have 
everything proved to them some of them go to these conferences and 
buy this stuff hook line and sinker lanning says 
statements of questionable accuracy are found even in some law 
enforcement publications 
for example the massachusetts state police sent its troopers a 
newsletter on satanism last summer to help police spot possible 
outbreaks the newsletter included a calendar of occult holidays 
and a catalog of satanic symbols and it declared without citing a 
source that throughout the united states and canada there has 
been a dramatic increase in the ritual abuse of children most 
often by satanic cults 
that statement is hype as it relates to massachusetts said 
essex county district attorney kevin burke we have not had a 
report of ritualistic child abuse 
david g bromley a sociologist at virginia commonwealth 
university in richmond va sees not an increase in satanic crime 
but a cult scare that has more to do with urban legends and 
modern psychology than with criminology 
i think its all a hoax says bromley who investigated 
allegations of cult brainwashing in the 1970s that were never 
proven he is now examining the satanism scare and suspects it may 
be a similar phenomenon 
bromley says rumors and stories circulating about rings of 
adults who start day care centers for the purpose of finding 
children to abuse in satanic rituals are sheer fantasy but 
fantasy fed by reports of real child abuse and by todays parents 
guilt and fears of entrusting their children to strangers 
it is not coincidental that allegations of satanic 
conspiracies are centered on day care centers he says 
lanning said statisics cited at police seminars exactly 
duplicate the wave of reports about missing children in the early 
1980s reports found on closer scrutiny to be greatly exaggerated 
in 1983 we were told that 50000 kids a year were being 
kidnapped by pedophiles he said now were told that 50000 
kids a year are being kidnapped by satanists 
such explanations do not satisfy alves initially he dismissed 
as nonsense reports of evil doings in the woods and hunters 
sitings of people in red robes around campfires 
but in a stretch of state forest so secluded that it takes an 
hours walk on trails and a few hundred yards bushwhacking to 
reach he has found an abandoned shack spraypainted with 
pentagrams and other occult symbols 
dolls stuck with pins have been nailed to the remnants of a 
6foot cross nearby is a toddlersize throne carved from a tree 
stump it is only 18 inches tall and has indentations in the seat 
so small that no adult could sit on it 
three other huts in the woods a desecrated grave and several 
animal mutilations in nearby new bedford also point to cult 
activity in the area alves says 
law enforcement officials agree that police must be able to 
separate fact from fantasy if they are to investigate such crimes 
properly or locate the culprits 
because a kid sprays a pentagram on a building doesnt mean 
hes willing to go sacrifice a human life omara says but if 
you have a scene with all the trappings that indicate that someone 
is very much involved in satanism would they be capable

former cop michael j nelson once was 
described as walking a beat with one foot in the twilight zone 
hes in it up to his elbows now at the price of a oncepromising 
career 
nelson former chief of detectives in hendricks county west of 
here quit when sheriff roy w waddell told him he no longer could 
pursue an investigation of satanic rituals that began with a spate 
of grave desecrations 18 months ago 
a private investigator now he helps alleged victims of 
satanists but he finds theres little demand for his services 
nelson 40 an indianapolis native who grew up in california and 
returned here after a hitch in the army was a wellrespected 
detective in september 1987 when an isolated complaint of grave 
tampering began a quiet obsession 
the headstones of a small family plot had been turned over and 
desecrated in a wooded secluded area of hendricks county a man 
who lived nearby after overhearing a barroom conversation had 
gone out to see for himself 
he was in tears he could hardly talk he was alleging it was 
devil worshipers nelson said in an interview in the office he 
converted from his homes family room 
rumors of satanism had permeated the county for years nelson 
in his only previous brush with the occult had been on patrol once 
in the area when he came across what he believed was a circle of 
devil worshipers that experience had left him shaken 
news of the grave descration prompted others to come forward 
with similar stories and nelson soon had 15 graves that had been 
disturbed at seven sites over a year and a half there also were 
ghoulish details such as reports of redrobed cultists gathering 
near the home of a convicted murderess and an alleged attack on a 
motorist by a hooded man with a spiked glove 
as circumstance would have it it also was halloween season by 
january nelson and his twilight zone beat had attracted 
national publicity 
it was heady stuff for nelson but it was becoming a headache 
for local officials concerned about the image of their suburban 
community the detective meanwhile was coming up with a ton of 
leads but making little headway in the case 
effective immediately began the letter from sheriff waddell 
on jan 1988 you will discontinue any investigation of the 
reported disturbances of graves and the gathering of intelligence 
pertaining to satanic cults 
by feb 15 nelson was transferred to uniformed patrol 
i was taken back i was speechless nelson said but he 
pursued the investigation on his own time until he was reminded he 
still represented the department and should cease and desist he 
ceased being a hendricks county deputy on may 26 
if the sheriff had his way you never would have heard about 
it nelson says its hard for people to believe it does exist 
i think its more important for the people to know about this 
and to know how to deal with this than to keep it covered up 
in nelsons office amid the law enforcement plaques and 
certificates the volumes devoted to understanding human 
behavior and his third wifes collection of owl figurines he 
reserves a corner for occult memorabilia voodoo dolls pentagrams 
record albums by heavy metal bands such as motley crue and 
megadeth and confiscated notebooks in which devilish rites are 
detailed 
satanists are guilty of not only grave robbery but also arson 
rape kidnapping brainwashing and even child sacrifice nelson 
says he compares the public apathy to the light regard for the 
drug culture in the 1950s look at us now he says 
the whole criminal justice system is inept when it comes to 
these kinds of allegations he says 
weve got to get people to believe people believe it occurs 
only in television and movies but it doesnt its out there its 
sucking up adolescents left and right 
dale griffis of tiffin ohio a former police detective and now 
a widely respected consultant on such matters agrees with nelson 
theres a lot of catchup ball being played now by law 
enforcement officials and mental health professionals griffis says 
nelson as a private detective however hasnt been able to 
attract much business he said he sometimes regrets leaving the 
sheriffs department and has inquired about joining other police 
agencies but his age is working against him and he wont give up 
trying to expose satanists 
nelson shares what hes learned in lectures and police seminars 
but receives little compensation for it other than his expenses 
hes writing a book but confesses he needs help organizing it and 
doesnt have a publisher lined up 
his last occultrelated case was in december when he was hired 
to help in a civil suit a michigan woman was pursuing to help her 
daughter and grandchild whom the woman thought faced a threat of 
child sacrifice nelson says 
he takes on nonoccult work as well but there isnt enough to 
put food on the table thats up to his wife phyllis who directs 
security at a local auto plant 
if my wife didnt have a good job wed be starving he says

editors note summer was spoiled for thousands of beachgoers 
last year when medical wastes such as syringes and blood vials 
washed ashore on the eastern seaboard from massachusetts to 
maryland though officials now doubt that hospitals were the 
culprits the environmental protection agency has established 
stringent new rules for disposal of trash from health facilities 
</TEXT>

after paying big bucks to rent a house on 
long beach island last summer kathleen mckeand wasnt about to 
stay away from the beach simply because of the scare about medical 
waste washing up on shore 
but the bayonne hospital executive remembers how anxious she 
felt watching her 1yearold niece dig in the sand 
we went to the beach but still you were extremely careful 
she recalls you look upon digging in the sand as almost a 
birthright for a child and yet you would very carefully examine 
where the baby was digging i found myself being almost paranoid 
about it 
she wasnt alone 
the specter of medical waste washups cast a long shadow over 
the summer of 1988 closing choice beaches on the jersey shore and 
new yorks long island and creating worries even for beachgoers 
like mckeand who never confronted a closed sign on their 
favorite stretch of sand 
now with a new beach season fast approaching government 
officials are hoping to prevent a repeat of the nightmares of 1988 
with new rules on how hospitals dispose of their used needles 
blood bags and other potentially infectious waste 
the us environmental protection agency is working to put in 
place by the first day of summer a new pilot medical waste tracking 
program for new jersey connecticut new york and seven other 
states that border the great lakes even at that the agency 
cautions that its new rules may not significantly reduce the 
amount of medical waste deposited on beaches 
federal officials doubt that the medical trash that made the 
headlines including more than 100 bloody vials found on the 
shoreline behind bayonne high school here last july came from 
hospitals or other medical facilities covered by the new tracking 
system 
lets not delude ourselves into thinking that this program is 
going to instantaneously capture all medical waste says dr john 
moore deputy epa administrator and chairman of an agency task 
force on medical waste 
the federal tracking program will cover hospitals and other 
facilities that generate 50 pounds or more per month of medical 
waste doctors dentists and clinics that generate lesser amounts 
will have to weigh and log their medical wastes but not fill out 
the cradletograve tracking forms 
none of this tracking or logkeeping will capture any of the 
syringes that the nations diabetics use at home and throw out in 
the trash or the needles that drug addicts use in the streets and 
discard down sewer grates 
if you think of a couple of million people a day in the 
privacy of their home using a needle or syringe for medical 
purposes thats a lot of needles moore says lets not delude 
ourselves into assuming that none of this stuff is going to find 
its way on some beach somewhere sometime 
experts say medical waste is part of a broader problem of 
floating garbage that sullies all american shores 
we treat medical waste no better or no worse than we treat any 
other kind of solid waste says tom super a special assistant to 
moore 
but aids has heightened the publics concern about the safe 
disposal of blood needles and the tons of other potentially 
hazardous trash produced in abundance at health care facilities 
the epa says that 32 million tons of the 160 million tons of 
solid waste generated each year in the united states is hospital 
medical waste 
but only 10 percent to 15 percent of that 32 million tons is 
regarded as potentially infectious into this category fall human 
blood and blood products used needles and scalpels pathological 
wastes from surgery and autopsies cultures and stocks of 
infectious agents and contaminated animal carcasses from research 
labs 
most hospitals have inhouse incinerators to burn such waste 
rendering it harmless the epa estimates that 70 percent of 
hospital waste is incinerated inhouse 15 percent is sterilized in 
autoclaves and 15 percent is transported offsite for incineration 
or burial 
apart from public repugnance at the sight of needles or bloody 
vials on a beach the epa says several studies have shown that 
medical waste is generally less virulent than typical domestic 
waste 
public health officials including the centers for disease 
control believe the risk of contracting such diseases as aids from 
exposure to these wastes is very low the agency says those most 
at risk are the medical personnel and sanitation workers who must 
handle these wastes on the job 
dr james h sammons executive vice president of the american 
medical association cautioned the epa in a recent letter against 
defining medical waste too broadly he said soiled diapers 
were more of a threat than most of the trash that hospitals and 
doctors produce

dirty diapers are full of bacteria says the epas moore but 
theres no evidence that suggests you need a special tracking 
system for disposable diapers 
moore says the epa tried to define medical waste narrowly enough 
to capture the stuff thats worthy of capture because of 
infectious potential or the potential for physical harm but not 
capture the disposable pillowcase that just happens to be on a 
hospital bed used by a heart attack patient 
some lawmakers have accused the epa of casting too small a net 
in a letter to the head of the epa 19 members of congress charged 
that the agency had exempted too much medical waste from its 
tracking system 
there is a real threat that the same offensive and potentially 
dangerous medical trash will once again wash up on our beaches 
because epa has issued this sweeping exemption said the group 
led by rep james florio dnj 
florio says that under the epa plan bedpans sponges bandages 
and sutures will not be subject to the tracking system unless they 
are soaked with blood 
the epa estimates it will cost health care providers and 
facilities in the 10 demonstration states 55 million a year to 
comply with its tracking and reporting requirements average costs 
range from 3757 per year for hospitals to 71 for dentists 
bayonne hospital and other hospitals in new jersey have been 
operating under a waste tracking system the state instituted last 
fall and even before that concern about aids and other 
bloodborne diseases had prompted changes in the handling of 
patients blood and used needles 
we use precautions now for all patients says thomas 
pontoriero the hospitals director of environmental services 
that led to the installation of new locked containers on the 
wall of each patient room where nurses deposit needles immediately 
after they are used the sealed containers are picked up and 
dropped in a special cage before being emptied and the contents 
incinerated 
likewise there are now special white baskets with red liners in 
each room for other medical waste bound for the incinerator and 
even the linen baskets in the hallways now have a special vinyl 
liner to keep blood from seeping through 
bayonne a prosperous 299bed community hospital that 
celebrated its centennial last year is also hiring an extra 
sanitation worker to deal exclusively with the medical waste 
including weighing and logging it before incineration 
in restrospect pontoriero says we have always followed 
precaution procedures most hospitals have handled it properly but 
its good to have a formal protocol to follow in handling this 
stuff its better to be safe than sorry 
the hospitals incinerator broke down last july and was out of 
operation for nearly four months pontoriero spent 24000 having a 
waste disposal company cart the medical waste off twice a week for 
eventual incineration in south carolina 
the disposal company eastern chemical waste systems had a 
foolproof manifest system pontoriero says we had their 
documentation signed by them about the number of boxes that went 
out and the total weight fifteen days after they picked it up we 
received a copy back signed by the outfit in south carolina that 
was burning this stuff for us 
the federal pilot program will rely on similar logs that both 
the health facilities and transporters will fill out if a hospital 
fails to get a signed receipt back from the waste destination point 
in 45 days it must notify both the epa and the state violators 
can be fined up to 50000 per day and sent to jail for up to five 
years 
it was just after the hospital incinerator broke down that some 
teenagers walking on the shoreline behind bayonne high school 
found the first blood vials 
it was just a coincidence but it caused a few anxious moments 
for pontoriero and kathleen mckeand the hospitals director of 
marketing and public relations 
we knew what eastern chemicals credentials were mckeand 
says but once its out of our hands its not like we ride 
shotgun on their trucks to make sure it is going to south 
carolina 
the medical trash on bayonnes shoreline was never traced to the 
source 
but the epas super said that the evidence points to 
individuals not facilities as being responsible for the bulk of 
the medical waste that washed up on beaches from maryland to 
massachusetts last year 
one of the great myths of this past summer was that the 
facilities were somehow midnight dumping their waste he says

editors note doctors disagree on whether kids should be put 
on lowfat diets like their mommies and daddies many cardiologists 
believe that everyone should cut down on fat after infancy 
however some pediatricians worry that lowfat diets for children 
will lead to malnutrition 
</TEXT>

should kids catch cholesterol phobia 
certainly its going around for lots of grownups sausage is 
sin bacon is verboten a juicy steak is dietary blasphemy 
americans are concerned not to say obsessed over what they 
eat and the belief has taken root that youngsters should watch 
their diets too 
it makes sense heart disease starts early the man who dies of 
a heart attack at 65 is the victim of an illness that probably 
began in nursery school 
many doctors believe they can forestall this insidious 
destruction by starting people on healthy diets in childhood while 
they caution that infants need lots of fat to grow quickly these 
experts argue that after age 2 everybody should follow a 
prudent diet 
definitions vary but in general this means that 30 percent or 
less of the days calories should come from fat and only a third 
of the fat should be the saturated variety 
people get heart disease because they inherit the wrong genes 
they can improve their chances of surviving and perhaps avoid the 
disease completely if they eat right too much saturated fat in 
the diet dangerously raises their cholesterol levels over a 
lifetime this clogs the hearts plumbing and eventually stops it 
up entirely 
almost everyone agrees that a prudent diet is good or at least 
harmless for adults even if people have good heart genes it will 
help them keep off weight and maybe give them an edge against some 
kinds of cancer 
but when it comes to children the consensus ends in general 
the disagreement pits heart doctors against kids doctors many 
cardiologists believe that everyone should cut down on fat after 
infancy however some pediatricians worry that lowfat diets for 
children will lead to malnutrition 
its a matter of emphasis says dr laurence finberg a 
pediatrician at the state university of new york in brooklyn 
pediatricians have a concern about adequate growth cardiologists 
come from the adult sector and they see it a little differently 
kids need lots of calories to grow fat is natures richest 
source of calories pound for pound fat contains twice as many 
calories as carbohydrates 
pediatricians argue that if kids cut out highfat food such as 
whole milk and ordinary hamburgers they will need to eat a lot 
more vegetables and other food to get enough calories 
while eating a lowfat diet with adequate calories is certainly 
possible dr marc s jacobson warns that parents sometimes go 
overboard even nutritionists have trouble figuring the precise 
percentage of fat in the diet parents sometimes overshoot and cut 
their youngsters fat levels back to 20 percent or 25 percent of 
calories 
as a result the children may not get enough energy especially 
if they are picky eaters and their growth will be stunted 
i tell parents not to change thier childrens diet says 
jacobson a pediatrician at long island jewish medical center in 
new hyde park ny if they dont have a family risk of heart 
disease then i dont think we should be doing anything at this 
point in time 
the american academy of pediatrics recommends that children get 
30 percent to 40 percent of their calories from fat which is 
essentially what they are already eating a federal survey found 
that american children get between 34 percent and 39 percent from 
fat 
pediatrians and cardiologists agree that children with a family 
history of heart disease should have their cholesterol checked and 
they should go on diets if their cholesterol levels are high but 
pediatricians generally balk at rigorously squeezing the fat out of 
every youngsters diet 
i think runofthemill parents should be aware that a 
highfat diet is not good and should avoid a highfat diet says 
finberg who is chairman of the academys nutrition committee 
you dont need to say it any more stringently than that 
to back up their concern some pediatricians cite the studies of 
dr fima lifshitz of north shore university hospital in manhasset 
ny three years ago he reported the cases of seven children who 
failed to grow adequately because their parents had put them on 
diets the parents were worried about heart disease and obesity 
despite such reports many cardiologists believe the chances are 
remote that youngsters wont get enough to eat especially enough 
fat on the other hand the dangers of too much cholesterol in the 
blood are clear 
these doctors would like to see childrens cholesterol levels 
drop from the present level of 160 milligrams per deciliter of 
blood to 140 or lower that means that by the time they reach 
adulthood their cholesterol will still average below 200 which is 
generally considered to be a healthy level 
we believe that the ideal level of cholesterol in the blood 
would be between 110 and 140 for children says dr curtis 
ellison a cardiologist at boston university medical school if 
we could achieve that we could put every cardiologist out of 
business 20 years from now 
probably the leading advocate of the prudent diet for children 
is the american heart association dr frank a franklin of 
louisiana state university a member of the associations nutrition 
committee says children can easily cut their fat to a healthy 
level without making radical changes or sacrificing calories 
the rules are simple he says stick with 1 percent milk choose 
lean meat and lowfat cheese and buy snacks and desserts that 
dont contain lard or tropical oils 
we are not talking about ripping cookies out of childrens 
hands and putting a cucumber there franklin says we are being 
painted as puritans as though we are trying to restructure 
american life through diet we are only trying to make people live 
longer

editors note if its pleasing to the nose theres probably a 
market for it thats the philosophy of aroma researchers at a new 
jersey company whose customers range from soap manufacturers to the 
makers of fine perfumes they even formulated a dinosaur 
vegetation fragrance for the philadelphia zoo 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
a honey bee would likely have a nervous 
breakdown if trapped inside a new jersey fragrance factory where 
scientists are constantly in search of new scents to sell 
an overwhelming odor fills the plant of international flavors 
and fragrances it is the mingled essence of hundreds of 
concentrated odors released into the air when workers open 
canisters filled with rare ingredients that are blended to create a 
desired smell 
sweet orange and rare rose oils compete with spicy vanilla and 
cinnamon a lovely lavender scent tangles in the air with the 
woodsy odor of moss 
iff scientists have devised scents for detergent companies that 
ask for something fresh or clean they put the smell in 
products that range from household air fresheners to expensive 
perfumes 
iff researchers also have faced some unusual challenges says 
companmy spokesman william g dalton when the philadelphia zoo 
wanted to let children experience all their senses in its new 
treehouse exhibit iff devised a dinosaur vegetation 
fragrance 
when the owner of a shopping mall bakery was overwhelmed by the 
omnipresent odor of a pizza shop next door he needed sensory 
competition dalton says we developed a smell for freshbaked 
goods and it worked 
in 1988 iff which employs 4800 people in 36 countries 
reported net sales of 8395 million and a net income of 1287 
million the company touts itself as the ghostwriter to its 
clients refusing to identify any of the famous brands of 
fragrances the company has developed 
not everyone is impressed with the smells though 
environmentalists and local residents have complained about noxious 
odors and discharges into the raritan bay prompting state 
environmental officials to impose fines 
at times those fines have been stiff including a 125 million 
penalty in october 1986 for groundwater pollution in view of the 
problems the company is modifying its monitoring equipment as the 
facility continues to grow 
the business of fragrance boomed when federal health officials 
banned the use of an antibacterial ingredient in soaps that killed 
odorcausing bacteria dalton says 
fragrance was the natural substitute dalton says 
but the fascination with fragrance is hardly a new phenomenon 
in february archaeologists dug up a 2000yearold flask of oil 
that might have been used to anoint ancient israelite kings 
today scents are found in advertising strips between the pages 
of magazines in most every brand of shampoo and even in plastic 
toys 
we have not seen any indication that there is too much 
fragrance on the market dalton says people get excited by new 
fragrances as long as its pleasing its acceptable 
to get public reaction to a newly developed scent iff hires 
local residents to smell a variety of different things in a 
variety of ways whether on skin or cloth or whatever says ira 
katz director of research and development were not necessarily 
interested in whether they personally like it but whether it 
covers a malodor such as body odor or kitchen odor 
testers in cubicles mostly women take quick sniffs from 
small jars then record the overall intensity of each in some 
instances the testers have sniffed forearms smelled dank laundry 
or even hovered over a row of smelly garbage cans 
in iffs compounding facility next door employees look like 
chefs as they mix oils crystals and other liquids in 
stainlesssteel buckets and tanks to produce concentrates of 
various fragrances the recipes are topsecret and divided up 
among several employees to protect the secrecy of a customers 
formula says ted trembley general manager of the iff compounding 
facility 
the fragrance compounds are then shipped to a customers own 
plant where they are mixed with other ingredients to create the 
completed product 
the raw ingredients used to produce an individual fragrance vary 
in their rarity bulgarian rose otto for instance is perhaps 
the most expensive it takes one ton of rose petals to make about 
two pounds of the intensely strongsmelling oil worth more than 
5000 trembley says 
the high cost of natural ingredients such as sandalwood and 
exotic flowers has led iff researchers to devise methods of 
artificially reproducing scents 
the scientists also have devised a method to capture a scent in 
its natural state the most desirable intensity trembley says 
a fresh flower does not have the same molecular structure 
after it is cut he says 
to duplicate those exact scents scientists use a portable 
mechanism that can be taken anywhere from the tiny greenhouse on 
the roof of iff headquarters to a large field of flowers in europe 
the method involves placing a small glass globe over a flower 
and using a simple pump to draw the air around the blossom into a 
small tube says robert trenkle a senior project chemist 
an absorbent material in the tube captures the aroma 
molecules and the material is then analyzed with a spectrometer 
to determine its primary components 
the trickiest part is putting all the components back together 
and coming up with the same scent trenkle says 
a flowers scent he says is an elaborate mixture of 
chemicals being emittedusually to attract an insect a flowers 
odor is not for us to enjoy its for a much more important 
reason 
in the past decade iff has concentrated on capturing thousands 
of fragrance notes and reproducing them for the benefit of the 
human nose dalton says some fine perfumes he says may be 
combined from 1500 ingredients 
our perfumers are very creative people he says they are 
actually artists starting with a blank canvas developing a 
fragrance from zero 
despite the technological advances made in creating new scents 
and synthetically reproducing scents dalton acknowledges that one 
part of iffs scientific and creative process will probably never 
be duplicated 
we can test our products only with the human nose he says 
and even then its still very subjective

ray charles meet charles wadsworth charles 
wadsworth meet ray charles that may be the scenario one friday 
night in may when these two accomplished pianists meet backstage at 
the new york city ballet 
it is a bit of stage irony that these two remarkable musicians 
were both born in georgia about a year apart both trod the boards 
for 40 years or more fashioning stellar careers and yet their 
paths never crossed until now 
in the same week in may ray charles and charles wadsworth will 
be featured in live from lincoln center broadcasts on pbs 
playing two separate programs of music in their separate 
inimitable styles 
ray charles at home in los angeles plans to turn on tv today 
may 7 at 5 pm edt for a twohour concert by the chamber 
music society of lincoln center charles wadsworth will play and 
make a speech summing up 20 years of incredibly intense hard 
muchloved work 
wadsworth has been artistic director of the society since its 
beginning and has seen it grow from 16 concerts a season to 90 he 
decided to retire at the end of this season when the society was 
20 and he would be turning 60 
wadsworth plans to take his wife to a birthday dinner next 
friday and then to the new york state theater to see three ballets 
by the new york city ballet the middle 50minute one at 9 pm 
edt will be televised it will have ray charles on stage with 
the dancers playing piano and singing his songs a fool for 
you a 1955 ray charles composition is also the title of the 
ballet 
then charles wadsworth may go backstage to meet ray charles 
ray charles who was born in albany ga on sept 23 1930 
studied classical music at the state school for the blind in st 
augustine ga long before he became famous for his exhilarating 
combination of secularized gospel blues and pop music 
charles wadsworth born in newman ga on may 21 1929 was 
first primarily a piano accompanist he has been working in 
classical chamber music since gian carlo menotti had him set up 
daily chamber concerts at the spoleto festival in italy in 1960 
wadsworth has written some pop ballads and intends to use time 
afforded by retirement to write some more as well as play the 
piano more often and possibly do something on cable tv 
for the ballet ray charles says choreographer peter martins 
was the cat who picked some of my early recordings i had to go 
back and learn the songs the way i did them at that time they took 
the records and thats what they learned the steps to i play some 
of those songs today but i play them so different 
charles was happy with the songs that were chosen ive been 
very fortunate in my recording career he says i never was put 
in a position to record anything i didnt like record companies 
always said hey man whatever you record you record 
the first performance of a fool for you was last spring 
during the new york city ballets american music festival charles 
who never had provided a live ballet score before didnt get 
carried away and stretch out on any of the numbers im not going 
to do something to goof them up he says 
on stage with him on friday as they were for last years 
premiere will be his backup singers the raeletts and most of the 
members of his first band they wanted it as close to the same 
sound as possible he says i went out and found the cats they 
all have their own things going now they come in and do this just 
for me which i think is sweet 
todays chamber music concert will include poulencs sextet 
for piano and winds one of pianist wadsworths favorites ive 
been playing that 30 years now he says its a very cheerful 
sensuous warm piece it seemed the ideal thing for me to play in 
this final concert 
asked what he considers the chamber music society of lincoln 
centers greatest achievement wadsworth replies i think it has 
been to focus people all around the country on the incredible 
wealth of chamber music repertoire and the excitement that can be 
generated by having the very greatest virtuoso artists perform this 
music together 
there are so many more chamber music events around the country 
than we ever dreamed would be happening when we started this 
thing 
of the two ray charles was first on television in seattle in 
1948 my trio had this 15minute radio show every week he 
recalls they came in and filmed part of it we didnt do 
anything great on it but i was playing my music and getting it 
exposed i was extremely excited i was beside myself tv wasnt 
big then bars had one tv and people would meet up there and 
watch 
these days charles turns down more tv than he accepts he 
prefers to tour with a band and the raeletts and to perform with 
orchestras in symphonic arrangements of his music 
thinking about hearing charles perform for ballet wadsworth 
says ive always had the greatest admiration for my fellow 
georgian i cant wait 
on the other side charles says that he likes chamber music 
when it is played right i have to tell you i like any kind of 
music i can sit down and listen to and it makes sense

veteran producer roger l stevens says broadway 
is suffering from a severe shortage of good writers 
the good writers have gotten old and died and television gets 
the young ones before they develop their craft he says 
matteroffactly there was a time in the 1950s when there might 
be 25 firstrate scripts floating about at any one time not any 
mlay in paris cast mikhail baryshnikov in the 
lead role the play has broken the house record at the ethel 
barrymore theater 
it couldnt miss stevens says here is one of the most 
famous short stories of all time by one of the most famous authors 
of all time plus a superstar all in one package 
metamorphosis and ar gurneys hit the cocktail hour 
now playing offbroadway are stevens first new york shows since 
he retired last year as chairman of the board at the john f 
kennedy center for the performing arts in washington i spent the 
last three years trying to give the position to somebody he 
quips 
for 17 years he headed the behemoth cultural institution which 
was originally proposed by president kennedy in 1961 as the 
national cultural center 
in the beginning many in congress were against the cultural 
center later named after the late president but stevens 
persisted he went from congressman to congressman to gain support 
for the project even after the gleaming white marble structure 
opened in the early 70s he had to battle for money 
we were always so broke stevens recalls we never got any 
government money for productions 
it was the centers involvement in such musicals as pippin 
and annie that brought in money plus stevens neverflagging 
efforts to raise cash from private and corporate donors 
stevens remains on the centers board of trustees and he hasnt 
given up his other cultural jobs among his other duties are the 
chairmanship of the national book awards membership on the 
presidents committee on the arts and humanities and founding 
father of the fund for new american plays 
before stevens entered the theater he had been a successful 
real estate man he headed a syndicate that bought and sold the 
empire state building in the early 1950s and he also has extensive 
real estate holdings in seattle 
i never wanted to be a producer stevens says i just 
wanted to get away from the real estate business 
his first big commercial production a musical version of 
peter pan starring jean arthur and boris karloff in 1950 was a 
hit and he was hooked 
if you have one big successful musical you are set for 
life stevens says 
stevens bonanza was west side story but he recalls the 
initial response from investors was minimal 
i had to guarantee the money for the production on my own 
he says i always knew it was going to be a hit although nobody 
else thought so i just thought how can we go wrong we had 
romeo and juliet plus jerry robbins doing the dances 
still he has had his share of failures who remembers such 
flops as midgie purvis blood sweat and stanley poole 
everybody loves opal and a lot of others 
i expect them stevens says its the law of averages 
today if one out of seven or eight works youre doing well 
his efforts to form what amounted to a national theater company 
at the kennedy center under director peter sellars met with a lot 
of publicity but little success 
i dont think he had enough experience especially in theater 
itself stevens says peter was very good with operas but 
washington just didnt seem to take to him it was quite a surprise 
to him when it didnt work 
where does stevens look for new shows 
if youve been in the business as long as i have you know 
where all the authors are and what theyre doing he says but 
plays dont just come in to you like they used to there are very 
few available plays that dont tell the same old story you just 
have to keep looking

in the 1970s banks overflowed with money to 
lend and south americans were ready to borrow it today the south 
americans struggle just to pay the interest on the loans let alone 
the principal foreign debt is emptying south americas pocketbook 
this is another in a series of periodic reports by the associated 
press on the economic social and political turbulence that has 
turned south america into a continent in crisis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
across south america the crushing burden of foreign debt piled 
up largely by military governments no longer in power is stifling 
economies stirring unrest in the masses and threatening fragile 
democracies 
some leaders see the crisis as an opening for radical populists 
with radical solutions debt moratoriums or outright repudiation 
of debt for example and in turn the possibility of military 
rule once more 
foreign debt is likely to be a major issue in presidential 
elections this year argentina brazil chile paraguay bolivia and 
uruguay 
compounding the debt problem however are factors that have 
pervaded south american nations long before they went on a 
borrowing binge mismanagement corruption and accumulations of 
vast wealth in cities while handtomouth poverty and illiteracy 
persisted in the countryside 
colombia and peru face the additional burdens of guerrilla wars 
and the illegal cocaine trade 
ten south american nations owe a total of 2774 billion 
according to compilations of the economic commission for latin 
america and repayments are taking a heavy toll on their economies 
and the livelihood of their peoples 
five years ago brazilians could buy a cookstove for what it 
costs them now to buy a kilo of black beans inflation has soared 
to 1000 percent yearly and the cruzado currency has been devalued 
by a factor of 1 million 
in colombia peru and bolivia efforts to cope with mounting 
debts have opened the way to a 10billion cocaine trade that feeds 
the starved economies with hard currency and provides jobs for the 
unemployed drug money threatens to erode accepted economic and 
political systems 
in argentina once one of the worlds wealthiest nations the 
80 billion gross domestic product has stagnated for a decade and 
the value of the austral currency steadily declines 
in venezuela where oil once brought wealth poverty is rising 
fast a survey of 23 million families in 1981 by the latin 
american institute of social research showed 22 percent were poor 
its survey of more than 3 million in 1987 showed the rate had risen 
to 54 percent three days of rioting over price increases in late 
february and early march left 276 people dead and more than 1000 
injured and conditions remain tense 
the riots were the result of a crisis that can be written in 
capital letters the foreign debt said carlos andres perez 
venezuelas president 
a debt paid with misery is a bill that will eventually be paid 
with democracy said president jose sarney of brazil which has 
the highest of the third worlds foreign debt 115 billion 
democracy is losing ground in latin america because the 
solutions it has presented do not attend national problems we 
offer pessimistic solutions and the parties of the left optimistic 
ones 
said argentinas president raul alfonsin the misery the 
depressing conditions of life the lack of food housing health 
training education and jobs create a culture dish that can be 
exploited by ultras and extremists of whatever tendency 
foreign debt has become increasingly politicized on the 
continent 
it is a top issue in the election campaigns in brazil and 
argentina where leftist or populist candidates are frontrunners 
they began entering the picture as governments cut wages and 
subsidies on basic goods and services to meet creditor demands for 
economic austerity the cuts resulted in sharply reduced living 
standards on top of stalled economic growth 
a plan announced in march by us treasury secretary nicholas 
brady acknowledges for the first time that the third worlds debt 
may not be payable 
though still sketchy bradys proposal to eliminate 20 percent 
of debt marks a distinct turn from the reagan administrations 
policy of piling new loans on old 
banks too now recognize that only debt relief will avoid 
explosive social unrest and guarantee at least partial payment 
voluntary debt reduction is a necessary part of any future 
debt strategy said william rhodes head of the citicorp 
debtrestructuring committee 
most south american governments have long cried for creditors to 
share responsibility for the lending bonanza of the 1970s when 
most of their debt was accrued by military governments without 
popular mandates 
they argue that banks flush with petrodollars from the 1973 oil 
crisis were looking for ways to invest latin american nations 
which were posting 4 to 5 percent growth rates and hadnt defaulted 
on a debt since the 1930s seemed a good prospect 
but many experts now say the banks took undue risks failing to 
verify how the money was spent and ignoring repayment 
possibilities money was lent at floating interest rates which in 
the 1970s were at a low of 1 percent 
though much of the borrowed money was used for important 
development projects such as roads airports and hydroelectric 
dams much more was wasted 
the brazilian military government spent an estimated 20 billion 
on a program to build 10 nuclear plants by 1980 but only one has 
been built a plant nicknamed lightening bug because it shuts 
down so often and parts for three others rust in warehouses

in argentina the military regime used the loans to buy weapons 
and help finance the 1978 world cup soccer championship in chile 
the military paid import bills 
still more money went to pad foreign bank accounts of corrupt 
politicians bureaucrats and businessmen estimates are that 15 
billion of brazils 115 billion debt 20 billion of argentinas 
56 billion debt and 22 billion of venezuelas 32 billion went 
into private accounts abroad 
lending didnt reach a standstill until 1982 when mexico 
announced it did not have the money to meet a monthly payment the 
announcement sent shivers through financial circles abroad and talk 
arose of a world economic crisis 
us banks were the most exposed with 72 billion in latin 
loans as much as 20 percent of citicorp profits and 25 percent of 
other bank revenues were from loans to brazil alone 
some experts now say if banks were to write off at least part of 
the debt major financial turmoil could be avoided 
at best it would mean the collapse of one or two new york 
banks said rudigar dornbusch an economics professor at the 
massachusetts institute of technology and an adviser to debtor 
nations 
though new money from private banks no longer financed 
development projects after 1982 south americas debt almost 
doubled as nations rolled over payments in endless accords with 
creditors as interest rates soared 
a chilean opposition leader ricardo lagos maintains the debt 
was simply kicked ahead for future governments to pay 
youve got a situation in which the emperor has no clothes 
dornbusch said the debt is being shown up for what it really is 
it isnt payable under present terms 
in brazil economic austerity measures slashed wages by 50 
percent in the past five years while 25 percent of the 
economically active population cant find regular jobs the 
government estimates 60 percent of the population struggles by on 
the equivalent of less than 80 a month while the country has 
spent 50 billion meeting interest bills since 1984 
argentinas annual per capita income dropped to the equivalent 
of 1630 in 1988 from 1990 in 1980 according to the world bank 
in chile 38 percent of the 12 million people live below the 
poverty line according to ernesto tironi of the economic 
commission for latin america 
in smaller south american nations the situation is more 
dramatic 
cocaine earns colombia more than coffee its principal export 
peru and bolivia earn more from cocaine than from all their 
official exports together according to a us presidential 
commission 
peru has virtually suspended debt payments by linking capital 
outflows to 10 percent of export earnings but still the economy 
shrank nearly 9 percent last year inflation is projected at 10000 
percent this year and one in every three people doesnt have a 
steady job 
the discontent has fed the election campaigns in argentina and 
brazil 
in argentina peronist candidate carlos menem hinted he might 
impose a fiveyear moratorium on debt payments if elected on may 14 
in brazil leonel brizola of the democratic labor party a 
frontrunning presidential prospect has argued for a suspension of 
payments on the debt contracted in an orgy of lending between the 
military government and banks 
another frontrunner in brazil luiz ignacio lula da silva of 
the workers party says he agrees with cubas fidel castro latin 
america should pay no more brazilians vote nov 15 
if creditors do not write off part of what is owed democracy 
will be threatened and leftist alternatives will start looking 
attractive to the people says brazils president sarney 
and that he adds could bring on another cycle of military 
coups

word of mouth and fliers distributed in 
mostly poor mostly black areas brought gladys mae hinson and a lot 
of women like her to the clinic where dr jesse james howard 
delivered babies for 350 
ms hinson 23 the youngest of 18 came from mosses an 
impoverished backwater to have her second child antoinette was 
born at 655 pm on aug 20 1986 and howard sent mother and baby 
home at 730 even though antoinette was having trouble breathing 
soon her breathing stopped 
gladys mae gave her baby mouthtomouth resuscitation during the 
30minute race to a hospital but lack of oxygen already had taken 
its toll she cant walk she cant talk she cant take care of 
herself 
a month later howard sent janice peterson home 2 hours after 
willie jr was born willie began having trouble breathing the next 
day before he got to the hospital he died of inhaling meconium or 
fetal feces a normally treatable complication of childbirth 
medical examiner james r lauridson believed willie shouldnt 
have died and asked the state board of medical examiners to 
investigate right away said board director larry dixon six more 
doctors urged action against howard 
the board investigated 11 of howards deliveries over an 
18month period including those of willie antoinette another 
baby with brain damage and three others who died and asked the 
alabama medical licensure commission to revoke his license it took 
until july 1987 for the commission to suspend howards license and 
until the following march for revocation 
we should have done something a little sooner maybe said 
dixon a state senator but he said the circumstances a black 
doctor delivering black babies in an office for poor women whod 
had little prenatal care prevented the board and the commission 
from moving any faster than they did 
he was dealing with a patient population that has a much 
higher infant mortality rate than the rest of the state we didnt 
know at first whether we were dealing with gross malpractice or a 
phenomenon of the population 
alabamas 1986 infant mortality rate was 133 deaths per 1000 
live births the worst in the nation nationally the rate was 
104 in 1987 alabama fell to fourth with 122 complete 
nationwide statistics are unavailable 
howard who says hes delivered 2000 to 2500 babies contends 
that the whitecontrolled medical community has been on my case 
for years in part because his deliveries took business away from 
hospitals and other doctors a double standard of care exists in 
alabama he says whites get quality care from wellpaid doctors 
while poor blacks get whatever they can 
because of that double standard howard should be praised for 
his work said his attorney robert turner its a miracle more 
of his patients didnt die its a testament to his skill that they 
didnt 
howard was as much a missionary as a medical doctor jl 
chestnut another of his lawyers argued in appealing the march 23 
1988 license revocation before montgomery county circuit judge 
joseph phelps 
board officials knew we were going to be charged with racial 
discrimination when we got into it dixon said adding that such 
claims have been standard when action is taken against a member of 
a minority group 
the board accused howard of sending babies home minutes after 
problem deliveries performing risky deliveries in an illequipped 
office not keeping newborns warm leading to cold stress and 
repeated failure to recognize and treat significant and 
substantial lifethreatening medical conditions 
the standards of medicine nowadays dictate that if youre 
going to provide the care theres a minimum standard of care 
youve got to meet said dr earl fox head of the alabama 
department of public health 
howard a 1972 graduate of meharry colleges medical school in 
nashville tenn says he met that standard in deliveries which 
accounted for 10 percent of his practice many of those babies 
had problems from the getgo i didnt do anything to those 
mothers 
but howard has been no stranger to the authorities 
the board had investigated him before in 1976 but declined to 
take action citing lack of evidence of alleged irregularities in 
his prescription practices howard said he also had been 
investigated twice for alleged problems with deliveries like those 
that cost him his license 
and in selma where howard set up a clinic in 1973 he lost his 
hospital privileges for stabbing dr chudy okoye during a scuffle 
in a ditch he also was convicted of assault fined 500 and 
sentenced to 30 days in jail served on weekends no formal charges 
were filed in an earlier scuffle in an operating room where okoyes 
surgery took longer than scheduled 
howard also assaulted a woman employee who had been living with 
him and was fined 50 and given a 30day suspended sentence and 
six months probation in 1979 he was fined and given a suspended 
sentence for petty larceny and in 1980 he was convicted of 
failing to file birth and death certificates the death certificate 
charge was dropped on appeal howard was fined 1 after pleading 
guilty to the birth certificate charge 
when howard moved his clinic to montgomery in 1985 members of 
the area medical community already had seen some of his babies in 
emergency rooms 
wed get a dead baby born to a lowincome family and the 
first thing wed ask is did it come from dr howard said ike 
moss a former investigator with the states department of forensic 
sciences i started hollering lets get his license when i 
worked the second one 
still about 100 people showed up at a license hearing in 
support of howard who is living in tuscaloosa and awaiting phelps 
decision 
he was a neighborhood hero said dr thomas c nolan a 
member of the licensure commission 
sharon jones 18 of fort deposit whose daughter died less than 
a day after her june 9 1987 birth said howard treated me very 
nice 
its just in gods hands said sharons mother annie pearl 
jones i never felt like he killed the baby 
febie ann crums baby suffered brain damage during delivery june 
5 1987 he is not really the age hes supposed to be he has not

researchers are looking for drugs to prevent allergic reactions 
from starting but until they succeed 35 million allergic americans 
will just have to keep fighting the symptoms with pills snorts 
shots and handkerchiefs 
and despite advances in treatment spring still can be a 
miserable time 
there currently is no way to attack the central souce and make 
it go away said gerald vanderpool of american allergy 
consultants in atlanta so basically you have to deal with it 
there are ways now to keep a patient fairly comfortable no many 
years ago it was a voodoo and witchcraft specialty 
an allergic reaction is an overzealous response of the immune 
system to an otherwise harmless substance such as pollen dust 
penicillin or cat dandruff the body releases powerful chemicals 
that cause those classic symptoms runny nose watery eyes rash 
or in asthma constriction of the breathing passages 
of 35 million allergic americans 146 million suffer from hay 
fever nearly 9 million have asthma and 118 million have eczema 
hives swelling or an allergic reaction to food medicine or insect 
stings 
the discovery that lifted allergy treatment from the voodoo 
and witchcraft category was immunoglobulin e or ige an antibody 
found in much higher levels in allergic people antibodies fight 
foreign substances in the body when ige cells come into contact 
with a foreign substance they release histamine a chemical that 
causes swelling and itching the greatest advances in treatment in 
recent years have been improved delivery of timetested drugs 
a better understanding of the allergic reaction and better 
medication are making life more bearable for people with allergies 
said dr allen kaplan the chairman of the department of medicine 
at state university of new york at stony brook and president of the 
american academy of allergy and immunology a prime example is the 
use of steroids that can be inhaled to treat asthma 
previously the most severe asthmatics had to take steroids by 
pills administering them through inhalation gets a very 
concentrated dose into the lungs without significant absorption 
into the rest of the circulation kaplan said therefore it 
minimizes the side effects of steroids and optimizes therapy to the 
lungs because youre delivering it directly 
another asthma drug is cromolyn sodium available as a nasal 
spray or eye drop it works by inhibiting the secretion of mast 
cells which are involved in all allergic reactions in both 
these instances were treating the reaction locally in a reasonably 
potent way kaplan said they really work better than 
treatments weve used in the past 
allergy treatments have for years relied on antihistamines 
which combat the chemical responsible for many allergy symptoms 
kaplan said antihistamines have advanced in two significant ways 
versions are available that do not cause drowsiness and 
timedrelease capsules to be taken just once or twice a day 
there is no question our understanding of allergies has 
increased tremendously in recent years kaplan said the immediate 
allergy symptoms are well known and are the target of most 
treatments but researchers have learned only recently that there 
is a delayed secondary reaction 
this reaction may occur four to eight hours after the initial 
symptoms have died down and the stimulus has been removed he said 
it lasts many hours and is dependent on the prior allergic 
reaction 
people allergic to many things may be displaying almost constant 
symptoms because of these secondary reactions he said 
understanding the biochemistry of the late phase reaction is in 
its infancy as we understand it better i would anticipate drugs 
coming out that would interfere with it 
if the target of an allergy is the lungs the result is asthma 
which sends 27 million people a year to the doctor and kills 4000 
it is the leading cause of missed school days says the american 
academy of allergy and immunology 
we used to think of asthma as a brief reaction occurring 
shortly after exposure now we know its a prolonged reaction that 
may persist for several days said dr phillip lieberman of 
memphis tenn past president of the academy that has allowed 
for more rational treatment programs 
the more severe aspects of asthma are the target of clinical 
drug tests to fight leukotrienes a chemical estimated to be 
thousands of times more powerful than histamine in causing allergic 
inflammation of air passages 
in hay fever the main culprit is pollen the male germ cells of 
many plants the most damaging types of pollen come from trees in 
the spring grass in the summer and ragweed in late summer and 
fall grass tree and weed pollens are light and airborne 
blossoming flowers have heavy sticky pollen rely on insects for 
reproduction and arent a problem for allergy sufferers 
when the pollen count is worst depends on location but as a 
rule tree pollen starts being a problem in the south as early as 
february and gradually moves north in some climates the tree 
grass and weed seasons may overlap 
perhaps the best way to avoid pollen is to take a sea cruise a 
remedy beyond the reach of most people the american academy of 
allergy and immunology lists several other places where one might 
wait out the pollen season but it sounds like a wish list for an 
outdoors nut the central adirondacks wooded areas of maine new 
hampshire northern minnesota extreme northern michigan 
california and west of the cascades in oregon and washington 
the desert areas of the rocky mountains and hawaii alaska and 
the caribean islands also are relatively free of ragweed 
there are less exotic ways to control exposure to allergens 
stay inside in the early morning when pollen tends to be worst 
and on windy days keep the windows closed and use a filtered air 
conditioner drive with the car windows shut dont mow the grass 
rake leaves or grow many plants indoors 
treatments to fight the reaction itself rather than the 
symptoms also are available and work on the same principle as any 
vaccination injections of allergens are given in increasing 
dosages building the bodys tolerance 
this immunotherapy is most effective in people allergic to 
pollens molds dust and some insect stings 
the most dangerous allergic reaction is known as anaphylactic 
shock a drastic sudden reaction to such things as food drugs and 
insect stings that can be fatal reaction to food is very 
individual but the foods most often cited for anaphylaxis are 
nuts shellfish eggs and seeds 
the food and drug administration estimates there were 37000 
adverse drug reactions in 1985 2 percent of which were fatal 
people over 30 are more susceptible to insect stings which kill 
about 50 a year in the united states hornets yellowjackets 
wasps bees and some species of ants such as the southeasts fire 
ants are the worst offenders

carol loveland wouldnt advise replacing 
meat and potatoes with a plate of dirt but after studying whats 
called geophagia she says a mouthful of just the right soil may 
sometimes be good for what ails you 
some soils may contribute minerals that can be absorbed 
said the utah state university anthropologist warning however 
that some people can become very anemic from eating dirt 
ingesting chemicals that interrupt the bodys exchange of nutrients 
or can be sickened by harmful microbes 
i think the chances of clayeating doing an individual very 
much good are rather slim loveland concluded 
her study to be published in the june issue of the journal food 
and foodways found dirt and clayeating throughout history 
there may have been a point where food was not so much separated 
into animal or vegetable whatever was available in the environment 
was edible 
in roman times galen the 2nd century physician known as the 
father of experimental physiology acquired 20000 lozenges of 
dirt and goat blood from the mediterranean island of lemnos and 
dispensed them for various ailments 
to this day dirteating is practiced in various forms 
motivated by belief in soils nutritional medicinal cultural or 
even religious properties 
in africa the clay is frequently formed into an egg shape and 
sold in the markets loveland said in india its molded into 
the shape of a tea cup left unbaked tea is poured into the cup 
and the individual drinks the tea and eats the cup 
in americas rural south clayeating remains a resilient 
subculture while the practice may have been imported by african 
slaves she said it no longer can be described as limited to 
particular social ethnic or racial groups 
other people are using clay too she said noting that 
capsules and tablets of dirt and clay are showing up in health food 
stores touted for their mineral content and as remedies for 
certain stomach and intestinal ailments 
indeed clayeating in the americas predates the importation of 
slaves it had deep roots among the natives of latin america prior 
to the arrival of the spanish conquistadors who helped perpetuate 
the practice loveland said 
in esquipulas a village in guatemala the indians 
prehistorically were taking clay from a clay bed and when the 
spanish arrived they thought they knew a good thing when they saw 
it she said they built a cathedral at this clay bed and 
manufactured the clay into capsules 
these were blessed by the catholic church and ended up all 
over 
the capsules 2 to 3 inches in diameter and decorated with 
scenes of the crucifixion and other christian icons were sold to 
pilgrims and converts they were still in circulation until 10 or 
15 years ago said loveland who has a couple of them 
her study begun in 1987 did reveal that certain kinds of clay 
can help neutralize stomach acid other soil containing kaolin and 
bentonite found in overthecounter diarrhea medicine have 
value as intestinal remedies 
too much of such clay however could block the intestinal 
tract with serious possibly fatal results 
to a limited degree geophagia can be seen has having migrated 
into the realm of accepted medical and nutritional use though on a 
more sophisticated level said utah state university soil scientist 
thomas furst who assisted in the study you can go down to the 
health food store and buy dolomite or to a grocery store and buy 
tums and thats basically calcium carbonate 
but at the more elemental level the risks increase markedly 
furst warned 
while some soil contains nutritional elements like magnesium 
phosphorus potassium calcium iron zinc and other minerals that 
same earth especially if high in organic matter can be teeming 
with diseasecarrying parasites 
some clays also can contain arsenic and people who munch urban 
garden soil believing it safe could risk lead poisoning from 
automobile exhaust residues

folks have used slippery elm bark for 
centuries to cure everything from sore throats to constipation and 
researchers are trying to find out whether whitetailed deer in 
some areas are doing the same 
dr edwin michael a wildlife researcher at west virginia 
university said he first came upon slippery elms that had been 
stripped of their bark near this coal town just south of the 
pennsylvania border in 1981 
after further observation he concluded that a few deer in 
widely scattered areas were responsible this is not typical 
deer behavior these deer are choosing a particular species of 
tree at a particular time of year and going to a lot of trouble 
to strip the bark from them 
there must be some reason 
michael has just begun a twoyear study to find out why some 
deer prefer chewing the tender inner bark of the slippery elm 
while shunning neighboring trees including such usual favorites as 
maple and black cherry 
our first guess is that there is a lack of quantity or quality 
in their food supply he said but the deer at some point 
also must have learned that the bark is satisfying do they use it 
as a cure or temporary relief for what ails them i think thats 
wild speculation but its possible 
ripping the bark from the exposed roots and lower parts of the 
tree is no easy task for the deer which have no upper front teeth 
nonetheless deer in some parts of western monongalia county have 
stripped the bark from hundreds of slippery elms killing most of 
the saplings he said 
evidence of similar behavior has been reported in greene county 
pa north of hagerstown md and at front royal va 
you might find 100 or 200 trees stripped clean in one spot 
but a mile or two away where there are just as many deer and just 
as many slippery elms there will be no signs of bark stripping at 
all michael said 
how do they recognize that the tree is a slippery elm do they 
smell it do they know it by sight how do you explain the 
scattered pockets of the behavior 
indians used slippery elm bark as a remedy for coughs sore 
throats and to promote healing said clarke ridgeway a west 
virginia university expert on the historical development of drugs 
they introduced it to the early colonists who adapted indian 
remedies in the 1600s when they could not obtain their usual 
medicines from europe 
still available in some pharmacies and a popular item in health 
food stores slippery elm bark is a mucilage that acts as a barrier 
to irritation and has a lubricating effect when mixed with water 
it doesnt have any antibacterial action but does contain a 
number of sugars which make it a good source of food for deer when 
other browse is in short supply ridgeway said the deer could be 
using it as a preferred source of nutrition or they could like the 
way it swells up into an oily gelatinous mass when they chew it 
complicating michaels research is that we dont know when a 
deer has a sore throat we dont know when a deer is ailing until 
its about to die 
do deer get sore throats they must theres no reason to 
think that only people do now is it only deer with sore throats 
that are stripping the bark 
we of course dont think that is the case but its 
possible we dont give wildlife enough credit for what they do

periodic droughts in the western united 
states may be linked to changes in the positions of the sun and 
moon researchers say 
charles w stockton of the university of arizona says theres no 
physical proof that these changes actually would influence 
drought but since 1600 recurring drought coincided with solar 
and lunar cycles 
by studying and extrapolating astronomical data stockton said 
it may be possible to forecast droughts based on the research he 
said the wests next drought which will be severe but not 
widespread will be in the late 1990s 
stockton david meko of arizonas treering laboratory and j 
murray mitchell jr a retired climatologist with the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration found clues in tree rings 
which vary based on rainfall 
severe but localized droughts similar to last years in the 
midwest occur during the solar minimum the period in the suns 
22year cycle when sunspots diminish to their lowest number 
stockton said the same thing occurs during the lunar cycle when 
the moon lines up with the sun every 186 years 
when those two phenomena occur in roughly the same year about 
every two centuries a devastating drought should sear most of the 
west stockton said adding that the last such occurrence was in 
the dust bowl days of the 1930s 
no one knows how the cycles may alter earths climate but 
there is some evidence now that the luminosity of the sun changes 
with sunspot numbers he said that is the fewer the sunspots 
the hotter the suns surface 
whether it would be hot enough to trigger drought is an 
unanswered question stockton said adding that the sunspots could 
cause a slight rise in temperature evaporating water from the 
earths surface killing many plants 
the lunar link is more elusive he said

researchers hoping to help endangered 
florida panthers expand and move outside the everglades have cut 
short part of a test after four of seven cougars being used as 
surrogates died or were killed 
the last two alive were captured last week near osceola national 
forest said tom logan of the florida game and fresh water fish 
commission the two animals would not have given us any new 
information we dont feel its prudent or productive to leave the 
animals out in the field 
of the seven texas cougars released in north florida to see how 
panthers might adapt outside south floridas everglades one died 
of unknown causes two were shot by poachers and one was injured 
while being captured by wildlife officers and had to be killed a 
fifth was captured about two weeks ago 
of the two captured last week one was found napping in a tree 
in a residential jacksonville neighborhood and the other had been 
hunting exotic deer at a private hunting preserve north of lake 
city 
the florida panther once roamed north florida but is now 
confined to the everglades where officials estimate no more than 50 
survive the last confirmed north florida sighting of one of the 
big cats was in the early 1960s 
wildlife officials had planned to end the program in june a 
year after the release of the first five cougars two more were 
released in march 
when we had the original group they behaved as they should 
when the numbers were reduced things started happening logan 
said we need to evaluate the number of animals out there and how 
it affects them 
until information from the experiment is evaluated logan said 
he could not recommend whether florida panthers should be released 
in north florida

beach mice threatened with extinction 
on the central gulf coast have emerged from winter breeding in 
greater numbers but there still arent many of the tiny 
nightwandering creatures 
scientists arent sure what role the choctawhatchee alabama and 
perdido key beach mice play in the environment they seem to be 
closely associated to the growth of sea oats but even that has not 
been proven 
in 1986 alarmed us fish and wildlife service biologists began 
trapping and removing the mice from the path of condominium 
construction booms along the gulf thirty perdido key mice were 
moved to the gulf islands national seashore the perdido key mice 
were completely eliminated from florida during hurricane frederic 
in 1979 and the only remaining ones were on the alabama beach 
the mice now are reported thriving in the 7mile protected gulf 
islands preserve said nick holler a professor at auburn 
university where some pairs were taken for breeding the perdido 
key mice were the most threatened and probably still are 
holler said 
some have been trapped in the bon secour wildlife refuge and 
fort morgan both west of gulf shores they are being introduced to 
the colony in captivity against the possibility of another 
hurricane wiping out the wild population 
the main threats to the 3inch mice are still people walking on 
sand dunes where the mice burrow to live and cats other predators 
are owls and foxes 
other threatened or endangered species also are finding refuge 
in national park services gulf islands national seashore said 
spokeswoman suzanne lewis projects there include efforts to 
reestablish populations of southern bald eagles brown pelicans 
and red wolves 
horn island a wilderness barrier island in the mississippi 
portion of the preserve has been the release site for 19 young 
eagles since 1985 plans call for up to 50 birds to be released 
this year on the mississippi gulf coast 
horn island also will be the release site for a pair of red 
wolves to begin five years of research on the biology of the 
animals young wolves also will be released on the alligator river

three months into the bush administration 
consumer groups are still uncertain about what to expect with one 
advocate saying the administration is moving with all the speed 
of a glacier 
some say the pendulum is swinging back to more activity in 
consumer protection others say the signals are still confused 
consumer advocates were thrown on the defensive by the reagan 
administrations antigovernment antiregulation stance 
david stockman reagans first budget director once wrote that 
consumer groups had created this whole facade of consumer 
protection in order to seize power in our society i think part of 
the mission of this administration is to unmask and discredit that 
false ideology 
consumer groups have not forgotten that george bushs first 
assignment from ronald reagan was head of a task force charged with 
reducing regulatory burdens 
joan claybrook head of public citizen the umbrella advocacy 
group founded by ralph nader said as vice president george 
bush was one of the most anticonsumer antihealth and safety 
public officials weve ever had 
mark silbergeld director of the washington office of consumers 
union said that bushs record was one of relieving business of 
its health safety and consumer protection obligations but 
silbergeld refused to read that record as a prediction 
new offices often bring new obligations he said but 
theres no sign yet what bushs new office will mean for consumers 
silbergeld said 
the administration is preparing to deal with consumer issues 
with all the speed of a glacier he said 
miss claybrook would agree with that the consumer product 
safety commission is twisting slowly in the wind unable to act 
because the current two commissioners do not even make up a quorum 
she said 
we are being neglected and thats a bad sign said pamela 
gilbert a lawyer with the public interest research group another 
naderinfluenced outfit sharing office space with public citizen 
she said she is not worried that bush will attack government 
regulations again what we fear is business as usual with 
consumer protection agencies languishing under small budgets and 
unfilled appointments 
robert abrams attorney general of new york state and president 
of the national association of attorneys general said there is 
concern that no new name has surfaced as the new chairman of the 
federal trade commission one understands that it takes a while 
for a new administration to get organized but i think were now at 
the point where there begins to be some scratching of the head 
whether there has been undue delay 
daniel olivers term has expired as chairman of the federal 
trade commission and he is serving in a holdover status 
abrams said he was uncertain what direction the administrations 
consumer policies would take but theres no question that we in 
the states look forward to the federal watchdog agencies returning 
to their traditional role where they have the resources and the 
authorities to move effectively 
but the administration has not decided whether to support 
oppose or stand indifferent to a bill renewing the legislative 
authority of the consumer product safety commission 
anne graham acting chairman of the twomember commission is 
taking no position on the bill which incorporates what critics 
call micromanagement through many directives 
she supports a provision that would permit two members to be a 
quorum when the commission has only three members 
ms graham looks for a lowering of the voices and less 
confrontation you have jim florio a democratic member of the 
house from new jersey who chairs the consumer protection 
subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee and joe barton 
a conservative texas republican on the bill as sponsors we 
couldnt have had that three or four years ago 
its impossible to tell though where the commission is headed 
without knowing who will be the third member if i had to guess 
id say wed be a little more active she said 
president bush has made it clear he cares about children and 
this agency concentrates a great deal on children spending half 
its budget on them she said 
bruce silverglade legal director of the center for science in 
the public interest is encouraged by januarys ftc action accusing 
campbell soup co of false advertising for failing to disclose high 
sodium concentrations in its soups 
under oliver the commission almost gave up on filing false 
advertising cases against national advertisers and pursued smaller 
healthfood marketers instead 
i think well see the pendulum swing back andstay there for 
awhile silverglade said 
not everybody agrees silbergeld was asked is the pendulum 
swinging back he replied no other than in the environmental 
area 
silverglade said silbergeld sees the soup case as a 
harbinger of a kind because that is his area id like to see more 
and i would like to see them go up and ask for the budgets to do 
the job

f hoffmannla roche amp co the swiss 
chemical and pharmaceutical company today announced a major 
overhaul that involves formation of a holding company and 
elimination of its current share structure 
the restructuring is intended to increase management efficiency 
enhance operational flexibility and satisfy the markets call for a 
simpler share structure hoffmannla roche said the changes also 
take into account proposed reforms of the swiss company law 
the plan announced at a news conference in basel at which the 
company also released its latest financial results quieted 
speculation that hoffmannla roche would use the occasion to 
announce plans to seek control of another pharmaceutical concern 
hoffmannla roche chairman fritz gerber declined to comment on 
whether the new structure would place the company in a better 
position to launch a takeover bid for philidelphiabased smithkline 
beckman corp or britains beecham group plc the two companies 
have announced their intention to merge 
hoffmannla roches announcement last friday that it had 
scheduled a news conference for today to discuss a series of 
significant measures stirred speculation that it might be preparing 
an offer for one of the companies 
under the current twin share structure each owner of 
hoffmannla roche shares or dividend rights certificates also owns 
shares in sapac corp a new brunswick njbased affiliated 
company which handles business in north and south america asia 
parts of afria australia britain and other places 
the new structure would convert these dual stock holdings into 
shares in a holding company that would comprise interests held by 
both hoffmannla roche and sapac 
sapac shares are to be called in and sapac is to become a 
subsidiary of the new holding company called roche holding ag 
in addition the proposed group holding company would own a new 
baselbased subsidiary consisting of roche and sapacs operating 
functions 
a third stage of the restructuring would reshuffle and 
significantly enlarge hoffmannla roches stock base under the 
proposed structure the companys share capital would be increased 
in a series of stages 
gerber in describing the overhaul to reporters called it a 
logical step in the companys adjustment to future needs he said 
the changes would make hoffmannla roche stock more accessible to a 
broader base of investors 
separately hoffmannla roche said its profit rose 331 percent 
to 6415 million swiss francs the equivalent of 389 million at 
todays exchange rates up from from 482 francs in 1987

stock prices pulled back today as traders cashed 
in some of the markets recent gains 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1192 points to 
239754 in the first half hour of trading 
losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading 
of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 370 up 602 down and 
510 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 2230 million shares as of 10

analysts said it was not surprising to see the market run into 
some resistance after its sharp rise over the past four weeks 
they also noted that weakness in blue chips often occurs after 
they have been driven higher as they were late friday by computer 
program trades related to a set of expiring stock index options or 
futures 
aside from those technical forces analysts said hopes remained 
high on wall street that interest rates would turn downward before 
long 
an increase last thursday in key west german interest rates sent 
a brief jolt through the stock market but it quickly recovered as 
traders concluded that the federal reserve wouldnt take any 
similar action

comsat corp said monday its earnings rose 16 
percent in the first three months of 1989 primarily from growth in 
its international satellite operations 
comsat said international telecommunications revenues grew due 
to increased traffic demand but were offset partly by promotion 
discounts instituted in the second half of 1988 maritime revenue 
growth resulted from increased telephone traffic mainly from 
cruise ships and other commercial vessels comsat said 
net income for the quarter ending march 31 was 165 million or 
89 cents a share on revenues of 974 million compared with 
earnings of 143 million or 77 cents a share on earnings of

operating loss on revenues of 117 million in the first three 
months of 1989 compared with a 12 million loss on revenues of 
109 million in first quarter 1988 comsat attributed the loss to 
increased marketing and operating costs

a federal bankruptcy judge today postponed for 
the second time a hearing over whether strikebound eastern 
airlines should be put up for sale in its entirety 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland rescheduled todays 
hearing for may 3 to give potential buyers more time to examine 
eastern financial data and to give parties involved in the 
airlines bankruptcy case more time to negotiate over a possible 
reorganization plan 
the judge has asked eastern its unions and major creditors to 
demonstrate why the airline shouldnt be put up for auction in its 
entirety including its northeast shuttle service slated to be sold 
to developer donald trump 
meanwhile a household name financial institution has 
recently emerged as a new serious bidder for eastern along with 
billionaire hotelier jay pritzker trans world airlines inc 
chairman carl icahn and exbaseball commissioner peter v 
ueberroth according to sources close to the situation 
and mohamed hadid a washington real estate investor who 
recently agreed to buy the ritzcarlton hotels in washington and 
new york confirmed through an associate friday he is interested in 
buying miamibased eastern 
pritzker who reportedly has offered around 500 million for 
eastern has been given access to confidential financial data 
concerning the airline bankruptcy examiner david i shapiro 
confirmed today 
shapiro also said twa officials had expressed interest in 
getting access to the financial data which is being released to 
parties who agree to confidentiality restrictions 
ueberroth whose 464 million deal to buy eastern collapsed 
april 12 also is believed to still be interested in the carrier 
easterns management is expected to present early this week to a 
committee representing its major creditors a plan for sharply 
reducing its operations and selling substantial assets on 
thursday the creditors committee which also includes union 
representatives discussed a financial review of the airline by the 
investment firm goldman sachs amp co 
union leaders and their advisers meanwhile have been sifting 
through a pile of offers for the carrier to determine whether they 
are viable the unions who have been approached by a number of 
suitors interviewed one such candidate thursday evening and 
eventually decided he was a washout sources said 
around 25 wouldbe buyers have had some sort of contact with the 
unions since easterns chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on march 9 
including about a dozen who were considered serious enough for more 
extensive talks the sources said 
the airline has been virtually grounded since march 4 when its 
machinists union struck over a longsimmering wage dispute and 
pilots and flight attendants walked out in sympathy

agreement to merge with great britains beecham group subject to 
stockholder approval announced monday sales were up in the first 
quarter but profits fell sharply 
net earnings fell 22 percent to 1302 million from the 1665 
million a year ago sales rose 7 percent to 124 billion compared 
to 116 billion in the 1988 januarytomarch quarter 
profits translate to 105 a share compared to 134 in the 
similar 1988 period 
henry wendt chairman and chief executive said the decline in 
earnings in the quarter was in line with expectations 
the primary factor was the adverse comparison of us 
pharmaceutical sales with a period of heavy trade stocking in early 
1988 which made sales unusually high the company said the rise 
of the dollar also depressed the dollar value of overseas earnings 
and sales 
clinical laboratory sales climbed 69 percent or 80 million 
reflecting last years second quarter acquisition of international 
clinical laboratories 
smithkline beckman and beecham announced april 12 that it had

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
lawsuit by consumer activist ralph nader environmentalists and 
others seeking a government ban on the chemical alar 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw out 
the suit 
alar sold by uniroyal chemical co is used primarily to 
enhance the color and uniform ripening of apples 
some studies have shown it can cause cancer in animals and may 
be a serious health risk to humans particularly children 
but the environmental protection agency on jan 6 1987 
rejected a plea by environmentalists and others to ban alar the 
agency said it lacked sufficient evidence to order it off the 
market 
instead 10 days later the epa lowered by onethird the 
allowable amounts of the chemical that may remain as residues in 
apples the new rule was designed as an interim measure to permit 
more time for the agency to study alars effects 
nader and the others whose petition was denied by the epa filed 
a federal suit aimed at forcing the agency to ban alar 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last october threw out the 
suit for procedural reasons 
the appeals court said the epa could be exposed to a barrage of 
lawsuits if forced to go to court every time it denied a petition 
like the one submitted for alar 
epa could conceivably be forced to appear continually in 
appellate courts defending regulations long established that 
parties failed to contest at the time of their promulgation the 
9th circuit court said if congress had intended such a result 
it is unlikely it would have prescribed a fixed deadline for 
appeals from regulations 
the bush administration urged the supreme court to reject the 
environmentalists bid to revive their suit 
citizens who file petitions with the environmental agency should 
not be allowed to bypass administrative procedures established by 
federal law justice department lawyers said 
in other action the court 
turned away an appeal by deposed philippine president 
ferdinand marcos and his wife imelda aimed at overturning a court 
order freezing their assets 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that in effect 
requires the marcoses to defend themselves in a lawsuit filed by 
the philippine government the lower court order also bars them 
from transferring most of their alleged vast wealth 
agreed to review a judges order raising property taxes to 
help pay for racially desegregating public schools in kansas city 
mo 
the justices said they will hear arguments that the judge 
overstepped his authority when imposing the tax hike for all 
property within the citys school district 
let stand a ruling that a federal judge may overrule federal 
environmental officials and permit use of an allegedly dangerous 
pesticide 
the justices without comment rejected an appeal by 
environmentalists and organized labor in a case involving the 
pesticide dinoseb of particular importance to farmers in idaho 
oregon and washington state 
left intact a 101 million refund the nations telephone 
companies were ordered to pay customers for excessive charges in 
1978 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the federal 
communications commission overstepped its authority in ordering the 
refunds 
agreed to decide whether the government may tax as income the 
deposits that utility companies demand from customers to ensure 
payment of future bills 
the court said it will hear a bush administration appeal in a 
case involving an indiana electric utility 
agreed to decide whether an indian tribe can prosecute members 
of other tribes for crimes on its reservation 
the court said it will review a ruling that gives the salt river 
pimamaricopa community in arizona authority to prosecute a 
california man accused in the fatal shooting of a 14yearold boy 
agreed to judge the validity of a federal law allowing the use 
of abandoned rail line rightsofway for nature trails 
the court said it will decide in a case from vermont whether the 
law unconstitutionally deprives some property owners of the use of 
their land without providing just compensation

the united states and the european economic 
community are near an agreement in their dispute over an eec ban on 
imports of us beef treated with growthboosting hormones a dutch 
official said monday 
us officials have agreed to let the eec certify us beef due 
to be exported to the eec as having been raised without the use of 
hormones dutch secretary of state for foreign affairs yvonne van 
rooy said 
the tentative accord reached by a useec panel of experts 
has solved 80 percent of the problem mrs van rooy told 
reporters outside an eec foreign ministers meeting 
an official at the us mission to the eec in brussels declined 
to comment except to say that negotiations were continuing 
eec external relations commissioner frans andriessen briefed the 
foreign ministers on the tentative agreement 
there was general satisfaction among the eec states that the 
americans have agreed in principle to a certification system 
said an eec source who asked not to be named 
francisco fernandez ordonez the spanish minister who chaired 
the ministers meeting said it was still too early to say what 
the outcome of the hormone conflict will be but he told 
reporters he glimpsed the possibility of a solution 
under the accord eec inspectors at us meat plants would 
certify no hormones were used to raise beef due to shipped to any 
of the 12 eec nations 
but the eec source said us and eec officials have yet to 
quantify how much beef could be exported to the community under the 
certification procedure including offal that is used in meat 
products the question remains if it the united states could 
still export the same amount of beef as it did previously 
the eec citing health reasons banned all imports of 
hormonetreated meat as of jan 1 the ban affects about 100 
million in us beef to the eec annually 
initially it was to affect 140 million but this was reduced 
after the eec agreed to exclude beef used for pet food 
the us has threatened to retaliate against eec imports that 
in turn led the eec to threaten counterretaliatory measures 
against us exports of walnuts and dried fruit 
a special eecus task force was formed feb 18 to study the 
issue as both sides agreed to hold off on any retaliation during a 
75day cooling off period 
the united states has agreed to a certification policy under 
which it would vouch that beef sent to the eec was not raised on 
growthboosting hormones mrs van rooy said 
this is a success for europe the united states has shown to 
be sufficiently realistic 
the eec considers the use of such hormones harzardous to the 
health of consumers the united states has maintained there is no 
scientific base for that 
the cooling off period ends in early may it was instituted to 
prevent a trade war and allow the bush administration come to grips 
with the issue which it inherited from the reagan administration

in california the maker of semiconductor test equipment 
pkl companies was a minority shareholder in macrodata it filed 
suit in 1976 accusing cutlerhammer of illegally depressing the 
price of macrodata stock 
eaton corp later took over cutlerhammer and a jury in 
california ordered it to pay pkl companies 26 million in actual 
damages and 15 million as punishment for the illegal conduct 
in the appeal acted on today eaton corp said the 15 million 
award was unconstitutional eaton corp said it was innocent of any 
wrongdoing and should not be made to pay for any misconduct by 
cutlerhammer it also said the 15 million award was excessive 
the supreme court is considering a similar issue in another case 
this year but decided today not to delay action in the eaton corp 
appeal pending that ruling which is expected to be announced by 
july

billionaire marvin davis has revised his 
lawsuit challenging the poison pill takeover defense of nwa 
inc the northwest airlines parent company he wants to buy in a 
27 billion hostile tender offer 
the lawsuit in the court of chancery in wilmington del 
originally sought to invalidate the pill but at a hearing today 
lawyer gilchrist sparks said davis is asking only for the 
elimination of a provision that would prevent a new board of 
directors from dismantling the pill for 180 days 
davis has launched a proxy fight to take control of the board of 
directors at the companys may 15 annual meeting if he were to 
succeed a provision in the poison pill plan would prevent the 
new board from dismantling the takeover defense for 180 days 
such a provision would cripple the new board from accepting 
legitimate buyout offers thus hindering davis proxy fight sparks 
said 
six months is a very long time sparks said stockholders 
want to get the money now not in six months so they will vote for 
whoever will get them the money now 
chancellor william allen said he would rule soon on the request 
sheldon raab a lawyer for northwest objected to the request 
he said the 180day waiting provision has the purpose and effect 
of getting wouldbe acquirers such as davis to come to the board 
and negotiate 
it is a way of buying time to get higher bids explore 
alternatives to get maximum shareholder value raab said the 
job of a corporations director is not to shoot himself and his 
shareholder in the foot but to make a deliberated decision 
on their behalf 
meanwhile northwest chairman steven rothmeier says he would 
like a white knight investor to come forward and work with 
current management if northwest airlines cannot remain independent 
rothmeier told the wall street journal the best course would be 
for the company to remain independent and follow the growth 
strategy he has charted for the nations fourthlargest airline 
but he said the company is exploring putting a large stake in nwa 
in the hands of friendly investors 
there are potentially friendly investors out there said 
rothmeier 
davis tender offer stands at 90 a share even though the stock 
has been trading well above that price nwa stock closed friday at 
10250 on the new york stock exchange up 375 the board was 
scheduled to meet today to review the offer and other options 
rothmeier declined to identify any potential friendly investors 
but other nwa officials said 10 to 15 parties have expressed 
interest in all or part of the company the journal reported they 
include leveraged buyout firms and airline and airfreight 
companies 
a recapitalization involving a special shareholder dividend is 
another option 
nwa board member robert a charpie chairman of cabot corp in 
boston said the board had asked its investment advisers first 
boston corp to examine the possibility of recapitalization 
many corporations have done well at it good managers can 
manage highly leveraged companies charpie told the journal 
the only other investment group with a confirmed interest in 
buying northwest is led by los angeles investor and former marriott 
corp official albert checci and former nwa director gary wilson 
now an executive at walt disney co that group owns a 49 percent 
stake in nwa and could be friendly to nwa management 
the journal reported that the checci group has financial backing 
from elders ixl ltd one of australias largest companies with 
interests in beer wine livestock and financial services the 
newspaper said neither checci nor elders could be reached for 
comment 
meanwhile the new york times reported today that kelso amp co a 
small investment bank based in new york has decided to consider a 
bid for the airline a spokesman for kelso and a northwest 
spokesman declined to comment

the us dollar rose against the major currencies 
in european trading on monday helped by a weaker west german mark 
gold prices also rose 
foreign exchange dealers said the mark dropped amid uncertainty 
about where it is going as a result of last weeks bonn government 
reshuffle 
but the decline of the mark could be reversed by an expected 
government announcement of suspension of the 10 percent withholding 
tax on income from interest 
a possible additional plus for the mark is that the markets 
expect the us firstquarter gross national product figures due on 
wednesday will show the american economy has started to slow down 
traders said that would reduce the likelihood of higher us 
interest rates and thereby make the mark more attractive

corn and soybean futures prices closed sharply 
lower monday on the chicago board of trade following heavy weekend 
showers in one of the driest sections of the corn belt 
oats also closed with sharp losses but wheat futures gained 
slightly on continued dry weather in the great plains 
a weather system triggered severe thunderstorms in western 
illinois and eastern iowa over the weekend but brought little 
relief to the rest of the midwest where corn planting has begun 
and soybean growers are preparing to plant 
the coverage was probably less than 20 to 25 percent of each 
state but it was enough to create a negative atmosphere this 
morning in the grain markets said mickey luth a soybean analyst 
in chicago with shearson lehmann hutton inc 
the losses in the corn and soybean markets more than offset 
fridays steep gains 
at the close wheat was cent to 1 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 416 a bushel corn was 6 cents to 
7 cents lower with may at 269 a bushel oats were 6 cents to 6 
cents lower with may at 196 a bushel soybeans were 11 cents to 
18 cents lower with may at 743 a bushel

foreign and us steelmakers share technology 
and investment routinely these days as a fact of life in competing 
for business in the global economy two steel industry leaders said 
monday 
we dont have a monopoly on steel in the usa said 
vincent j pongia president of the association of iron and steel 
engineers as the associations threeday spring conference began 
monday 
its a global economy today particularly in the steel 
market said herschel b poole the associations managing 
director and a former executive of usx corp 
the foreign influence in steelmaking is obvious at the 
cincinnati conference which is attracting an estimated 1000 steel 
industry executives and engineers for two days of technical 
presentations the conference ends wednesday with a tour of armco 
incs middletown works steel mill 
steel industry leaders from 10 industrialized nations are making 
presentations at the conference on new steel production technology 
including automated controls and other new equipment the total 
includes 47 presentations by us steel industry leaders and 10 by 
japanese leaders six from canada five from the united kingdom and 
four from west germany 
pongia said the association functions as a means by which 
engineers from us and foreign companies can exchange information 
about technologies and any drawbacks 
engineers talk to one another and very frankly they wont 
give away proprietary information said pongia who has 
experience as a steel industry engineer and as manager of 
operations and maintenance functions 
shared investment between us and foreign steelmakers in new 
plants has become more widespread because of the enormous costs 
conference spokesman russ robinson said a new continuouscasting 
plant alone just part of a larger steel mill could cost 150 
million he said 
nucor corp of charlotte nc is building an innovative mill 
in crawfordsville ind designed to roll thinner strips of steel 
and move hot steel more quickly from casters to rolling equipment 
thus saving energy costs and production time 
pongia said the steel industry will be watching closely to see 
whether the process is successful the concept is based on 
technology used in west germany 
pongia is vice president of citisteel usa inc a chineseowned 
company which renovated and reopened a 250employee steel mill in 
claymont del the owners purchased the company within the last 
year 
the armco mill that will be toured is preparing to take 
advantage of japanese steel technology armco announced on march 27 
that its middletownbased eastern steel division and japans 
kawasaki steel corp signed an agreement under which kawasaki will 
buy a 40 percent share of the division for 350 million 
armco plans to ask its shareholders to approve the joint venture 
at the companys annual meeting friday in whippany nj 
pongia said the steel industry has increased its spending on new 
plants and expansion as the industrys financial comeback has 
progressed from years of heavy losses in the early 1980s 
the us steel industry posted a collective 24 billion profit 
last year and is increasing spending in capital improvement 
projects this year to 23 billion up by 28 percent from last 
year pongia said

the 1986 tax overhaul added 17 billion a 
year to the income taxes of us property and casualty insurance 
companies an industry survey indicated monday 
for 1987 the new law boosted the tax bills of the 
propertycasualty companies to 35 billion according to the price 
waterhouse accounting firm that included 92 million in 
alternative minimum tax a special levy designed to ensure that all 
corporations with a profit pay some tax regardless of their 
deductions 
the companies rising taxes were traced to three provisions in 
the 1986 law that were aimed specifically at propertycasualty 
companies loss reserve discounting unearnedpremium offset and a 
proration adjustment 
the price waterhouse survey released by insurance industry 
services suggested the new law in the long run will mean an even 
larger increase in propertycasualty taxes since operating losses 
were used to offset a share of the companies taxable income in 
1987 
the changes in the law raised the companies taxable income by 
95 billion in 1987 
the conclusions were based on a survey of insurance companies 
that accounted for 79 percent of propertycasualty premiums in 1987

exxon corps firstquarter earnings fell 13 
percent the company said monday as rising crude oil prices took a 
bite out of refining margins and the alaskan oil spill took a toll 
mostly on the companys image 
for the three months ended march 31 earnings at the nations 
biggest oil company declined to 13 billion or 99 cents a share 
from 15 billion or 106 a share in the first quarter of last 
year revenue rose 1 percent to 222 billion compared with 22 
billion in the 1988 period 
exxon based in new york said expenses grew fourfold from the 
1988 first quarter to 54 billion from 13 billion due mainly 
to special onetime costs including the acquisition of texaco 
canada inc 
exxon said the march 24 spill that tarnished the reputation of 
the nations largest oil company had only a negligible financial 
impact in the first period exxon said it charged 30 million for 
salvage expense vessel repair and partial loss of cargo 
the huge exxon valdez oil tanker crashed into an underwater reef 
off the alaskan coast on march 24 spewing about 250000 barrels of 
oil into prince william sound 
exxon chairman lawrence g rawl said the company doesnt yet 
know the full cost of the disaster 
exxon and exxon shipping company carry insurance in 
substantial amounts to deal with cleanups damage claims and 
liabilities resulting from oil spills the company said based 
on information to date we cannot reasonably estimate the net 
expense to be borne by exxon and exxon shipping company 
rising world oil prices hurt exxons refining and marketing 
earnings but helped its exploration and production income in the 
first quarter rawl said 
contrary to some public perceptions prices for motor gasoline 
and other products did not increase as rapidly as crude oil 
costs the chairman said 
world crude prices have risen about 10 a barrel in the last six 
months and although gasoline retail prices have jumped in recent 
weeks analysts said they have not risen by a comparable amount per 
gallon 
thats the reason were continuing to have a price rise in 
april as they play catchup to crude said bruce lazier analyst 
with prescott ball amp turben inc 
lazier said exxons earnings were good considering the crude 
rise 
earnings from domestic exploration and production rose 22 
percent to 343 million compared with 281 million in the 1988 
first period income from foreign exploration and production 
however slid 20 percent to 513 million from 642 million 
refining profits meanwhile were down nearly 43 percent to 147 
million from 431 million in last years first quarter 
stephen smith an analyst with bear stearns amp co said he 
expects a reversal in the second quarter as the rise in crude 
prices is passed through to product prices including gasoline 
at some point gasoline will take over as demand increases 
with the driving season smith said 
exxon said firstquarter results reflected a 39 billion 
expense for the acquisition of texaco canada inc by its canadian 
subsidiary imperial oil ltd texaco inc sold its 78 percent stake 
in texaco canada in january 
exxon also purchased more than 15 million shares of its own 
stock at a cost of 676 million

swiss drug manufacturing giant f 
hoffmannla roche amp co inc said monday it will modernize its 
share structure and reorganize its corporate framework 
the changes would make it easier to invest in the company and 
conform to pending changes in swiss corporate law 
hoffmannla roche failed in a takeover bid for sterling drug 
inc last year and the streamlining could help the company in 
other us takeover attempts some analysts said 
the companys us operations which accounted for 19 billion 
in revenue out of the parents 6 billion are based in nutley 
one school of thought holds that a global consolidation in the 
pharmaceutical business is inevitable smithkline beckman corp of 
philadelphia and beecham group plc of london have merger plans and 
monsanto co of st louis bought gd searle in 1985 eastman kodak 
co stepped in last january 1988 to thwart hoffmannla roches 
designs in sterling 
the move would make it easier to exchange stock for shares in 
another company hoffmann may seek to acquire said louis c webb 
an analyst at advest group inc in hartford conn 
drug makers are very attractive for acquisition he said 
the changes also could help pave the way for hoffmannla roche 
to list its stock on us exchanges said michael martorelli an 
analyst at janney montgomery scott inc of philadelphia it trades 
only in switzerland 
does it make it easier to list probably he said will 
they list thats a different story 
hoffmannla roches chairman fritz gerber declined monday to 
comment on whether the changes would ease the way for a takeover 
bid 
the new structure to be proposed at the companys annual 
meeting may 31 in basel switzerland would eliminate the automatic 
dual ownership of stock in both swissbased roche group and sapac 
corp ltd 
under the 50yearold arrangement sapac incorporated in new 
brunswick canada was the holding company for subsidiaries in 
north and south america asia australia the united kingdom and 
part of africa 
now sapac would become a subsidiary of roche group in which 
shareholders would own stock 
further the company would form roche holding ltd to become a 
parent of f hoffmannla roche which would assume control of 
operations and liabilities 
the holding company arrangement makes the corporation more 
transparent to the outside world the company said 
finally hoffmannla roche said it would reorganize its shares 
to enlarge the stock base

trading operations often show wide swings sometimes favorable and 
sometimes adverse salomon said in a statement the first 
quarter was one of those periods 
salomon said its energy division phibro energy made 98 
million before taxes more than 2 times as much as in the same 
period last year boosted by oil price increases and added refining 
capacity 
the firm said a 72 million pretax loss was reduced by a 44

shareholders of united technologies corp 
a major us defense contractor rejected moves monday to pull the 
corporation out of south africa and to look into company hiring 
practices in northern ireland 
the shareholders also rejected a call for an annual list of 
names of top company leaders with former ties to government 
voting at their annual meeting held this year at the peabody 
hotel in memphis the shareholders supported management on all 
issues raised at the gathering 
the shareholders overwhelmingly approved the election of 11 
members of the corporations board of directors and approved an 
employee incentive plan offering stock options to top company 
managers 
robert f daniell united technologies chairman and chief 
executive officer said the company enjoyed a good year in 1988 
we positioned ourself for a very healthy future he said 
the companys pratt amp whitney division has a backlog of orders 
for commercial aircraft engines worth 84 billion and is launched 
on a program to reduce costs 30 percent by 1992 daniell said 
profits for the companys sikorsky helicopters increased in 1988 
after a difficult period the previous year and the otis elevator 
and carrier air conditioner divisions also recorded strong sales 
he said 
united technologies automotive division he said had its 
fourth year of growth in a row 
the division has an average of almost 70 worth of equipment 
on every car you see daniell said 
one resolution which also has failed at previous shareholder 
meetings sought to divest the company of its elevator plant 
employing about 1100 workers in south africa 
a companion resolution sought to ban the company from doing 
business with government agencies in south africa 
united technologies is opposed to south african policies of 
racial separation but the company can do more to oppose apartheid 
by staying in the country than by leaving daniell said

exxon corps chief executive predicts that 
remnants of the valdez oil slick will vanish within 10 years 
because of cleanup efforts a comeback by mother nature and 
evaporation of the leftover sludge 
in an interview in the may 8 edition of fortune magazine which 
went on sale on most newsstands monday lawrence rawl also says the 
largest us oil company could have controlled up to half the spill 
ifit had received approval from coast guard and alaskan authorities 
to dump chemical dispersants by air 
rawl also rejected criticism of exxons behavior and his lack of 
public visibility in the days after one of its tankers crashed into 
an underwater reef off the alaskan coast march 24 spewing more 
than 240000 barrels of oil into prince william sound the worst 
spill in us history 
youre damned if you do and damned if you dont rawl said 
in the interview i concluded that we were going to be up to our 
butts in alligators right here 
exxon has said it will clean up the mess which has devastated 
the area around valdez and led to congressional calls for tighter 
regulatory control over oil company access to the huge reserves in 
the nations largest state 
rawl declined to predict how long the cleanup would take or what 
it would cost the company but he told the magazine hes seen other 
larger spill cleanups that have been relatively inexpensive 
because the environment has just come right back 
asked what reporters will find if they return to valdez in 10 
years rawl said nothing i would think they can return to 
valdez a lot sooner than 10 years from now i dont think they will 
find much in terms of environmental damage 
rawl said one reason he was optimistic about the cleanup is 
were going to put a hell of an effort on it 
he also said oil evaporates and it oxidizes we can pick a lot 
of it up it is surprising but in world war ii we lost 16 times 
more oil off the east coast of the us in the early months of 1942 
when your tankers were torpedoed and there was no permanent damage 
to the shoreline 
rawl said exxon had been ready to dump chemical dispersants on 
the spewing oil shortly after the accident but the basic problem 
we ran into was that we had environmentalists advising the alaskan 
department of environmental conservation that the dispersant could 
be toxic 
he said the consequent delay to load planes full of the 
dispersant to dump on the oil was one of the main reasons the 
public perceived the oil giant as acting slowly and irresponsibly 
when you get 240000 barrels of oil on the water you cannot 
get it all up rawl said but we could have kep

severe thunderstorms occurred in western illinois and eastern 
iowa over the weekend but brought little relief to the rest of the 
midwest where corn planting has begun and soybean growers are 
preparing to plant 
the coverage was probably less than 20 to 25 percent of each 
state but it was enough to create a negative atmosphere this 
morning in the grain markets said mickey luth a soybean analyst 
in chicago with shearson lehmann hutton inc 
in a sixto10day forecast issued after the close the national 
weather service predicted normal temperatures and normal ainfall in 
the midwest early next week the weather service called for 
continued abovenormal temperatures in the great plains 
threatening further deterioration of the droughtstressed kansas 
wheat crop

farmer selling of oldcrop supplies over the weekend following last 
weeks rally may soybeans had surged 12 cents a bushel on friday 
and corn had gained 2 cents to 5 cents 
on the new york mercantile exchange most unleaded gasoline and

commodity exchange on buying partly inspired by the gold markets 
resistance to selling below about 383 a troy ounce for spot 
delivery 
no matter what they tried they werent able to get it lower 
so they had to turn it around at some point and take the path of 
less resistance take it higher said richard levine vice

elders futures inc in new york 
gold settled 280 to 290 higher with june at 391 a troy

slaughterready cattle into the summer those perceptions were 
bolstered by fridays agriculture department quarterly 
cattleonfeed report which showed 3 percent more cattle being 
fattened for slaughter as of april 1 than on the same date a year

bond prices drifted in a narrow range monday 
finishing little changed as traders appeared to be awaiting further 
evidence on the economy and the likely direction of interest rates 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond finished unchanged 
compared with late friday and its yield held at 898 percent 
market analysts said trading was light in the absence of 
marketmoving news developments and in advance of several economic 
reports due later this week starting tuesday with data on durable 
goods orders for march 
later this week the government expects to report its 
preliminary estimate of firstquarter growth in the gross national 
product 
in recent weeks several reports have indicated the economy may 
be slowing but last weeks increase in interest rates by the west 
german central bank has made some traders fearful of a global trend 
toward higher rates a development that would depress bond prices 
meanwhile the treasury department sold 72 billion in new 
threemonth bills at an average discount rate of 866 percent up 
from 857 percent last week another 72 billion was sold in 
sixmonth bills at an average discount rate of 872 percent up 
from 859 percent last week 
the rates were the highest since april 10 when threemonth 
bills sold for 871 percent and sixmonth bills averaged 878 
percent 
in the secondary market for outstanding treasury securities 
prices of shortterm and intermediate governments were off 132 
point while longterm issues gained as much as 132 point 
according to telerate inc the financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer lost 029 to 112850

the air force said monday it had awarded 
contracts to two competing teams of companies to determine how a 
new jet fighter they are designing can be modified for use by the 
navy as well 
the two contracts each worth 50 million and awarded by the air 
force on behalf of the navy are part of a previously announced 
cooperation program between the two services in which the air force 
is developing a new jet fighter and the navy is developing a new 
groundattack jet for the 21st century 
under the 1986 cooperation program the air forces socalled 
advanced tactical fighter is to be used by the navys aircraft 
carriers as a replacement for the f14 tomcat and the navys 
advanced tactical aircraft is to be used by air force tactical 
bombing squadrons 
the two teams competing on the advanced tactical fighter include 
lockheed corp and general dynamics corp and northrop corp and 
mcdonnell douglas corp one of those teams is to be selected in 
1991 to build the plane 
the contracts awarded monday are designed to allow the air force 
contractors to identify the changes which are necessary to meet 
the navys unique aircraft carrier suitability and mission 
requirements 
some of the changes required to make the navy variant 
carriersuitable include adding a wing fold strengthening the 
landing gear adding a nose tow and arresting hook and a highlift 
system to make approach speed and attitude compatible with carrier 
launches and landings the air force added 
while the air force was responsible for awarding the contracts 
the navy said monday it was funding the work

energy futures prices plunged monday amid new 
reports of rising oil production and possible new sources of 
imported gasoline 
the june contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us grade of crude oil fell 71 cents a barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange closing the day at 2061 other contract 
months closed as much as 79 cents lower 
analysts said a report shortly after midday edt that some 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries were 
boosting production to take advantage of rising crude prices 
triggered a selloff 
ed ryan energy analyst with dean witter reynolds inc said the 
market had been nervously quiet until then 
when the statement came from opec that it was increasing its 
production that triggered profittaking ryan said 
opec is believed to be producing about 205 million barrels a 
day 2 million above its selfimposed quota since it established 
the quota last november to boost world oil prices crude prices 
have risen more than 60 percent 
many investors also were jittery in the absence of new 
information about the resumption of north sea oil production after 
last weeks gas explosion 
news of the accident on tuesday sent crude prices soaring more 
than 3 a barrel to a threeyear high the accident disrupted the 
flow of brent crude through a major pipeline which affected the 
production of at least 500000 barrel 
the north sea disruption compounded fears of an already tight 
gasoline supply situation at the onset of the driving season 
analysts said a decision friday by the environmental protection 
agency giving massachusetts until june to impose new higher octane 
regulations also helped soften prices 
in addition they said that rumors circulating in the market 
about possible foreign gasoline supplies also contributed to the 
decline 
we heard that new deliveries are coming in from latin 
america said john hill an energy broker with merrill lynch 
energy futures gasoline that would normally go to europe is 
coming here because prices are so high here 
among refined products traded on the exchange unleaded gasoline 
for may delivery dropped 193 cents to 7223 cents a gallon with 
most other contracts down 2 cents heating oil for may slid 182 
cents to 5181 cents a gallon with other contracts 2 cents lower

quarter compared with a loss of 76 million in the first quarter 
of 1988 sales for the quarter were 5376 million up from 4828

in the yearago period 
the los angelesbased oil company said its 1988 firstquarter 
results included a 456 million cumulative gain from a change in

charges of 322 million for writedowns 
without adjustments firstquarter 1988 earnings were 44 
million or 38 cents per share unocal said 
stegemeier succeeds fred l harley 72 who announced his

189 million for the first quarter of 1988 unocal said 
as of march 31 unocal had reduced its debt to 433 billion

the first womens bank which was founded in 
1975 to give women equal opportunity in banking has changed its 
name to the first new york bank for business the chairman 
announced monday 
the new appellation reflects the banks decision to expand into 
middle market commercial lending and its belief that women are no 
longer discriminated against by other banks said martin a simon 
the chairman 
the mission that the bank had to specialize in women because 
they didnt have equal opportunity became anachronistic because 
everyone else was doing the same thing he said 
the first womens bank was never successful financially he 
said because of its small capital base moreover he said it soon 
became clear that there was no need for a bank that catered 
exclusively to women 
simon joined the bank in december 1986 and led the 
recapitalization effort that moved it from a financial institution 
with 50 million in assets and 23 employees to 633 million in 
assets and 189 employees 
the banks new target is the middle market in the new york 
metropolitan area people or businesses that are looking for loans 
of 1 million to 5 million the chairman said 
however he said the banks flagship branch located at park 
avenue and 57th street will retain the first womens bank banner to 
demonstrate a caring and an affinity for women we intend to 
foster 
simon noted that half of the banks senior management is made up 
of women few banks if any can make that claim he added 
the name change will affect all of the banks other branches 
except for the first childrens bank which opened at fao 
schwarz in september 1988

each passing day of spring is giving automakers a 
better picture of how the rest of their year is shaping up and 
theres speculation that it may not look as good as theyd planned 
midapril sales figures by the eight us automakers are due 
tuesday and the industry has been looking for rebounding numbers 
it is the first 10day sales reporting period to feel the full 
impact of incentive programs announced in late march and early 
april by general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp 
march and april normally herald the spring carbuying season 
but sales this past march were lower than expected automakers 
responded with a number of new incentives hoping to make customers 
deals they couldnt refuse 
those hopes havent necessarily become reality 
car and light truck sales during the first 10 days of april 
appeared strong on paper rising 283 percent over the same period 
last year ford led the charge boosting sales of its domestically 
made cars by 47 percent but those figures compared with 
yearearlier numbers weakened when incentives expired at the end of 
march 1988 
sales had rebounded by midapril last year meaning a 
yeartoyear comparison on tuesday will be more valid 
youre comparing it with a fairly strong period last year 
analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc said monday 
i guess youd say they incentives are working but not as 
well as they used to he said if thats so midapril sales 
were better than the march rate but not as good as early april 
analyst douglas laughlin of bear stearns amp co of new york 
agreed that april sales were critical for the industry 
im holding my breath a little on this one he said adding 
that he was watching interest rates particularly closely 
if interest rates start to trend down i think that would 
alleviate some of the concern among automakers about the impact 
of this particular incentive program he said it would 
suggest that things will be easier in the next few months 
if interest rates hang up here laughlin said it may be a 
source of concern for the industry 
one of the first places any industry concern would be noted is 
in the companies production schedules gm ford and chrysler held 
to ambitious production levels through the first quarter of this 
year leading some analysts to speculate that production rates 
would have to be changed later this year especially at 
modelchangeover time in the third quarter 
wards automotive reports a weekly industry newsletter said in 
monday editions that gm had cut its production schedule 
significantly for june july and august

divers located the bodies of two 
maintenance workers killed monday when an early morning explosion 
rumbled through the underpinnings of ford motor cos rouge complex 
the victims were identified as billy stiener 27 of redford and 
john l hatch in his early 50s of detroit ford spokesman john 
spelich said 
the bodies were located at 730 pm monday in a halfmilelong 
portion of a utility tunnel that carries electric water steam and 
compressed air services to several buildings at the 1100acre 
facility 
the tunnel 7 to 8 feet in diameter was flooded with 4 to 6 
feet of water after the blast apparently ruptured a water pipe 
spelich said 
the blast tore gaping holes in parking lots flipped cars blew 
windows from a threestory power substation and forced the company 
to shut down a number of operations including the mustang 
automobile assembly line 
john schultz a driver for a bus company ford contracts to carry 
people around the huge complex said he saw flames shooting 300 
to 500 feet into the air for a short period of time shortly after 
the 620 am blast 
there was no fire damage 
spelich said the two victims were employed by doetsch industrial 
services inc of detroit a woman answering the doetsch telephone 
who refused to give her name said the company has done maintenance 
work at the rouge complex for years 
while the divers searched below workers on the surface some 
wearing masks and protective clothing picked up and bagged debris 
out of concern that asbestos which had been used to wrap the steam 
pipes might escape into the air the fibrous mineral has been 
shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals spelich said workers 
immediately watered down any areas which might have been affected 
by airborne asbestos 
about 6500 firstshift employees at the complex were sent home 
after the explosion the afternoon shifts at the mustang assembly 
plant a metal stamping plant and part of a glassmaking operation 
were told not to report for work affecting about 2500 workers 
ford spokesman jay meisenhelder said 
it wasnt clear how long any of the 16000 workers at the 
complex would be away from their jobs the assembly plant has been 
making about 46 mustangs an hour recently spelich said 
the rouge complex located in dearborn a few miles west of the 
detroit city limits includes steelmaking and engine plants in 
addition to the operations shut down by the blast

laidoff workers at the wall street brokerage 
lf rothschild amp co have sued their former employer under the new 
federal plant closing law while three drexel burnham lambert inc 
employees have sued that investment house over its plans to sell 
its retail brokerage business 
the rothschild employees claim they were dismissed without the 
60 days notice required under the law 
a lawyer for the workers said monday he did not know of any 
other suits filed under the worker adjustment and retraining 
notification act which took effect feb 4 the workers were laid 
off march 10 
though the act is known popularly as the plant closing law it 
applies to any company with at least 100 employees in all and at 
least 50 at one site such firms must give workers 60 days notice 
of a shutdown or mass layoffs 
the lawyer jeffrey g smith said lf rothschild laid off 
about 250 workers at its manhattan headquarters without warning 
the suit seeking back pay and punitive damages was filed friday 
in us district court in manhattan by seven former employees as a 
class action 
the suit said rothschild was one of the 20 largest brokerage 
houses in the nation with more than 300 million in capital 
before the october 1987 stock market crash 
the firm suffered heavy losses in the crash and was purchased in 
june by a subsidiary of franklin savings association a savings and 
loan based in ottawa kan but it continued to lose money and the 
layoffs ensued 
in a letter announcing the layoffs rothschild told its 
employees the plant closing law did not apply because the company 
had been pursuing a realistic opportunity to have a lender bail 
it out and avert the layoffs 
smith said the law did offer such an exemption on grounds that 
a layoff notice would scare off potential lenders 
but he said in this case the bailout apparently was being 
considered by franklin the parent company smith said that would 
not qualify for an exemption because franklin already was aware of 
rothschilds condition 
kevin hoffman rothschilds attorney declined to discuss the 
case saying the company would respond in court 
he did say rothschild gave severance pay to the workers but 
smith said the law requires notification regardless 
in the drexel case the classaction suit filed monday by the 
three workers charges drexels top managers with breach of contract 
and violations of their fiduciary duties because of the plans to 
sell the brokerage division 
the suit filed in new york state supreme court in manhattan 
contends that the sale of the unit will cost the brokers millions 
of dollars because they will be forced to sell their drexel stock 
for far below its true value 
the price of the stock is based on book value the suit did not 
disclose the firms book value 
according to the suit drexel has understated the book value of 
its assets including warrants and options it has received in some 
deals in lieu of partial payment of fees 
drexel spokesman steven anreder told the new york times that the 
firm had not studied the suit and had no comment 
drexel annouced plans last week for a major restructuring that 
involves the sale of the brokerage unit and the elimination of 
about onethird of drexels work force the restructuring was 
prompted in part by bad publicity due to the investigation of 
securities fraud at the investment house
