activists on friday used the first anniversary of 
the killing of six jesuit priests to revive their fight against 
us aid for el salvador a cause long overshadowed by events in 
eastern europe and the middle east 
in a rally in los angeles meanwhile 113 people were arrested 
and cited for allegedly blocking entrances to the federal building 
where protests have been held weekly since the nov 16 1989 
killings by salvadoran soldiers 
in new york city about 50 out of 100 people holding a vigil 
near the salvadoran consulate were arrested and charged with 
disorderly conduct for blocking the entrance to the building 
police said 
boston became the 10th us city to join a boycott of coffee 
made with salvadoran beans jesuits held a memorial mass and 
candlelight vigil academics debated the salvadoran civil war and a 
peace group debuted a television ad that features footage of the 
bodies of the murdered priests 
its sad that it took killings of people of that stature to 
regain the attention of the american people said rob everts 
director of the new england chapter of the peace group neighbor to 
neighbor they didnt die in vain this tragedy was critical in 
getting the attention of policy makers 
the six priests were slain with their housekeeper and her 
15yearold daughter 
about 75 people attended a candlelight vigil outside bostons 
john f kennedy federal building friday and memorial services were 
held at boston college and the cathedral of st paul for the dead 
priests and the 74000 other salvadorans who have died in 10 years 
of civil war 
of course events in the persian gulf have been on the front 
burner said us rep joseph moakley who heads a congressional 
inquiry into the murders after a year its almost amazing that 
the public is still focusing on the atrocities in el salvador 
moakley said the priests murders have drawn that attention 
the jesuit community and others have kept a focus on these 
heinous crimes he said 
neighbor to neighbor renewed appeals for a boycott of folgers 
and other us coffee brands that use salvadoran beans bostons 
city council endorsed the boycott and mayor raymond l flynn banned 
the brands from city offices 
our feeble and failed el salvador policy is one tragic remnant 
of a cold war which has ended virtually everywhere else flynn 
said it is time to end not merely reduce military aid to el 
salvador 
procter amp gamble said in a statement that a boycott only hurts 
the people of el salvador and the company provided letters from 
the us government urging it to continue buying salvadoran beans 
about 400 people took part in the los angeles rally among those 
cited by police and later released was david clennon of the 
television show thirtysomething said mary brent wehrli a 
protest organizer 
no violence or injuries were reported 
the city council proclaimed friday a day of special remembrance 
to commemorate the killings of what were termed martyrs for the 
cause of human rights

the central intelligence agency has fired four 
employees in an investigation of the sale of valuable mistakenly 
printed postage stamps the agency said friday night 
five other other employees were disciplined in unspecified ways 
the case arose when the cia purchased 95 of the 1 stamps at the 
mclean va post office for its own use in 1986 
the stamps showed an oil lamp but the ones bought by the cia 
had the body of the lamp upside down such misprints can be 
extremely valuable to stamp collectors 
the nine employees sold 85 of the misprints to a new jersey 
dealer giving the dealer one torn stamp each employee kept one 
stamp now worth a reported 17000 each and one of the nine 
employees is believed to have lost his stamp 
the four employees who were dismissed were fired for lying to 
investigators misappropriating government property and failing 
to return a number of valuable stamps purchased with agency funds 
after they were directed to do so said spokesman mark mansfield 
the dismissals were ordered reluctantly only after all 
alternatives were fully explored and this resolves the case from 
our point of view he said 
mansfield quoted cia director william webster as saying in an 
internal statement this case is important to every employee in 
the agency because it gives a clearer picture of what is expected 
of us public service is a special trust it is not easy it is not 
without temptations 
the washington post first disclosed the firings in saturday 
editions the newspaper said the cia discussed the case after the 
smithsonian institution announced it had received four stamps as a 
donation from the cia 
those stamps had been given back by the disciplined employees 
none of the nine employees has been identified 
only one sheet of 400 stamps was believed misprinted and the 
other 305 stamps apparently were used to mail letters and packages

an american who said he disguised himself 
as an arab and made a sevenday 700mile escape across the desert 
from kuwait returned home friday to a tearful welcome from his 
family 
ernest briskey assistant vice president for international 
program development at oregon state university spent 110 days in 
hiding in kuwait city before making his way to amman jordan on 
tuesday 
briskey a food technology expert and former dean of agriculture 
at oregon state was working as a senior adviser to the kuwaiti 
institute of scientific research when iraqi forces invaded the 
country on aug 2 
his wife three children and 4yearold granddaughter welcomed 
him on his arrival at portland international airport 
he declined to talk about the specifics of his escape because of 
fear of reprisal for those who helped him those who gave him aid 
during his time in hiding and as he escaped would be executed if 
they were caught he said 
briskey 59 spoke about the damage done in kuwait by the iraqi 
army 
its been an incredibly brutal destruction of a people and a 
country actually much worse than what has been portrayed perhaps 
to the american people he said 
briskey said the iraqis were removing everything of value from 
kuwait 
they brought trucks down he said they took dairy cows 
all the chickens all the computers all the cars they took 
anything moveable hospital supplies 
briskey said he heard many tales of brutality 
i personally know that they did shoot members of families if 
they found anything american briskey said i know people who 
saw this happen they shot people including a 70yearold 
grandfather because a passport was found 
briksey said he lived in four different places while in hiding 
and there were many times he nearly was captured 
i spent time under bushes outside the house under air 
conditioners and under water tanks while searches were being 
threatened briskey said one time i could count 200 soldiers 
and more than a half a dozen tanks outside my window 
asked how he spent his time briskey said i listened to the 
bbc every hour on the hour and i read a lot i read the bible 
twice 
he said he supports president bushs actions in the region and 
only wishes the buildup of forces had come sooner he hopes war can 
be avoided but said he saw no signs that saddam hussein is willing 
to withdraw iraqi forces from kuwait 
kuwait is not kuwait anymore he said it is all bunkered 
ridges are built out of sand with machine guns and all the barbed 
wire and the mines

most seem to feel that if we have a recession it will not be 
deep and that well come out of it relatively soon six months at 
most and i would like to think that is true president bush on 
the economy in an interview with cable news network 
 
the crisis we are experiencing now is still a crisis of a 
totalitarian state which is reflected in the paralysis of power 
the center is sliding down to confrontation with the republics and 
first of all with russia boris yeltsin president of the 
russian federation addressing the supreme legislature

president bush acknowledges he may not have 
explained his goals in the persian gulf standoff clearly enough to 
reassure the american public and one congressional backer of his 
gulf policy strongly agrees 
president bush has proven to be an inept communicator and has 
failed to convey to the public why we are in saudi arabia rep 
les aspin chairman of the house armed services committee said 
thursday 
aspin dwis said he believes that hearings planned by 
congressional committees including his own will provide 
sufficient debate on the critical issue 
bush in an interview thursday with cable news network pledged 
not to involve the country in a drawnout vietnam situation he 
said he probably has not communicated very well his objectives in 
the gulf standoff against iraq 
if i havent done as clear a job as i might on explaining 
this then ive got to do better in that regard because i know in 
my heart of hearts that what we are doing is right the president 
said 
recent congressional criticism of bushs decision to send 
200000 us troops to join the 230000 already in the gulf region 
reveals the absence of a consensus said aspin who supports bushs 
policy 
we need a consensus on the issue of whether the embargo works 
and when you use military force to enforce the embargo he told 
reporters 
aspin also released an interim report card on us allies and 
other nations based on their aid to the gulf effort 
the lawmaker gave turkey and egypt aplus for their prompt 
response to the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 turkey was 
cited for shutting down the oil pipeline from iraq that runs 
through turkey to the mediterranean sea 
egypt sent 2000 troops to saudi arabia shortly after the 
invasion and committed 30000 additional ground troops 
saudi arabia received a b from aspin for a financial 
contribution that fails to match the profits it will earn due to 
higher oil prices and increased saudi oil production 
the pentagon says the gulf states have contributed 6 billion so 
far aspin gave japan a c for its plan to provide 2 billion 
through march 1991 germany received a c while other european 
nations were given a cminus 
this is not meant to trivialize an important issue but rather 
to summarize and give greater clarity to an analysis that is 
necessarily nuanced and intricate said aspin 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a senior member of the house 
armed services committee expressed concern that frontline arab 
states were not doing their part in providing forces 
the united states should be reducing the number of us troops 
and telling the saudis and other states of the gulf cooperation 
council to provide the primary military force she said 
in other gulfrelated developments 
iraqi president saddam hussein told abc news he was holding 
hostages because their presence may help distract anybody who may 
opt for war saddam called on bush to pledge not to attack iraq 
and added an open pledge of this nature a declared statement of 
this nature would be sufficient for us to allow all foreigners to 
leave iraq he also said he needs nuclear weapons to balance 
weapons he contended israel possesses 
bush invoked emergency powers authorizing the pentagon to begin 
military construction projects in the gulf region without advance 
approval from congress otherwise the pentagon would have had to 
go through a long process of seeking authorization and financing 
from congress 
the house banking finance and urban affairs committee said it 
will hold hearings on the economic impact of us involvement in 
the middle east on nov 2728 
the american civil liberties union released a statement signed 
by 45 national organizations calling on bush to promise not to 
order a military attack against iraq without congressional 
authorization 
the state department said more than 100 americans and their 
foreignborn family members are expected to leave kuwait on sunday 
aboard a uschartered iraqi airways flight most are women and 
children who had been eligible to leave for some time but decided 
only recently to do so a spokesman said

the bush administration scrambling to regain 
the upper hand in the tax debate is studying a proposal to cut 
social security and other benefits paid to affluent americans and 
funnel the savings to the poor and middle class 
while an effort to trim such popular benefit programs as social 
security medicare and farm subsidies would be certain to provoke a 
firestorm of protest a white house official said thursday the idea 
was being contemplated very seriously 
under the proposal being reviewed the savings obtained by 
trimming payments for welltodo recipients would be used to 
provide tax cuts for lessaffluent taxpayers 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity stressed that 
the benefitcut proposal was at a very preliminary stage of review 
as the administration begins work on its fiscal 1992 budget to be 
submitted to congress in february 
the proposal would offer the tempting political benefit of 
allowing the administration to trim government spending and cut 
taxes while at the same time blunting democratic charges that the 
republican white house favors the rich 
in the past the administration and congress have shied away 
from trying to reduce the budget by trimming popular government 
benefits 
the benefit cuts are receiving a new look because the 
administration believes last months deficitreduction agreement 
gives it new leverage the white house source said 
that agreement which calls for 500 billion in savings over 
five years has a new payasyougo mechanism that will trigger 
automatic benefit cuts unless congress reduces benefits in line 
with any tax reductions it approves 
thus the administration could be assured that if it links 
benefit cuts and tax cuts in its budget congress wont be tempted 
to pass the politically popular tax reductions while simply 
ignoring the recommended benefit reductions 
the benefitcut plan was first disclosed by the wall street 
journal 
white house budget director richard darman has said he believes 
the new deficitenforcement mechanism will shift the debate from 
one simply over how much to spend to one over where the spending 
offers the best return 
as part of the budgetdrafting exercise president bush has held 
a series of meetings in the past week with his advisers and top 
business executives to help gauge whether the economy is in a 
recession and what the appropriate government response should be 
reflecting on the meetings bush offered his gloomiest 
assessment to date of the countrys economic prospects saying i 
am concerned that we are in a downturn here 
in an interview broadcast thursday night by cnn the president 
noted that the technical definition of a recession as two 
consecutive quarters of declining economic output had not yet been 
met but he did not rule out the possibility that the nation was on 
the verge of having two negative quarters 
im not an economist but most seem to feel that if we have a 
recession that meets these technical terms that it will not be 
deep and that well come out of it relatively soon six months at 
most bush said 
a group of top bankers and industrialists who met with bush on 
thursday gave him a generally pessimistic view of the economys 
prospects according to one participant 
jhn g medlin jr president and chief executive officer of 
first wachovia corp a leading bank holding company said the 
general view among the business leaders was that we may have 
slipped into a recession 
the administration has said it wants to include as part of its 
1992 budget progrowth measures aimed at lessening the impact of 
any downturn 
medlin said the president did not mention any specific measures 
under consideration administration officials have suggested 
however that bush may try again to cut the tax rate on capital 
gains the profits made on the sale of real estate stocks and 
other assets

the shower of letters packages 
and banners for the us troops in the persian gulf region is a far 
cry from the sendoff joe mobley got the last time he was in a war 
zone 
in 1968 he sailed aboard the uss enterprise from san francisco 
to vietnam where he would be held for four and a half years as a 
prisoner of war in americas longest and most unpopular conflict 
there were people throwing garbage at us from the golden gate 
bridge said mobley 46 now captain of the carrier uss saratoga 
operating in the red sea 
in operation desert shield americans at home are throwing 
bouquets in the form of 70 tons of mail every day 
it may be putting a big strain on the militarys mail service 
but for the 230000 us service personnel deployed in the gulf 
region its a big morale booster 
all military men like to feel the citizens are behind them it 
makes the job a lot easier mobley said thats a stark 
contrast to what most of us felt in vietnam 
public support is as important as it is fickle when public 
opinion turned against the vietnam war a generation ago campus 
demonstrations and civil riots turned into outright indignation 
against the military 
for now the giant greetings cards and banners from school 
children church groups and wellwishers help troops endure the 
harsh saudi sands 
the rural retreat elementary school in wytheville va for 
example has adopted members of a platoon in the armys 82nd 
airborne division the principal a vietnam vet is the father of 
pfc jimmy phipps 20 a machine gunner with the 82nd 
if you dont have people that care and you dont have people 
behind you you aint got nothing phipps said during a break 
from training 
these guys live off mail its like their blood said capt 
clint esarey 31 of fort lewis wash 
mail from family friends and loved ones is one thing sacks of 
letters care packages and chocolate bars from strangers is 
something else 
weve received countless pieces of mail from people we dont 
know have never heard of said marine cpl christopher 
francovich 23 of san francisco 
everytime i read them i get goose pimples it touches us it 
makes this little event here worth it for us id like to thank the 
folks back home francovich said 
a hangar at an airfield in eastern saudi arabia is adorned with 
a giant white sheet trimmed with a yellow ribbon from an elementary 
school in toms river nj it has peace signs and bart simpson 
faces on it 
one note reads i strongly suggest when you come back party 
hearty marty 
another signed by michael tsambikou says kick some butt 
win 
in the same hangar are three giant cards collected from a 
shopping mall in burlington nj and a giant postcard from 
delaware 
i just want you to know all of delaware is backing you and 
hoping for your safe return when youre sweating and eating less 
than delicious food just remember that when you return you can 
eat all the wonderful food you can stuff in your bellies wrote 
laurie wheeler 
its important to know youre not forgotten that somebody 
cares said lt kim thompson the female leader of a military 
police platoon in the 197th infantry brigade 
one package addressed to any jewish soldier contained a 
hanukkah kit which would be impossible to get in a country that 
recognizes islam as the only religion 
keep it coming it boosts the morale of every soldier out 
here said staff sgt joseph herald 34 of olympia wash 
most soldiers have only a cursory knowledge of the domestic 
debate about whether or not american troops should be deployed in 
the desert to counter iraqs aggression after its aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait 
but they agree with those who say there should be popular 
support for their sacrifices or theres no point in being in saudi 
arabia 
the last thing we need is to have a war over there a bloody 
war and have american boys being brought back in body bags and yet 
not have the american people behind them said sen sam nunn a 
georgia democrat who is chairman of the senate armed services 
committee 
weve gone that route one time we dont need to do it 
again nunn said 
those memories are alive in the minds of old hands and fresh 
faces alike 
its almost overwhelming the support weve gotten from back 
home thats something we didnt get in vietnam said col glynn 
hale a brigade commander in the 82nd airborne who served three 
tours in vietnam 
it never really struck me until we started getting all the 
letters and cards over here its quite a change these guys know 
theyre being appreciated over here hale said 
marine cpl carlin walters 21 of vidor texas remembers too 
in the back of our minds we dont want to be treated like 
they were in vietnam he said if i come home from this and and 
people decide to spit on me aint no telling what ill do

thousands of people are flocking to a greek 
orthodox church to see an icon that they believe began shedding 
tears last month after a special prayer session for peace in the 
middle east 
the icon of st irene patron saint of peace has drawn 
christians of many denominations and smaller numbers of moslems 
jews and the curious to the st irene chrysovalantou cathedral 
church officials say 
visitors have come from as far away as france japan and india 
according to maria galiatsatos assistant secretary at the church 
in a largely greek astoria neighborhood in the queens borough 
she said she receives up to 500 phone calls a day 
we have had more than 100000 people visit here since she 
began crying galiatsatos said one sunday we didnt close the 
church until 4 am and we reopened at 6 oclock in the morning 
the churchs bishop vikentios of avlon says he believes the icon 
of st irene whose name means peace in greek is weeping for 
the persian gulf 
the gulf crisis is very serious at this moment something 
will happen and we have sent a message of peace to mikhail 
gorbachev the secretarygeneral of the united nations and 
president george bush the cleric said 
worshipers believe the icon painted in greece in 1919 and 
brought here two decades ago began crying oct 17 after it was 
taken to a sister church in chicago for a special service for world 
peace 
at 7 oclock in the evening after the prayer service in 
which we had about 1000 people praying for peace especially in 
the persian gulf several people came running to us they said 
come look the icon is crying and we came upstairs and we saw 
the tears and everyone started crying 
this was it a message to the world that it must continue to 
pray for peace 
after the icon was brought back from chicago word of the 
weeping saint spread quickly in the neighborhood 
the painting a portrait of a dourfaced woman cloaked in black 
is encased behind glass on a carved oak stand set up before the 
altar of the darkened church 
people file past to the sounds of mournful greek chants a 
figure in a black hood beckons them one at a time lighting a taper 
to illuminate the painting 
at first the flame reveals little but then the light seizes on 
the face of st irene where glistening streaks can be seen 
extending from each eye down the cheeks 
kiss the icon the robed figure intones before the visitor 
steps away 
the church has ruled out taking the icon from the church for 
scientific tests but invites skeptics to examine the painting and 
even take some tears for laboratory analysis 
cj peterson 67 dropped by after hearing about the icon from 
fellow worshipers at a baptist church to me it seemed real it 
looks like tears it looked real it looked wet he said 
bishop vikentios said he is pained by the picture 
were sad were so sad we dont want to see the icon crying 
ive been here for 20 years and she has always been happy he 
said

three of the keating five senators were 
deeply involved in helping financier charles h keating jr 
strongarm federal banking regulators and in some cases discussed 
money and favors at the same time the senate ethics counsel says 
democratic sens alan cranston dennis deconcini and donald 
riegle played the largest roles in helping charles h keating jr 
seek waivers of federal rules limiting risky savings and loan 
investments the senate ethics committees lawyer said as the panel 
opened hearings thursday 
special counsel robert s bennett who concludes his summation 
of evidence today assigned lesser roles to sens john mccain 
rariz and john glenn dohio 
while senator cranston and deconcini were by far the most 
active on mr keatings behalf the evidence shows senator riegle 
played an important role in the early stages bennett said 
on the other hand it is to be said for senator riegle that 
like senators glenn and mccain his efforts on behalf of lincoln 
appear to have ended as of april 9 1987 
on that date the five lawmakers were told by federal officials 
that criminal referrals involving keatings lincoln savings and 
loan association would be made to the justice department 
cranston of california was the only one of the five senators 
who did not attend thursday he begins radiation treatment for 
prostate cancer next week and after todays session may miss much 
of the proceedings 
the five senators are accused of improperly intervening with 
federal banking regulators on keatings behalf riegle of 
michigan is chairman of the senate banking committee deconcini is 
from arizona 
keating and his associates contributed more than 13 million to 
the senators campaigns or favored causes his californiabased 
sampls collapse may cost taxpayers as much as 2 billion keating is 
free on bail while facing fraud charges in california 
bennett said there was no disputing that each senator tried to 
help keating in some way 
but he said the question of whether they exerted improper 
influence arises partly from the campaign finance system that 
increasingly requires members of congress to seek financial 
contributions 
it is a booming warning bennett said unless the trends 
are recognized and dealt with we will have more cases like this 
and the reputation of this body and its members will be in utter 
ruin 
bennett said cranston continued contacting federal regulators on 
keatings behalf after being told that criminal complaints about 
lincoln would be referred to the justice department he said 
cranstons efforts continued even after former arizona gov bruce 
babbitt told him keating was a crook 
cranston received the most money from keating including 
850000 to three voter registration projects he backed bennett 
said cranston a liberal democrat should have questioned why a 
conservative such as keating would give money to causes that 
probably would lead to more black and hispanic voters 
i will give you many instances where acts and money were 
discussed at the same time and hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
the case of senator cranston passed in an office in this 
building bennett said 
evidence shows deconcini offered a deal on keatings behalf to 
top thrift regulator edwin gray bennett said deconcini has denied 
such a quid pro quo was offered 
the counsel said riegle set into motion plans for grays 
meeting with other senators and hid from his own aides his role in 
arranging that meeting 
campaign contributions by keating and associates to riegle came 
just weeks before that meeting bennett said he disputed riegles 
claim that he did not know that a fundraising visit to keatings 
phoenixbased company american continental corp was scheduled on 
a trip he took to arizona within days of the gray meeting 
bennett said glenn arranged and attended a luncheon involving 
keating and thenhouse speaker jim wright in january 1988 to 
discuss sampl problems but the counsel said he found no evidence 
linking glenns actions to keatings contributions 
mccain had been a friend of keating his family had vacationed 
at keatings resort home and flew on keating company planes 
bennett noted but he added there appeared to be nothing improper 
in mccains conduct

jennifer williams caught a glimpse of her father on the news and 
was shocked to see his hair had gone white in the months since her 
father and stepmother became trapped in iraq by the persian gulf 
crisis 
this whole hostage situation has taken a toll on everyone in 
this family said ms williams a senior at southern methodist 
university in dallas so im going over there to do whatever i 
can to get them out 
ms williams 21 is among a growing group of americans who have 
decided to accept saddam husseins invitation to spend the holidays 
with loved ones stranded in iraq 
i know that saddam doesnt care about christmas this is all 
about the media ms williams said still i have to do what i 
can to try and negotiate them out 
stewart and charlene williams who work in the banking industry 
became human shields after iraqi troops overran kuwait on aug 
2 foreign women and children were subsequently freed but 
charlene 45 stayed behind 
now jennifer williams feels its her turn to take a stand 
but jerry waters a spokesman for the state departments kuwaiti 
task force said the us government was advising families against 
such expeditions 
while our hearts go out to these families our advice remains 
the same travel to iraq is dangerous and we cannot guarantee the 
safety of those who decide to go said waters who could not say 
how many inquiries the task force had received 
john stevensons siblings already have made their travel 
arrangements the hostages twin sister and two brothers dont care 
what the government recommends 
we have one priority to see our brother bill stevenson 
acting as family spokesman said from brockton mass were not 
going to a zoo to view animals held in cages were going to get 
our brother and bring him home 
relatives of the estimated 1000 americans held in kuwait and 
iraq can imagine heroic scenarios in which their personal pleas to 
saddam secure a loved ones freedom 
but the reality some families said could play out very 
differently 
i spoke to guy said betty seago whose husband was among 
hostages allowed to telephone home recently and he said he 
didnt have good feelings about saddams invitation but would 
leave it up to me 
mrs seago said she had no plans to visit her husband an oil 
worker even though i know he wants to see me she said her 
family in johnson city tenn felt such a trip would be too risky 
kim edwards 34 of carson city nev chose to ignore the risk 
and made a trip to visit her husband tony in baghdad she arrived 
safely back in the united states last week and is planning a return 
visit in december 
the trips are necessary because somebody has to do 
something mrs edwards said we all feel that our hands are 
tied the united states isnt making any sort of diplomatic move 
toward a peaceful resolution 
president bushs decision last week to deploy up to 200000 more 
servicemen in the persian gulf has stirred fear among many of those 
with stranded loved ones who could die if war breaks out 
im morally opposed to war jennifer williams said wednesday 
from dallas and im opposed to my father and stepmother dying 
for oil thats why im going over there to try negotiations 
vafa fouroohi said he doesnt see much room for negotiation 
though his younger brother has secured a visa and plans to visit 
their father in baghdad 
i think this is propaganda said fouroohi who is managing 
the family business in redmond wash his father fred harrington 
was taken hostage while visiting kuwait on business 
saddam hussein is perhaps creating a little good

the plo says it wont block president elias 
hrawis efforts to end 15 years of civil war but its thousands of 
guerrillas in south lebanon are a wild card that saddam hussein 
could play 
the iraqi president might try to use the plo to thwart the plans 
of syria his archrival and hrawis main backer 
yasser arafats plo which has supported saddam has at least 
5000 hardcore guerrillas and thousands more reservists around the 
southern port of sidon an area that neither syria nor the lebanese 
government controls 
not only is the plo strong but the shiite moslem amal and 
hezbollah factions are also regrouping there along with prosyrian 
guerrilla groups the israelis occupy a border strip and show no 
sign of leaving 
hrawi aided by syrias military muscle has persuaded lebanons 
main militias to withdraw from beirut in the first phase of a peace 
plan to demilitarize the capital and on paper at least eventually 
the whole country 
the plan ratified by parliament last fall made no specific 
reference to the palestinians but hrawi has said they would have 
to disarm as well 
the palestinians weapons will be removed and the palestinian 
refugees will be placed under the protection of the government 
and legal authorities he said 
were prepared to help the government spread its authority 
over the whole of lebanon including our refugee camps let them 
talk to us and an agreement on this can be worked out saadallah 
qott the plos political chief in south lebanon told the 
associated press 
col anwar mady the plo commander in the sidon region said 
let president hrawi talk to his counterpart the president of 
palestine arafat about what he wants from the palestinian forces 
in lebanon and im sure whatever the lebanese government wants from 
us can be worked out 
qott interviewed at his office in the elbus refugee camp near 
tyre said arab league resolutions state that palestinians 
should have a regular brigade of the palestine liberation army in 
each arab country that hosts them 
our forces in lebanon can make up a regular pla brigade and 
were prepared to place it at the disposal of the lebanese under 
the direct command of the army he said 
but the offer is clouded by many questions 
arafat is not in a strong bargaining position right now hes 
already being squeezed by syria saudi arabia and egypt who have 
allied against saddam over his aug 2 invasion of kuwait the last 
thing arafat needs now is pressure on him in south lebanon 
but security sources say that syria which has been at odds with 
the plo since 1983 will not allow hrawi to cut a deal with the 
palestinians that would give the plo any legitimacy in lebanon 
that leaves hrawi in an awkward position he does not have the 
military strength himself to reestablish government control in the 
south with its 40000 troops in lebanon syria is the main 
powerbroker but it is wary of provoking the israelis by doing 
hrawis work for him 
charles snow a veteran regional analyst wrote in the middle 
east economic survey this week that getting the militias out of 
beirut is likely to be childs play compared to disarming them 
and even if the militias are somehow persuaded or coerced into 
handing over their weapons still larger obstacles loom on the 
horizon 
one of them is the status of the palestinians in south lebanon 
and their relations with the government 
south lebanon was once virtually run by the palestinians who 
used it as a base for attacks on israel the palestinians creation 
of a statewithinastate and the threat it posed to the 
christiandominated government was a key factor behind the outbreak 
of civil war in 1975 
the christians cooperated with the israelis when they invaded 
lebanon in 1982 and drove the plo out of the south and beirut 
but when the christians allied themselves with iraq in 1988 
they helped arafats guerrillas infiltrate back into lebanon 
because the plo fighters opposed the syrians 
hrawis longterm aim is the removal of foreign forces in 
lebanon including the palestinians 
but the syrians have made it clear they will not withdraw until 
israel pulls out of the zone in south lebanon it has occupied since 
mid1985 when most of its invasion army withdrew

cable news network is asking the supreme court 
to let it broadcast tape recordings of deposed panamanian leader 
manuel noriegas telephone conversations with his lawyers from his 
florida jail cell 
the justices today were awaiting responses from noriega and the 
bush administration to the emergency cnn request and are unlikely 
to act on the matter before next week 
meanwhile the fbi said thursday it had obtained cnn tapes in 
atlanta and was checking whether they were recordings of noriega 
cnn protested that the tapes were obtained without a warrant and 
demanded they be returned 
the network said the material was taken from a room that been 
occupied by one of its reporters at the omni hotel part of a 
complex that also houses cnns offices a security firm had 
notified fbi agents about the box of materials cnn said 
cnns lawyers on thursday asked justice anthony m kennedy to 
set aside a federal judges order banning the broadcasts kennedy 
who handles such emergency matters from florida promptly referred 
the case to the full court 
lawyers for noriega and the administration were urged to reply 
to the networks arguments by noon saturday 
the justices could act on the matter over the weekend but may 
decide to take some more time to study it 
cnn has been restrained indefinitely from telecasting news of 
great importance to the public lawyers for the network said 
balanced against this irreparable harm to the first amendment 
cnn and the public are speculative threats to interests that can be 
otherwise protected 
cnn is challenging an order issued by us district judge 
william hoeveler in miami on nov 8 that bars cnn from broadcasting 
at least some portions of the seven tapes until hoeveler can 
determine whether the broadcasts would endanger noriegas right to 
a fair trial 
cnn refused to hand over the tapes to hoeveler but did agree not 
to broadcast tapes of noriega talking to his lawyers until 
receiving some word from the supreme court 
noriega is accused of accepting 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin cocaine cartel he has been held at a federal 
prison outside miami since his surrender shortly after the us 
invasion of panama last december 
federal prison officials say inmates telephone conversations 
routinely are monitored except when the prisoners state that they 
are talking to their lawyers 
in addition to the emergency request cnns lawyers filed a 
formal appeal with the full supreme court that seeks to have the 
justices declare hoevelers order an unconstitutional prior 
restraint on free speech 
the networks lawyers said noriegas rights to a fair trial have 
been jeopardized by the governments taping of his conversations 
not by any cnn action 
gagging cnn will neither cure nor avoid any breach by the 
prosecution the lawyers said it will serve only to punish a 
news medium which has faithfully executed its constitutional role 
by reporting on criminal proceedings and allegations of unlawful 
government action 
a series of supreme court decisions has greatly limited judges 
power to issue such gag orders to safeguard fair trial rights 
in a 1976 decision the court unanimously struck down an order 
issued against the news media by a judge presiding over a nebraska 
murder case 
in that case the court said such prior restraints may be used 
only as a last resort and that judges always must first consider 
lessdrastic measures

supporters of israel are increasingly anxious 
that the bush administration has relegated its veteran ally to the 
sidelines of the persian gulf crisis to please its newfound arab 
friends allied against iraq 
as the standoff wears on israeli officials have complained 
about a lack of military cooperation with the united states and 
have made veiled threats that israel will not be left a sitting 
duck for iraqs missiles 
publicly us and israeli officials dismiss suggestions of an 
israeli preemptive strike and both governments agree theres 
nothing to be gained by israel taking on iraq but privately many 
concede the two countries priorities in the crisis differ 
substantially 
israels main aim is to crush saddam husseins military machine 
especially the air force and missile arsenals that he has 
threatened to use to launch chemical weapons and wipe out the 
jewish state 
us goals are less clear publicly the administration has 
defined its goals as quashing saddams aggression defending the 
regions vast oil reserves removing all iraqi forces from kuwait 
and restoring that countrys government privately us officials 
add another target destroying saddams most lethal weapons 
but israels supporters are worried that international pressure 
and an eventual compromise with iraq will force the united states 
to abandon the last goal 
theyll go home and well be left facing those missiles 
said one israeli official in washington who asked not to be 
identified 
israels supporters also worry that in the aftermath of the 
crisis the arab states that lined up with the united states 
against iraq will demand payment in the form of pressure on israel 
to give up lands it captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 
mideast war 
president bush fueled this fear several weeks ago when he 
suggested at the united nations general assembly that once the 
crisis is over solutions must be found to the regions other 
problems although he insisted later that he was not hinting at any 
link between the iraqi invasion of kuwait and israels occupation 
of arab lands israel supporters were not appeased 
a handful of meetings between bush and leaders of the jewish 
community in recent weeks have not set their minds at rest either 
we believe you dont sacrifice longterm interests for the 
sake of shortterm needs said malcolm hoenline executive 
director of the conference of presidents of major jewish 
organizations 
bush assured representatives of the group which is the umbrella 
for top american jewish leaders that the united states remains 
committed to its special relationship with israel 
at the meeting bush refused to promise he would veto a proposed 
antiisrael resolution at the united nations his administration 
has supported two resolutions condemning israel for the oct 8 
killings of 20 palestinians in a jerusalem riot breaking with the 
inviolate past practice of supporting israel at the world body 
i dont think the relationship has changed so much what you 
dont see now is the public embrace said one us official 
the sense of growing acrimony has caused both sides to back down 
a bit in recent days israel has agreed to accept a united nations 
factfinding mission urged on it by the united states and other 
united nations members and us officials have increased military 
cooperation with israel officials said they declined to discuss 
the nature of this cooperation 
in addition quiet efforts are under way to arrange a white 
house audience for israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir next month 
when he comes to the united states on a private visit 
bush and shamir have a strained personal relationship born of 
poor chemistry and ideological disagreements and officials on both 
sides would like to improve the atmosphere between the two men 
but the basic feeling that israel has been demoted in its 
alliance with the united states is pervasive among supporters of 
the jewish state 
what he has in mind is a noprofile role rather than a 
lowprofile one bush has decided israel should be a protectorate 
of the united states rather than a strategic ally said martin 
indyk director of the washington institute for near east studies 
the notion that israel should leave its defense in the hands of 
another country is anathema to the military doctrine of the tiny 
state surrounded by arab enemies which has made selfreliance a 
cornerstone of its existence 
israel is prepared to stay out of the usiraq confrontation as 
long as it has a basic understanding with the united states that 
its a silent partner not a silent pariah said indyk whose 
think tank is well plugged into israeli thinking

most states are acting quickly and well and 
effectively in approving antidrug laws says national drug 
policy director william j bennett but a congressional critic says 
bennett is not the person to judge 
bennett on thursday released a status report that listed which 
of 18 antidrug measures supported by the bush administration have 
been approved by each state 
the chart is not a ranking of the states and i would caution 
against concluding that a state with a lot of dots on this chart is 
necessarily better off than a state with a few dots said 
bennett who is resigning this month as director of the office of 
national drug control policy 
nevertheless the states getting the most praise from him 
generally had passed the most laws 
rep charles b rangel chairman of the house select committee 
on narcotics and a frequent bennett adversary dismissed the 
ratings 
while i believe the states should be held accountable for 
their drug control efforts i do not believe it should be done by 
bill bennett because he has no effective federal programs to point 
to the new york democrat said 
instead of trying to subtly rate states and coerce state 
legislatures into adopting director bennetts preferred state drug 
policies and procedures the drug czar should be offering technical 
assistance to help states develop effective antidrug strategies in 
a cooperative atmosphere 
bennett singled out nine states for praise texas florida 
pennsylvania michigan colorado oklahoma minnesota rhode island 
and new jersey all but texas and pennsylvania have adopted at 
least 12 of the 18 antidru laws checked for the status report 
but bennett criticized california which has passed 11 of the 
18 and new york which has approved eight california needs 
tougher drug sentences and new york needs tougher penalties for 
users he said 
both states which have decriminalized possession of small 
amounts of marijuana have major trafficking operations and drug 
consumption and they must do more he said 
bennett acknowledged that the laws checked may not be the best 
determinant of the effectiveness of a states war on drugs for 
example one measure concerned whether a state has boot camps for 
some drug offenders thirtytwo states do but two states he 
praised pennsylvania and rhode island do not 
the measures checked included whether the state 
requires eviction of drug offenders from public housing 
projects 
allows the seizure and forfeiture of drug traffickers assets 
has guidelines allowing private employers to conduct random 
drug tests on their workers 
has centers monitoring people for at least six months after 
they complete drug treatment to ascertain whether the treatment 
works 
states that have adopted six or fewer of the measures are 
alaska arkansas new hampshire north carolina north dakota 
vermont washington west virginia and wyoming plus the district 
of columbia 
those with 12 or more are colorado florida michigan 
minnesota new jersey oklahoma and rhode island the rest had 
seven to 11 
the status report also included each states per capita spending 
on drug treatment last year 
new york spent the most 8 per person next was connecticut 
with 457 rhode island 341 maryland 243 new jersey 
235 oregon 217 and florida 207 
spending the least were south dakota at 6 cents idaho and 
minnesota 7 cents alabama 21 cents maine 23 cents and west 
virginia 26 cents 
in all 23 states and the district of columbia spent less than 
1 per resident on drug treatment last year the report showed

should people stop using electric blankets 
because scientists suspect it may cause cancer or a miscarriage 
food and drug administration officials wont advise one way or 
the other 
but they will tell you that the studies while still 
inconsistent and inconclusive are getting more troubling 
even three years ago the fda said there was not enough evidence 
to be concerned but now the evidence is not as amenable to 
discounting said f alan andersen an official in the agencys 
center for devices and radiological health 
on thursday a divided fda advisory committee endorsed the 
agencys policy that recognizes the suspicious link between 
electric blankets and cancer and miscarriages but stops short of a 
public warning of danger 
we cant say there is no public health concern but we cant 
quantify it the risk anderson said 
panel members told the fda to continue working with industry to 
make manufacturing changes to reduce the very low frequency 
radiation emitted by electric blankets and to continue monitoring 
scientific studies 
anderson describes the evidence now as showing a suggested 
association between exposure to low levels of electromagnetic 
radiation and the possibility of adverse health outcomes 
including cancer and miscarriages 
while the risk cant be quantified it is prudent to reduce 
electromagnetic emissions for electric blankets just as the fda 
has been trying to do with video display terminals the panel 
agreed 
its too soon to regulate but its also too soon to walk 
away said panel member mary e moore associate radiological 
physicist at cooper hospital university medical center in camden 
nj im not convinced we have the data to say its totally 
safe 
the advisory committee on technical electronic product radiation 
safety standards voted 83 to endorse the fdas policy to work with 
electric blanket makers on reducing the levels of radiation 
then after one member left the others split 55 and rejected a 
motion that called for the agency to advise the public there was no 
scientific evidence of a public health risk 
edgar b dally vice president and general manager of cti 
cyclotron systems in berkeley calif said the evidence that 
points to a possible public health hazard are a series of flaky 
studies you cant add up garbage and get gospel 
the whole thing is getting out of control he said the 
possibility of mass panic is there 
the fda began working with the nations three electric blanket 
manufacturers last spring to reduce the levels of magnetic fields 
outside the blankets which is relatively easy and fairly 
inexpensive to do he said all three have cooperated and made the 
electrical changes 
however reducing the electrical component of the 
electromagnetic field is more difficult and may not even be 
feasible with electric blankets because of the heavier cord that 
would be required he said 
all appliances that are powered by alternating current emit some 
electromagnetic radiation but the fda has focused on electric 
blankets and video display terminals because these are the two 
products where both the intensity and duration of exposure for 
consumers generally is greatest 
current and future studies may show that other appliances and 
devices are more more harmful but until that is known the fda 
should be cautious anderson said

the soviet unions plight as winter 
approaches and the possibility of us bailout measures show how 
quickly history can alter events 
for 45 years the two superpowers viewed each other with icy 
suspicion on monday in paris they will sign a treaty that sets in 
motion the largest weapons cutback ever attempted by old 
adversaries 
and in washington bush administration officials are exploring 
ways to help the soviets get through the winter without 
embarrassing president mikhail s gorbachev the uneasy head of a 
oncepowerful empire now struggling not to collapse in disarray 
the contingency planning is based more on concern that internal 
disorders may escalate than on food shortages although they are 
severe administration officials told the associated press 
thursday 
its a tense moment and its anyones guess whether there is 
going to be some outandout confrontation an official said 
gorbachev is waging a difficult campaign to convert the soviet 
economy he was encouraged by the united states and other 
capitalist nations and really had no choice 
after more than 70 years of communism the soviet system was 
capable of ambitious space exploration programs and maintaining 
powerful armed forces but it could no longer put off it citizens 
demands for a better life 
gorbachevs transition to a westernstyle system has produced 
dislocation and hardships food rationing will begin next month in 
leningrad the countrys second largest city 
some smaller cities have lived with rationing for more than a 
year 
in moscow items such as sugar are restricted the city council 
is debating whether to issue coupon booklets 
the bush administrations estimate is that the soviets can get 
through the winter because the harvest was good and food imports 
are high 
the main problem the officials said is transporting the crops 
to market spoilage in the last few months was massive 
the food situation is always bad but it may not be worse this 
year said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
our best estimate is that they are going to muddle through 
soviet troops may be used to help get the food to the main 
population centers 
however the officials said internal unrest could send the 
country into a tailspin and the potential for destabilization is 
the main reason the administration is exploring ways to help out 
the bush administration has encouraged gorbachev to negotiate 
selfdetermination with the baltic states but apart from 
lithuania latvia and estonia the diverse soviet union also is 
being pulled apart by other nationalities trying to get out from 
under kremlin control 
and it is these strains that are contributing to gorbachevs 
plight as he pursues perestroika 
among the aid measures under consideration within the bush 
administration are emergency disaster relief airlifting food and 
medicine and dispatching technicians to help iron out 
transportation problems 
there is no decision yet to go ahead the officials stressed 
one question still being explored is whether aid can be extended 
through us domestic disaster relief programs another is whether 
congressional restrictions on assistance to communist countries 
pose an impenetrable barrier 
president bush is expected to discuss the situation with 
gorbachev during the 34nation summit meeting in paris next monday 
through wednesday 
earlier this year secretary of state james a baker iii invited 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze to draw up a list of 
problems in the soviet economy that us technical advice might 
help overcome 
no direct food or other assistance was contemplated at the time 
since then however the situation has grown more precarious as 
gorbachev redoubles his efforts to revamp the soviet economy and 
runs into resistance from consumers and bureaucrats 
baker in a major policy speech oct 19 warned that modernizing 
in the soviet union had also brought fragmentation standards of 
living are deteriorating he said shortages are spreading and 
the harvest is rotting freedom has unleashed ageold ethnic 
animosities 
we all must be understanding of the hardship a great people is 
now enduring he said 
meanwhile in weighing whether to provide an aid package 
policymakers in the bush administration must consider whether the 
gesture would aid or hurt gorbachev politically

millions of americans have been cheating the 
government out of billions of dollars a year by claiming 
nonexistent children and parents as dependents for tax purposes 
the internal revenue service says 
the year after congress required that children 5 or older have 
social security numbers the number of dependent exemptions dropped 
by 7 million below what had been predicted that brought in an 
extra 28 billion in taxes in 1987 alone the irs says 
returns filed by 11627 couples and individuals showed declines 
of seven or more dependents claimed from the previous year nearly 
67000 claimed four five or six fewer dependents than before in 
most cases the exaggerated claims had been made for several years 
the decrease is particularly significant because it seems to 
indicate that a 20year trend of increasing numbers of improper 
dependency exemptions has finally been reversed concluded irs 
researcher john a szilagyi 
the study indicated that most of the cheating was being done by 
single taxpayers and by married people who filed separate returns 
the number of dependents claimed by singles dropped 483 percent 
from 1986 to 1987 claims by married people filing separately 
declined 28 percent the number claimed by couples filing joint 
returns dropped 39 percent 
there was not nearly so much variance when the tax returns were 
divided into income groups those with income under 25000 showed 
a 7 percent decline in dependents claimed between 25000 and 
50000 the number fell 4 percent and those with income over 
50000 reported 49 percent fewer dependents than a year before 
returns filed for 1987 claimed 697 million dependents the irs 
had anticipated 767 million these figures do not include the 
personal exemptions allowed taxpayers and their spouses 
the irs began asking congress as far back as 1976 for authority 
to require social security numbers for children claimed as 
dependents but the idea was resisted for fear it would lead to a 
single number by which a big brother federal government could 
trace the finances of any citizen 
by 1979 the number of improperly claimed dependent exemptions 
had grown to 82 million or 112 percent of those claimed the irs 
said but congress would not agree to the change until it 
overhauled the tax system in 1986 
the law has been amended twice since for returns filed in 1991 
any child 2 or older must have a social security number as part of 
the deficitreduction plan enacted earlier this month congress 
lowered the age to 1 starting with returns filed in 1992 
the irs is not through with those taxpayers who were found to 
have exaggerated their claims for dependents over a period of 
years 
the agency checked a sampling of 838 such taxpayers whose 
returns had been audited by last may and found that 89 percent of 
them had been hit with tax increases averaging 2200 about 4 
percent of those cases are facing the possibility of criminal fraud 
charges

the job took six months instead of three but 
nasa is nearly finished checking out the various systems on the 
hubble space telescope and is preparing its instruments for science 
use 
the science verification phase will run into next year it 
involves comparing the hubbles pictures of stars taken above the 
atmosphere with photos taken from the ground 
that enables astronomers to adjust readings from the hubbles 
five instruments much as a motorist checks his speedometer against 
highway markers and compensates for differences 
during the orbital verification phase now nearing completion 
the national aeronautics and space administration discovered that 
one of the telescopes mirrors was ground to the wrong 
specifications and that the spacecraft develops an annoying shudder 
whenever it passes from sunlight to darkness 
when we first started to plan the mission the orbital 
verification was expected to last three months said jim elliott 
spokesman for the goddard space flight center because of the 
problems with the mirrors aberration and the jitter we havent 
been able to accomplish all we hoped to in that time 
j keith kalinowski head of the telescope science management 
office at goddard said the entire calibration process had been 
expected to take nine months instead he said it may take 15 to 
18 the hubble was released from the space shuttle discovery in 
april 
despite its problems the hubble has returned better images than 
some of those made from the ground among them are the clearest 
pictures yet of pluto the farthest planet from the sun in the 
solar system and its moon charon 
hubble also photographed saturn in more detail than has been 
possible from the ground but short of the clarity achieved by the 
passing voyager spacecraft 
a galaxy seen only as a fuzzy ball by telescopes was found to be 
so tightly packed with stars that it may harbor a black hole at its 
center the galaxy is about 40 million light years away and 
contains about 30000 stars in an area of only about nine light 
years 
we primarily lost the sensitivity and ability to detect very 
faint objects said kalinowski roughly speaking if i were 
able to detect an object of a certain brightness at a given

supporters rang cow bells as the lone 
swiss entry in the world solar challenge crossed the finish line 
friday to win the 1800mile race 
the solarpowered car resembling a giant pinkandblue 
cockroach took the lead on the first day of the competition after 
leaving darwin on australias north coast 
the spirit of biel steadily stretched its margin on the 
stuart highway across the countrys arid outback midsection 
it finished at a resort south of adelaide more than 250 miles 
ahead of secondplace honda the prerace favorite which was not 
expected to complete the course until saturday the cars race only 
nine hours a day 
three cars japans hoxan corp and us entries university of 
michigan and western washington university were battling for 
third place 
the swiss car averaged about 38 miles per hour and finished in 
an unofficial time of 46 hours and 23 minutes that was 1 hours 
off the record set by general motors sunraycer in the inaugural 
race three years ago 
the car was entered by the bienne school of engineering the 
team finished third in 1987 after suffering a collision near alice 
springs which almost put them out of the race 
this proves we are not just a country of chocolate and 
cheeses leo renggli the swiss consulgeneral in melbourne said 
as he and 200 other people met the winners 
biel team leader fredy sidler said the energy consumed by the 
car over six days was equivalent to about 1 gallons of gasoline 
he said it gave the team a great deal of pleasure to eclipse the 
performance of the giant multinational motoring companies in the 
race 
its not their fault they are big and we are small but we 
proved the standard of technology we have is really at the highest 
level sidler said 
the swiss car might have broken the record except the first day 
was plagued by rain and overcast conditions that delayed the start 
and slowed the field torential downpours later forced some teams 
to cover their cars 
the 36team entry list included 11 cars each from australia and 
japan eight from the united states and one each from canada 
switzerland germany denmark new zealand and england 
there were only three official dropouts although a couple of 
cars were reported to have traveled only 125 miles they have five 
more days to officially finish the race 
the stuart highway runs through some of the worlds most 
desolate countryside temperatures regularly surpassed 100 degrees 
as the cars cruised through the arid land with no signs of 
civilization for stretches of 190 miles

spiraling energy prices brought on by the 
turmoil in the persian gulf have sent inflation skyward in recent 
months and now threaten to deepen the economic downturn gripping 
the us economy analysts say 
its taking money out of peoples pocketbooks they dont 
have enough purchasing power to boost sales and keep the economy 
moving said donald ratajczak director of economic forecasting at 
georgia state university 
its depressing the economy added irwin kellner chief 
economist at manufacturers hanover trust co in new york 
private analysts will have a better handle on the nations 
inflation outlook with the governments release today of the 
consumer price index for october 
in advance of the labor departments report many economists 
were predicting a rise of between 06 percent and 07 percent in 
october or the equivalent of an annual rate of nearly 7 percent 
that would follow the 08 percent jumps in consumer prices that 
hit american consumers in both august and september 
analysts pinned both of those sharp increases squarely on 
soaring energy prices that followed iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait and another sharp rise today would also be blamed on the 
persian gulf standoff 
on thursday president bush called business leaders to the white 
house to discuss the nations economic problems and possible ways 
to ease the pain of any economic downturn while the administration 
has stopped short of saying the nation has entered a recession 
many analysts say it has happened 
on the inflation front analysts say the only thing keeping the 
current outbreak from worsening is the sluggishness of the us 
economy 
now that the economys slowing down that alone should cool 
things off said peter radford chief analyst at national 
westminster bancorp in new york 
the oil situation has not been able to ripple out through the 
rest of the economy because the economy is in recession said 
kellner of manufacturers hanover 
an economic slowdown holds down inflation because retailers find 
it hard to raise prices in the midst of a recession analysts said 
sales are hard to get anyway so this is not a time to be 
raising your prices radford said 
earlier this week the commerce department reported that retail 
sales grew by just 01 percent in october and in fact would have 
declined had it not been for the increase in gasoline prices 
analysts said consumer prices excluding the volatile food and 
energy components or the socalled core rate of inflation 
probably increased 04 percent in october 
last week the labor department reported that the producer price 
index for finished goods one stop short of retail jumped 11 
percent in october but the same report showed that slowing 
economic growth held wholesale price growth for nonfood and 
nonenergy items to zero 
analysts predicted that in coming months inflation may start 
easing a bit if war does not break out in the gulf because the 
worst of the oil shock will be over 
oil prices appear to be stabilizing barring war oil prices 
probably will slow substantially after todays report ratajczak 
said

more us warships and planes will use existing 
military bases in this small citystate in what may be the first of 
a new type of security arrangement in southeast asia 
less costly and more flexible than massive installations like 
subic bay and clark field in the philippines the new arrangements 
could provide lowprofile us access to facilities without the 
political complications of establishing american bases 
host governments would come under the us military umbrella and 
local economies would be buoyed by spending by the visitors 
washington would be able to sustain forces in the western 
pacific and indian ocean reducing reliance on the philippine 
bases leases on the philippine bases expire next year and talks on 
their future are under way 
the united states and singapore said the agreement signed 
tuesday was concrete evidence of the determination of the united 
states to retain a military presence in southeast asia for the 
foreseeable future 
under negotiation for more than a year the accord was signed in 
tokyo by vice president dan quayle and singapore prime minister lee 
kuan yew they were attending the enthronement of emperor akihito 
the united states will not pay singapore directly for increased 
use of the facilities but the presence of more us servicemen is 
expected to help the singapore economy 
officials stress that no new bases will be built the us air 
force is to make greater use of paya lebar airport and us navy 
ships will call more often at sembawang 
paya lebar outgrown as the main civil airport was converted to 
military use in 1981 sembawang was a royal navy dockyard in 
british colonial days 
permanently assigned us navy support personnel are to increase 
from 20 to about 95 an extra 75 americans will rotate through with 
each air force deployment they will stay in existing military 
housing 
when the agreement was signed a battle group led by the 
aircraft carrier independence was in port after a tour of duty in 
the persian gulf 
air force fighters based in south korea held two joint exercises 
named cope sling with singapores air force earlier this year 
before leaving tokyo wednesday quayle said talks with the 
philippines over keeping us bases there were likely to conclude 
on a mutually agreeable basis 
its just not the case that bases in singapore will 
substitute for those in the philippines quayle said 
this is not a substitute for that nor do we envision any 
transfer of the bases in the philippines to singapore he said 
but in manila diplomatic sources said us and philippine 
negotiators appear headed for an arrangement somewhat closer to the 
singapore plan with the united states maintaining a reduced 
presence at bases that would come under philippine control 
washington already has announced plans to withdraw all tactical 
combat aircraft from clark next year 
asian diplomats and us officials say washington has been 
trying to negotiate similar access agreements in brunei thailand 
and malaysia 
a senior state department official said in july during the 
annual association of southeast asian nations meeting that brunei 
already had offered access asean members include brunei 
indonesia malaysia singapore the philippines and thailand 
brunei is also prepared for an enhanced security 
relationship said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity bruneian officials confirmed that talks had taken place 
but would not elaborate 
unlike singapore which inherited an array of airfields 
dockyards and other military installations from the british brunei 
has little on hand but money is usually no object to the absolute 
monarch of the oilrich sultanate 
until brunei stepped forward singapore was the only country in 
southeast asia that openly backed a continued us military 
presence officials in several other capitals express private 
support but in public stress they are nonaligned 
malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad said recently that his 
country was willing to repair us navy ships as well as those 
from other countries on a commercial basis and had no objection to 
joint training operations 
indonesian armed forces spokesman brig gen nurhadi 
purwosaputro said wednesday that his nation does not object to the 
new ussingapore agreement 
as long as the agreement is limited to the use of facilities 
we are not worried about it if the accord deals with the use of 
military bases then we object nurhadi said 
vietnamese officials in the late 1970s also said they provided a 
facility not a base when the soviet navy used installations at 
cam ranh bay built by the united states during the vietnam war 
the staterun vietnam news agency sunday quoted vietnamese 
leader nguyen van linh as saying us ships could return to cam 
ranh bay if ties were normalized between hanoi and washington

a new public school in a blighted 
neighborhood is being turned over to a corporation that will run it 
for profit in its own unusual fashion no grades no desks and a 
phone in every classroom 
we have an opportunity to change education in america and 
were going to use all the strength and love and energy we have to 
make it happen pat parham principal of the stilluncompleted 
south pointe elementary school told an overflow crowd of about 150 
teachers at a meeting last week 
educational alternatives inc which operates private schools in 
paradise valley ariz and eagan minn plans to open south 
pointe with 550 students next fall and run it for five years dade 
county school officials approved the plan this summer 
eai director kathryn thomas said the school will create an 
atmosphere that celebrates learning by reducing studentteacher 
ratios to 121 tossing out multiplechoice exams and letting 
students pursue personal goals at their own pace 
south pointe wont have desks but it will have computers 
classroom telephones will let students call their parents during 
school hours to share their successes 
what weve done is try to empower children thomas said 
learning becomes contagious when everybody is actively involved 
in the process 
some local educators expressed skepticism about such a program 
in an area where about 95 percent of the families qualify for 
public assistance many students come from broken homes and drug 
abuse and violence are common 
i hope its not as idealistic as it sounds this area is 
tough said lourdes fernandez who teaches second grade at 
another local elementary school 
but frank petruzielo dade countys associate school 
superintendent said there is no reason to believe that only 
traditional educational theories work 
everybodys got an idea and an opinion on how to improve 
public education he said this was a novel opportunity to let 
people put their money where their mouth is 
eai charges 4500 tuition at its schools in minnesota and 
arizona south pointe which is being built with dade county funds 
will get no additional public funding that means eai will have to 
pay for extra learning materials and make its profit from the 
450000 it hopes to raise privately 
the school also has applied for a threeyear 230000 nabisco 
foundation grant to face one of its biggest challenges encouraging 
parents many of whom speak no english and have little formal 
education to get involved 
we want our parents to learn how to be parents parham said 
were trying to hire a person to go into the homes and train the 
parents on how to work with their children 
eai also hopes to recruit student advocates including 
senior citizens and people in business to provide students with 
daily encouragement 
weve got to be able to respond to all their survival needs 
without it well just be spinning our wheels said linda lentin 
the lead teacher at the school 
jana diconstanzo a single mother says she is more than willing 
to give the new school a chance she has her 5yearold son 
francis enrolled in a private preschool 45 minutes from her home 
but plans to enroll him at south pointe next year she said other 
public schools in the area are too dangerous 
this is going to be a real blessing to me she said i 
think they need something new down here

war women and the bible occupied 
deliberations of us roman catholics bishops in the closing 
session of their annual fall meeting 
as the national conference of catholic bishops ended its session 
thursday the bishops presiding officer dispatched a 
handdelivered letter to the white house telling president bush 
that offensve military action in the middle east at this point 
could violate church principles about war 
the church leaders adopted standards for bible readings in 
worship services that would not stereotype firstcentury jewish 
attitudes toward jesus and would be more inclusive of women 
the bishops also signaled their determination to keep trying to 
produce a temporarily stalled pastoral teaching letter on womens 
role in the church and society 
bishop joseph l imesch of joliet ill head of a committee 
that has worked on the letter for seven years said it still is 
alive and well 
the work continues he told the gathering i want to erase 
any doubt about the future of the committee or the pastoral 
letter 
possibilities were seen for action on it next year or the year 
after but imesch added wryly if we arent done by 1999 we all 
quit 
following widespread criticism that past drafts were 
inconsistent in upholding equal opportunities for women but 
reaffirming their exclusion from the priesthood action on the 
letter at this meeting was put off the vatican suggested that 
other national bishops conferences be consulted about it 
imesch told reporters that it would be a miracle if the main 
stumbling block the tension between the equality principle and 
church barrier to womens ordination could be overcome 
asked if bishops as one of the few exclusively male 
organizations left in the country felt uncomfortable in trying to 
define the place of women he said theres a great deal of 
uncomfortability 
he added much womens input has come through hearings across the 
country 
in the floor discussion auxiliary bishop francis p murphy of 
baltimore said the extensive discussion has raised consciousness 
in the church and the country and thrown light on the equal or 
unequal experience of women in the church and society 
meanwhile imesch confirmed reports that comments from the 
vaticans doctrinal congregation had accompanied the suggestion to 
delay the letter but the contents had not been released 
some other bishops most of whom asked not to be identified 
said they had heard the vatican message criticizes the letters 
defense of womens rights in regard to husbands 
auxiliary bishop thomas j gumbleton of detroit said he had 
heard some of it is so bad they dont want to see it let out 
in the letter to bush archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of 
cincinnati the conference president said of the persian gulf 
crisis 
we urge our government and our allies to continue to pursue 
the course of peaceful pressure and not resort to war 
he said a military offensive now could well violate the 
churchs ageold just war criteria requiring that objectives 
justify the human costs that it not target civilian areas and that 
resort to it comes only after all reasonable peace efforts have 
failed 
the bishops also approved a document on observance next year of 
the 500th anniversary of the coming of europeans to america 
recognizing both good and bad results and expressing determination 
for better ways in the future

imad abu sneineh is an arab who no longer knows 
whom to fear most the palestinians are after him because his 
father sold property to a jew and now he has been knifed by a 
jewish extremist 
i never believed i would be stabbed by an israeli abu 
sneineh said thursday as he recovered in the hospital i thought 
to myself tens of thousands of times that i may be stabbed by an 
arab because my father sold his home to ariel sharon 
in fact the house in jerusalems moslem quarter was bought by a 
jewish religious organization sharon the hardline former defense 
minister moved in after arab attackers killed two israelis in the 
moslem quarter december 1987 
jewish real estate purchases from arabs are shrouded in secrecy 
and it is not known whether sharon owns or rents the house 
abu sneineh 31 lives across from sharon with his wife and two 
young children but it doesnt win him any privileges he says 
police stop and search him every day 
israelis say arabs sell because they get good prices but the 
leaders of the palestinian uprising call them traitors 
abu sneineh says he saw no money from the sale but he no longer 
dares to pray at the al aqsa mosque on fridays now that he has 
been denounced as a collaborator in a leaflet put out by uprising 
leaders 
he says friends have turned their backs and he wishes he could 
talk with sharon 
maybe he would give us arms to protect ourselves from arabs 
he said 
sharons spokesman could not be reached for comment 
i go out in the morning and i dont believe i will return home 
these days he said i kiss my kids as if i was going and not 
coming back 
on wednesday abu sneineh was outside the butchers shop where 
he worked in the ultrareligious bukhran quarter of jewish west 
jerusalem waiting for his jewish employer to close up and drive 
him home 
a religious jew walked up and slashed him from shoulder to belly 
with a knife he said 
he always came to the store to threaten arabs swore at the 
arabs but i didnt believe he would do something like this he 
said i thought he wanted help to ask prices but he took out a 
knife and slashed me 
the employer mordecahi mizrahi tried to shield abu sneineh and 
he too was hospitalized with stab wounds in his hands 
police say the man attacked abu sneineh after mizrahi refused 
his demands that he fire the arab the assailant said he was 
against arabs working in israel newspapers said 
i worked for israelis i was their friend and they mine 
they stabbed me and slashed me what did i do abu sneineh said 
but abu sneineh says it will not affect his good relations with 
jews but he doesnt think he will return to the butchers shop 
as he talked he leaned out of the window at hadassahein karem 
hospital smoking a cigarette and occasionally wincing from the 
pain of his wound 
what am i supposed to think he said i hate my life 
i dont even know why my father sold the apartment he died 
and with him his truth but the arabs dont let us forget his 
mistake he said

every day after the evening television 
newscast iranians are told which of their numerous coupons they 
can exchange for modest rations of cooking oil meat rice and 
detergent 
the 8year war with iraq which sapped irans resources ended in 
august 1988 and tehran is earning a windfall from higher oil prices 
caused by iraqs invasion of kuwait 
but shortages persist and the economy remains sluggish despite 
strenuous efforts by president hashemi rafsanjani to revitalize it 
thats a major setback for rafsanjani leader of irans 
socalled pragmatists and his drive to consolidate power by 
improving conditions for the countrys 55 million people 
hes trying to liberalize the economy while improving relations 
with the west to attract badly needed investment and technology 
his radical rivals bitterly oppose his strategy alleging it 
deviates from the revolutionary ideals of the late ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini who died last year 
earlier this week the government pushed a plan through 
parliament to seek 175 billion in foreign loans a move the house 
had resisted even during the war 
the government is under continual pressure to alleviate 
shortages boost output and free iranians from the economic 
hardship they have endured since the 1979 islamic revolution 
last month hasan alhoseyni a member of parliament from the 
city of arak complained that irans deplorable economic conditions 
have brought everincreasing pressure to bear on societys weak 
and middle classes 
he demanded action and declared no other issue must 
overshadow this important task 
the farsilanguage bayan monthly said the first problem 
facing the government in its attempt to improve the state of the 
economy and to lessen the pressures on the underprivileged masses 
is inflation 
iranian consumers know about inflation 
salaried workers earning a monthly average of 70000 rials 
1000 at the official exchange rate cannot keep up with runaway 
prices 
in tehran a months salary is hardly enough to pay the rent for 
a onebedroom apartment buy two meals for four at a good 
restaurant or even one car tire 
earlier this year a survey by the genevabased national 
statistics organization listed tehran with a population of about 7 
million as the worlds most expensive city 
the center reported that living costs for an average urban 
family last year were 18 million rials 26000 more than double 
the average annual income 
borrowing which accounts for about onequarter of the current 
budget soared along with prices irna reported it quoted isshaq 
jahangiri deputy chairman of parliaments planning and budget 
committee as saying borrowing had to be increased to supplement 
shortfalls in revenue he gave no figures 
since the persian gulf crisis triggered by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 sent oil prices shooting up iran has been earning 
an extra 33 million a day in precious foreign exchange 
but jahangiri said that windfall still falls short of the 15 
billion in oil revenue projected in the budget 
in a bid to revive the postwar economy rafsanjani has 
announced a record 30 billion budget for the current iranian year 
which ends march 21 the budget is the first phase of his 112 
billion fiveyear plan 
but four months before the end of the year the budget has been 
revamped because most of its projections were not realized 
jahangiri said that a large chunk of the deficit was due to the 
governments inability to collect taxes which were to account for 
40 percent of revenue

jesse jackson says the japanese should regard 
black americans as fellow victims of ignorant prejudice and invest 
some of their wealth in black enterprises 
africanamericans have a special relationship with you as 
third world people jackson said in a thursday night speech to 
the japan commerce association 
he said many white americans are upset with both blacks and 
japanese 
they are angry at the japanese for buying up america the 
same kind of stereotype they used to have of jewishamericans is 
now transferred in many ways to japanese and they are now angry 
at blacks for sharing in the remaining jobs he said 
jackson a twotime unsuccessful presidential candidate was 
elected last week to a shadow senator post from the district of 
columbia in the unpaid position he will lobby congress for 
district statehood 
his invitation to speak to the japan commerce association an 
organization of washingtonbased japanese corporate 
representatives follows a remark by japans justice minister 
seiroku kajiyama last september that prostitutes moving into a 
tokyo neighborhood had the same effect as blacks moving into a 
neighborhood in america 
both kajiyama and prime minister toshiki kaifu apologized but 
many outraged blacks said kajiyama should have been ousted from the 
kaifu cabinet 
jackson said corporate japan should show more sensitivity to the 
plural makeup of the united states and to the spending power of 
the us black community by holding a summit with leading 
blacks on investment and economic development 
jackson said such meetings would be a better way to get results 
than insults and picketing of the japanese embassy 
he said also that the japanese should invest in the us urban 
crisis the problem of decaying and drugridden inner cities 
populated by many poor minority americans

hildegard behrens sang the title role in the 
metropolitan operas first presentation of richard strauss 
salome on thursday saving her voice at the beginning so she 
could pour it out at the end and not so much dancing the dance of 
seven veils as twirling around 
in many ways this production of salome works against the 
opera its a big blackwalled basement with a pit where john the 
baptist is held upstairs on balconies and in windowed rooms 
decorated with pagan frescos are seen people in lavish party 
dress 
the impact of the wickedness of salomes mother herodias is 
lessened because of the general decadence being conveyed helga 
dernesch sang herodias well and looked sophisticated in a chic gown 
and sleek blonde hairdo 
salomes adolescent sexual awakening to an inaccessible man 
isnt conveyed 
richard cassilly was excellent as herod his voice often had an 
appropriate hollow tone 
james conlon was conducting the opera at the met for the first 
time at the beginning behrens sounded thinner than she does in 
wagner operas and one wondered if strauss textured orchestration 
was drowning her out later as her high notes pealed out it 
became clear that she had been holding back 
ekkehard wlaschiha sang john the baptist with ringing tones 
after he pushed salome away during their first meeting he began to 
sing with personality as well when he sang from down in his pit 
he sounded muffled like fafner the dragon in wagners 
siegfried 
tenor peter zazaras in his debut season at the met made a 
strong impression as narraboth the young man who loves salome but 
stabs himself in horror at her excesses 
behrens wears the pink dress with fluffy sleeves of the 
production two years ago but doesnt lift off chiffon panels of the 
skirt one by one as her veils which did look silly she lifts off 
one panel twirls around holding it then takes off and flings the 
whole dress leaving her in a white gown with short sleeves 
also she falls on the floor at the end guards dont rush in 
and crush her with their shields 
the good thing about this salome was the performance of the 
music

paul wellstones first meeting with sen jesse 
helms is likely to be a little tense 
i have detested him since i was 19 and moreover i think he 
won against harvey gantt on a blatantly racist campaign period 
its true said wellstone elected last week as minnesotas 
junior senator 
the senate is something of a club and members rarely attack each 
other personally wellstone a liberal democrat has spent the week 
opening friendships that will be critical to his success in the 
senate 
but he has made it clear in media interviews that he does not 
like helms the archconservative north carolina republican who 
last week defeated gantt to win a fourth term gantt the former 
mayor of charlotte is black 
wellstone first heard helms while studying at the university of 
north carolina in the 1960s and has despised him ever since 
the new lawmaker said in an interview with the philadelphia 
inquirer last week 
helms who has never met wellstone responded thursday with some 
advice for the new senator 
i hope that he will prove to be somewhat more stable 
otherwise hes going to have a difficult time in the senate

the republican national committee is firing a 
fourth of its staff but party officials say the reduction is a 
normal beginning for a nonelection year 
we gear up in the even years and we gear down in the odd 
years said mary matalin rnc executive director the committee 
has about 270 fulltime employees 
bj cooper communications director for the committee said a 
comparable staff reduction occurred four years ago after the 1986 
midterm elections 
matalin and cooper denied published reports the cutbacks were 
forced by a disappointing fundraising year or were ordered by 
white house chief of staff john sununu 
were 100 percent supportive of their effort to shift gears 
said ed rogers white house political director there was no 
instruction to do anything out of here its part of a longstanding 
plan the white house was informed of it on an fyi basis the day 
before yesterday 
the rnc had an operating budget for 1990 of 26 million and 
raised more than enough to cover it 
at the democratic national committee spokeswoman ginny terzano 
said no immediate cutbacks are planned but the dnc is a much 
leaner operation with only 100 fulltime employees 
the democrats raised just over 10 million in 1990 including a 
record 27 million wednesday night at the partys annual gala

canadian researchers say those wanting a 
glimpse of what would happen if the earth warms from the greenhouse 
effect should look at ontario canada 
portions of the province are plagued with increased forest 
fires less snow warmer lakes and fewer trout they say though 
not from the greenhouse effect 
lakes monitored for more than 20 years in northwestern ontario 
have been slowly changing as temperatures rise snowfall declines 
and fires ravage nearby forests scientists at the canadian 
department of fisheries and oceans report today in the journal 
science 
while the study does not claim that the changes are due to the 
greenhouse effect the groups leader dw schindler said the 
changes could be a preview of what is to come if the earth does 
warm up 
this is by no means the only period that has warmed for a 
prolonged time or at the rate that were seeing schindler said 
our point is to show what increasing warming and drying 
which we would see with a greenhouse effect would do to lakes and 
their watersheds 
the greenhouse effect refers to global warming that is caused 
when the atmosphere is enriched with carbon dioxide and some other 
gases that affect the movement of solar radiation and heat the 
socalled greenhouse gases allow sunlight to pass through the 
atmosphere and strike the earth but the gases can prevent heat 
from radiating back out into space thus trapping thermal energy 
about the planet 
an increase in carbon dioxide is related to the burning of 
fossil fuels such as coal and oil

lockheed corp says it will appeal a jurys 
453 million award to three employees who claimed they were 
wrongfully fired for questioning the safety of the defense 
contractors mammoth c5b cargo plane 
a superior court jury made the award thursday to clyde w jones 
jr 62 terrence f schielke 50 and thomas e benecke 48 
the three said they were dismissed in 1985 after questioning the 
structural stability of the plane now being used to ferry troops 
to the persian gulf 
we believe the punitive damages are an injustice and come as a 
result of appealing to the passions and prejudice of the jury 
said lockheed attorney gordon krischer the evidence doesnt 
warrant this verdict 
krischer said the planes were checked by the air force and found 
to be safe 
former lockheed chairman lawrence o kitchen testified the men 
behaved unprofessionally in going outside the company to obtain 
independent metallurgical tests on the c5b 
he said that jones had already elected to retire before lockheed 
officials learned of the employees concerns schielke and benecke 
were fired for circumventing company policies and audit procedures 
kitchen said 
i just wonder what else is wrong with the rest of their 
airplanes said juror jackey grundman 
each of the plaintiffs was awarded 15 million in punitive 
damages awards for compensatory damages and emotional distress 
totaled 202065 for benecke 91660 for jones and 82789 for 
schielke 
eric julber who represented benecke said the award sends a 
message that you shouldnt fire people for raising safety 
concerns 
the frames were cracked warped twisted schielke said 
thursday and instead of scrapping them they went ahead and used 
them because it would have put them so far behind schedule to scrap 
them that the defense department would not have bought the 
planes 
herbert hafif attorney for jones and schielke said four planes 
built with defective mainframes are being used to ferry troops to 
saudi arabia 
our next move is to ask the congress to investigate this he 
said 
jones was a senior quality control inspector at lockheeds 
marietta ga plant on loan to california installations in burbank 
and palmdale schielke was an auditor at burbank and benecke an 
auditor at palmdale 
jones lives in tennessee schielke lives in lancaster calif 
and benecke in thousand oaks calif 
financial analysts said lockheed can afford to cover the award 
the calabasasbased aerospace company has an estimated 100 
million cash on hand and is expected to generate profits this year 
of 315 million said securities analyst lawrence m harris of 
bateman eichler hill richards

found in a common grave last month may have been killed by members 
of the military 
the interior minister gen jorge torres aciego told reporters 
thursday that the government would try to investigate to find out 
who was responsible and will severly punish them whether it be 
the navy army or the air force 
local farmers said they discovered the bodies in a common grave 
in the remote mountainous area of chilcahuayco 9 miles northeast 
of ayacucho

detained by the armed forces in an antiterrorist operation in late 
september 
farmers reported the find to the ayacucho district attorney on 
oct 17

the emergency zone status of the city of ayacucho on oct 24 but 
the area around the city remains under military control

former defense secretary michael heseltines bid 
to replace prime minister margaret thatcher was boosted today by an 
opinion poll that showed support for a change in leadership 
the survey showed that if heseltine replaced mrs thatcher as 
leader of the governing conservative party which would 
automatically make him prime minister the tories would shoot to a 
10point lead over the opposition labor party 
the poll conducted by market and opinion research international 
and published in the times of london showed that if mrs thatcher 
remained party leader and prime minister the conservatives would 
trail labor their main challenger by four points 
the tories have trailed labor in opinion polls for the past 16 
months the next general election by law must be held by mid1992 
but the prime minister can call one any time before that 
the british domestic news agency press association said the 
polls findings represent an enormous boost for mr heseltines 
chances of wresting the leadership from mrs thatcher 
heseltine 57 on thursday formally submitted his bid for the 
leadership of the conservative party 
he will challenge the 65yearold mrs thatcher in a secret 
ballot tuesday among the 372 conservative legislators in the house 
of commons it is the first serious challenge to her leadership 
since she took office in 1979 
to win tuesday a candidate needs 50 percent of the votes cast 
and have at least 15 percent more than the runnerup 
a second ballot if necessary would be held on nov 27 and 
other candidates are free to come forward the winner needs only to 
get a majority 
the opinion poll was based on facetoface interviews with 1088 
people after the close of nominations for the conservative or 
tory leadership on thursday heseltine was the only nominated 
challenger 
the poll showed 49 percent of the respondents would support the 
conservatives if heseltine became leader compared with 39 percent 
for labor and seven percent for the liberal democrats the other 
five percent was split among smaller parties 
if mrs thatcher survives heseltines challenge labor would 
have 45 percent support tories 41 percent and liberal democrats 
10 percent according to the poll it did not state a margin of 
error 
another newspaper the independent reported today that a survey 
of londonbased japanese investors showed 54 percent would be more 
inclined to buy shares in british companies if there were a new 
tory leader the survey was conducted by the securities house 
nomura 
mrs thatcher who won general elections in 1979 1983 and 1987 
said on thursday she intends to fight for the job she was 
responding to a labor legislator who held up a 5yearold newspaper 
in which shed promised to quit in 1990 
heseltine reported to be a millionaire resigned his cabinet 
post as defense secretary in 1986 in a cabinet dispute over how to 
save the ailing westland helicopter company 
in an interview thursday with independent television he said he 
was inspired to challenge mrs thatcher following speech in the 
house of commons tuesday by sir geoffrey howe 
howe who resigned as deputy prime minister on nov 1 
criticized mrs thatcher for her opposition among european economic 
community leaders to more rapid pace for european unity 
discord has been building in the conservative party for more 
than a year partly over mrs thatchers attitude toward ec 
policies other problems include interest rates of 14 percent 
annual inflation of 119 percent and a percapita poll tax that 
sparked widespread rioting earlier this year 
heseltine has promised to order an immediate review of the tax 
if he wins he has also pledged to introduce what he calls caring 
capitalism to replace mrs thatchers rigorous freemarket 
policies which critics say benefit the rich at the expense of a 
growing number of the poor

president mikhail s gorbachev today promised a 
shakeup in the military leadership and defended his plan to rescue 
the collapsing economy and prevent rebellious republics from 
breaking away 
it was not immediately clear why gorbachev was calling for the 
shakeup and he did not elaborate in his speech to lawmakers in the 
supreme soviet legislature 
he denied he had lost the support of the army as one legislator 
implied after a meeting between the soviet president and deputies 
serving in the military 
the official tass news agency said gorbachev told legislators 
that there would be personnel changes in the higher commanding 
echelons of the armed forces and documents were being prepared for 
submission to the legislature 
gorbachev also said that in the near future he would nullify 
decisions by union republics and local governments that denied 
soldiers and their families civil rights particularly in the 
independenceminded baltic republics 
he was responding to legislatures in several republics that deny 
some civil rights to members of the soviet military and curtailed 
the draft in regions seeking independence 
the soviet leader denounced what he called vile rumors that 
the country would suffer from cold and starvation during the 
upcoming winter and rejected the idea of a coalition government 
with the russian federation 
no more defensive action it is high time to launch an 
offensive gorbachev said delivering a report to the supreme 
soviet at the demand of rebellious deputies 
gorbachevs report came as he was losing support from former 
loyalists the current moscow news a weekly that has been a 
supporter of his reforms urged him to either prove your ability 
to take decisive actions or resign 
at your demand you were given additional powers the 
publications founders said in an open letter to gorbachev 
today you can either use them for establishment a dictatorship 
or for deepening democratic perestroika a dictatorship will lead 
you and the whole country to ruin 
gorbachev rejected accusations that the central government had 
no plans to combat the deteriorating economic and political 
situation and ethnic strife we have a concrete program and it 
must be fulfilled 
although the economic picture was bleak gorbachev rejected 
vile rumors that the country will be hungry and cold he 
explained that the problem lay in the delivery system and that 
there was ample food in the country to meet reasonable demands 
his speech came a day after leningrads city council voted to 
join a growing list of soviet cities rationing food 
bowing to demands by legislators for a report on his meeting 
with russian federation president boris n yeltsin last weekend 
gorbachev said their discussions were routine 
he said sharing power with only the russian federation would be 
unfair to the other republics in a coaltion government if 
russian leaders take over it will mean discrimination against the 
other republics gorbachev said 
instead he repeated his call for a country unified by a new 
union treaty spelling out the relationship between the central 
government and the republics 
we dont need political leaders who stimulate separatism and 
nationalism we need help to consolidate the country gorbachev 
said 
referring to his meeting with yeltsin the soviet leader said 
it was just routine people said it was a sensation but it was 
just regular work 
the two leaders discussed the union treaty that would hold the 
15 republics together in a single country and gorbachev said he 
gave assurances that russian economic interests would be taken 
into account in any agreement 
all but one of the republics have declared some sort of 
sovereignty from the kremlin and gorbachevs plans for developing a 
market economy hinge on the republics staying in the union 
the supreme soviet session today was attended by most leaders of 
the 15 republics union leaders and members of gorbachevs advisory 
council 
there was no live television or radio coverage of gorbachevs 
report 
the soviet leader agreed on wednesday to address the legislature 
after delegates angry about the slow pace of reform abandoned 
their agenda on wednesday and demanded a report on the state of the 
union and his meeting last weekend with yeltsin 
many republics especially russia are disregarding laws passed 
by the national legislature and decrees adopted by gorbachev and 
the council of ministers or soviet cabinet 
according to tass legislators at the supreme soviet became 
rebellious wednesday and refused to discuss bills suggested from 
above until a new treaty on relations between the kremlin and the 
republics is concluded

water so foul that parents wont let their babies 
drink it soil so tainted that it can no longer be saved air so 
deadly that each breath is a step toward respiratory disease and 
life expectancy is cut short 
the hazecovered land once called east germany is every bit the 
environmental disaster that it has long been believed to be a new 
study says 
the united german governments first comprehensive look at its 
new territory gives a bleak overview of the ecological wasteland 
left behind by the communists and the daunting challenge of 
repairing it 
right now the easts environment poses a considerable health 
threat to the population environmental minister klaus toepfer 
said in berlin 
about 10 million of the lands 16 million people have drinking 
water that is at times or permanently of harmful quality he 
said 
toepfer said the government will spend 86 million this year 
toward cleaning up the land but that a massive longterm effort 
is needed to eliminate its myriad health hazards 
we now have to build up an information network and draw up a 
list of priorities he said at a news conference thursday 
coinciding with the release of the 158page report 
among the findings 
about 1000 of the former nations 7565 villages have drinking 
water so high in nitrates that infants are routinely given bottled 
water 
almost half of the rivers and lakes are so polluted that they no 
longer can be processed for drinking water 
only 3 percent of the rivers and 1 percent of the standing 
water such as lakes and canals are considered ecologically sound 
only 38 percent of the household sewage is treated before it is 
dumped into canals 
toepfer said that more than 40 percent of the ground is 
considered spoiled and huge areas in industrial regions are so 
contaminated that the topsoil would literally have to be trucked 
away for the land to be salvaged 
the report says eastern germans are more likely to live shorter 
lives than their western countrymen 
according to 1985 data east german men had a life expectancy of 
695 years about 25 years below that of west german men women 
had a life span of 715 years seven years below the average in the 
west 
east germany had the most productive industrial economy of the 
old east bloc but the former leadership paid virtually no 
attention to environmental concerns 
most of the cars trabants had heavily polluting twocycle 
engines wastewater went untreated farmers used fertilizers and 
pesticides at twice the rate as their counterparts in the west the 
report says 
sewage and wastewater dumping and the use of inorganic 
fertilizers have created serious groundwater contamination the 
report says 
perhaps no single factor has spoiled the air more than the use 
of brown coal or lignite which was mined in east germany and is a 
major source of energy for industries and homes 
lignite is responsible for the heavy concentrations of sulfur 
dioxide and dust in the air which has caused extremely high rates 
of bronchitis and asthma particularly in children the report 
says 
the heavy industrialized southern cities of former east germany 
are the hardest hit with 20 percent higher rates of respiratory 
ailments than in the north it said 
factories had few if any pollution controls a major factor in 
the lack of interest among western investors in taking over the 
vast majority of the former staterun enterprises 
high lead content was found in vegetables and fruit grown in 
industrial areas and in the blood of people living there 
pcbs heavy metals dioxins and other toxic materials have been 
found in high quantities in air and water it said

iraq has invited international inspectors 
to verify it is not developing weapons at its nuclear research 
sites as tension in the persian gulf rises an international atomic 
energy agency spokesman said today 
the united nations agency inspects iraqi and other nuclear 
facilities at sixmonth intervals under the nonproliferation 
treaty that prohibits the spread of nuclear technology for 
nonpeaceful use 
iraqs representative to the iaea rahim alkital told the 
agencys directorgeneral hans blix three weeks ago that the 
doors were open for a routine inspection at the countrys four 
nuclear research sites spokesman hansfriedrich meyer said 
the last inspection was in april speculation had arisen that 
baghdad might prohibit visits after the agency suspended technical 
assistance in line with un sanctions following iraqs invasion of 
kuwait aug 2 
with the suspension still in effect meyer declined to say in a 
telephone interview whether agency inspectors would tour iraqs two 
research reactors storage and fuel producing facilities 
al kital could not be reached for comment 
the last inspection found no evidence iraq was putting uranium 
at its nuclear facilities to military use an agency statement 
said 
iraq has repeatedly denied allegations by western media and 
israel which bombed iraqs tammuz1 reactor in 1981 that it is 
developing nuclear weapons

the international atomic energy agency says iraq 
has invited its inspectors to verify that iraqs small stock of 
enriched uranium has not been made into an atomic bomb the new 
york times reported today 
the move by iraq as seen as a signal that it does not intend to 
use a nuclear weapon in the persian gulf crisis the newspaper 
said 
the uranium in question a 276pound orangesize mass 
consisting of 93 percent pure uranium 235 was salvaged from iraqs 
osirak nuclear reactor after it was destroyed by an israeli 
warplanes in 1981 the times said 
iraq obtained the uranium from france in 1976 to operate the 
reactor on condition the fuel would be subject to inspection by 
international officials 
there has been concern the highpurity uranium could be easily 
made into one primitive bomb the times reported such a bomb would 
have little military value but could be used for a sensational act 
of terrorism the paper said 
iraq is a signer of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty that 
binds signers to renounce the possession or use of nuclear weapons 
and to submit to regular inspections of its uranium by 
international atomic energy agency officials 
such inspections have been carried out every six months and no 
violations have been detected the times reported 
hans meyer a spokesman for the agency in vienna told the 
newspaper that iraqs ambassador to austria rahim alqital 
invited the agency to conduct a new inspection meyer would not 
disclose when the agency will inspect the fuel

nasa lost radio contact with magellan 
again this time for about 40 minutes and also had to suspend 
the spacecrafts mapping of venus for nearly a day to adjust its 
main antenna ever so slightly 
the break in radio contact early thursday was the third time 
contact with the craft was lost and engineers still havent found 
the cause nasa said 
after engineers reestablished radio contact they discovered 
the crafts main antenna was pointed slightly away from earth it 
cannot transmit its maps and radar images of venus unless the 
antenna is pointed precisely toward earth 
scientists spent much of thursday readjusting the antenna which 
was off a scant 1 degrees nasa said 
it was not immediately why the antenna was out of alignment 
nasa said 
magellan was launched from space shuttle atlantis in 1989 on a 
744 million mission to send maps and radar images of venus back to 
earth it lost radio contact with nasa for 11 hours on aug 16 and 
17 hours on aug 21

seven peace campaigners headed for iraq today to 
set up peace camps on the saudikuwaiti border to stand as 
voluntary human shields in the event of a us attack 
we are well aware of the consequences of our actions but this 
is a point of principle in the traditions of gandhi said pat 
arrowsmith a 60yearold peace campaigner who left with the group 
for amman jordan 
the military forces will have to cross our camps and may even 
kill us if they want to fight she said 
miss arrowsmith said iraqi authorities told the group that it 
would be welcome 
the campaigners hope to drive from baghdad and select camp sites 
on both sides of the border between iraqioccupied kuwait and saudi 
arabia where us and other forces have assembled 
it is our intention to select sites in key points which will 
prevent the movement of war material and forces said miss 
arrowsmith adding that other peace protestors will join them once 
the camps were established 
we dont know how many people will eventually be present but 
it could be hundreds it is a very strong peace movement she

leading us and european community 
officials opened talks today likely to focus on a farm subsidy 
policy dispute that has stalled world trade negotiations the 
persian gulf crisis was also high on the agenda 
us secretary of state james a baker iii headed the american 
delegation for a second meeting this year with officials of the 
12nation trading bloc 
we hope that we will find at least a mechanism or process 
for moving forward the discussions baker told reporters thursday 
aboard his flight to brussels 
even before the meeting began us trade representative carla 
hills and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter made stops in 
germany and france to urge some compromises 
weve got a stalemate and weve got a problem mrs hills 
said thursday shortly after her arrival in brussels 
it would be difficult to maintain international cooperation on 
issues ranging from the environment to the persian gulf crisis 
if you are at each others throats over trade issues she said 
the officials were expected to discuss the gulf and economic aid 
to jordan egypt and turkey those countries have been hardhit by 
the international trade embargo imposed on iraq after it invaded 
kuwait aug 2 
their agenda also included discussions on eastern europe 
at issue in the trade talks is a demand by the united states and 
other agricultureexporting countries that the ec make sharp cuts 
in its expensive farm subsidy programs the community has so far 
offered to make only modest reductions 
the dispute has threatened to scuttle the uruguay round of trade 
negotiations an ambitious fouryear effort to revamp the world 
trading system and reduce barriers to trade in 14 other areas 
including textiles manufactured goods and services such as 
banking and telecommunications 
the talks which began in 1986 in punta del este uruguay are 
due to end with a final week of bargaining in brussels starting 
dec 3 
but the communitys refusal to promise heftier subsidy cuts has 
raised doubts about whether the round can be completed 
successfully 
mrs hills warned that international tensions would rise if the 
uruguay round fails 
we would be headed into a period of much greater friction 
she said 
the ec recently proposed to reduce subsidies on major farm crops 
by 30 percent over 10 years some of the cuts have already been 
made 
the bush administration has asked for cuts of 75 percent in farm 
income supports and 90 percent in export subsidies over a decade 
beginning next year 
the united states is pushing agriculture reform because it hopes 
that lowering trade barriers will enable its farmers to sell more 
goods on the world market other farmexporting countries like 
argentina and australia also would like a chance to export more 
the ec however contends it needs its array of agriculture 
supports to protect its 10 million farming community many of whom 
have small operations 
industrialized nations spent 251 billion on agricultural 
subsidies last year according to estimates from the organization 
for economic cooperation and development the community accounted 
for 975 billion and the united states 672 billion 
ec members are belgium denmark france germany greece 
ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands britain spain and 
portugal

premier ante markovic says 
yugoslavia faces dictatorship or disintegration unless its 
quarrelsome republics agree to his liberal economic and political 
reforms 
markovic told parliament on thursday that the countrys crisis 
has reached such proportions that the countrys existence is 
drastically in question 
his reforms including privatization of the economy and the 
lifting of import and foreign investment restrictions have angered 
the hardline leadership of communistled serbia the largest 
yugoslav republic 
serbias staterun press has accused markovic of being a western 
agent and of wanting to turn yugoslavia into a banana republic 
the noncommunist governments in the western republics of 
slovenia and croatia which advocate transforming yugoslavia into a 
loose association of nearindependent states are wary of the 
croatian technocrats insistence on keeping yugoslavia united as a 
federation 
last month serbia undermined markovics reform by unilaterally 
abolishing yugoslavias common market and introducing duties on 
goods from slovenia and croatia 
the two independentminded republics recently have changed their 
constitutions setting the stage for possible secession from the 
current federation of six states and two provinces 
markovic said unconstitutional policies of slovenia 
croatia and serbia inevitably led to the worsening of political 
tension in yugoslavia and most directly jeopardize the countrys 
existence 
he accused the republics of carrying out policies which 
evidently lead to the breakup of the country or the 
introduction of dictatorship 
he did not elaborate 
we must face the fact that we are seen from abroad as one of 
the most crisisridden regions in europe while foreign leaders 
consider that yugoslavia is on the brink of breakup and civil 
war markovic said 
he said only a united and democratic yugoslavia would be 
accepted into an alleuropean political and economic system 
markovic prime minister since march 1989 introduced reforms 
last december that have throttled runaway inflation and pulled 
yugoslavia from the brink of bankruptcy 
the reforms won praise from western creditors but sideeffects 
were a sharp drop in industrial output and closure of many 
unprofitable companies that threatens to push up unemployment 
already a hefty 19 percent 
initial optimism that markovics popularity could overcome the 
growing political crisis evaporated in the face of continued 
feuding between politicians and ethnic groups 
markovic said yugoslavia would need 25 billion more from 
foreign creditors next year in order to implement his policies 
yugoslavia already owes 16 billion to western banks and 
governments 
markovic criticized serbia for illegally withholding 250 
million in contributions for the federal budget

authorities investigating a jetliner 
crash that killed all 46 people aboard including seven americans 
say it could be several months before the cause of the disaster is 
fully known 
officials thursday cited pilot error and technical failure as 
possible causes of the wednesday night crash as the alitalia dc9 
approached zurich international airport en route from milan italy 
radar data showed the plane was flying about 990 feet too low 
alitalia and swiss officials said there was no explanation yet for 
the low altitude 
zurich airport spokesman andreas meier said radar data suggest 
the pilot misjudged his altitude 
alitalia officials on italian television speculated the planes 
electronic navigation system failed 
swiss transporation department spokesman ulrich sieber said 
investigators may need several months to compile and publish their 
report on the inquiry 
at least seven americans were aboard the plane according to the 
airline and us embassy officials 
the embassy in bern identified the american victims as karol 
forman paul vaughan and william briggs of new york state john 
stuckey and jerry bass of north carolina robert anderson an 
american resident of switzerland and stephen ritter of north 
carolina no hometowns were given 
the embassy had no further details early today 
the nationalities of four victims were still undetermined the 
airline said 
pope john paul ii offered condolences to the victims families 
the plane crashed into a steep wooded hillside broke up and was 
gutted by fire zurich police official eugen thomann said all 
victims likely died on impact 
witnesses said the pilot seemed to gun the planes engines just 
before impact about 12 miles northeast of central zurich some 
witnesses reported seeing fire and hearing explosions while the 
plane was still in the air 
rain on thursday hampered investigators inspecting the debris 
about 300 rescue and police officials recovered bodies and cleaned 
up 
since victims were burned beyond recognition positive 
identification could take weeks zurich police spokesman hansrudolf 
suter said 
police said the the jets two flight recorders or black 
boxes were found thursday and will be sent to an english lab for 
evaluation one recorder tracks flight data and the other tapes 
cockpit conversation 
meier said terrorism was not ruled out but stressed there was 
no immediate indication the plane was a target 
alitalia said the twoengine dc9 built in 1974 was last 
inspected 10 days before the crash

milli vanilli the dreadlocked pop duo whose 
debut album sold 7 million copies could become the first act to be 
stripped of a grammy after it was learned they didnt sing a single 
note on the record 
if theres been a substantial fraudulent misrepresentation 
of the entity i think there is a high likelihood that the academy 
would have to take some action said michael greene president of 
the national academy of recording arts amp sciences the academy 
administers the grammy awards 
he said the academys action could include taking back the 
groups 1989 grammy he said no one has ever been stripped of a 
grammy in its 33 years 
frank farian the german producer who turned a pair of anonymous 
pretty boys into an international phenomenon revealed in an 
interview this week that hunky dudes fab and rob robert pilatus 
and fabrice morvan were actually the fabulous bunko boys 
farian said the barechested vocalists once described by the new 
york times as exotically sexy did nothing more than look good 
and lip sync for videos and tv and concert appearances while others 
did all the singing 
the record company never knew that i never told them 
anything said farian later on after the record was out 
there were some people who raised some questions 
the vanillis won a grammy for best new artist and rob and fab 
became international stars girl you know its true and blame 
it on the rain were both huge hit singles for the band at the 
mtv awards the boys boasted they were better than elvis or bob 
dylan 
farian would not say who the real singers were but added that 
they will appear on his next album not a milli vanilli album 
he said wednesday he was forced to go public with the 
revelations when the boys told him they wanted to sing on the 
followup to girl you know its true 
i said no i dont go for that sure they have a voice 
but thats not really what i want to use on my records said 
farian 
in a statement thursday the two said they have been ready 
willing and able to record our own vocals and have been prevented 
by frank farian from doing so 
and in an interview with the los angeles times pilatus called 
farian a control freak who would not allow us to enter the 
studio 
hes a white german guy who has a big complex about black 
artists said pilatus a black native of germany 
the last two years of our lives have been a total nightmare 
weve had to lie to everybody he said we are true singers 
but that maniac frank farian would never allow us to express 
ourselves 
we were afraid for two years that this day would come 
pilatus said weve cried about it sometimes but deep inside 
we wanted it to happen pilatus said he and morvan planned to 
sing on their next album 
the revelation didnt bother arista the label that raked in the 
cash when girl you know its true topped the charts 
seven million albums embarrassing asked roy lott vice 
president for operations i dont mean the end justifies the 
means but we sold 7 million albums 
according to farian the idea to hire rob and fab as front men 
for the band came to him when the pair arrived at his studio in 
germany shortly after the recording of girl you know its true 
it suddenly clicked in my mind and it was kind of evident i 
had the music there were the people who wanted to perform 
outside said farian and i said hey lets put that 
together and make a great record out of it 
lott said the label is unconcerned about the dupe and it plans 
to distribute farians new album 
as for rob and fab their futures a bit more uncertain 
we are purely their distributor we do not have a specific 
deal with rob or fab lott said 
the los angele times said sources have suggested that a dallas 
native charles shaw was one of the singers on the milli vanilli 
albums in a telephone interview from germany shaw told the times 
once you hear me sing and then you have the milli vanilli record 
in your hand even if i told you it wasnt me singing you wouldnt 
believe me 
do i resent that milli vanilli made so much money and all i 
got was studio fee in the beginning i was very very upset 
shaw said but i put it to the side and at the present moment i 
plan to succeed on my own

the national council of churches has 
demanded that the united states pull its troops out of the persian 
gulf and work for a peaceful settlement of the iraqkuwait crisis 
the only troops that should stay in the region are those whose 
presence is requested by the united nations the council said in a 
resolution adopted unanimously thursday at the groups convention 
we stand at a unique moment in human history when all around 
us seemingly impregnable walls are being broken down and deep 
historical enmities are being healed the council said and 
yet ironically at such a moment our own nation seems to be poised 
at the brink of war in the middle east 
the council also called on iraq to release all foreign citizens 
held hostage in iraq and kuwait and to withdraw its troops from 
kuwait 
it said president bush and the congress should use every means 
to reach a peaceful settlement including direct negotiations with 
iraq 
the council represents about 42 million americans from 32 
denominations including many of the nations largest mainstream 
christian churches 
also thursday the group decried family violence as sin and 
called on christian communities to actively protect women and 
children from victimization at the same time the council 
confessed that past inaction by church leadership has sustained 
the injustice of family violence 
family violence is an epidemic in western postindustrial 
societies where it is considered a birthright by some men the 
statement said in some cases it said even interpretations of 
scripture support the notion of males right to control and 
chastise others

china announced today that it will devalue its 
currency nearly 10 percent beginning this weekend the countrys 
second devaluation in less than a year 
the state administration of exchange control said the 957 
percent devaluation will be effective saturday according to the 
official xinhua news agency 
as usual xinhua waited until after the close of the banking day 
to make the announcement and officials could not immediately be 
reached for comment 
xinhua quoted the state administration of exchange control as 
saying the devaluation is part of the effort to deepen the 
countrys economic and monetary reform and accelerate economic 
development 
the last devaluation took place in december 1989 and was by 212 
percent 
currently the old buying price is 471 yuan to the dollar and 
the selling price is 473 yuan after the devaluation saturday it 
will cost 521 yuan to buy one dollar and the selling price will 
be 524 yuan 
countries usually devalue their currency to make their products 
cheaper on world markets and improve their trade balance however 
china has been enjoying a large trade surplus due to stringent 
import controls 
chinas currency which is not convertible on world money 
markets is widely believed to be overvalued the new rate is still 
slightly below that used on the black market

a suspected ira bomber reportedly had his first 
meal today after 37 days on a hunger strike 
the home office which oversees britains prisons refused to 
confirm that desmond ellis had eaten but said no prisoner in the 
london prison system was on a hunger strike 
desmonds father noel ellis said his son would end his strike 
today 
the younger ellis had refused food to protest his extradition 
from ireland to britain where he faces trial on charges arising 
from a 1981 irish republican army bombing campaign that killed 
three people 
the supreme court of ireland ruled wednesday that the 
38yearold television engineer culd be extradited to britain and 
ellis was flown immediately to london 
noel ellis said he visited his son thursday in south londons 
brixton prison 
my son has been on hunger strike now for 37 days in an attempt 
to prevent his extradition to this country where he will face the 
same system and the same courts which sentenced the guildford four 
and the birmingham six to imprisonment noel ellis told 
reporters 
four people known as the guildford four were released in 
october 1989 after prosecutors told the court of appeal that 
police had lied about some evidence in the case 
the home office responsible for law and order recently ordered 
a new appeal hearing for six men jailed for two birmingham pub 
bombings in 1974 because of evidence that police may have 
falsified some evidence in that case 
ellis is the first ira suspect to be extradited under irelands 
1987 extradition law 
extradition has been a contentious issue between britain and 
ireland under the previous law some suspects wanted in britain 
have beaten extradition by arguing that their alleged offenses were 
political 
ellis has already served a sixyear jail term in ireland for 
possessing explosives 
the ira is fighting british rule in northern ireland it wants 
to unite the predominantly protestant province with the 95 percent 
roman catholic republic of ireland under a socialist government

the soviet unions top middle east negotiator 
says the world community must try to avoid war in the persian gulf 
by agreeing to a conference on the palestinian question if iraq 
withdraws from kuwait 
yevgeny primakov a member of the presidential council that 
advises soviet president mikhail s gorbachev reiterated the 
kremlins desire to avoid a military conflict in the persian gulf 
at a news conference in new york thursday he said saddam 
hussein should be given the opportunity for a facesaving 
withdrawal from kuwait 
the united states is expected to circulate a un security 
council resolution by the end of november that would authorize 
force to drive iraq from kuwait diplomats said thursday 
but in an interview with the new york times primakov said on 
thursday that the security council should not be pushed into 
adopting such a resolution while negotiations with iraq are being 
pursued 
iraq invaded its small oilrich neighbor on aug 2 in a dispute 
over oil money and land iraq later annexed kuwait and sent its 
army to occupy it 
primakov who has made two trips to baghdad to meet with iraqi 
officials spoke before receiving an award from the citizens 
exchange council for promoting better ussoviet relatons 
in a later speech to the council he proposed a flexible 
linkage between iraqs withdrawal and a conference to resolve the 
israelipalestinian dispute we could inform him about our 
intentions to take steps toward an international conference he 
said 
saddam has demanded that a withdrawal from kuwait be linked to 
establishment of a palestinain homeland president bush has 
rejected placing specific conditions for an iraqi withdrawal but 
said other issues could be discussed after a pullout 
as part of arranging a political solution to the gulf crisis 
primakov also proposed establishing a scheme of regional 
security that would include limits on iraqs chemical weapons 
arsenal and the withdrawal of the usled multinational military 
force opposing iraq 
bush recently has bolstered us forces in saudi arabia saying 
the troops must be capable of launching an offensive us 
officials say they intend to add about 200000 soldiers to the 
230000 already there 
the soviet union in the past has indicated it might approve of 
military action against iraqi forces under a un command if 
peaceful measures fail 
but primakov said on thursday that we must do everything 
possible to force a withdrawal everything in our power for a 
political solution 
the alternative is a military solution that would have 
terrible consequences not only in loss of life but in further 
destabilizing the region he said

seven people headed today for iraq where they 
planned to set up peace camps on both sides of the kuwaitisaudi 
border in an effort to prevent fighting from breaking out 
we are well aware of the consequences of our actions but this 
is a point of principle in the traditions of gandhi said pat 
arrowsmith a 60yearold peace campaigner who left with the group 
for amman jordan 
the military forces will have to cross our camps and may even 
kill us if they want to fight she said 
miss arrowsmith said iraqi authorities had told the group it 
would be welcome in baghdad 
the campaigners hope to set up camp sites on both sides of the 
border of iraqioccupied kuwait and saudi arabia where us forces 
and troops from 25 other nations have assembled since iraqs aug 2 
invasion of the emirate 
the 300000 strong force which includes 230000 american 
soldiers faces 460000 iraqis deployed in kuwait and southern 
iraq 
it is our intention to select sites in key points which will 
prevent the movement of war material and forces said miss 
arrowsmith 
she said that other peace protesters including former pop 
singer cat stevens now known as yusuf islam would join them 
once the camps were established 
we dont know how many people will eventually be present but 
it could be hundreds it is a very strong peace movement she 
said 
the activists were identified as arrowsmith of britain jean 
dreze of belgium bela bhatia of india bassam fattal of ghana 
richard crump of britain john steel of britain and a fourth briton 
of lebanese origin identified only as saadallah

simon amp schusters decision not to publish a 
novel containing graphic scenes of violence has opened the door for 
other publishers who have expressed interest in the book the 
authors representative said 
publicist amanda urban said she was negotiating with several 
other publishers interested in bret easton ellis latest novel 
american psycho she would not elaborate 
the publishing house announced wednesday it was canceling plans 
to print ellis third novel 
ellis 26 said simon amp schuster lastminute decision not to 
publish the novel which depicts a serial killer who mutilates 
women amounted to censorship he accused the publishing house of 
bowing to pressure from its parent paramount communications inc 
simon amp schuster spokeswoman barbara reno said the company would 
not comment on ellis charges 
ellis said the decision means the end of his relationship with 
simon amp schuster which published his previous novels less than 
zero and the rules of attraction 
chairman richard e snyder told the washington post he learned 
of the violent contents of the book only recently and said editors 
who bought it made an incorrect decision 
it was i who decided we should not put our name on this book 
its a matter of taste snyder said he said he was not pressured 
by paramount 
ellis rejected snyders explanation 
i think it would have been a matter of taste if this had been 
raised or discussed 12 months ago not after jackets were 
printed up the book typeset 250 bound galleys made he said 
american psycho had a january publication date and was 
scheduled to be shipped to stores next month 
the book which includes graphic passages of women being 
dismembered and cannibalized was criticized recently in spy and 
time magazines 
ellis said the reviews verged on the hysterical and focused 
on 40 pages of the 400page novel 
i think it distorted what the book is really about and in some 
strange way gave the impression that i was endorsing this kind of 
violence which if you read the book is clearly not the case he 
said 
urban said ellis gets to keep his advance a source involved 
with the contract who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
advance was 300000

daniel ortega today likened the us 
military buildup in the persian gulf to the us invasions of 
grenada and panama and accused washington of applying a double 
standard when it comes to human rights 
the former nicaraguan president criticized the united states for 
backing un resolutions in support of occupied kuwait while doing 
little to enforce resolutions calling for israel to withdraw from 
occupied territories 
how come for them human rights apply to some people but not 
the others asked ortega who arrived wednesday on a fourday 
visit 
there have been scores of un resolutions on israels 
occupation of paestinian land these resolutions should be 
implemented too if there is to be a comprehensive settlement in the 
region 
the official iraqi news agency reported earlier that ortega 
supported saddam husseins proposal aug 12 for a simultaneous 
settlement of his invasion of kuwait and the israeli occupation of 
palestinian territories 
the united states which leads a multinational force of more 
than 350000 troops arrayed against iraq since its aug 2 invasion 
rejected the linkage 
ortegas criticism of the united states was expected washington 
supported the contra reels who fought ortegas leftist sandinista 
government throughout most of the 1980s ortega was defeated in 
february elections by a presidential candidate supported by the 
united states 
speaking of the us gulf deployment ortega said my country 
has suffered from the same policy when they tried to undermine the 
sandinistas 
referring to the 1983 us invasion of grenada and the 1989 
invasion of panama he said the invasion of grenada and the 
intervention in panama are also other examples of the policy of 
hegemony 
on friday ortega met with foreign minister tariq aziz and 
national assembly speaker sadi mehdi saleh the iraqi news agency 
reported it said saleh told ortega that iraq wants the gulf crisis 
resolved peacefully 
but if the forces of evil attempt to ignite war then iraq 
will be forced to fight back the agency quoted saleh as saying 
it said during his two separate meetings with saleh and aziz 
ortega expressed support of iraq in its drive to liberate the 
region from american hegemony 
ortega met on thursday with saddam baghdad television said they 
discussed third world countries that are trying to combat us 
hegemony

reporters withheld their bylines today in a 
show of unity as an evening strike deadline neared at the san 
francisco bay areas three biggest daily newspapers 
talks between the san francisco chronicle san francisco 
examiner and san jose mercury news and about a dozen unions 
representing 4500 employees recessed late thursday and were 
scheduled to resume early today 
the two sides took up wages thursday after agreeing on 
noneconomic issues at the newspapers which have a combined 
circulation of more than 1 million the unions threatened to strike 
at 5 pm if a new contract is not reached 
workers represented by the newspapers unions include reporters 
and editors drivers and press operators most of the unions 
contracts expired in february 
the newspaper guild which represents the reporters asked 
members to begin withholding their bylines from stories today and 
practically all writers names were gone from early editions of the 
san francisco chronicle 
among those missing was herb caen whose popular and 
idiosyncratic column has appeared in san francisco papers for more 
than 50 years there was little chance readers would fail to 
recognize his whimsical style and skyline logo 
my name doesnt appear at the top of this column today because 
theres talk of a newspaper strike and we scribblers are showing 
our solidarity and our dedication to the guild by withholding our 
most precious possessions our bylines caen wrote at the bottom 
of the column if you didnt notice good for you 
the unions are seeking raises of 20 percent the top scale pay 
for reporters at all three papers is 800 per week 
the 20 percent request was high but youve got to start 
somewhere said doug cuthbertson chairman of the union umbrella 
organization 
richard jordan chief negotiator for the san francisco newspaper 
agency which prints the chronicle and examiner would not indicate 
how much of an increase it was willing to provide 
neil chethik chairman of the newspaper guild for the mercury 
news said the unions set a strike deadline just before the holiday 
season on purpose 
our leverage on the newspaper is the holiday season when ad 
revenues are usually up he said 
the morning chronicle with weekday circulation of about 
560000 publishes jointly with the examiner on sunday for a 
combined circulation of about 725000 the afternoon examiner has a 
weekday circulation of about 138000 
the san jose mercury news has a weekday circulation of about

elevation to head of government fifteen legislators abstained and 
the rest were absent 
the vote was taken after an acrimonious sevenhour debate 
between supporters of vp singh whom chandra shekhar replaced as 
prime minister last week and supporters of the new government 
a new political climate has to be created chandra shekhar 
said before the vote let us stop calling each other names at 
this moment we should try to agree to work together i want 
everybodys cooperation 
singh was brought down amid political and religious conflicts 
about 390 people have been killed across india over the past 
four weeks in hindumoslem riots and clashes between police and 
hindu fundamentalists seeking to build a temple on a site in 
northeast india already occupied by a mosque 
six people were killed in new delhi on wednesday the first time 
the current wave of religious violence has struck the capital when

singh lost a vote of confidence nov 7 after chandra shekhar led 
a breakaway faction of the governing janata dal party and joined 
hands with the congress party of former prime minister rajiv 
gandhi 
the dissident faction of the janata dal called the janata 
dalsocialist has barely 10 percent of seats in parliament but 
the backing of gandhis congress party which has the support of

seeking gandhis support for ensuring his survival

the first major ussaudi 
arabian military exercise with the ominous name imminent 
thunder began its second day today shrouded in secrecy 
by military standards the sixday exercise including a mock 
amphibious invasion is relatively small but its name and the 
sudden announcement that it was already under way heightened its 
importance at a time of uncertainty in the persian gulf 
before the exercise started iraq on wednesday denounced it as 
a clear act of provocation close to the iraqi border that 
demonstrated americas aggressive intentions 
the name imminent thunder raised speculation about whether a 
real military operation was imminent this was reinforced by the 
recent prediction in a french magazine that an offensive would be 
launched on nov 17 the first moonless night after the us 
elections 
us navy spokesman cmdr jd van sickle said the exercise was 
not intended to provoke the iraqis and insisted the name had no 
particular significance 
the purpose is to give participating forces training in joint 
and combined operations and to enhance amphibious warfare skills 
he said exercise imminent thunder is part of our desert shield 
training 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said thursday the main 
amphibious landing exercise was being held about 100 miles south of 
the kuwaiti border he also said that as part of imminent thunder a 
smaller group of marines was conducting a training exercise about 
25 miles south of the emirates frontier 
approximately 1000 us marines 1100 aircraft and 16 ships 
including the aircraft carrier uss midway which arrived in the 
region earlier this month are participating in the exercise along 
with an unspecified number of saudi forces 
training will consist of the amphibious landing expected 
sunday with air cover and close air and naval support of ground 
forces no live ammunition is to be fired 
the exercise began under a news blackout but the military said 
pool media coverage was being planned for the weekend 
the participants represent about 1 percent of the 230000 
americans and 100000 servicemen from 25 other countries deployed 
in the gulf following iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
nonetheless it is the largest use of aircraft in a single 
training exercise in operation desert shield it is also the first 
mock amphibious assault in saudi arabia following three previous 
exercises in neighboring oman and bahrain 
if desert shield is to be effective either defensively or 
offensively its numerous arab and western military contingents 
must be coordinated effectively 
only two weeks ago secretary of state james a baker iii and 
king fahd of saudi arabia agreed on command and control of all 
troops 
inside the kingdom there is now joint ussaudi command 
outside the kingdom the united states will command its own forces 
but it must receive the kings permission to launch an attack from 
saudi soil 
president bush has said he wants to wait for un trade 
sanctions against iraq to force baghdad out of kuwait but he has 
also voiced impatience with president saddam husseins 
intransigence 
bush who will visit troops on thanksgiving day recently 
doubled the number of us aircraft carriers in the gulf region to 
six he is also sending 200000 additional military personnel to 
give desert shield an offensive capability 
earlier this week british defense secretary tom king and 
abdullah bishara secretary general of the gulf cooperation 
council also warned iraq there was a limit to the patience of the 
allied forces 
the exercise includes units of the us army navy air force 
and 1000 members of the 4th marine expeditionary battalion as well 
as the royal saudi air force and naval and marine units 
staff sgt maceo wylie 42 of columbia sc with the armys 
528th medical psychological detachment said it was important for 
the allies to train together because thats the only time you 
know who you can rely on in combat 
but army 1st sgt mickey kershaw 37 of west islip ny said 
the exercise was a waste of time he said it would be far 
better to attack saddam now than do it five years from now when 
this guy nukes me and the family i might have

maneuvers near the kuwaiti border today and secretary of state 
james a baker iii was in europe for talks that will include the 
persian gulf crisis 
president bush leaves today to join baker for further 
discussions with allies then spend thanksgiving with us soldiers 
in saudi arabia it would be the first presidential visit to 
frontline troops since the vietnam war 
iraqi president saddam hussein suggested a peaceful solution was 
still possible and indicated he could release western hostages if 
bush promised not to attack iraq an offer the united states has 
rejected before 
us officials were gauging international reaction to a possible 
un security council resolution authorizing force to drive iraq 
from kuwait some diplomats said the resolution could come by the 
end of the month 
the soviet unions top middle east envoy yevgeny primakov told 
the new york times on thursday the introduction of such a 
resolution should be delayed to give time for talks on a 
facesaving iraqi withdrawal from kuwait he said those talks 
could include discussion of the palestinian question 
about 1000 us troops and an unknown number of saudi soldiers 
were taking part in the sixday imminent thunder maneuvers 
which began thursday also involved were about 1100 aircraft and 
16 ships including the aircraft carrier uss midway no live 
ammunition was to be used 
the iraqis denounced the exercise as a clear act of 
provocation but a us navy spokesman cmdr jd van sickle 
said it was purely for training he said the code name had no 
particular significance 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said on thursday the main 
amphibious landing exercise expected sunday would be held about 
100 miles south of the kuwaiti border he said also under imminent 
thunder a smaller group of marines was conducting a training 
exercise about 25 miles south of the kuwaiti border 
bush is scheduled to travel to europe and the mideast on the 
eightday trip he is to spend thanksgiving in saudi arabia base 
for the 300000strong multinational force deployed against iraq 
after its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the last us president to visit frontline forces was lyndon 
johnson during the vietnam war in 1967 
in a cable news network interview thursday bush said he wanted 
to send a signal to saddam that we are deadly serious about 
getting iraq out of kuwait 
before heading to the middle east bush was to meet on the gulf 
crisis with leaders of the soviet union britain and france at a 
threeday paris gathering of the 34nation conference on security 
and european cooperation 
in particular us officials said bush planned to sound out 
members of the 15member un security council on the wording of a 
proposed resolution to authorize force against iraq 
an aide to baker said the united states would like to introduce 
the resolution this month while its diplomat still presides over 
the council yemen a proiraqi council member will hold the 
presidency for december 
baker was in brussels belgium today for trade talks with 
representatives from the 12nation european economic community 
also on the agenda was aid to jordan turkey and egypt which have 
suffered most under the unbacked trade embargo against iraq 
saddam meanwhile said iraq still seeks a peaceful solution 
iraq for its part sees that the right way to go is the 
course for peace and that peace should be comprehensive complete 
and final saddam said in an abctv interview broadcast thursday 
but saddam made no peace proposals and also said that whoever 
hits us we shall hit them back saddam has said that any peace 
talks must also cover israels occupation of lands claimed by 
palestinians 
primakov in a speech thursday in new york said the world 
should do everything possible to encourage iraq to leave 
kuwait including holding an international conference that would 
address the palestinian question 
some relatives of american hostages say they plan to take 
saddams offer to visit iraq during he holiday season state 
department officials said the us government has advised against 
the trips 
hundreds of westerners are being held in iraq and kuwait some 
at strategic sites to deter attack by the multinational force 
deployed against iraq 
more than 100 americans and their foreignborn family members 
were to leave kuwait on sunday aboard a uschartered iraqi 
airways flight the state department said thursday most were women 
and children who have been eligible to leave for some time but 
decided only recently to depart said a state department spokesman 
richard boucher 
meanwhile the international atomic energy agency in vienna said 
today that iraq has invited inspectors to verify that it is not 
developing weapons at its four nuclear research sites 
the unexpected move was clearly designed to forestall attack on 
the ground that iraq is working toward nuclear capability iraq has 
repeatedly denied allegations by western media and israel that it 
is developing nuclear weapons 
iraqs representative to the unsupported agency said three 
weeks ago that the doors were open for a routine inspection 
agency spokesman hansfriedrich meyer said no date was announced 
also today seven antiwar activists left london for baghdad 
hoping to set up camps on both sides of the saudikuwait border 
the group said it intended to disrupt any battles that might break 
out former pop singer cat stevens now known as yusuf islam

rising energy prices hit american consumers 
for the third straight month in october pushing inflation up a 
sharp 06 percent the government reported today 
the 06 percent rise in the consumer price index followed jumps 
of 08 percent in both august and september 
that means that in the three months since iraq invaded kuwait 
inflation has risen at an annual rate of 89 percent the fastest 
threemonth advance since 1982 the labor department said during 
all of last year inflation rose 46 percent 
however analysts noted that the inflation rate for products not 
related to energy rose a modest 03 percent many economists see 
this socalled core rate a better indication of inflation 
economists said the downturn in the us economy many analysts 
think a recession has gripped the economy is holding down prices 
except for oil 
the sliding economy is preventing the oil and energy shock 
from causing a runaway on inflation said allen sinai chief 
economist at the boston co 
theres a hint here that we may get through this inflationary 
shock from oil in reasonably good shape but only at the cost of a 
sharp downturn in the economy keeping inflation from getting out of 
hand sinai said 
meanwhile the us merchandise trade deficit narrowed 33 
percent in september the first improvement since june the 
government reported today but petroleum imports were at their 
highest level in nine years because of escalating costs due to the 
persian gulf crisis 
the commerce department said imports dropped 24 percent to 
413 billion despite a huge 285 percent jump in petroleum 
imports but exports also fell down 22 percent to 318 billion 
the deficit is the difference between the two 
in a separate report the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation plunged 21 
percent in october it was the largest decline since a 23 percent 
drop in april 1979 
average weekly earnings in october before adjusting for 
inflation were 34985 up from 34139 a year earlier taking the 
62 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the 
12month period real weekly earnings were down 35 percent 
as in the previous two months the government blamed almost all 
of octobers inflation jolt on spiraling energy prices 
private analysts have been concerned that the fallout from the 
turmoil in the persian gulf would deepen any recession 
its taking money out of peoples pocketbooks they dont 
have enough purchasing power to boost sales and keep the nations 
economy moving said donald ratajczak director of economic 
forecasting at georgia state university 
todays inflation report showed that fuel oil shot up 128 
percent in october putting those prices 508 percent higher than 
they were before the iraqi invasion 
gasoline jumped 77 percent in october bringing those prices to 
269 percent higher than they were three months ago so far this 
year gasoline has jumped 369 percent and the governments 
socalled gasoline index is now well above its previous peak level 
of 1981 
the 89 percent spurt in all consumer prices for augustoctober 
was the fastest threemonth rise since prices shot up 109 percent 
for the period ending in july 1982 the government said 
analysts expect that inflation without an eruption of a 
shooting war in the persian gulf will return to more normal 
levels in coming months as oil prices stabilize 
if oil prices do not go up one can expect the inflation fire 
to basically be out by next spring sinai said 
still the oil shock could persist though not as dramatically 
as costs filter through to the thousands of other energyrelated 
products such as chemicals plastics and air fare

possible ways to ease the pain of any economic downturn similar

president coincides with the first anniversary of czechoslovakias 
velvet revolution the term describes the mass street protests 
that ended 40 years of communist rule and restored democracy with 
former dissident vaclav havel as president

us exile before the two peoples joined as an independent 
czechoslovakia in 1918 
masaryk became czechoslovakias first president that year 
wilsons support of czechoslovak independence established warm 
relations between the two nations and pragues main train station 
a glassdomed building near central wenceslas square was named 
after wilson to thank him 
after the communists took power in 1948 wilsons name was 
dropped and the terminal became simply the main station

wilsons station never stopped being wilsons stationeven when 
frightened communist rulers tried to wipe out the reference 
wilson has returned to prague where he always belonged but 
never visited koran said adding that bushs visit would 
complete the magic circle as if with a message from our 
ancestors the president will visit for the first time ever 
us ambassador shirley temple black outlining the special 
relationship between wilson and masaryk said the station was 
originally named after wilson to show the recognition of 
czechoslovakia as a world country 
bush is returning a visit made to the united states by havel in 
february he was the first czechoslovak president to visit america 
officially 
after the czech lands were occupied by hitlers army in 1939 
president eduard benes made a private visit to the united states 
from exile in britain during the communist era america was viewed 
as a beacon of freedom and czechoslovaks unabated warm feelings 
toward the united states are evident on the eve of bushs visit 
a simple white plaque unveiled at the ceremony bears a 
photograph of wilson and the inscription on the occasion of the 
first visit of an american president to czechoslovakia this 
station has been renamed the woodrow wilson station 
a 71yearold woman was clearly pleased with the formal 
renaming 
that is what it was during the first republic and we are 
comfortable with it she said

times when keating wanted help with federal banking regulators the

on approximately four separate occasions senator cranston 
accepted or solicited several hundred thousand dollars from mr 
keating for his campaigns or voter registration drives to which 
he was closely associated said counsel robert s bennett

circumstances with a request by mr keating for action with 
federal bank regulators bennett said 
bennett outlined the case against cranston on the second day of 
the committees hearings into the links between five senators and 
keating whose lincoln savings and loan failed at an estimated cost 
to taxpayers of 2 billion 
but before he began cranstons lawyer asked that one of the six 
committee members sen jesse helms be barred from judging the 
california democrat 
helms speaking under oath stoutly denied the charge by 
cranston attorne william w taylor iii that he had already made up 
his mind in the case he refused to step aside 
taylors request provided a dramatic start to the second day of 
hearings into the keating five and reflected the political

atlantis settled into orbit under a 
communications blackout after a dazzling night launch of the 
pentagons last secret shuttle mission the ship reportedly carried 
a spy satellite aimed at iraq 
riding a 700foot column of yellow flame the shuttle lifted 
from its seaside launch pad at 648 pm thursday climbed smoothly 
into darkness slowly dimmed to a speeding star and then winked 
from view more than 350 miles downrange 
atlantis fivemember allmilitary crew reportedly planned to 
release a satellite that will focus cameras or electronic signal 
detectors on the middle east where american troops stand poised 
against iraq 
a news blackout has been imposed on the mission cutting off 
public release of communications between the crew and mission 
control only bare status reports will be issued during the 
fourday flight 
as of midday today all appeared to be going well that were 
not hearing anything means that the orbiter and crew are doing 
fine nasa spokeswoman billie deason said 
it was the first flight in eight months for atlantis one of two 
shuttles grounded during the summer because of hydrogen fuel leaks 
mission control spokesman jeff carr described the launch as 
pictureperfect 
national aeronautics and space administration chief richard 
truly said it was just about as smooth a countdown and liftoff 
as he has ever seen weve got a good bird a healthy crew and a 
good mission on the way he said 
the mission is the seventh and final secret military flight 
planned for a shuttle the air force has said that unmanned 
rockets principally the titan 4 will be used in the future to 
launch secret spy and communications satellites 
col frank stirling who heads the titan 4 program said 
unmanned rockets offer greater reliability than nasas fleet of 
three and ultimately four shuttles 
with titan we have a continuing production line with many 
titans available so that if we should ever have a problem or an 
outage with the vehicle we would still be able to recover and 
continue operations he said 
the pentagon will use the shuttle twice in 1991 but both 
missions are unclassified 
atlantis crew consists of air force col richard covey mission 
commander navy cmdr frank culbertson jr pilot and army maj 
charles gemar air force lt col carl meade and marine col robert 
springer all mission specialists 
although details of atlantis mission are military secrets 
published reports have identified the cargo as a satellite that 
will conduct either electronic eavesdropping or photo surveys of 
the persian gulf area including iraq the reports said that while 
atlantis was grounded because of the fuel leaks the air force 
satellite was modified for middle east surveillance 
atlantis was the fifth of 37 shuttle flights to be launched in 
darkness and the fifth shuttle mission of 1990 a year in which 
nasa was plagued with shuttle problems 
atlantis and columbia were grounded after dangerous hydrogen 
leaks developed during launch attempts in trying to solve the 
problem nasa replaced atlantis external fuel tank some plumbing 
and valve seals 
atlantis and columbia were cleared for flight last month 
nasa officials were clearly relieved thursday night 
it puts atlantis back into flying status again said launch 
director bob sieck in a few weeks we expect to have columbia 
there too so well have all three shuttles flying again 
the third shuttle discovery flew last month columbia is being 
prepared for launch in december

convicted murderer lawrencia 
bembenek got permission to marry the man she fled prison with but 
because hes being deported today it was unlikely they could make 
it to a church in time officials said 
officials at the jail where ms bembenek and dominic gugliatto 
were being held granted permission for the marriage if they could 
obtain a license 
but thunder bay city clerk harry kirk said the couple would not 
have enough time to get the marriage license before gugliatto was 
deported this afternoon 
either ms bembenek a former model milwaukee police officer 
and playboy club waitress or gugliatto needed to apply in person 
for the license and jail officials could not arrange for the move 
on such short notice kirk said 
as far as were concerned there is no other option kirk 
said 
the 50 marriage form takes about 15 minutes to complete with 
the corresponding paperwork but ms bembenek would need to provide 
original court decrees proving her previous divorce he said 
ms bembenek 32 was divorced from former milwaukee police 
detective elfred schultz shortly after she was convicted of 
murdering schultzs former wife christine schultz in 1981 
she was serving a life prison sentence at a prison near fond du 
lac wis when she escaped last july and fled to canada to start a 
new life with gugliatto 35 a suburban milwaukee factory worker 
authorities said 
the couple were recaptured last month after a visitor to thunder 
bay a canadian tourist city just north of duluth minn 
recognized them from a segment about their escaped aired on the 
television show americas most wanted 
since their capture the couple has fought deportation to the 
united states where they face escape charges gugliatto was 
ordered deported this week while a decision for ms bembenek is 
pending 
once back in the united states gugliatto will face charges of 
aiding and abetting bembeneks escape

the three main rightwing parties filed a censure 
motion today against the socialist government setting the stage 
for a parliamentary battle that could unseat premier michel rocard 
the noconfidence motion stems from strong opposition to 
proposed reforms in taxation for social security a vote on the 
motion is scheduled for monday 
the dispute poses the biggest threat for rocard since president 
francois mitterrand named him premier when the socialists regained 
effective control of parliament in 1988 
the socialists lack an outright majority in the national 
assembly and have relied in the past on abstentions by the usually 
friendly communist party to defeat conservativesponsored censure 
motions 
this time the communists have pledged to support the motion 
its the first time the communist party will have crossed the 
yellow line said national assembly president laurent fabius a 
socialist and former prime minister 
nonetheless fabius predicted in a radio interview that rocard 
his bitter rival in jockeying to succeed mitterrand would weather 
the vote i dont think theres going to be a majority to reverse 
the government fabius said 
rocard a technocrat from the socialists pragmatic wing has 
survived four noconfidence motions during his tenure thanks to 
communist abstentions 
the premier says he is relying on support from centrist deputies 
to make up his partys shortfall of 19 seats from an overall 
majority in the 577seat national assembly 
the three parties that introduced the motion include the rally 
for the republic headed by paris mayor jacques chirac the union 
for french democracy led by former president valery giscard 
destaing and the smallish center union party 
together with the communists they can muster 286 votes just 
three short of the 289 needed to bring down the government 
the socialists have 272 seats rocard is counting on defections 
from the ranks of rightwing parties and support from the 20 
nonaffiliated deputies about 15 of whom normally vote with the 
socialists 
the 11 percent social security tax would replace part of the 
existing social security contributions paid by employers and 
employees

happened this late and so acutely

from her home in white settlement texas with a sore throat and 
fever she was 13 
fricker said its not known why the heart was rejected he said 
stormie showed no signs of heart trouble 
doctors said they would study whether the unusual rejection was 
related to the experimental antirejection drug stormie was taking 
the drug fk506 is being tested only at the university of 
pittsburgh hospitals of which childrens is one 
meanwhile stormies mother said thursday she cherished the time 
she had with her daughter because she knew time was short

president bush leaving tonight on an 
eightday trip to the middle east and europe vows he will not 
plunge the united states into a vietnamlike war that we cannot 
win in the persian gulf 
theres not going to be any long drawnout agony of vietnam 
bush said thursday in an interview on cable news network he said 
the reason he is sending 200000 more troops to saudi arabia was to 
demonstrate to iraqs saddam hussein that we are deadly serious 
about demanding that he withdraw his troops from kuwait and free 
all hostages 
bush who has been seeking to rally stronger congressional 
support for his persian gulf actions will be joined in saudi 
arabia on thanksgiving day by the top four house and senate 
leaders 
i think its a good indication it sends a good signal not 
only to the american people but hopefully to saddam hussein that 
there is bipartisanship and politics does stop at the waters 
edge senate minority leader bob dole rkan said today 
going to saudi arabia in addition to dole are senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine house speaker thomas foley 
dwash and house minority leader robert michel rill 
bush cautioned that saddam is trying hard to get an atomic 
weapon and he said the world will have to insist on 
international guarantees against further aggression by iraq even if 
it pulls out of kuwait 
the presidents hardline remarks signaled anew that he is not 
in the mood to compromise with baghdad over its invasion of kuwait 
bush said he was not interested in arranging a facesaving 
gesture for saddam to sound a retreat 
when you rape pillage and plunder a neighbor should you then 
ask the world hey give me a little face give me a little 
facesaving so i can do what i should have done months ago bush 
said 
the persian gulf crisis was at the top of the presidents agenda 
as he prepared to depart tonight for czechoslovakia the first stop 
on a journey that also will take him to germany france saudi 
arabia and egypt 
the emotional high point will be a thanksgiving day visit with 
us forces in the desert sands of saudi arabia 
there also will be news on other fronts he will be the first 
us president ever to visit czechoslovakia 
and during a threeday summit in paris bush will join soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev on monday in signing a historic 
eastwest treaty sharply reducing nonnuclear forces that both nato 
and the warsaw pact maintain in central and eastern europe 
bush and gorbachev are to meet privately and are expected to 
discuss the deterioration of the soviet economy the administration 
is developing contingency plans to provide emergency food and 
medicine to the soviet union to help it get through the winter 
officials said 
in his cnn interview bush acknowledged that congress alone has 
the right to declare war but he asserted that he has the primary 
responsibility to make tough decisions to force iraq out of 
kuwait 
referring to the makeup of the house and senate bush said 
and you cant have 435 commandersinchief and you cant have a 
hundred commandersinchief 
he rejected any comparison between the persian gulf and vietnam 
i will not as commanderinchief ever put somebody into a 
military situation that we do not win ever bush vowed and 
theres not going to be any long drawnout agony of vietnam so i 
reject that parallel 
but i can understand why people say that he added 
because they are thinking we dont want to have a drawnout 
vietnam 
the presidents eightday trip will open saturday morning in 
prague before an anticipated audience of hundreds of thousands of 
people he will lay a wreath in wenceslas square to commemorate the 
first anniversary of the velvet revolution that led to the 
overthrow of the countrys communist rulers 
the visit is intended to toast the resurgence of democracy and 
pay tribute to czechoslovakias courage in facing economic 
hardships as it discards a statecontrolled economy in favor of a 
freemarket system 
the celebration of democracy also is the theme of a fivehour 
stop on sunday in germany for talks with chancellor helmut kohl it 
will be bushs first meeting with kohl since he successfully 
engineered one of the most dramatic episodes in modern european 
history german unification 
from germany bush will travel to paris for the 34nation summit 
to strengthen cooperation between east and west bush will use the 
occasion to sound out britain france the soviet union and others 
on the wording of a un resolution authorizing force to drive iraq 
out of kuwait

leaders and the exiled leadership of kuwait

president mikhail s gorbachev announced plans 
today to replace military and government officials blocking his 
economic reforms and he urged support for a new treaty to hold the 
country together 
the soviet leader addressed the supreme soviet legislature 
which had demanded he give a full report on his plans for political 
and economic change 
lawmakers reacted coolly to gorbachevs 90minute speech 
refusing to applaud and rising to ask him questions when it was 
finished 
he left the floor without answering and deputies took 
microphones to complain that he had not addressed their concerns 
about the economy 
gorbachev is locked in a power struggle with russian federation 
presdient boris n yeltsin that has paralyzed their rival 
governments over economic reform 
yeltsin later took the floor and demanded gorbachev agree within 
two weeks to form a new extraordinary anticrisis committee to 
govern in place of prime minister nikolai ryzhkov and his cabinet 
yeltsin said the committee would include leaders of all 15 
republics 
the latest conflict threw new uncertainty into the government 
crisis that has pitted russia the largest soviet republic against 
the kremlin which still holds the soviet purse strings and 
dictates economic and foreign policy 
yeltsin and gorbachev met on sunday and agreed to form parallel 
commissions to decide how to divide control over the economy 
today they focused on their separate plans for ending the economic 
crisis that has left most store shelves bare and rendered the ruble 
currency increasingly worthless 
gorbachev said measures to reorganize the government and get 
rid of outdated clearly useless structures would be submitted to 
the legislature within 10 days 
he did not detail the changes but said they had ryzhkovs 
approval indicating the embattled prime minister would not be 
among those affected despite yeltsins call for him to resign 
gorbachev has used his presidential powers to issue decrees on 
the economy including ordering state businesses to fill orders and 
raising the prices of certain goods to stimulate domestic 
production 
some of the orders however have been countermanded by 
separatistminded republics including russia 
it is unclear who will be obeyed across the country of 285 
million people 
gorbachev faced with restive republics and ethnic violence in 
the chaotic period of transition to a market economy promised 
changes in the top echelon of the armed forces command 
pounding the lectern for emphasis he rejected persistent rumors 
of a military coup and said people were spreading them to discredit 
the army 
we cannot discredit the armed forces because we need them now 
to maintain stability in the country gorbachev said 
the soviet president alternately speaking forcefully and very 
softly also urged the legislature to consider a moratorium on new 
republic laws that contradict national ones 
he said that in the near future he would nullify decisions by 
republics and local governments that denied soldiers and their 
families civil rights particularly in the restive baltics 
all but one of the republics have declared some sort of 
sovereignty from the kremlin but gorbachevs plans for developing 
a market economy hinge on the republics agreeing to stay in the 
union 
gorbachev has proposed a new treaty that would give the 
republics a degree of autonomy while leaving national economic and 
military power in kremlin hands 
we dont need political leaders who stimulate separatism and 
nationalism we need help to consolidate the country gorbachev 
said 
after the soviet leaders speech several deputies took the 
floor to complain that gorbachev had not addressed their concerns 
about the economy 
we didnt hear what we wanted to hear said yuri blokhin a 
legislator from moldavia we wanted to hear concrete measures 
but he didnt give us anything 
speaking during a break outside the chamber leningrad mayor 
anatoly sobchak said gorbachevs speech was not what we need 
what we need are extraordinary measures 
during his speech gorbachev lowered his voice to a nearwhisper 
when he began discussing a coalition with yeltsin his chief 
political foe 
calling his sunday meeting with yeltsin simply routine he 
rejected the idea of giving the russian leader more national power 
and hinted at the dangers of russian nationalism 
in a coalition government if the russian government gets any 
more power it will mean discrimination against the other 
republics gorbachev said 
after gorbachevs speech the whitehaired yeltsin told 
legislators that the first task of the proposed anticrisis 
committee would be to take an inventory of all the food in the 
country and distribute it where necessary 
the crisis we are experiencing now is still a crisis of a 
totalitarian state which is reflected in the paralysis of power 
yeltsin said the center is sliding down to confrontation with 
the republics and first of all with russia 
emerging later during a recess yeltsin said the committee would 
not work with ryzhkov but we might form a coalition with 
gorbachev he told reporters

on government reorganization now about the structure of the 
union government it should be decisively changed even before the 
signing of the union treaty first of all this question is 
reflected in the union treaty and is solved fundamentally youll 
see it yourself when in several days you get a draft concept of the 
treaty first of all we should get rid of outdated clearly 
useless strucures suggestions in this respect should be submitted 
in the next 10 days 
we should finish with the formation of new bodies created in 
connection with transition to a market economy i mean an 
interregional committee on economic reform an antimonopoly 
committee and others the reorganization of the government should 
be accompanied by a renewal of its members those who are most 
competent should be brought into government 
</TEXT>

on paralysis of power now everybody is talking about the 
crisis of power the center is getting a flow of ultimatums to take 
decisive measures on improving the situation in the country we 
should ask ourselves bluntly what is the matter why instead of a

the matter lies we should clarify the question

on role of communist party in the past we could describe the 
mechanism of power in practically one word the party it 
infiltrated practically everything both the state organizations 
and public structures any decision of the cpsu was regarded as an 
order not subject to discussion it was a tough in its own way 
logical authoritative system which however was not only 
incompatible with democratic principles but as we know led to 
colossal losses and flaws as far as the social progress of the 
country is concerned 
we have consciously dropped it and there is no way backwards 
but moving away from an old structure of power we have not yet 
created democratic mechanisms that would meet the new tasks when a 
decision is taken by the president where is that mechanism that 
would work as in the past

a newspaper advertisement published 
friday appealed for information on four missing iranians whose fate 
has been linked to some of the western hostages held by proiranian 
extremists 
the halfpage ad signed by relatives of the missing iranians 
appeared in the leading beirut newspaper annahar 
we came to collect the pieces of our hearts it said the 
relatives arrived in lebanon tuesday 
the ad carried pictures of the iranians who disappeared in the 
christian enclave during israels 1982 invasion of lebanon 
christian warlord samir geagea said in a tv interview tuesday 
that the iranians were killed after their abduction by rightwing 
militiamen under the command of his prosyrian rival elie hobeika 
iran has interceded on behalf of western hostages held in 
lebanon and it has said it would help secure the relese of the 
remaining 13 in return for information about the iranians 
mohsen musavi charge daffaires at the iranian embassy was one 
of those abducted his wife maryam said at a news conference 
thursday that the iranians were alive 
the latest information we received ascertains that all four 
iranians are still alive in the laqlouq prison of the lebanese 
forces christian militia headed by samir geagea mrs musavi 
said 
we got this information from newly freed prisoners from 
laqlouq jail who came to our embassy in nicosia cyprus she 
said 
laqlouq is a ski resort in the mountains of kesrouan province 
about 40 miles northeast of beirut the region is a lebanese forces 
militia stronghold 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah the most influential shiite 
moslem cleric said thursday that the fate of the four missing 
iranians should be revealed because this is a tragedy as inhuman 
as the detention of the western hostages

hezbollah or party of god which is the umbrella for underground 
factions holding most of the westerners missing in lebanon 
fadlallah has made appeals for the release of hostages in the 
past they appear to have had no tangible impact on the kidnappers 
of the western hostages despite his influence on religious 
matters 
however when the selfstyled organization of islamic dawn 
released former american hostages robert polhill and frank reed 
last april it said the releases were due among other things to 
the behests of senior religious leaders

iben browning has incurred the wrath of 
geologists and seismologists for projecting a 5050 chance for a 
major earthquake on the new madrid fault zone in early december 
he may soon be getting in trouble with economists 
during a presentation thursday to a st louis business group 
the new mexico scientist said it appears that conditions are right 
for the world to fall into a depression in 1992 
for climatological reasons we will reach the bottom of the 
depression about the end of 1992 i expect it will be the 
most severe since 1776 more severe than the 1930s browning 
said 
among other things he said 
that high tidal forces have affected such things as the size 
of the wheat crop in the soviet union and the rise of nazism before 
world war ii 
that volcanoes cause acid rain not coalburning factories and 
power plants 
that the temperature of ice in greenland affects the world 
economy 
one thing he didnt spend much time talking about was his 
projection that strong tidal forces could touch off a major 
earthquake in the midwest about dec 3 he also had nothing to say 
about the overwhelming criticism it has prompted 
that would be a waste of time id rather just stick to my 
work said browning 
although he referred to his projection as a guesstimate he 
said he was confident in his reasoning and thought people should 
listen to what he has to say 
brownings projection has created a stir in parts of the midwest 
where residents have bought survival kits and earthquake insurance 
the new madrid fault runs from marked tree ark north to 
cairo ill and affects parts of missouri arkansas tennessee 
illinois and kentucky 
in 1811 and 1812 three major quakes caused widespread 
devastation along the fault rattled chimneys as far away as boston 
and knocked residents of nashville and cincinnati to the ground 
earthquake experts say theres a good chance of another quake in 
the region eventually but have dismissed brownings theories of 
the chances of one being triggered by tidal forces 
browning 72 of tijares nm is chief scientist for summa 
medical corp an albuquerque biotechnology research and 
development company 
he has a doctorate degree in physiology and bachelors degrees 
in physics and math he has studied climatology on his own and 
publishes the browning newsletter on world climates

lawyers for manuel noriega headed for federal court 
today for a hearing on whether the deposed panamanian dictator 
should be appointed a governmentpaid defense attorney and also 
sought to have the charges thrown out 
noriegas private defense team led by fran rubino had claimed 
the us government has sabotaged its work by freezing noriegas 
assets leaving no money for legal fees 
in what rubino said may be one of his last acts in the noriega 
case he filed a motion today to dismiss the charges accusing the 
government of a conspiracy to deny noriegas rights to a fair trial 
and effective legal counsel 
the motion accuses the government of misconduct by taping 
noriegas prison phone calls with his attorneys cable news network 
reported last week that it had obtained tapes of such calls 
the defense motion also accuses the prosecution of illegally 
freezing his funds and says an unidentified government witness 
attempted to entrap the attorneys two months ago by soliciting a 
bribe to change his testiony 
us district judge william hoeveler on tuesday set a deadline 
of today for noriegas lawyers and the prosecution to work out a 
payment plan otherwise he said he will declare noriega indigent 
and appoint an attorney on the us payroll 
if declared indigent noriega would be allowed two attorneys 
paid a maximum of 75 an hour and investigative expenses of a few 
thousand dollars 
by contrast the justice department has 30 lawyers on the case 
and is prepared to spend up 30 million to prosecute noriega on 
charges of accepting 46 million in bribes from colombian cocaine 
smugglers rubino said 
the tight budget for indigent defendants makes it nearly 
impossible for governmentappointed attorneys to compete said yale 
kamisar a law professor at the university of michigan 
you need investigators you need experts to challenge the 
government to put them to the test he said 
meanwhile cable news network has asked the us supreme court 
to overturn hoevelers ruling of last week prohibiting the 
broadcast of taped jailhouse telephone conversations between 
noriega and his lawyers 
on thursday the fbi which is investigating how cnn obtained 
the government tapes seized tapes and papers that had been stored 
in a cnn reporters hotel room the network claims the material was 
improperly removed from the hotel room by security guards and has 
demanded the fbi return it 
soon after the united states invaded panama last december the 
justice department asked other countries to freeze 27 bank accounts 
holding about 20 million in purported illgotten gains allegedly 
controlled by noriega 
hoeveler ordered about 6 million freed in june but prosecutors 
said the foreign governments then confiscated the money on their 
own 
also at issue is 58 million in cash found by us troops in 
noriegas offices in panama prosecutors said that upon surrender 
noriega denied the money was his and that it was then turned over 
to the panamanian government 
rubino said noriega never disavowed the money

young refugees from the civil 
war in mozambique are being sold in south africa for use as slave 
laborers concubines or sacrifice in magic rituals two newspapers 
reported friday 
the weekly mail and the sowetan both antiapartheid newspapers 
reported that the mozambican refugees were being sold in the 
johannesburg region for about 140 each to both whites and blacks 
the reports said some slaves were killed during muti or 
magic rituals 
the weekly mail said one of its reporters purchased two slaves 
jorge mthembu 17 and immanuel kambule 18 for 80 each the 
youths did not know they had been sold as slaves it said 
reporter phil molefe wrote that he bought the teenagers from a 
dealer near the mozambican border the weekly mail said it decided 
to buy slaves to prove that the traffic in human beings exists 
they are now at my mercy if they refuse to work demand pay 
or threaten to run away i can call the police and have them 
arrested as illegals and deported molefe wrote 
police officials had no comment on the reports 
refugees fleeing the war in mozambique are smuggled over the 
border by men claiming they will get them jobs in south africa 
once in south africa the refugees are sold to farmers businessmen 
or men who want wives or concubines 
many of the female slaves are between 14 and 17yearsold the 
reports said they are sold as wives or concubines and some are 
beaten if they refuse to sleep with their purchasers they said 
young girls who refused to be sold to local men as wives were 
reported to have been taken to the bush and it was not known what 
happened to them the mail reported 
male slaves are used to work in shops businesses or on farms 
and are purchased by whites and blacks the reports said 
the weekly mail said white farmers use the refugees as laborers 
often providing only food or clothing and no wages farmers 
frequently call police and have them returned to mozambique as 
illegal refugees when they are no longer needed it said 
some slaves reportedly were sold for magic and killed in rituals 
in the black homeland of kangwane near mozambique the sowetan 
reported 
it is easy to kill them they have no identification and no 
family their origins are unknown and sad as it is nobody will 
miss a refugee aid worker rachel nsimbisi was quoted as saying 
the weekly mail said refugees were willing to accept almost any 
conditions rather than return to mozambique where rightwing 
guerrillas are fighting the leftist government 
most of the fugitives are unwilling to return to mozambique 
because even the most adverse conditions in south africa 
including slavery and forced labor are preferable to life amid 
the devastation caused by war it said

the fbi but would not allow fishing expeditions through cnn 
offices the network said on a midday newscast 
william hinshaw head of the fbi bureau in atlanta said today 
that after a thursday night meeting with cnn officials he agreed 
to seal the box and not take inventory of its contents until the 
justice department orders him to do so 
the fbi previously said agents would go through the box today 
hinshaw said he didnt know what materials were in the box he 
said he did see some cassettes in the box but was uncertain if 
they were audio or video cassettes although he said one i saw 
appeared to be a audio cassette 
the network has asked the us supreme court to overturn a 
federal judges order issued last week barring it from airing 
recordings of conversations between noriega and the fallen 
panamanian dictators legal team 
in addition a hearing was scheduled in miami this afternoon to 
determine whether noriega whose assets have been frozen by 
prosecutors should be declared indigent and appointed a government 
defense attorney 
lead defense attorney frank rubino saying it might be one of 
his last acts in the noriega case today filed a motion to dismiss 
the charges against noriega accusing the government of engaging in 
a conspiracy to deny his right to a fair trial and the effective 
assistance of counsel 
the motion accuses the government of misconduct by taping 
noriegas prison phone calls with his lawyers as well as illegally 
freezing his funds it also says an unidentified government witness 
attempted to entrap the attorneys two months ago by soliciting a 
bribe to change his testiony 
noriega is being held in a miami jail awaiting trial on charges 
of taking 46 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade the 
fbi is investigating how cnn obtained seven tapes of his jail cell 
phone conversations 
fbi spokesman scott nelson in washington said thursday that 
agents obtained the box without a warrant we were made aware of 
the tapes and merely picked them up for analysis he said 
johnson said he protested the fbis action in the strongest 
terms to agency officials in washington 
cnn general counsel steve korn said today hed written joseph 
whitley the us attorney in atlanta demanding the return of 
the tapes and that the materials in the box not be reviewed or 
duplicated 
the new york times today quoted an unidentified cnn official as 
saying the actual noriega recordings were not in the box 
the fbi did not get the main course the official said 
the box was removed monday from a room that had been occupied by 
fernandez who has been working on the noriega story 
her room was at the omni hotel which is owned by cnns parent 
company turner broadcasting and is part of a complex that also 
houses cnns offices 
hotel manager bill thompson said hotel security officers thought 
fernandez had checked out when they removed a box containing papers 
and at least one videotape 
cnns johnson said today that fernandez who has been covering 
the noriega story had not checked out of the room but 
apparently there was a mistake by the hotel that led to her room 
being cleared out 
after taking the box from the room the hotels security guards 
saw that some of its contents were cnn property he said they 
turned the material over to turner security officers from whom the 
fbi took the box he said 
he and korn said it still unclear how the fbi was notified about 
the box 
i dont know who called who korn said 
turner security which provides security for the cnn center 
complex had a discussion with the fbi inquiring about stolen 
government property and turner security told them they had a box 
that might fit that description cnn spokesman steve haworth said 
thursday cnn denied the material in the box was stolen 
haworth said turner security a subsidiary of cnns parent 
company turner broadcasting systems inc did not tell 
appropriate cnn officials it had the box 
cnn said agents took the box over the objections of a network 
attorney who was present korn said the attorney asked for a 
warrant and was not given an answer and certainly not given a 
warrant 
meanwhile cnn lawyers on thursday asked supreme court justice 
anthony kennedy to set aside a judges order barring broadcast of 
the phone conversations 
kennedy who handles such emergency matters from florida 
referred the case to the full court there was no word on when it 
might act 
cnn is challenging an order issued by us district judge 
william hoeveler in miami on nov 8 that bars it from broadcasting 
the tapes until hoeveler can determine whether the broadcasts would 
violate noriegas rights 
cnn refused to give up the tapes but agreed not to air any 
attorneyclient recordings until the supreme court decides the 
matter the network contends hoevelers order is an 
unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech 
federal prison officials say inmates phone calls routinely are 
monitored except when prisoners say they are talking to their 
lawyers but cnn said it has tapes that include conversations 
between noriega and his defense team

prime minister chandra shekhar won a 
parliamentary vote of confidence friday and appealed for an end to 
the sectarian conflict that brought down his predecessors 
government 
the vote came after seven hours of acrimonious debate between 
supporters of the new government and lawmakers who questioned its 
legitimacy because of the political deals made to form it 
the country cannot afford confrontation we cannot go on 
fighting with each other chandra shekhar told the lower house of 
parliament 
the 522member house voted 269204 in chandra shekhars favor 
formally endorsing his taking over as head of the government 
fifteen legislators abstained and the rest were absent 
more than 390 people have been killed across india in the past 
four weeks in hindumoslem riots and in clashes with police over a 
hindu fundamentalist groups plan to build a temple at a site now 
occupied by a mosque 
chandra shekhar said he would hold talks with the hindu world 
council to stop its campaign to demolish the mosque in the holy 
hindu city of ayodhya 310 miles east of new delhi 
even if they do not want to talk to me i will go on talking 
to them he said i shall talk to every citizen of india but 
there will be no compromise on the unity and integrity of india 
chandra shekhar replaced his longtime rival vp singh 
singhs minority government fell apart when a rightwing hindu 
party the bharatiya janata party withdrew its support last month 
angered by singhs opposition to the temple construction plan 
chandra shekhar belonged to singhs janata dal party but broke 
away two days before singh lost a vote of confidence and resigned 
as prime minister nov 7 
the temple campaign led to hindumoslem riots in scores of towns 
and villages across india the strife touched the capital for the 
first time on wednesday when at least six people were killed in 
clashes a seventh person died of stab wounds on friday 
hindus make up 82 percent of indias 880 million people moslems 
comprise 12 percent 
chandra shekhars janata dalsocialist party a breakaway 
faction of janata dal claims to have 68 sworn followers or barely 
10 percent of seats in the lower house of parliament but he joined 
with his longtime rival exprime minister rajiv gandhi to win 
enough votes for a majority 
gandhis congress party and its allies have 210 seats 
chandra shekhar defended the alliance and appealed for a new 
political climate 
at this moment we should try to agree to work together he 
said 
but the alliance was denounced across the political spectrum 
it is a mockery and debasement of democratic norms a 
twoheaded monster with no body and limbs said somnath 
chatterjee of the left front an alliance of communist and 
socialist parties 
lal krishna advani leader of the bharatiya janata party 
accused chandra shekhar of abandoning the voters who ousted 
gandhis congress party from power in general elections less than a 
year ago 
this government lacks political legitimacy advani said 
so far the government is composed of only chandra shekhar and 
his deputy prime minister devi lal other cabinet ministers are 
likely to be named within three days 
there are doubts as to how long the new government will last 
analysts say gandhi will withdraw his support whenever he thinks 
the congress party is ready to contest elections

daniel ortega accused washington friday of 
using the military buildup in the persian gulf to win permanent 
dominance in the middle east and he likened it to the invasions of 
grenada and panama 
the former nicaraguan president criticized the united states for 
backing un resolutions in support of occupied kuwait while doing 
little to enforce resolutions calling for israel to withdraw from 
occupied territories 
how come for them human rights apply to some people but not 
the others asked ortega who arrived wednesday on a fourday 
visit 
there have been scores of un resolutions on israels 
occupation of palestinian land these resolutions should be 
implemented too if there is to be a comprehensive settlement in the 
region 
the official iraqi news agency reported earlier that ortega 
supported saddam husseins proposal for a simultaneous settlement 
of his invasion of kuwait and the israeli occupation of palestinian 
territories 
washington has rejected that linkage 
the united states leads a multinational force of more than 
350000 troops arrayed against iraq since its aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
speaking of the us gulf deployment ortega said my country 
has suffered from the same policy when they tried to undermine the 
sandinistas 
washington supported the contra rebels who fought ortegas 
leftist sandinista government throughout most of the 1980s ortega 
was defeated in february elections by a presidential candidate 
supported by the united states 
referring to the 1983 us invasion of grenada and the 1989 
invasion of panama ortega said the invasion of grenada and the 
intervention in panama are also other examples of the policy of 
hegemony 
on friday ortega met with foreign minister tariq aziz and 
national assembly speaker sadi mehdi saleh the iraqi news agency 
reported it said saleh told ortega that iraq wants the gulf crisis 
resolved peacefully 
but if the forces of evil attempt to ignite war then iraq 
will be forced to fight back the agency quoted saleh as saying 
it said that during his two separate meetings with saleh and 
aziz ortega expressed support of iraq in its drive to liberate 
the region from american hegemony 
ortega met on thursday with saddam baghdad television said they 
discussed third world countries that are trying to combat us 
hegemony

a jury today sentenced mass murderer 
ramon salcido to die in the gas chamber for the 1989 wine country 
slayings of seven people including his wife and two of their 
children 
salcido 29 showed no reaction when an interpreter told him the 
jurys verdict one juror wept as the sentence was being read 
judge reginald littrell sent formal sentencing for dec 17 he 
has the power to reject the death penalty decision and impose the 
only other alternative life in prison but such a move is rare in 
california 
the jury received the penalty phase of the case tuesday 
afternoon the same panel had found him guilty of six counts of 
firstdegree murder one count of seconddegree murder and two 
counts of attempted murder 
defense attorney marteen miller said the verdict would be 
appealed to us district court 
the mexicanborn salcido who fled to his home town of los 
moches after the april 1989 slayings was convicted of shooting or 
slashing to death his wife angela his 4yearold and 22monthold 
daughters sofia and teresa his motherinlaw marion richards 
her 12yearold and 8yearold daughters ruth and maria and 
tracey toovey 35 the winemaster at grand cru winery in glen 
ellen 
the jury also convicted salcido of attempting to murder his 
2yearold daughter carmina who was found slashed next to the 
bodies of her sisters in a garbage dump and kenneth butti his 
supervisor at the winery 
the defense never disputed that salcido was the killer and 
during its concluding remarks to the jury called the killings 
unspeakable horrendous terrible crimes 
however miller contended his client was high on cocaine and 
alcohol during the violence and described him as crazier than a 
toad the night of the slayings 
he had sought a verdict of seconddegree murder or manslaughter 
because he said the drugs had put salcido in a psychotic 
depression when the rampage began 
he also said salcido did not cooperate with his defenders 
he was told not to wear suit and he comes into court with a 
suit and wearing cowboy boots miller said 
salcidos trial was moved from sonoma county to san mateo county 
because of the extensive news coverage of the case littrell is a 
sierra county superior court judge who was assigned to the case

the united states helped organize sleeper 
guerrilla units in western europe in preparation for a possible 
soviet invasion but it had nothing to do with those cells after 
the 1950s say current and former us officials 
their comments contradict secret testimony obtained by the 
associated press in rome friday that instructors of the italian 
anticommunist network codenamed gladio took part in a 1972 
training exercise at a us base in germany 
in the testimony a military intelligence official who 
supervised gladio in the 1970s also said the united states funded 
construction and a first arms shipment for a gladio training base 
set up on the island of sardinia in the 1960s 
gladio was a purely italian operation we had no connection 
with it or with other individual country networks said one us 
official 
former cia director william colby said he did not recall having 
any direct contact with the groups when he headed the cia from 1973 
to 1976 speaking in an interview from moscow where he was 
attending a seminar colby said he helped set up such networks in 
scandinavia in the early 1950s 
the comments of colby and others came amid revelations flooding 
europe about the existence of antisoviet resistance networks in at 
least 15 countries from france in the west to turkey in the east 
the operation was first exposed last month in italy where it was 
codenamed gladio for the short swords used by roman gladiators 
most of the cells appear to have been disbanded starting in the 
1970s although press reports say the networks controlling body 
still formally exists in belgium 
the cia was aware the network was being maintained but was not 
involved in its running officials said 
the idea of establishing an underground resistance network was 
conceived by several members of the north atlantic treaty 
organization said colby 
but italian prime minister giulio andreotti said the idea was 
first broached by the united states which approached italy in 
1951 he said the whole west european network came under nato 
control only in 1959 
in his 1978 memoirs colby said the cia set up the office of 
policy coordination in the late 1940s to plan for the not 
unlikely possibility of a soviet invasion of western europe 
the opc wanted to be in a position to activate wellarmed and 
wellorganized partisan uprisings against the occupiers he said 
in the book entitled honorable men my life in the cia 
an official familiar with the us role who asked not to be 
named said the idea should be viewed in the context of the 
anticommunist fears of the late 1940s and the cold war of the 
early 1950s 
with eastern european countries falling under soviet control one 
by one with sovietbacked north korea invading the south and with 
the anticommunist witchhunt in the united states orchestrated by 
senator joseph mccarthy it made complete sense he said 
with the lesson of europes failure to throw off nazi occupation 
during world war ii fresh in their minds us officials were 
determined to be prepared in advance against a soviet threat 
the cia undertook a major program of building throughout west 
european countries clandestine infrastructures of leaders and 
equipment trained and ready to be called into action as sabotage 
and espionage forces when the time came colby wrote 
colby who had parachuted into norway in 1944 to link up with 
norwegian resistance fighters and help them organize sabotage 
activity against the nazis was picked to set up anticommunist 
networks in scandinavia 
colby was sent to stockholm in 1951 and for the next two years 
he organized stay behind networks in the four scandinavian 
countries in two of them he worked freely with the intelligence 
agencies in the two others his contacts with the intelligence 
agencies were limited and he had to rely more on his own contacts 
colby wrote 
while he didnt identify the countries that offered him more 
freedom colby strongly indicated they were norway and denmark 
which were members of nato sweden which is militarily neutral 
and finland are not 
colby said the operatives he recruited were civilians one was a 
journalist another an american graduate student studying in 
scandinavia a third an american of scandinavian descent who had 
returned to his native country to run a farm 
in the interview colby said he did not know about the networks 
weapons caches which have been described by various european 
newspapers in recent days i dont know about weapons caches if 
they existed they were kept secret 
colby said he did not have anything to do with setting up the 
gladio network in italy although he was posted by the cia to rome 
in 1953 
his task there colby recounted in his book was to funnel 
several million dollars and us expertise to strengthen the 
centrist political parties against the growing influence of the 
italian communist party 
moscow was giving the italian communists some 50 million a 
year he said and it was unthinkable the united states would 
let italy fall under soviet control

officials involved in a secret european resistance 
network underwent training at a us base in west germany in the 
1970s according to confidential documents obtained friday 
the documents also disclosed that french and british officials 
involved in the network visited a training base built with us 
money to train italian members of operation gladio as the 
resistance network is known 
the documents sum up secret judicial testimony by italian 
officials and indicate a higher level of european coordination in 
the anticommunist network than had been revealed 
they also were the first official corroboration of reports that 
the guerrilla organization existed in britain 
also friday the german government announced that a branch of 
the secret organization still exists in that country and will be 
dissolved 
the guerrilla groups were formed throughout europe after world 
war ii by secret services to create a resistance movement or gather 
intelligence in the event of a warsaw pact invasion 
they were made up of civilians and coordinated at least in part 
by nato according to officials who were involved some groups 
received cia funds they say 
an italian parliamentary committee that oversees secret services 
on friday held a second day of closed hearings on operation gladio 
premier giulio andreotti who first disclosed the existence of the 
network last month testified 
two venice judges carlo mastelloni and felice casson have been 
investigating whether the network was linked to a series of 
terrorist bombings in italy from 1969 to the early 1980s when the 
communists italys no 2 party came to the brink of power 
a military intelligence official who supervised the operation 
from late 1971 to 1974 told mastelloni that eight to 10 instructors 
of the guerrillas went to the main us base in west germany in 
1972 there they took part in a simulated exercise of enemy 
occupation said gen gerardo serravalle 
a summary of his secret testimony was obtained by the associated 
press from a parliamentary source 
according to the testimony us intelligence officials invited 
the italians back for another training exercise in 1974 
serravalle said an italian training base was established on the 
island of sardinia in the 1960s under a secret nato accord 
the united states provided money for construction and for the 
first arms shipments which included pistols and magnesium and 
plastic explosives according to the testimony 
serravalle said italian and british gladio organizers exchanged 
visits in 1972 and 1973 and that similar visits were made by two 
french officials to the italian base in 1974 
the british government has refused to confirm the existence of a 
domestic resistance network on friday defense secretary tom king 
told reporters he had never heard of gladio 
french officials have said they had such a group but that it 
withered away years ago 
serravalle said he attended meetings in paris london brussels 
and luxembourg of european officials involved in the network 
his former superior gen fausto fortunato testified that 
during his tenure from 197174 the nato committee overseeing the 
resistance groups included france britain germany italy 
belgium luxembourg and the netherlands

germany swamped by immigrants and newcomers from 
all parts of the world will assign 20 percent of all 
asylumseekers to the formerly communist east starting in december 
officials said friday 
west germany long was popular with refugees because of its 
generous social benefits and liberal asylum laws crafted after 
world war ii these now apply in former east german territory since 
unification on oct 3 
the 11 states in western germany complain they cannot cope with 
the growing numbers of asylumseekers they have demanded that bonn 
put some of the burden on the five new states in eastern germany 
the number of asylumseekers in germany is expected to top 
200000 this year fewer than 4 percent of the applicants are ever 
expected to be granted refuge but processing their applications 
can take years 
although asylumseekers are not allowed legally to work they 
are eligible for welfare benefits including governmentsubsidized 
housing while their cases are being decided 
the interior ministry said friday that each of the five new 
states saxony brandenburg mecklenburglower pomerania 
saxonyanhalt and thuringia must count on receiving 8000 asylum 
applicants a year starting dec 1 
although the western states say they can no longer cope the new 
eastern states face far more serious financial difficulties in 
absorbing the newcomers 
the economics and social science institute of the german trade 
union says the local governments face a shortage of more than 66 
billion to run their communities over the next four years 
the eastern state of saxony already has registered 31 refugees 
from romania poland india lebanon iraq and turkey but could 
house them only in huts on the edge of town 
the new states in eastern germany also lack social counselors 
and translators to help the asylum seekers adapt 
the liberal asylum laws were drafted in west germany after world 
war ii in light of the extermination of jews gypsies and 
foreigners in nazi death camps 
parliament has been reluctant to change the law on asylum to 
avoid charges of intolerance 
foreigners entering germany can immediately approach police and 
demand asylum they cannot be shipped back to any area of conflict 
or spot where they could face political persecution 
many asylumseekers are economic refugees 
an influx of asylumseekers in eastern germany could cause 
strains with the local population which already faces uncertainty 
because of the postcommunist economic crisis 
raised in a tightly controlled society eastern germans 
generally are less tolerant to foreigners than their counterparts 
in the west where the notion of a multicultural society is heavily 
promoted 
the german government contends that with the opening of borders 
in europe a europewide solution is needed for the asylum problem 
bonn advocates additional economic aid especially for the 
emerging democracies in eastern europe to encourage potential 
asylumseekers to stay home 
germany is especially worried about the possibility of a mass 
influx of soviet citizens fleeing economic chaos and hunger at home 
once moscow liberalizes travel laws

his later call for tax revenue increases as well as his 
statements on maternity leave and foreign policy as the reasons for 
naming him 
the citation calls attention to statements by officials that are 
grossly deceptive evasive euphemistic confusing or 
selfcontradictory said william lutz chairman of the 
organizations committee on public doublespeak 
second place went to mobil corp for calling one of its trash 
bags photodegradable even while theyre buried in landfills 
and third place went to rep newt gingrich the house minority 
whip for supporting and then opposing tax increases 
before opposing bush on the tax increase the georgia republican 
defended the presidents stand on raising taxes by saying he 
very explicitly didnt say raise taxes he said seek new 
revenues 
the white house issued no response to the award friday and a 
telephone call to gingrichs office elicited no immediate response 
mobil spokesman john lord said the company never claimed the 
bags would degrade in landfills he said the company contended that 
an environmentally safe additive speeded decomposition when the 
bags were exposed to sunlight 
he said mobil had added the reference to degradability 
because of marketing pressures but later deleted the word because 
of mounting confusion 
bushs doublespeak included statements about maternity leave 
the teachers group said 
during his campaign he said we need to assure that women 
do not have to worry about getting their jobs back after having a 
child or caring for a child during a serious illness 
but after his election bush vetoed the bill for parental and 
medical leave a white house statement said the president has 
always been opposed to the federal government mandating what every 
business in this country should do 
lutz of rutgers university also cited two examples of foreign 
policy the us response to the june 1989 massacre in beijing and 
the december invasion of panama 
after the tiananmen square killings bush announced suspension 
of us participation in all highlevel exchanges of government 
officials with china two weeks later bush secretly sent 
national security adviser brent scowcroft and deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger to china lutz said 
bush called the trip a contact not an exchange and 
resumed negotiations for arms sales to china 
lutz also said bush refused to refer to the us mission in 
panama as an invasion saying he deployed forces in operation 
just cause but at a dec 21 news conference bush said you 
could say how come you didnt tell me that you were going to 
invade the send in those troops down into panama 
the group also awarded charlotte baecher author of selling 
americas kids commercial pressures on kids of the 90s the 
committees 1990 george orwell award for honesty and clarity in 
public language

sen alan cranston actively solicited 
contributions from savings and loan owner charles h keating jr at 
times when keating wanted help with federal banking regulators the 
senate ethics committees special counsel charged today 
cranston denied any wrongdoing i engaged in no unethical 
conduct he told the committee you know that i broke no law 
cranston who is ill with prostate cancer made his first 
appearance in two days of hearings he spoke after two other 
members under investigation john mccain rariz and john glenn 
dohio issued similar declarations of innocence 
still to be heard were dennis deconcini dariz and don 
riegle dmich all five are under investigation for their links to 
keating whose lincoln savings and loan failed at an estimated cost 
to taxpayers of 2 billion 
earlier committee counsel robert s bennett outlined his case 
against cranston 
on approximately four separate occasions senator cranston 
accepted or solicited several hundred thousand dollars from mr 
keating for his campaigns or voter registration drives to which 
he was closely associated bennett said 
each of these four occasions was linked by time and 
circumstance to a request by mr keating for assistance with 
federal bank regulators bennett said 
when his turn came mccain told the committee i know i acted 
ethically and properly and in compliance with all applicable 
standards of conduct including my own 
and glenn testified that at no time did i ask for special 
treatment for anyone and at no time did i trade favors or perform 
actions in return for money 
cranston told the committee that you know that i pocketed no 
money that there was no personal gain for me or any member of my 
family i never recommended much less demanded that any 
government official do anything improper or grant any constituent 
any special favor 
yes i was persistent in expressing my concerns about the way 
bureaucrats were dealing with this large business in my state he 
said referring to lincoln which was chartered in california i 
believed that its failure if it came to that would be a 
catastrophe for countless constituents of mine 
the days hearing began on a dramatic note when cranstons 
lawyer asked that one of the six committee members sen jesse 
helms be barred from judging the california democrat 
helms speaking under oath stoutly denied the charge by 
cranston attorney william w taylor iii that he had already made up 
his mind in the case he refused to step aside and the hearings 
continued 
bennett pointed to cranstons own words in a deposition taken 
by ethics committee lawyers in which the senator freely 
acknowledged keatings access to him was in part because of his 
substantial contributions 
during his deposition senator cranston said a person who 
makes a contribution has a better chance to get access than someone 
who does not bennett recounted 
bennett said keating made a 100000 contribution to a voter 
registration project associated with cranston on march 3 1987 
less than a month before cranston and other senators met with top 
bank regulator edwin gray on behalf of keating 
that fall keating gave another 250000 and six days later 
cranston called grays successor danny wall bennett cited a memo 
to cranston from one of his fundraisers who said walls 
appointment was good news for keating the same memo said 
you should ask keating for 250000 
at the time keating was seeking to have bank regulators waive a 
rule limiting risky investments by lincoln 
bennett depicted cranston as aggressively seeking contributions 
from keating 
it was very clear senator cranston solicited contributions and 
sought contributions from mr keating bennett said 
bennett drew repeated expressions of irritation from ethics 
chairman howell heflin who suggested bennett was singling out 
cranston when many senators request contributions from donors at 
one point when bennett insisted he was being evenhanded heflin 
interjected selectively 
heflin reminded bennett he was not a prosecutor but was there to 
assist in collecting facts 
bennett replied im not tilting the facts mr chairman the 
facts tilt 
the panel is looking into any connections between 13 million 
in donations keating made to the five men or their favored causes 
and their efforts to intervene with federal regulators looking at 
the savings and loan 
bennett was expected to finish his presentation when the panel 
reconvened today but taylor first sought to have helms recuse 
himself 
he cited reports from helms recent successful reelection 
campaign in which the north carolina republican had referred to 
cranston as the leading water carrier for keating 
it appears to me that a reasonable person would conclude that 
senator helms has not only made up his mind about the issue but 
that he has already said so said taylor 
helms acknowledged making the remarks and said he did so after 
his democratic opponent in the campaign received a contribution 
from cranstons political action committee 
senator cranston injected himself into that campaign and i 
was entitled to try to eject him i make no apology for what i said 
because it was true helms said 
neither senator cranstons partisanship nor mine will play any 
role in my decision helms said if the weight of evidence 
shows that senator cranston has indeed brought discredit upon the 
senate i will vote accordingly if the evidence shows otherwise i 
will base my decision upon that

rep guy vander jagts challenger for the top 
house republican campaign post is charging financial mismanagement 
of the multimilliondollar committee and raising questions about 
payoffs to its employees 
the challenger rep don sundquist of tennessee has challenged 
vander jagt in a letter to account for money the national 
republican congressional committee has raised and spent over the 
past decade copies of the letter were circulated to all house 
republicans on thursday 
sundquists letter to the michigan congressman notes that the 
nrcc raised 285 million in the twoyear election cycle leading up 
to the nov 6 voting finished the period 25 million in debt and 
funneled only 7 percent of the money directly to candidates 
i have serious concerns about the financial management of the 
committee wrote sundquist rtenn 
sundquists letter posed 16 detailed questions to vander jagt 
including whether the committee has rules against its employees 
receiving commissions royalties dividends consulting fees 
expensive gifts the use of vacation homes or other rewards from 
committee consultants or vendors 
gary koops a spokesman for the nrcc said the committee is 
audited annually and all its contributions and spending are 
documented in reports filed with the federal election commission 
if he were serious about getting answers hed go look at 
those reports koops said of sundquist he said vander jagt has 
helped build the organization rom one with a 750000 budget in 
1975 to a 1520 million annual operation now with 13 million 
active donors 
the toughly worded challenge came just a week after house 
elections in which the republicans lost a net of nine seats and 
sank to their lowest level of strength in the chamber since 1982 
sundquist asked that vander jagt rmich reply to the 
questions by nov 27 so lawmakers can know the answers before they 
vote for nrcc chief vander jagt has held the post for 14 years 
the 167 republicans in the 102nd congress that convenes in 
january will meet at the capitol in early december to choose their 
leaders for the coming two years the race for chairman of the nrcc 
is the hottest of those contests 
sundquist began contacting colleagues a week before the 
elections and asking them to support him for the post 
the move came on the heels of a highly publicized snit between 
the white house and ed rollins vander jagts chief operative at 
the committee over an nrcc memo telling republican house 
candidates it was ok to oppose president bushs stand on the 
federal budget 
a supporter of vander jagt house gop whip newt gingrich sought 
to portray sundquists challenge as inspired by the white house as 
a vendetta against rollins but sundquist has denied it 
there was never a meeting note conversation or contact with 
the white house said sundquist spokesman ralph perrey this 
effort is coming from house members who are concerned about the way 
the committee has been run

three landlords of a building that housed a 
social club where 87 people were killed in a march arson fire are 
not criminally liable for the blaze a prosecutor has decided 
bronx district attorney robert t johnson made the announcement 
thursday after a hearing for julio gonzalez who was charged with 
178 counts of murder arson and related crimes 
during the court appearance before state justice burton b 
roberts gonzalezs lawyer richard berne repeated his plan to use 
the an insanity defense 
gonzalez was accused of splashing gasoline inside the clubs 
entrance march 25 before lighting it and causing the blaze 
immediately after the fire much discussion focused on whether 
the buildings landlords could be charged in connection with the 
fire 
but johnson said an extensive investigation had determined that 
alex dilorenzo whose corporation owned the property and jay weiss 
and morris jaffe leaseholders and managing agents were not 
criminally liable 
the prosecutor said defects and safety violations contributed 
substantially to the harm caused by the fire 
he said the three landlords took at least some steps however 
ineffectually to try to fix the violations including demanding 
that the club be closed and attempting to evict the tenant who was 
staging them 
thus there is insufficient proof that their behavior rises to 
the level of criminal conduct he said

czechoslovaks on friday excitedly 
awaited president bushs arrival on a historymaking visit 
coinciding with the first anniversary of the velvet revolution 
that toppled communist rule 
on the eve of its firstever us presidential visit prague 
officially renamed its railway station in honor of president 
woodrow wilson who encouraged a much earlier czechoslovak push for 
independence 
the simple ceremony said praque mayor jaroslav koran was a 
fitting prelude to a presidential visit that would complete the 
magic circle of usczechoslovak relations as if with a 
message from our ancestors he said the president will visit 
for the first time ever 
within the citadels of power in the postcold war prague 
government and among the populace at large excitement even 
exhileration was in the air 
its perfect 24yearold medical student tomas sklenar said 
of the timing of bushs visit american democracy is the greatest 
ideal exulted karel kren who also is studying medicine 
in anticipation of bushs arrival saturday czechoslovaks donned 
buttons showing a smiling us president with the inscription 
thank you american flags fluttered in the breeze mounted on 
elegant buildings alongside czechoslovakias national flag of 
matching red white and blue 
its good hes coming on nov 17 said zdenek matejovsky a 
32yearold waiter who waived the american flag and then impishly 
hid his face behind a mask of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
bushs trip comes at a period of substantially improved 
relations between washington and prague only a week ago the 
president signed legislation extending mostfavorednation trade 
status bush at the time called the measure an important 
milestone not only in usczechoslovak relations but also in 
reintegration into the global economy and the community of free 
nations 
earlier this fall in a meeting in new york with czech president 
vaclav havel bush announced he was lifting travel restrictions on 
czechoslovakias diplomats in the united states three months 
earlier us officials said that prague had agreed to accept us 
peace corps volunteers 
bush hosted havel at the white house and the playwright and 
former prisoner under the communist regime addressed a joint 
meeting of congress 
on friday czechoslovak officials restored wilsons place in 
this countrys history cementing ties that stretch back to when 
wilson helped his friend tomas g masaryk gain czech and slovak 
independence from the crumbling austrohungarian empire 
wilson recognized masaryks de facto government set up in 
us exile before independence masaryk a philosopher and 
acknowledged role model for havel became the first head of the new 
state in 1918 
pragues main railway station was named after wilson in 
gratitude for his help his name was dropped after the communists 
seized power in 1948 but remained customary for prague residents 
wilsons station has never stopped being wilsons station 
even when frightened communist rulers tried to wipe out all 
reference to the connections of our history with the ideals of 
american democracy koran said at the renaming ceremony 
czechs and slovaks like many other east europeans looked to 
america as a model of democracy during their four decades of 
authoritarian communist rule the turbulent history of this century 
has given czechoslovaks added reason to admire america 
caught on the crossroads of europe the two slav nations have 
traditionally looked both east and west in their effort to win and 
preserve independence 
embittered by stalinist repressions in the 1950s and the warsaw 
pact invasion that crushed communistled reform in 1968 
czechoslovaks have lost any love for the soviets who liberated the 
country from the nazis at the end of world war ii 
the betrayal of the 1938 munich agreement by which britain and 
france allowed nazi germany to annex onethird of czechoslovakias 
territory soured relations with the british and french 
nazi occupation fanned czech hatred of the germans who 
historically sought to dominate the czech lands after world war 
ii czechoslovakia brutally expelled about 25 million ethnic 
germans 
these clouded relationships with other western nations adds to 
the respect for america which found voice on the streets of prague 
friday 
i know that in america hes not very popular with the budget 
deficit and some other problems sklenar said but mr reagan 
former president ronald could not come here so its perfect that 
mr bush does 
the czechoslovaks have said that bush asked to attend saturdays 
anniversary 
we are happy a banner draped from a balcony proclaimed

the marine corps is beefing up its ground 
assault strength in saudi arabia by equipping a reinforcement unit 
with new m1a1 battle tanks officials said friday 
the two marine tank battalions already in the persian gulf area 
are equipped with 1960sdesigned m60 tanks which are lighter and 
not as well protected 
the marines decided shortly after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
to speed up a previously planned switch from the m60 tanks to the 
m1a1 the most modern us battle tank said lt col ron stokes 
a marine corps spokesman 
similarly the army recently began substituting m1a1s held in 
storage in europe for its older m1 tanks deployed in saudi arabia 
and it is expected to have more than 1000 of the topoftheline 
tanks in the area by the end of the year 
iraq has about 3500 tanks in and around kuwait according to 
the pentagon however only about 600 are believed to be the 
modern sovietdesigned t72 model 
strokes said the 2nd tank battalion now being trained on the 
m1a1 in the united states will deploy to the gulf with 58 of the 
modern tanks as part of a huge wave of marine reinforcements for 
operation desert shield over the next several weeks 
the approximately 45000 marines in saudi arabia and afloat on 
amphibious assault ships have about 140 m60 tanks there are no 
immediate plans to switch those to m1a1s 
the marines had been scheduled to start getting m1a1s next 
february or march but the gulf buildup led marine corps leaders 
to speed up the transition stokes said 
besides being shielded with better armor than older tanks the 
m1a1s 120mm gun provides greater firepower and its 
overpressure system provides more protection against attack 
from chemical biological or nuclear agents

slaying of another woman was tied to both deaths officials said 
the remains found sunday in the northeast kansas field were 
identified thursday as those of patricia diane rose 31 of st 
joseph 
an autopsy showed she died of blows to the head said st joseph 
police spokesman sgt jim connors 
the body of crystal lynn simmons 33 also of st joseph was 
found in the field monday about 400 yards from the remains of ms 
rose ms simmons also died of blows to the head officials said 
marvin l irvin 41 was charged with murder in ms simmons 
death authorities said he probably also will be charged with a 
second count 
we have both physical and witness evidence that would link 
irvin with ms rose said dwight scroggins the buchanan 
county mo prosecutor 
the farm where the women were buried is near property once owned 
by irvins family 
authorities say irvin also was a suspect in the disappearance of 
another st joseph woman micki jo west 19 who has been missing 
since 1979 
irvin was held without bond in buchanan county on a parole 
violation charge in iowa he was convicted in 1988 of threatening a 
jefferson iowa woman 
irvins attorney sought a gag order thursday to prevent st

trial said buchanan county public defender timothy d ernst 
there are allegations of other crimes he has not been charged 
with 
a hearing on the gag order was set for wednesday in buchanan 
county 
patricia roses sister vickie fadden said her family was 
relieved that their waiting was over 
i feel that we are lucky that they found her fadden said

twelve new governors are learning the ins 
and outs of their offices from their veteran colleagues during a 
national governors association seminar 
its the nuances of how you deal with your schedule how you 
involve your spouse how you use state facilities how you deal 
with security washington gov booth gardner explained to 
reporters friday 
the organization held its first seminar in 1968 and has held one 
every two years since this session began thursday and continues 
through sunday 
they seem excited gardner said while the closeddoor 
training sessions were conducted my view is governors today are 
more and more coming in with a broader background and a greater 
realization that a government is a service organization 
he added that new governors coming from the private sector must 
learn to include constituents in the decisionmaking process 
when you realize that you represent the entire public he 
said you owe it to the entire public to allow them access to 
government and an opportunity to be heard 
the seminars host kentucky gov wallace wilkinson said he 
missed out on a seminar because he was elected in 1987 during an 
off year 
wilkinson urged the new governors to retain that vision that 
you communicated so well while campaigning 
gardner stressed the importance of a good relationship between a 
governor and the legislature he said a legislative liaison is 
perhaps the most important hire they can have after a scheduler 
anything you want to do in terms of vision or planning is 
dependent on your ability to access successfully with the 
legislatures and get legislation passed he said 
governorselect attending the meeting are from florida georgia 
illinois kansas massachusetts michigan nebraska ohio

regular part of the diet among french and other continental 
europeans

freshly butchered horse meat when are we going to supply it 
sadly we are going to supply it after 1992 because in 1992 
it will once again become legal to transport live british horses to 
the continent for slaughter the ad said the export was banned 30 
years ago on the grounds of cruelty to animals 
earlier this year the animal protection group shocked many 
newspaper readers with advertisements showing a pile of dead dogs 
to try to win support for a dog registration scheme to reduce the 
number of strays the advertising standards authority did not 
criticize that ad 
but caroline crawford the authoritys spokeswoman said it 
intervened in the latest case because this particular 
advertisement we felt was likely to cause unnecessary offense and 
distress to the public at large 
gavin grant of the royal society for the prevention of cruelty 
to animals countered that the seriousness and importance of the 
subject matter unarguably warranted such an approach 
threequarters of a million live british animals including 
sheep already travel for more than a day without food and water 
often arriving exhausted battered or dead the prospect of 
horses joining that is appalling grant told british broadcasting

gov gaston caperton undergoes wild 
mood swings and at times becomes so depressed that he cancels his 
days schedule said an exaide who caperton fired earlier this 
week after a shoving match 
gc morse a former press aide said caperton has some 
problems but i dont know exactly what they are 
all i know is that they are causing great harm to the state 
and himself there are some dark things happening morse was 
quoted as saying in fridays the heralddispatch of huntington 
morse said capertons mood swings are incredible there 
have been days when he came into his office and decided he didnt 
want to do anything so his schedule would simply be wiped off 
capertons communications director bob brunner dismissed 
morses comments as coming from a bitter and disillusioned 
exemployee who is trying to taint an entire administration 
with his own ineptitude 
morse 41 and caperton 50 shoved one another wednesday after 
morse was fired from a 58000ayear job as a position paper 
writer for the division of energy 
morse a distant cousin of the governors said he challenged 
caperton on reasons the governor was giving for firing larry 
george the former energy commissioner and that prompted the 
pushing the incident ended when a state trooper grabbed morse 
george said he was dismissed as energy commissioner in a 
disagreement over the duties of the no 2 man in the division of 
energy william willis caperton described willis as a personal 
friend who has his wholehearted support 
caperton hired morse in january to replace press secretary steve 
cohen morse was ousted in august over a conflict in philosophy 
with the governor morse transferred to the division of energy 
caperton a millionaire businessman defeated gov arch a moore 
jr in the 1988 election to win his first term caperton and his 
first wife dee ended their 23year marriage in a messy divorce 
last fall in may caperton married rachael worby conductor of the 
wheeling symphony orchestra 
morse said the changes are affecting capertons actions 
including a recent trip and his opinions 
i think theres something to the fact that he got all the way 
to san francisco last weekend on his trip to japan then turned 
around and came back morse said i know it was reported he was 
physically ill but when i saw him wednesday morning he 
certainly didnt look ill to me

thousands of tiny wasps were unleashed on a 
texas field this week as growers look for new ways to control a 
pesticideresistant caterpillar that leaves cabbage heads so full 
of holes they look like lace 
four species of wasps some smaller than the head of a pin were 
sprinkled across a commercial field of cabbage in the rio grande 
valley on thursday 
if successful against the caterpillars growers may see the 
benefits of using the wasps on other crops such as broccoli 
cauliflower and kale said don nordlund a research entomologist at 
the usdas agricultural research service in weslaco texas 
because consumers also want more pesticidefree produce we 
may be able to start convincing growers to switch to this approach 
after this first crop nordlund said friday 
he said caterpillars of the diamondback moth the cabbage 
patchs worst insect enemy are resistant to almost all available 
insecticides 
insects have been used to control pests on the valleys citrus 
and sugar cane crops but nordlund said wasps have never been 
tested on a commercial cabbage crop in texas growers showed little 
interest when wasps were tried elsewhere in the early 1970s and 
the diamondback moth has since become resistant to pesticides 
according to entomologist k duane biever of the agricultural 
research services fruit and vegetable research unit in yakima 
wash the wasps lay eggs inside the caterpillars 
the larvae that hatch from those eggs feed off their 
caterpillar host eventually killing it he said the wasps 
however do not sting people or animals 
biever said the nipping and gnawing pests cause more than 35 
million in damage annually to cabbage crops nationwide 
the caterpillars leave cabbage heads so full of holes they 
look like lace said ma maedgen jr president of biofac the 
texas company that supplies the wasps

sudden heart rejection caused the death of 
13yearold stormie jones six years after she became the worlds 
first heartliver transplant recipient doctors said friday 
the autopsy results surprised stormies doctors who said heart 
rejection was rare so many years after a transplant 
ive never seen it occur or reported in the literature said 
dr f jay fricker stormies cardiologist at childrens hospital 
no one expected to see any rejection in stormie he said 
after all we had a track record of more than six years of never 
seeing any heart rejection so why would we suddenly see it now 
stormie died sunday at childrens hospital where she had her 
historic operation feb 14 1984 after being rushed from her home 
in white settlement texas with a sore throat and fever she is to 
be buried saturday in her hometown 
fricker said it would take doctors months to determine if at 
all what caused the sudden rejection 
doctors would not speculate about whether fk506 an 
experimental antirejection drug stormie began receiving last 
november a second liver transplant underwent last february or 
treatment for recurring hepatitis had anything to do with the 
rejection 
she was on the appropriate medications at the appropriate 
dosages said dr jorge reyes a liver transplant surgeon but 
obviously if she developed a rejection she broke through these 
medications 
each patient metabolizes drugs at different rates and 
their immune systems can be stimulated to different degrees he 
said particularly patients like stormie who had another process 
ongoing hepatitis you have to balance it even further its not 
an easy thing to do 
stormie last had a heart checkup 11 months ago by her doctors in 
dallas and was scheduled to undergo another within the next few 
months fricker said the checkup showed no abnormalities he said 
the girl needed the transplant because of hypocholesteremia a 
rare genetic disorder that prevented her body from processing 
cholesterol her sister misty suffers from a milder form of the 
disease 
for five years after her first transplant stormie had few major 
medical problems her setbacks began in october 1988 when she 
returned to pittsburgh for surgery to remove a bile duct 
obstruction 
she underwent a mild episode of liver rejection in november 1989 
and began receiving fk506 which is being tested at the university 
of pittsburgh instead of the traditional antirejection drug 
cyclosporine 
a bout with hepatitis in february slowly damaged her liver 
requiring a second liver transplant but postsurgery studies 
showed no evidence of heart problems fricker said 
stormie began rejecting the second liver in may and was treated 
with an increased fk506 dosage a month later she received 
medication to combat yet another bout of hepatitis 
recent flulike symptoms were the only indication something was 
wrong 
if she had gotten here earlier we would have suspected some 
heart dysfunction and instituted appropriate treatment 
fricker said 
still reyes said he considered the double transplant a success 
when you think that she lived for almost seven years then 
i think this was an inherent success because she had the 
opportunity to live to share things not only with her family but 
the world

president bush on friday signed into law a 
bill barring us mineral activities in antarctica for the time 
being although his administration opposes a permanent ban 
the antarctic protection act of 1990 was one of eight measures 
bush signed friday that are intended to also protect the 
environment in the florida keys louisiana new jersey the nevada 
desert and coastal regions as well as provide money for global 
warming research clean up the great lakes and provide grants for 
environmental education 
the antarctic law will ban indefinitely us mineral activities 
in the region until a new international minerals agreement is 
approved by congress that agreement would first have to be worked 
out by an international conference 
bushs action came three days before the start of a conference 
in chile where 24 countries will take up the future of antarctica 
environmental groups have urged the president to commit the 
united states to joining other nations including france australia 
and new zealand that want to make a permanently protected world 
park in the frozen continent 
us officials say they oppose the permanent ban urging instead 
an international compact for a limited moratorium on oil drilling 
and other minerals development 
they said a longterm moratorium was the preferred middle ground 
between those nations wanting to block mining forever and those 
like the united states unwilling to rule it out 
environmentalists claim that the indefinite ban merely gives 
industry time to prepare the technology for eventual development 
and mining 
but the white house touted bushs action on friday as 
advocating a forceful environmental protection agreement to 
supplement the antarctic treaty that has been in effect since 
1959 
clearly all of us must work together to preserve americas 
natural beauty bush said at a ceremony on the south lawn of the 
white house to sign the antarctic bill and seven others 
he also signed measures to 
establish the florida keys national marine sanctuary 
designating 2600 square miles off the keys as a national marine 
sanctuary 
establish national wildlife refuges in the 18000acre bayou 
cocodrie in louisiana and the 7500acre walkill river area of new 
jersey and fund additional marine research programs and stepped up 
enforcement by the environmental protection agency 
designate 83100 acres in southern nevadas mojave desert as 
the red rock canyon national conservation area 
nearly triple the size of the coastal barrier resource system 
by adding 818000 acres to the system along the atlantic gulf of 
mexico and great lakes coasts the measure also limits federal 
funds for development within the coastal barrier areas and requires 
that any federal property in the coastal barrier regions be 
transferred to the system 
provide grants and training to teachers for environmental 
education and create an office of environmental education at the 
environmental protection agency 
fund research on the global warming trend the administration 
bucking many of its allies contends there is insufficient 
scientific data to confirm that the earth is slowly warming due to 
gaseous emissions rather than committing itself to a reduction of 
those gases the administration is putting more money into 
research 
assist in the cleanup of toxic pollution in the great lakes and 
lake champlain

irans foreign minister said friday after 
returning from iraq that saddam hussein had not ruled out 
withdrawing from kuwait 
the iranian official ali akbar velayati spoke in an interview 
with tehran television a day after returning from a twoday visit 
to baghdad he met twice with his iraqi counterpart tariq aziz 
and once with saddam 
the lack of a joint communique by the nations foes during the 
198088 gulf war indicated the talks were chilly 
asked about the effects of the un economic sanctions velayati 
said the iraqi government itself did not try to conceal that the 
sanctions have after all affected them he did not elaborate 
velayati said it seemed baghdad had not decided whether it would 
keep kuwait 
one cannot say with certainty that it will go either way 
staying in kuwait and putting into practice the annexation of 
kuwait or the withdrawal from kuwait he said in the television 
interview monitored in nicosia 
velayati said he stressed that iran believes international 
borders are inviolable 
we did not prevaricate although we preserved the positive 
trend of our talks we stressed to them our principle that as 
the islamic republic we recognized and still recognize kuwait as 
an independent country 
we believe that kuwaits independence must be returned to 
it he said 
iran and iraq remained enemies until august when saddam 
unexpectedly agreed to irans conditions for a formal settlement of 
the 198088 war analysts said he was seeking to pacify his eastern 
flank to focus on the standoff with the usled multinational 
forces deployed in the gulf region after iraq seized kuwait 
iran and iraq reopened embassies in each others capitals last 
month

mikhail s gorbachev said he would fire government 
and military officials blocking his reform plans and his chief 
rival demanded the resignation of the central government to rescue 
the economy and hold the soviet union together 
gorbachev spoke with hardly any applause to an angry soviet 
legislature that demanded an accounting of where his reforms were 
going rival boris yeltsin president of the russian federation 
then took the floor to urge that prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
resign 
the gorbachevyeltsin power struggle showed the two leaders were 
still far from resolving their differences and ending the paralysis 
of power in the soviet union 
yeltsin had said after a private meeting wth gorbachev on 
sunday that the two leaders would form committees to work out a 
powersharing agreement creating hope for a unified effort to end 
the countrys economic crisis 
but gorbachev told the supreme soviet legislature that sundays 
meeting was merely routine and he refused to give the russian 
leader more national power 
dropping his usually robust voice to a nearwhisper in the 
cavernous chamber gorbachev said in a coalition government if 
the russian government gets any more power it will mean 
discrimination against the other republics 
yeltsin sat stonefaced through gorbachevs speech he later 
took the floor and demanded that gorbachev agree within two weeks 
to form a new extraordinary anticrisis committee that would 
govern in place of ryzhkov and his council of ministers 
the committee which would amount to a new cabinet would 
include representatives of all 15 republics it would take 
immediate steps to provide more food for the country buying it 
from the west if necessary yeltsin said 
the economic and political crisis in the country has come to a 
head he told the 542member supreme soviet the peoples 
patience has ended and an explosion could occur at any time 
facing a disintegrating economy and secessionist movements in 
several republics the lawmakers abandoned their agenda on 
wednesday and demanded that gorbachev report to them on the state 
of the union and on his relations with yeltsin 
yeltsin was dropped from the communist party politburo in 1987 
after criticizing gorbachevs reforms as too slow he has been the 
presidents chief political rival for more than a year and 
consistently ranks above gorbachev in public opinion polls 
the two agreed in august to cooperate on economic reforms but 
the agreement collapsed and their power struggle intensified last 
month when gorbachev won the supreme soviets approval for a 
compromise economic reform plan 
the russian parliament headed by yeltsin vowed to push ahead 
with a more radical plan to switch to a free market in 500 days 
starting nov 1 
since then gorbachevs national government and the russian 
parliament have issued conflicting orders that have effectively 
stopped either from advancing their programs 
yeltsin was elected earlier this year as president of the 
russian republic which includes twothirds of the soviet land 
mass about half its 285 million people and huge mineral wealth 
but the kremlin still controls the nations finances and its 
economic and military policy 
gorbachevs 90minute address received a generally cool 
reception in the legislative hall which was packed with visiting 
military and republic leaders 
soviet television broadcast the speech in full but did not 
carry yeltsins remarks 
gorbachev admitted that the country faces critical shortages at 
the start of winter but he insisted the government has adequate 
plans to maintain supplies he lashed out at disruptive forces 
that hinder the consolidation of society and the countrys exit 
from the crisis 
he told the lawmakers he would replace some military and 
government officials who were blocking his economic reforms he 
said the plan to get rid of outdated clearly useless 
structures would be submitted to the legislature within 10 days 
gorbachev did not spell out the changes but said they had the 
approval of ryzhkov indicating that the embattled prime minister 
would not be among those replaced 
gorbachev also promised changes in the top echelon of the 
armed forces command 
he rejected persistent rumors of a military coup and pounding 
the lectern said people were spreading rumors to discredit the 
army we cannot discredit the armed forces because we need them 
now to maintain stability in the country he said 
gorbachevs plans for developing a market economy hinge on the 
republics remaining in the union and he has proposed a treaty that 
would give them a degree of autonomy while leaving national 
economic and military power in kremlin hands 
nearly all the republics and many smaller regions have declared 
some form of sovereignty from the kremlin the baltic states 
georgia and the ukraine have said they will not sign the union 
treaty 
the president cannot be just on his own just as you cannot 
settle many questions without his participation and without his 
powers gorbachev pleaded lets act together 
a few deputies applauded that statement but they did not clap 
at the end 
gorbachev left the floor without answering questions and 
deputies took microphones to complain that he had not addressed 
their concerns about the economy

a state representative charged in an 
alleged checkkiting scheme became the fourth missouri legislator 
this year to be indicted on federal charges 
a grand jury in kansas city on thursday indicted fourterm rep 
henry rizzo dkansas city who ran unopposed for reelection last 
week and easily won his brother john t rizzo and a former 
business associate raymond e agee also were indicted 
us attorney jean paul bradshaw a republican said rizzos 
indictment on 17 felony counts of fraud was unrelated to his work 
as a legislator 
rizzo 37 disagreed 
i guess its the year of the politician he said thursday 
after being released on a signature bond i think this was 
brought because i am a democrat and an elected official 
bradshaw said rizzo and his codefendants face identical charges 
of writing bad checks from may to august 1989 on accounts from two 
defunct businesses they managed 
rizzo said he is innocent 
it was a business it went out of business and we did the 
best we could with it it was a bad situation but it was certainly 
not criminal he said 
earlier this year two other democratic lawmakers rep ej 
lucky cantrell of st louis and sen ed quick of kansas city 
were tried by bradshaws office on felony labor corruption charges 
quick was acquitted cantrell who was found guilty of 
conspiring to steal union money has appealed and is awaiting 
sentencing 
federal prosecutors in st louis won three federal felony drug 
convictions during the summer against rep dewey crump dmaryland 
heights he is due to be sentenced nov 30 
cantrell and crump lost reelection bids nov 6 quicks seat is 
not up for election until 1992 
house speaker bob griffin dcameron said rizzos indictment 
wouldnt help the legislatures image its not the greatest year 
weve ever had he said 
house ethics committee chairman doug harpool dspringfield 
said rizzos indictment was still another shadow over the 
legislature 
a house member convicted of a felony faces expulsion upon 
sentencing harpool said his committee also can recommend that the 
house suspend a member while a criminal investigation is pending 
i want to handle it consistent with what we did in the crump 
and cantrell cases harpool said it might be appropriate to 
get a complaint and to educate ourselves on the issues surrounding 
the allegations 
the ethics committee opted to defer disciplinary action against 
crump and cantrell until their trials were over

here are excerpts from fridays opening 
statements as senators under investigation for allegedly unethical 
conduct in the savings and loan debacle denied accusations against 
them 
sen john mccain rariz 
charlie keating was a political friend and supporter from 1981 
to 1987 when he came to see me in march of 1987 and asked me to do 
something i thought was improper i said no when he asked me 
to negotiate for him i said no the only thing i said i could do 
was to inquire whether american continental corp and lincoln 
savings were being treated fairly 
on april 9th i joined other senators in senator deconcinis 
office to meet with these san francisco regulators 
i learned at this meeting that lincolns complaints of bad 
treatment from the regulators were unfounded and that there would 
be a criminal referral to the justice department against lincoln 
i neither solicited nor accepted any campaign contributions 
from mr keating or american continental employees my relationship 
with mr keating was ended over and theres nothing more 
i know i acted ethically and properly and in compliance with 
all applicable standards of conduct including my own 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
sen john glenn dohio 
there are no facts as yet unrevealed there are no surprises 
in store for you when these hearings are over my conduct will 
no longer be the subject of speculation of gossip and of innuendo 
 
the truth is that at no time did i pare my principles or 
compromise my convictions at no time did i ask for special 
treatment for anyone and at no time did i trade favors or perform 
actions in return for money i acted honorably i behaved honestly 
and i have neither tainted my own reputation nor tarnished the 
reputation of this body 
i believe that a crucial part of my job as a us senator is 
to ensure that federal regulators and bureaucrats are treating 
people fairly 
i will and in the case of lincoln did ask for fair 
treatment but i will not and in the case of lincoln did not ask 
that a specific action be taken or that rules or regulations be 
interpreted simply to benefit a particular individual or company 
 
i have never accepted contributions from anyone who so much as 
implies even indirectly that their contribution is linked to a 
request for my assistance 
in 1984 mr keating apparently arranged for contributions to 
help retire my presidential campaign debt and in that same year i 
sent letters to the bank board asking that it delay implementation 
of the socalled direct investment rule until congress could 
fully consider the issue 
but when i signed those letters neither i nor my assistant 
who staffed this issue knew of mr keatings contributions

the man who hopes to take prime minister margaret 
thatchers job away from her took his attack on her governments 
unpopular local tax to scotland on friday 
mrs thatcher spent the day in northern ireland where she 
visited british troops in a visit her office said was planned a 
month ago 
i believe we shall win and i hope we shall win well she 
told reporters who asked about the leadership battle 
conservative party members of the house of commons will vote 
tuesday on whether to retain mrs thatcher as head of the party or 
to replace her with former defense minister michael heseltine if 
she loses she also must give up the prime ministers post 
heseltine continued to attack the local tax imposed by her 
government saying it could cost the conservative party the next 
general elections which must be held by mid1992 
a tactical question about the leadership vote arose when foreign 
secretary douglas hurd said he support mrs thatcher but refused to 
rule out the possibility that he might jump into the race if it 
isnt settled on the first ballot 
frontpage stories in the independent and the daily telegraph on 
friday said that a substantial number of conservative party 
lawmakers would prefer that hurd take over as prime minister 
he would have the opportunity to run only if the first round is 
inconclusive 
to win in the first round mrs thatcher or heseltine needs 15 
percent more votes than the other if all 372 tory lawmakers vote 
it takes 214 votes to win 
if the secondplace candidate gets at least 159 votes there 
would have to be a second ballot on nov 27 and other candidates 
would be free to enter 
heseltine said in an interview with bbc radio that it stood to 
reason then that if people believe hurd is the best candidate the 
lawmakers must vote for heseltine to open the way for a second 
round of balloting 
addressing a rally in the scottish town of lanark heseltine 
declared that the percapita local tax supported by mrs thatcher 
could lead to defeat for the conservative party in the next general 
election 
the socalled poll tax is set by local governments with a 
single charge for rich and poor it replaces the property tax and 
for many households it has meant a higher tax burden 
heseltines contention that he has a better chance than mrs 
thatcher of leading the party to victory was supported by a poll 
published friday in the times of london 
the poll by market and opinion research international showed 
the conservatives trailing labor by 4 points with mrs thatcher as 
leader but vaulting 10 points ahead of labor with heseltine the 
survey was based on 1088 interviews conducted on thursday 
polls earlier in the week also showed that the general public 
prefers heseltine but conservative voters overwhelmingly support 
mrs thatcher 
the only voters who will settle the leadership issue however 
are the 372 conservative members of the house of commons

rioters seizing their chance from a student protest 
smashed shop windows vandalized cars and battled police on friday 
after a park sitin ended peacefully in the shadow of the eiffel 
tower 
riot police hurled tear gas grenades and charged rockthrowing 
hooligans who began their rampage as 3500 high school students 
concluded their demonstration on the champs de mars 
twenty policemen were slightly injured and about 48 people were 
arrested police said 
the troublemakers scattered into surrounding neighborhoods 
breaking three store windows pillaging a drycleaning shop and 
damaging 25 cars overturning two of them police said 
there was nowhere near the violence that took place last monday 
when hundreds of young toughs on the fringes of a 100000strong 
student march looted shops destroyed 190 cars and fought pitched 
battles with police that melee injured 234 officers 
leaders of the two main student movements subsequently decided 
to hold a sitin on friday instead of a potentially more violent 
march 
students hoisting banners with the names of their schools filed 
quietly into a park few actually sat down on the grass wet from 
rain 
they are demanding more teachers smaller classes more 
innovative instruction repairs to facilities and better security 
on schoolgrounds 
the sitin area bordered highpriced apartment homes and

no 1 plus selections from the works of goldmark weber berlioz 
and wagner

abul abbas the dissident palestinian 
wanted in the west for terrorism said friday that us interests 
around the world will be attacked if war breaks out in the persian 
gulf 
speaking on algerian television abbas said the number of us 
forces in the gulf region surpasses what is needed to fulfill their 
official mission 
the american presence does not target the defense of kuwait or 
that of oil wells he said it targets the destruction of the 
iraqi potential 
if the usa starts a war in the gulf it should expect 
that its interests in the region and in other parts of the world 
would be hit he said 
abbas who heads a palestinian group based in iraq is wanted by 
the united states for the october 1985 attack on the achille lauro 
oceanliner in which a wheelchairbound passenger leon klinghoffer 
of new york was killed 
about 330000 allied soldiers including 230000 americans are 
in saudi arabia and the region to counter iraq us officials are 
now sending 200000 more troops there saying they want to maintain 
an offensive capability

washington is consulting with its 
allies on whether to seek a un resolution authorizing the use of 
force to drive iraq out of kuwait us secretary of state james a 
baker iii said friday 
on friday baker met with top officials of the european 
community he is to fly to geneva on saturday to gather support for 
such a resolution from the foreign ministers of ethiopia zaire and 
the ivory coast 
backing from those countries would give the united states 
broader approval among neutral and third world countries 
baker was later to travel to paris for talks with the foreign 
ministers of finland and romania during a threeday paris gathering 
of the 34nation conference on security and european cooperation 
which begins monday 
all five countries are members of the 15nation un security 
council which would have to approve any resolution on the use of 
force against iraq 
at the united nations diplomats said baker was trying to 
persuade security council foreign ministers to come to new york to 
adopt a resolution authorizing force to drive iraq from kuwait 
foreign ministers occupy their countrys seats on the council only 
in grave situations 
baker told reporters friday that american officials have made no 
final decision to seek any resolution on using military might 
against iraq 
we are in the continuing process of consulting with our 
coalition partners about whether or not that might be something we 
should do he said 
even so the united states appears prepared to introduce the 
resolution this month while its diplomat presides over the 
council yemen a proiraqi member of the 15nation council holds 
the presidency for december 
baker said iraqi president saddam hussein should understand that 
force was a credible option if he does not withdraw from kuwait 
which his forces invaded aug 2 
unless that message gets through to baghdad we really are 
pessimistic about whether or not the political and peaceful 
solution that we desire can really be obtained he said 
baker brushed aside a suggestion thursday from soviet envoy 
yevgeny primakov that a flexible linkage be drawn between an 
iraqi pullout and a conference to settle the israelipalestinian 
dispute 
saddam has demanded an iraqi pullout from kuwait be tied to a 
solution for the palestinian question president bush has said iraq 
must unconditionally withdraw but that other issues could be 
discussed after kuwait is freed 
baker said the united states shares a common position on iraq 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and his foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
they have agreed he said that there should be no rewards for 
aggression and no partial solutions to the problem and that we 
should not link this gulf issue with other issues 
he suggested primakov may have been speaking for himself and not 
for the soviet government 
france china and the soviet union have indicated they would 
like more time to give economic sanctions and diplomacy a chance to 
work before adopting any resolution authorizing force against iraq

beverly enterprises inc the nations largest 
nursing home chain has been found guilty of unfair labor practices 
in a ruling organized labor hailed friday as a major victory that 
could affect other corporate giants 
the fort smith arkbased chain said the ruling handed down 
by an administrative law judge would be appealed to the national 
labor relations board 
at issue was a 1987 nlrb case in which the government accused 
the company of engaging in 40 illegal acts designed to defeat 
workers rights to organize a union 
on face value we dont agree with the decision we have 
good relationships with all of our unions said bill ihle a 
beverly spokesman 
in the ruling made public friday administrative law judge 
martin linsky found beverly guilty of unfair labor practices at 33 
facilities in 12 states and ordered the chain to reinstate and 
provide back pay to workers who had been illegally fired for union 
activity 
linsky also issued a cease and desist order that requires 
all of beverlys 860 nursing homes to post for 60 days notices of 
the companys labor law violations and its workers rights to 
unionize 
this decision is a great victory for the tens of thousands of 
workers at beverly nursing homes many of whom lost jobs endured 
years of harassment and were denied their right to union 
representation said john sweeney president of the service 
employees international union 
the union said other american businesses could be affected too 
because now the nlrb might be able to hold a single corporation 
responsible for labor aw violations at its separate facilities 
the ruling could trigger critical new protections for workers 
of the future said sweeney whose union represents more than 
3000 workers at 50 beverly nursing homes 
in the nlrbs original 1987 case officials alleged that beverly 
had fired more than 25 union supporters and threatened to close 
nursing homes if employees unionized the government said other 
violations included physical assaults by beverly managers on union 
supporters and organizers and promises of benefits to discourage 
unionization 
the original complaint was filed in pittsburgh and consolidated 
dozens of separate charges raised by four unions since august 1986 
at 20 beverlyowned facilities in pennsylvania michigan 
minnesota texas and washington state 
specific charges included that beverly fired 17 workers at its 
fayette health care center in uniontown pa in 1986 for wearing 
union buttons the fired workers were reinstated three months later 
after the nlrb threatened to get a court injunction against the 
company 
at the time beverly was based in pasadena calif 
in his ruling linsky said the simple fact is that beverlys 
unfair labor practices were egregious took place over several 
years at numerous locations and clearly manifest a proclivity to 
violate federal labor law 
linsky found that beverly engaged in several illegal activities 
including unlawful threats interrogations promises or grants of 
benefits and surveillance

for the fifth time this year delegates met under portuguese 
government mediation to seek a ceasefire that would lead to 
multiparty elections in the southwest african nation

sessions held at a school near the coastal resort of estoril 16

mango a rebel negotiator said groundwork could be laid for a 
truce agreement by the end of the year 
the popular movement for the liberation of angola or mpla and 
the national union of the total independence of angola unita were 
among three rival guerrilla groups who fought portugal until 
angolas 1975 independence 
with the departure of the portuguese the mpla emerged the 
strongest group and took power since then unita with us and 
south african support has been fighting the mpla in a war has left 
an estimated 340000 dead 
steps toward peace began last year when cuba began a phased

the bush administration is studying the 
possibility of reducing government benefits paid to affluent 
americans in a variety of programs but not social security white 
house budget director richard darman said friday 
darman said that as part of the preparation of bushs new 
budget the administration was taking a look at benefits paid to 
people at several income levels 
he said that in the 1980s there had been significant cuts in 
welfare programs for the poor but he said those cuts left 
untouched the big government programs which distribute benefits not 
on the basis of income but based on other requirements spelled out 
in law 
we might present recommendations for trying to change that 
distribution of benefits darman said 
he specifically mentioned subsidy payments to farmers and the 
giant medicare program which provides health care for the elderly 
but darman said that news stories quoting unnamed sources as 
saying that social security benefits might be trimmed were in 
error 
darman said that report was mistaken in suggesting that we 
were thinking of tinkering with social security we are not doing 
that as part of this review but everything else is certainly in 
the equation 
darman made his remarks during an appearance before the council 
for excellence in government 
on another topic darman predicted that the budget deficit for 
the current fiscal year will climb to an alltime high despite the 
fiveyear deficitcutting agreement passed by congress last month 
darman said the red ink would most likely fall in a range 
between 250 billion and 300 billion 
the deficit for the 1990 fiscal year which ended on sept 30 
was 2204 billion just short of the alltime high of 2211 
billion set in 1986 
darman said that a variety of factors including the weakening 
economy and the uncertain situation in the middle east were 
combining to make the deficit rise 
the economys weakness was brought home to the white house this 
week in a series of meetings president bush held with his own 
advisers and a group of 20 top executives brought in to brief the 
president on economic conditions 
darman who attended the sessions said that the general 
consensus among both the presidents advisers and the outside 
experts was that the country was in a downturn a word bush himself 
used in an interview thursday night on cnn 
in that interview bush acknowledged for the first time the 
possibility of a recession but he insisted that any slump was 
likely to be mild and short 
most seem to feel that if we have a recession it will not be 
deep and that well come out of it relatively soon six months at 
most and i would like to think that is true the president said 
amoco corp chairman dickmarrow told reporters after fridays 
session with the president there is a general feeling that we 
are either in a recession or very close 
darman said the purpose of the four meetings bush has held on 
the economy in the past week was to develop a strategy for 
cushioning the shock of any downturn 
he said the president will probably make recommendations for 
stimulating economic growth in his budget due to be submitted to 
congress in february darman said that decisions on what types of 
programs to include would be made by bush at the earliest in 
late december

president bush on friday signed into law 
measures to upgrade airport security and to encourage volunteerism 
and community service 
bush signed the bills as he hurried to finish domestic business 
before an eightday foreign trip 
the aviation security improvement act of 1990 directs the 
government to develop guidelines to warn passengers of terrorist 
threats 
it implements safety recommendations of the commission on 
aviation security and terrorism appointed by bush after the bombing 
of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland 
the bill sets regulations on airport use of metal detection 
devices it requires airlines airports and travel agents to relay 
any security threat immediately to government officials 
airline and airport employees with access to security areas will 
have to undergo background checks and new training 
in signing the bill bush said he had reservations about a 
provision requiring the state department to negotiate agreements 
with other nations to achieve the enhanced security measures at 
foreign airports 
bush said he believed that provision intruded on his 
presidential authority to conduct foreign policy and said he would 
direct officials to interpret it so as not to conflict with that 
authority 
the national community service act of 1990 provides 287 million 
for community service programs including 5 million to begin a 
thousand points of light foundation to encourage volunteerism 
taking its name from bushs phrase for volunteers 
it provides money for programs encouraging youth community 
service through schools or community organizations grants to state 
education agencies expansion of youth corps teams for such 
projects as environmental cleanup and helping the poor and a test 
program for a civilian national service corps that would provide 
5000 in education assistance in return for a years fulltime 
service at a subsistence wage 
bush signed the measure despite attacks by republicans that it 
included wasteful spending at a time when the government was 
raising taxes and budget constraints prevented full funding 
existing programs for children and the poor 
bush also on friday signed the excellence in mathematics 
science and engineering education act to establish a variety of 
fellowships training programs and grants to foster and improve 
education in those fields the bill authorizes 150 million for 
such programs in 1991 
the president vetoed the indian preference act of 1990 which 
would have established a program to direct contracts and grants to 
indian enterprises bush said the bill would impose new 
expensive and often duplicative program responsibilities on the 
interior department which administers indian reservations 
bush said in a statement that he supports the bills goals and 
is committed to helping alleviate the widespread unemployment and 
underemployment on indian reservations 
he said the bills issues deserve a full airing in both houses 
of congress 
he said he would direct interior secretary manuel lujan to take 
steps to address problems with contracting programs involving 
indian enterprises 
bush took the action before departing friday night for prague 
the first stop of an eightday trip that will also take him to 
paris saudi arabia and egypt

officials of a japanese city bidding for the 1998 
winter olympics said friday they have asked schools and libraries 
to get rid of the little black sambo character which has been 
attacked as racist 
it is important for a better international reputation for 
nagano said a municipal official in speaking about the move 
the municipal office in nagano central japan late last month 
requested that the citys schools and libraries destroy all books 
pictures and educational tools involving little black sambo 
sambo originally meaning a person who was half indian and half 
black has been used as a degrading name for blacks for decades 
nagano city maintains everything that carries the word sambo 
or pictures of the boy should be banned regardless of content but 
naganos library officials said references describing racial 
problems in the story should not be banned 
also friday the justice ministry said it will use a photograph 
of children of different races on a publicity poster in an effort 
to combat racism 
a ministry official said it will be the first poster featuring 
american blacks in the governments promotional publication to 
counter racial discrimination 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
posters are expected to be put up at train stations and public 
facilities next month 
antidiscrimination campaigns have been held periodically since 
the justice ministrys office of human rights was established about 
40 years ago he said 
it is not clear whether the poster for this years campaign is 
related to controversial remarks made in september by justice 
minister seiroku kajiyama who compared prostitutes to american 
blacks 
following a police roundup of foreign prostitutes in tokyos red 
light district kajiyama said such prostitutes rui the 
atmosphere of neighborhoods they move into 
its like in america when neighborhoods become mixed because 
blacks move in and whites are forced out kajiyama said 
his remarks which provoked protests in the united states and 
japan were only the latest in a series of controversial comments 
on race from highranking japanese politicians and government 
officials 
sambolike figures with exaggerated lips and other 
stereotypical features can still be seen in some toys and other 
items in 1988 japan drew harsh criticism from the united states 
for black mannequins and dolls displayed and sold at stores 
in august this year a citizens group forced a major publishing 
house to strike out expressions and drawings exaggerating physical 
features of blacks in five popular comic books 
iwanami shoten the first japanese publisher to introduce the 
little black sambo story in japan said in late 1988 that the 
comics would not be reprinted

arab and nonaligned speakers on friday 
urged the un security council to deploy un peacekeepers in the 
israelioccupied territories to protect palestinians a measure the 
united states rejects 
a us diplomat described the plobacked initiative as veto 
bait and said the united states would block it 
other western diplomats said however that a compromise 
resolution was possible because all 15 council members want to 
avoid a veto or divisive vote 
colombia libya malaysia syria and tunisia all spoke friday in 
support of redeploying un military observers stationed in 
jerusalem for the un truce supervision organization to monitor 
the treatment of palestinians 
the proposed resolution also calls for convening a meeting of 
the 164 signatories of the fourth geneva convention which governs 
the treatment of occupied peoples and an international conference 
on middle east peace 
it is sponsored by yemen malaysia colombia and cuba 
israel rejects any un intervention to protect palestinians as 
a violation of its sovereignty over the territory it seized in the 
1967 mideast war it also objects to convening signatories of the 
1949 geneva convention arguing it doesnt apply to the palestinian 
territories 
the plos acting observer m nasser alkidwa told reporters 
friday that the plo opposes watering down the resolution to drop 
the call for un observers saying they were an essential 
factor 
we need to produce a new mechanism to monitor the situation 
and report back to the security council alkidwa said he said 
he hoped the proposed resolution would be brought to a vote on 
monday 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar meanwhile was 
considering whether to send jeanclaude aime his special envoy to 
israel and the occupied territories to study the situation there 
aides said they said perez de cuellar would not make a decision 
until he returns from paris on tuesday 
israel rejected a security council call for an investigation 
into the oct 8 violence on the temple mount in which 17 
palestinians were killed it announced this week however that it 
would accept a visit by aime to investigate general arabisraeli 
violence as long as it excluded the temple mount

cable news network asserted again friday the fbi 
wrongfully took a reporters box of materials on the manuel noriega 
case but the network could not fully explain just how it ended up 
in the fbis hands 
the fbi said it would not analyze the boxs contents until 
officials answer cnns complaint 
at a packed news conference at cnn headquarters in atlanta cnn 
general counsel steven korn said the network has not seen a 
subpoena or search warrant for the box which was taken by fbi 
agents thursday after security officers removed it from the hotel 
room of reporter marlene fernandez earlier this week 
the hotel is housed in cnns headquarters complex and korn 
acknowledged that turner security a cnn sister company was aware 
of the boxs whereabouts before fbi agents removed it 
asked why turner security didnt call cnn about the box korn 
said thats a good question 
but korn denied that cnn arranged the boxs removal as a ruse 
i am confident the general public will not be misled to think 
that this is a ruse because i know you are all good reporters and 
you will accurately report that this is no such thing whatsoever 
he said 
there was no word friday on whether the boxs contents had 
anything to do with cnns legal battle over its attempt to air 
audio tapes of government wiretaps of noriega 
korn said he did not know whether the boxs contents could 
identify cnns sources on the noriega story but said we dont 
believe our ability to pursue this story has been compromised 
cnn president tom johnson said friday he didnt know if the 
recordings contained in the box were audio or video tapes or if 
they were the phone calls between noriega and his legal team 
we just know that there were notes work papers and tapes 
related to cnns coverage of the noriega story johnson said 
william hinshaw head of the fbis atlanta bureau said friday 
his agency agreed to seal the box he said he would not examine its 
contents further until ordered to do so

property of the fbi it had not been abandoned korn said 
korn would not answer reporters questions on how long the box

federal regulators caving in to political 
pressure interrupted important nonabortion research when they 
barred americans from importing personal supplies of the french 
abortion drug ru486 the chairman of a congressional subcommittee 
said friday 
the food and drug administrations action in june 1989 helped 
fuel the antiabortion fever that has led the drugs maker to 
curtail supplies of ru486 allowed in this country said rep ron 
wyden dore 
the result has been that at least some of the research groups 
with fda permission to test ru486 as a treatment for breast 
cancer cushings syndrome and other diseases have been stopped he 
said 
cushings syndrome is a disorder of the pituitary gland that can 
produce obesity diabetes osteoporosis psychiatric problems and 
other symptoms 
heres this drug thats very controversial with multiple 
benefits and the only regulatory pronoucement about it was clearly 
based on politics rather than science wyden said 
the congressman noted that the fda imposed the personal import 
ban one month after receiving a letter from 11 members of the house 
and senate who oppose abortion in their letter the lawmakers told 
the fda the us government should not be involved in abetting 
abortion 
groups that oppose abortion have threatened to boycott and take 
other actions against companies or organizations that try to bring 
ru486 to the united states for abortion 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit denied that the agency was motivated 
by politics or acted under pressure from congress 
the criteria for allowing unapproved drugs to be imported for 
personal use are straightforward and ru486 did not meet three of 
them he said 
the three criteria that ru486 failed are that a personally 
imported drug must be aimed at a serious or lifethreatening 
illness there has to be no existing standard therapy for the 
illness and there have to be no safety questions 
the safety problem in fdas mind was the possibility that 
women could take the drug unsupervised by a physician 
in france ru486 is approved to induce abortion in earlystage 
pregnancies it is used under supervision of a physician along 
with prostaglandin a drug that speeds shedding of the uterus 
lining 
wydens small business subcommittee on regulation business 
opportunities and energy plans to hold a hearing monday at which 
several people are to testify about their research with ru486 
researchers at the national institutes of health are conducting 
at least two of the clinical trials that have been approved by the 
fda and as the law requires none uses ru486 for abortion 
dr george chrousos a researcher at the national institute of 
child health and human development said he has some 
apprehension about getting assurances from the drugs 
manufacturer rousseluclaf for further supply of the drug for the 
next phase of his study on cushings syndrome 
they are apprehensive he said of company officials 
kathryn b horwitz a researcher at the university of colorado 
school of medicine in denver said her federally financed research 
with ru 486 in the treatment of breast cancer is threatened by the 
fdas import ban 
the politics of abortion is restricting use of a drug that has 
much potential beyond abortion for treatment of cancer hormonal 
disorders and all kinds of things she said

mikhail s gorbachev has navigated through five 
years of political upheaval by staking out the middle between angry 
opponents but the formula ran aground friday when lawmakers 
demanded he pick a side 
the supreme soviet called gorbachev to account for the 
foundering economy and fragmenting union hoping to hear their 
president had settled on a path of rapprochement during a fourhour 
meeting sunday with his popular rival russian republic leader 
boris yeltsin 
yeltsins vast republic controls the bulk of the countrys 
resources while the kremlin holds financial and military 
authority the leaders conflicting orders for economic reform have 
paralyzed the country and their meeting raised hopes for a 
powersharing compromise that could rescue the economy 
but what deputies heard friday from gorbachev were more calls 
for consolidation around his fiveyearol perestroika program and 
his embattled proposal for a new treaty to hold the 15 republics 
together gorbachev gave short shrift to his private meeting with 
yeltsin calling it a routine session that was being 
sensationalized by politicians and the media 
instead he called for a replacement of the military and 
government officials whom he said were blocking his reforms 
he tried once again to pit his opponents against each other 
suggesting the smaller republics whose national cultures were 
suppressed during much of the communist partys 73year rule 
should be wary of a leading role by ethnic russians 
in a coalition government if the russian government gets any 
more power it will mean discrimination against the other 
republics he said 
a year ago the warning might have struck a chord with many 
republic leaders who are all too familiar with the history of 
imperial russias domination over a country stretching from the 
chinese border to poland 
but on friday the only lawmakers to respond enthusiastically 
were from small ethnic groups who themselves complain of 
discrimination within the republics republic leaders attending the 
session said they would support the proposed treaty only if the 
kremlin recognized their independence first and gave clear 
guarantees the pact would be voluntary 
most of the deputies in the hall were clearly fed up with 
gorbachevs pronouncements the chambers closed circuit cameras 
panned the hall to show uninspired faces and heads leaning on 
hands 
gorbachev didnt even receive the traditional applause at the 
end of his speech as deputies began rising to press him with 
questions he left the hall without giving any answers 
outside the chamber both reformists and hardliners attacked 
the president leningrads radical mayor anatoly sobchak told 
reporters that gorbachevs speech was not what we needed 
conservative former politburo member yegor ligachev complained 
gorbachev said nothing about how to attract the political forces 
needed to solve the problems 
yeltsin who had sat nearly expressionless during gorbachevs 
speech took the floor and demanded gorbachev agree within two 
weeks to set up an extraordinary anticrisis committee that 
would replace the government of embattled prime minister nikolai 
ryhkov 
the fact that yeltsin who is not a member of the parliament 
could stage such public defiance of gorbachev reflected his surging 
popularity an opinion poll released friday by the national public 
opinion center said 75 percent of respondents thought yeltsin could 
best represent russias interests compared with 35 percent for 
gorbachev the poll didnt give a margin of error 
another indication of gorbachevs plummeting support came from a 
deputy general secretary of the communist party vladimir ivashko 
who said he has received a staggering number of letters from 
party members demanding that gorbachev quit as party leader and 
concentrate on his presidential duties 
gorbachev ousted yeltsin from the partys politburo two years 
ago but yeltsin made a political comeback and was elected 
president of russia last summer 
last sundays meeting raised hopes of a new compromise but when 
gorbachev delivered his negative answer friday he retreated to a 
narrow middle ground which may be a hard place to stand

atlantis five astronauts orbiting 
earth in a public silence imposed by the pentagon deployed a spy 
satellite aimed at iraq and will return to earth on monday nasa 
and military sources said friday 
the astronauts spent their first full day in space friday 
working under a shroud of secrecy however sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the satellite was placed in orbit 
nasa punctuated the silence friday evening to report that 
atlantis would land at edwards air force base calif sometime 
between 5 pm and 8 pm est monday a more precise time will be

the crew is doing well and the orbiter atlantis continues to 
perform satisfactorily said mission controls kari fluegel 
atlantis thundered into orbit thursday night carrying a 
satellite that purportedly is to spy on iraq the shuttle was 
visible along the entire florida coast and as far north as south 
carolina as it rode a 700foot column of flame through the 
darkness 
it was the fifth time nasa launched a shuttle at nighttime and 
the seventh and last time a shuttle will carry a classified 
military cargo into space 
atlantis crew commanded by air force col richard covey had 
been expected to release the spy satellite from the shuttles cargo 
bay within 24 hours of liftoff experts believe the spacecraft will 
focus cameras or electronic signal detectors on the persian gulf 
the pentagon plans to use the shuttle two more times both in 
1991 to carry unclassified cargoes future military satellites will 
be lifted into orbit by unmanned rockets principally the titan 4 
atlantis flawless liftoff the second shuttle flight in two 
months was greeted enthusiastically by nasa officials who spent 
much of the year contending with grounded shuttles 
hydrogen leaks crippled columbia then atlantis over the summer 
both shuttles were cleared for flight last month following 
extensive repairs 
atlantis last flew in march when it carried another spy 
satellite into orbit 
it puts atlantis back into flying status again said launch 
director bob sieck in a few weeks we expect to have columbia 
there too so well have all three shuttles flying again 
columbias astronomy mission has been on hold since may when 
the shuttles hydrogen leaks were discovered four countdowns were 
attempted before nasa stopped to make way for discoverys october 
flight with a satellite on a mission to study the sun 
if columbia goes up in early december as planned the national 
aeronautics and space administration will have achieved six shuttle 
flights for 1990 nine missions originally were planned

dying by lethal injection or in the gas chamber 
freeman told mrs moore to stand and she had little reaction as

calm her two daughters

senators under investigation for helping 
charles h keating jr battle federal banking regulators 
emotionally defended their integrity and denied any wrongdoing 
friday before the senate ethics committee 
john glenn does not peddle influence period the ohio 
democrat told the panel of fellow senators sen donald w riegle 
jr dmich held up a jigsaw puzzle and said the committee 
special counsel was missing some key pieces when he negatively 
described riegles conduct 
the committee turned to personal defense statements by the 
keating five senators after the counsel robert bennett wound 
up a day and a half detailing accusations and evidence against 
them 
in addition to riegle and glenn sens john mccain rariz and 
alan cranston dcalif presented their statements cranston and 
riegle showed considerable emotion in their appeals for 
exoneration 
the hearing adjourned until monday leaving only sen dennis 
deconcini dariz to make his defense statement after he speaks 
witnesses will be called 
bennett concentrated on cranston the senates no 2 democrat 
on friday saying his help for keating and the businessmans 
failing lincoln savings and loan was closely connected to 
political donations from keating 
cranston suffering from prostate cancer and making his first 
appearance at the hearings was defiant in his denials 
i engaged in no unethical conduct he said firmly you 
know that i broke no law you know that i broke no senate rule 
you know that i pocketed no money that there was no personal 
gain for me or any member of my family 
yes i was persistent in expressing my concerns about the way 
bureaucrats were dealing with this large business in my state he 
said referring to the savings and loan which was chartered in 
california i believed that its failure if it came to that 
would be a catastrophe for countless constituents of mine 
the ethics committee of three democrats and three republicans 
will make recommendations based on the hearings that could 
determine the political futures of the five except cranston who 
has said he will not seek reelection 
the committee is trying to determine whether the 13 million 
keating and associates donated to the five influenced their 
intervention on his behalf with banking regulators 
many of the donations were given to the senators campaigns and 
causes while keating was trying to save his irvine calif 
institution regulators seized the thrift in april 1989 and it 
could cost taxpayers more than 2 billion to cover the losses 
cranston and riegle enlivened their presentation with props in 
the televised hearings 
the california senator placed five huge posters on easels 
listing designated staff fundraisers for each of the senates 100 
members 
it is absurd to suggest that fundraising and substantive 
issues are separated in senate offices by some kind of wall the 
senator said 
riegle held up the puzzle because bennett had done so on 
thursday in promising to fit them all together 
bennett riegle said did not have all the pieces of the 
puzzle we just have some of the pieces 
for instance riegle said bennetts presentation left out the 
main purpose of a rieglekeating meeting in january 1987 bennett 
said it was related to a keatinghosted fundraiser for riegle 
scheduled the following march 
but riegle said keatings itinerary made clear the main reason 
for the meeting was to discuss a 54 million keating development 
project in detroit 
sometimes documents can bleed when theyre not presented 
fairly riegle said that one was not presented fairly 
at the end of riegles presentation his voice broke as he 
thanked his family for support 
first up to defend himself friday was mccain of arizona the 
only republican in the group he declared i know i acted 
ethically and properly 
next came glenn who said at no time did i trade favors or 
perform actions in return for money 
bennett has recommended that the committee dismiss mccain and 
glenn from the case but that the investigation be intensified for 
cranston deconcini and riegle 
fridays second day of the hearings got off to an acrimonious 
start as cranstons lawyer asked that one member sen jesse helms 
rnc be barred from judging the california democrat 
helms speaking under oath stoutly denied cranston attorney 
william w taylor iiis accusation that he had already made up his 
mind in the case helms refused to step aside 
taylor had cited reports from helms recent successful 
reelection campaign in which the north carolina republican had 
referred to cranston as the leading water carrier for keating 
mccain said keating was a political friend and supporter 
from 1981 through 1987 when the two had a falling out because 
mccain refused to negotiate with banking regulators on the 
businessmans behalf 
when he came to see me in 1987 and asked me to do something i 
thought was improper i said no mccain said when he asked me 
to get former top thrift regulator edwin j gray off his back i 
said no 
despite the argument with keating in march 1987 mccain said he 
still attended april 2 and april 9 1987 meetings between 
regulators and the senators in which the lawmakers demanded fair 
treatment for lincoln 
the most immediate decision for the panel is to determine 
whether the investigation of each senator should be intensified or 
dropped 
bennett said as he outlined the evidence thursday and friday 
that crnston deconcini and riegle were more involved in helping 
keating than mccain and glenn 
keating donated 850000 to three voter registration projects 
supported by cranston and 49000 to his political campaigns 
bennett said that in september 1987 cranston sought to solicit 
500000 at one time for the voter projects his fundraiser joy 
jacobson told the committee she thought that was too much and 
persuaded him to lower his request to 250000 bennett said 
keating gave the 250000 nov 6 
bennett in presenting his findings from a yearlong 
investigation said in retrospect i think there was a link 
between keatings contributions and cranstons assistance sen 
cranstons contacts with the federal home loan bank board the 
evidence will show were closely connected with fundraising by 
keating 
he added it wasnt mr keating who was always seeking things 
sen cranston sought contributions from mr keating 
bennett added the evidence will show on four occasions 
cranston accepted or solicited several hundred thousands of dollars 
from keating for voter registration

one of berlins mayors offered friday to negotiate 
with radical squatters to end the riots that have paralyzed the 
citys government and threatened to topple its other mayor 
a mass police crackdown on leftist radicals occupying scores of 
buildings in the city this week has resulted in violent protests 
street fights with police and hundreds of arrests and injuries 
the berlin government has almost collapsed and the violence has 
fueled the arguments of those who oppose making it the seat of 
government of united germany 
berliners will elect a united government on dec 2 when all 
germans also will choose a national government 
tino schwierzina the former east berlin mayor who still holds 
the title until german elections said he would negotiate with the 
leftist radicals as long as they refrained from riots 
but the radicals through intermediaries issued a statement 
refusing negotiations and describing the police action as 
terrorism 
in any case it is not schwierzina but west berlin mayor walter 
momper who is actually running the city and momper is in danger of 
losing his job over the squatters controversy 
the leftist greens coalition bolted from mompers coalition on 
thursday to protest what they called unnecessary police action in 
evicting hundreds of squatters occupying scores of abandoned 
tenements in former east berlin the squatters are protesting a 
lack of affordable housing in berlin 
mompers social democrats now hold a minority in the city 
senate and the remaining parties say they will not support him as 
mayor the conservative christian democrats were to decide tuesday 
whether to support a noconfidence vote for momper 
violent clashes since monday have resulted in nearly 300 arrests 
and 400 injuries many serious traffic has been snarled by street 
fighting and marches 
on wednesday 3000 riot police and paramilitary troops raided a 
block of tenements that had been taken over by the radicals and 
the hours of street battles caused serious damage 
police used bulldozers armored cars water cannons and tear gas 
against masked street fighters who threw rocks debris and 
firebombs 
the rioting has bolstered the arguments of those who want the 
seat of a united german government to remain in the relatively 
placid town of bonn 
berlin was designated the symbolic capital of germany when the 
two former nations united on oct 3 but the united german 
parliament that is elected on dec 2 will have to decide whether to 
move government ministries to berlin 
critics say the move would be too costly given the massive costs 
of salvaging eastern germanys collapsing economy 
they also cite the citys chronic social unrest caused mainly 
by the veteran leftist underground for whom the clashes with 
police fit into a scheme of reducing germany to a state of anarchy

panamanian dictator said i was made to believe that i could use 
my funds to hire lawyers of my own choice 
citing his military background noriega said his attorneys were 
armed with handguns and no support staff while the prosecutors 
office has nuclear weapons 
i realize this case has implications to the highest levels of 
the united states government including the white house and i also 
realize that many forces are at work beyond your honors control 
noriega said explaining his fears about getting a fair trial 
noriegas private defense attorneys made a lastminute plea to 
the judge to throw out the limit on fees in the criminal justice 
act 
us district judge william hoeveler did not immediately decide 
the issue but appeared unmoved he said he had received indications 
from some exceedingly fine criminal defense lawyers who were 
willing to take the case under the low government fee schedule 
looking at noriega the judge sought to assure him that he would 
get a fair trial 
i want the defendant to understand he is not being cast adrift 
by the court and by the judicial system hoeveler said 
noriegas lawyers led by frank rubino told the judge they 
would have to abandon the case under conditions set by a law 
governing courtappointed legal counsel 
the 20minute plea was noriegas first extensive statement in 
court since surrendering to invading us troops in january clad 
in his fourstar generals uniform he read in spanish speaking 
forcefully but without raising his voice 
he had appeared subdued in some recent hearings but on friday 
smiled and waved to an acquaintance in the audience and talked 
animatedly with one of his attorneys 
earlier in the day the private defense team filed a broad 
motion asking dismissal of all drug charges against their client 
court papers argued that freezing noriegas assets and taping 
his phone calls from prison constituted government misconduct 
rubino also said an unidentified government witness had sought a 
bribe to change his testimony possibly in an ttempt to entrap the 
defense 
it is abundantly clear that the united states has engaged in 
misconduct heretofore unimaginable the motion said indeed 
the quality and degree of the governments crimes is unlike 
anything seen since watergate 
earlier this month cable news network reported it had audio 
tapes of jailhouse telephone conversations between noriega and his 
defense team rubino protested that such monitoring of confidential 
conversations apparently by federal authorities and any airing of 
the tapes by cnn compromised his clients right to a fair trial 
hoeveler did not immediately rule on the dismissal motion 
the fee controversy springs from us efforts in the wake of 
decembers invasion of panama to freeze 27 noriegalinked bank 
accounts holding about 20 million us prosecutors told foreign 
governments in france switzerland austria and other nations that 
the money was drugrelated 
after noriegas capture and return to the united states his 
attorneys went to hoeveler asking to withdraw from the case because 
they had no money to pay fees or expenses 
instead all sides initially worked out a deal for the 
government to hire rubino and his legal team for rates as high as 
350 an hour under the criminal justice act the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals however said there was no statutory authority 
for those rates 
the law allows only two or three attorneys paid no more than 75 
an hour during the trial and 40 for preparatory work in addition 
the law sharply limits expenses with judges never granting more 
than a few thousand dollars for investigators and research 
after that rejection hoeveler took another route he determined 
that noriega must have had legitimate income during his tenure as a 
military officer and ordered the us government to free about 6 
million of the frozen funds that money was to go into an escrow 
account to pay legal expenses 
but in the following five months the justice department failed 
to win the release of any money its attorneys told hoeveler on 
tuesday that the foreign governments had initiated their own 
confiscation actions and balked at releasing the money 
the best chance for noriegas attorneys appeared to be 58 
million in cash found by us troops in noriegas offices in panama 
during the invasion but federal prosecutors say the money was 
turned over to the new government of panama because noriega 
initially denied ownership a claim disputed by noriegas defense 
noriegas defense and many independent legal experts have cried 
foul over the money issue 
rubino said trying to defend noriega on a restricted budget made 
the case into david vs goliath 
legal scholars said the fact that the united states took away 
noriegas money then gave him a severely limited legal defense 
would reflect badly on the nations legal system 
noriega is being held at the metropolitan correctional center 
outside miami on charges of accepting 46 million in bribes to 
turn panama into a way station for colombias medellin cocaine 
cartel

authorities on friday recovered the 
bodies of the 46 victims of the alitalia jetliner crash and 
investigators combed wreckage for clues as to what caused the 
aircraft to slam into a hillside 
zurich airport spokesman ndreas meier said experts planned to 
try to reconstruct the pieces of the dc9 to help determine whether 
it exploded before crashing five miles from zurichs kloten 
airport 
maier said pilot error was the most likely cause of the crash 
because radar data showed the plane was flying about 1000 feet 
below the correct altitude for preparing to land he said the data 
suggested the experienced 47yearold pilot misjudged his 
altitude 
maier noted that records of the pilots radio contacts with the 
control tower at zurich airport did not indicate any problems he 
said the instrument landing system for the runway the plane was 
assigned to was operating normally 
some witnesses said the pilot seemed to gun the engine just 
before impact as if he was trying to regain height 
alitalia officials suggested however that the planes 
electronic navigation system may have failed 
the airline said seven americans 10 swiss six spaniards three 
germans two japanese and 11 italians including the crew of six 
perished in the disaster 
it said one passenger each was from india lebanon the 
netherlands finland and britain there was no information on the 
nationality of the remaining two passengers 
identification of the bodies was expected to take weeks as most 
victims and their possessions were burned beyond recognition by the 
flames that gutted the aircraft when it crashed and broke into 
pieces 
the planes two black boxes were recovered thursday and will 
be sent to britain for evaluation one recorder tracks flight data 
and the other tapes cockpit conversation 
alitalia said the twoengine dc9 built in 1974 was last 
inspected 10 days before the crash

the 1100 combat aircraft taking 
part in the imminent thunder exercises are a visible reminder to 
iraq that the multinational force assembled in the persian gulf has 
double its air power defense analysts said thursday 
that must be a very sobering thought for president saddam 
hussein said paul beaver publisher of janes defense weekly a 
respected publication on military matters 
a news blackout remained in effect on the second day of the 
exercise thursday in eastern saudi arabia which will include a 
mock amphibious invasion by us marines with air cover and naval 
support 
british fighter aircraft are taking part along with us and 
saudi arabian air naval and marine units a british military 
spokesman said thursday british said it had more than 50 planes 
participating in the exercise 
the us military announcement wednesday mentioned only us and 
saudi forces 
defense analysts said the main aim of the exercise is to put 
together the airstrike capability of the multinational force 
deployed in the persian gulf following the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
on aug 2 
there is also an element of psychological warfare 
especially in the choice of the name imminent thunder for the 
exercise the experts said us officials have said the name has 
no special significance 
it is all clearly part of a psychological campaign said 
edward foster a researcher with the londonbased royal united 
services institute for defense studies he said the exercises could 
be a form of increasing the pressure 
imminent thunder involves the largest use of aircraft in a 
single training exercise since the creation of the multinational 
force the exercise also involves 1000 us marines and 16 ships 
including the aircraft carrier uss midway 
the exact location of imminent thunder in eastern saudi arabia 
was not revealed press reports have said the exercise would be 10 
miles from the iraqikuwaiti border no live ammunition will be 
fired officials said 
we all know air power is going to be very important in any 
conflict and one would be very surprised if they didnt have an 
exercise like this to see whether they could keep track of all 
those planes in the air on a radar screen without hitting each 
other said col andrew duncan of the londonbased international 
institute of strategic studies 
beaver of the defense weekly said the usdominated 
multinational force was making sure its command and control system 
works 
theres no doubt about it the most important thing in any 
land battle is to gain air superiority and the most important 
thing is making sure everybody knows what theyre doing he said 
they need to know that saudis can refuel american aircraft and 
brits can rearm and refuel someone elses aircraft he said 
all the analysts spoke in telephone interviews from britain 
the amphibious landing expected sunday will be the fourth by 
elements of the 4th marine expeditionary battalion which has been 
floating off the coast since the deployment began the other three 
have been on the southern part of the arabian peninsula in oman and 
bahrain 
by keeping the marines at sea foster said youre always 
keeping the iraqis guessing youre always keeping the amphibious 
option open 
iraq has a 1 millionmember army but only something over 500 
combat aircraft about 430000 of iraqs soldiers are deployed in 
or near kuwait 
the multinational force of the united states and 25 other 
nations numbers about 330000 forces including 230000 american 
soldiers but president bush has said washington is sending 200000 
more to ensure that the force has an offensive capability

secretary of state james a baker iii on friday rejected a 
soviet envoys suggestion that a solution to the persian gulf 
crisis be linked to israels occupation of land claimed by 
palestinians 
baker said there could be no rewards for aggression he spoke in 
brussels belgium on the first leg of a 12day foreign trip that 
will include talks on the gulf situation 
at the united nations diplomats said baker was trying to 
persuade security council foreign ministers to travel to new york 
to adopt a resolution authorizing force to drive iraq from kuwait 
foreign ministers occupy their countrys seats on the council only 
in grave situations 
president bush left friday to join baker for further talks with 
allies then spend thanksgiving with us soldiers in saudi arabia 
it would be the first presidential visit to frontline troops since 
the vietnam war 
despite the bush administrations growing impatience with saddam 
hussein there have been increasing calls to avoid rushing into 
war egypt the soviet envoy and us congressmen urged on thursday 
that more time be allowed for the un trade sanctions on iraq to 
work 
oil prices fell friday on the new york mercantile exchange as 
traders decided that the outbreak of war could take some time the 
price fell 187 to 2925 a barrel 
also expressing optimism were seven peace activists who left 
london on friday for baghdad hoping to set up camps on both sides 
of the saudikuwait border they said they hoped to deter any 
fighting 
a news blackout meanwhile remained in effect on the second day 
of the imminent thunder military exercise in eastern saudi arabia 
iraq has condemned the exercise calling it a provocation 
on thursday the soviet unions top middle east envoy yevgeny 
primakov said the world should do everything possible to persuade 
saddam to withdraw from kuwait including agreeing to talks on the 
palestinian question 
in an interview friday with nbctv primakov said the saddam 
seems to be softening his ideas on the crisis a kind of 
evolution is taking place in his views primakov said and 
maybe it makes me more optimistic than before 
despite his other comments he insisted the united states and 
the soviet union are moving in one direction to oust iraq from 
kuwait 
baker said earlier friday that washington and moscow have indeed 
forged a common position on the gulf crisis he said they agreed 
that we should not link this gulf issue with other issues 
primakov might have been speaking for himself and not for the 
soviet government baker suggested 
saddam has said he might withdraw from kuwait if israel pulled 
out of the west bank and gaza strip seized in the 1967 middle east 
war but the united states and its allies have said iraq must 
withdraw unconditionally 
baker also said the bush administration was consulting with its 
allies on whether to seek a un resolution authorizing military 
force against iraq if peaceful means fail 
it is the view of the united states that force as an option 
cannot and should not be ruled out he said 
baker also in brussels for trade talks with the 12nation 
european economic community meets saturday in geneva with the 
foreign ministers of ethiopia ivory coast and zaire all security 
council members 
an aide to baker said thursday the united states would like to 
introduce the resolution this month while its diplomat presides 
over the council yemen a proiraqi member of the 15nation 
council holds the presidency for december 
un diplomats said baker was consulting with security council 
members on bringing foreign ministers to new york to adopt such a 
resolution 
i do not exclude the possibility that in november the 
americans may wish to stress the importance of the meeting by 
holding it at the ministerial level said the canadian ambassador 
to the un yves fortier 
about 330000 allied soldiers are stationed in saudi arabia 
they face 430000 iraqi troops deployed in southern iraq and 
kuwait which saddam invaded on aug 2 in a dispute over oil land 
and money 
bush has said he will send an additional 200000 troops to saudi 
arabia military officials there said friday the new deployment 
will be much swifter than the three months it took to bring the 
original 230000 troops to the gulf 
allied troops were participating in the sixday imminent thunder 
military exercise which includes a mock us marine amphibious 
invasion with air cover and close air and naval support of ground 
forces 
defense analysts said the 1100 combat aircraft taking part were 
a reminder to iraq that the allies have double its air power 
that must be a very sobering thought for president saddam 
hussein said paul beaver publisher of janes defense weekly 
the seven peace activists said they hoped to prevent fighting 
from breaking out they headed for iraq friday and planned to set 
up peace camps on both sides of the kuwaitisaudi border 
we are well aware of the consequences of our actions but this 
is a point of principle in the traditions of gandhi said pat 
arrowsmith a 60yearold peace campaigner 
the group included activists from britain india belgium and 
ghana they said they would be joined by others including yusuf 
islam formerly the pop singer cat stevens once the camps were 
established 
iraq has not ruled out a peaceful solution to the crisis said 
the iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati he was returning 
from two days in baghdad 
velayati said it appeared iraqs leaders had not yet made up 
their minds 
one cannot say with certainty that it will go either way 
staying in kuwait and putting into practice the annexation of 
kuwait or the withdrawal from kuwait velayati said

former president carter on friday 
declared his opposition to a possible us invasion of iraq 
saying i wouldnt be willing to give my life to invade someone 
elses land 
during a questionandanswer session with 1200 high school 
students carter said higher oil prices and the potential loss of 
american jobs were not strong enough reasons for the united states 
to launch a war in the middle east 
i dont believe that those are the kinds of reasons for us to 
sacrifice human life in the desert of saudi arabia and iraq 
carter said during the start of a threeday conference studying his 
administration at hofstra university 
us troops were deployed to defend saudi arabia shortly after 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
in brussels belgium on friday us secretary of state james 
a baker iii said washington was consulting with its allies on 
whether to seek a united nations resolution authorizing the use of 
force to drive iraq out of kuwait 
carter said that invading a country takes three times as much 
military might as it does to defend one he also noted that iraqis 
religious beliefs make it an honor to die for their country 
i dont have any doubts the us would prevail against iraq 
but the effects would be deleterious politically said carter 
i would offer my life to defend my family and country against 
an invading force but i wouldnt be willing to give my life to 
invade someone elses land he said 
carter spoke at the eighth presidential conference hofstra has 
sponsored carter the 39th us chief executive was president 
from 1976 to 1980 when he lost a reelection bid to ronald reagan 
carter said president bush made the right move by seeking un 
support after iraqs invasion and annexation of kuwait 
bush did a superb job in martialing support to prevent what 
was considered a likely invasion of saudi arabia he said but 
lately the president is shifting from a defensive role to an 
offensive role

president bush on friday vetoed legislation 
designed to crack down on countries and firms that traffic in 
chemical weapons at the same time bush issued an executive order 
he said would accomplish the principal goals of the bill 
the order imposes new export controls on chemical and biological 
weapons and calls for sanctions against violators 
another provision of the bill would have forbidden trade with 
cuba by overseas subsidiaries of us companies a ban to which 
us allies strongly objected 
the president said in a statement his major objection to the 
legislation is not the requirement of sanctions but the rigid 
way in which they are imposed 
he said the bill would force him to impose sanctions against 
countries with whom the united states might want to keep smooth 
relations 
bushs order 
prohibits exports that would help foreign chemical and 
biological weapons programs 
controls exports that would assist foreign countries in 
producing and procuring chemical weapons 
requires diplomats to work for a new international agreement 
banning chemical weapons with adequate verification procedures 
and to seek negotiations with other countries to cooperate in 
blocking the spread of chemical weapons 
directs sanctions against foreign countries and their citizens 
who use chemical or biological wepaons or are making substantial 
preparations to use such weapons or have developed or stockpiled 
such weapons in violation of international law 
the mandatory imposition of unilateral sacntions as provided 
in this bill would harm us economic interest and provoke friendly 
countries who are essential to our efforts to resist iraqi 
aggression he said 
the sanctions bush directed against foreign countries involved 
in chemical weapons proliferation include cutting of us foreign 
aid and arms exports to that country opposition to any loans to 
the country from international lending organizations restriction 
of us imports from the country and a variety of other measures 
the state department said the bill could impede us foreign 
policy in the current climate of alliances with old foes would be 
objectionable intrusiveness into executive branch prerogatives 
and would be potentially fatal to our efforts to cooperate with 
friends and allies 
the state department also opposed a provision aimed at 
preventing overseas subsidiaries of american companies from trading 
with cuba britain canada and other countries where these 
subsidiaries operate have complained the legislation would infringe 
on their sovereignty 
during a meeting this past week canadian external affairs 
minister joe clark told secretary of state james a baker iii the 
requirement was unacceptable us overseas subsidiaries do 
about a 320 million business with cuba annually 
computer and hightech industries backed the bill but the us 
chamber of commerce wanted a veto 
the simon wiesenthal center urged bush to sign the bill based 
on its investigation that it said showed 207 western companies 
helped provide iraqs president saddam hussein with chemical and 
biological weapons 
the center said those included 86 from germany and 18 from the 
united states

defense lawyers said friday that a government 
report casts doubt on the 1974 murder convictions of six irishmen 
for two bombings that killed 21 people 
the report concluded no one could be sure any of the six had 
handled explosives the lawyers said 
evidence at least two of the socalled birmingham six had traces 
of nitroglycerine on their hands when arrested was crucial to their 
convictions 
the six have waged a campaign to prove they were convicted and 
sentenced to life unjustly last august the government ordered the 
court of appeal to review their convictions home secretary david 
waddington cited apparent discrepancies in police notes of an 
interview with richard mcilkenny one of the six 
ivan geffen a lawyer for gerry hunter another of the six said 
a report by the home office forensic service cast doubt on the 
convictions in the nov 21 1974 bombings of two birmingham pubs by 
the irish republican army 
the new report was commissioned by the director of public 
prosecutions which is deciding whether to contest the new appeal 
no one can be sure beyond reasonable doubt that any of the six 
men had handled explosives geffen quoted the report as saying 
he said the court of appeal which affirmed the verdicts in 
1988 made a grave error of judgment in the way it interpreted 
the scientific evidence 
gareth peirce a lawyer for the other five men said the 
government report would likely be the final nail in the coffin of 
the prosecutions case 
five of the six men were arrested hours after the bombings as 
they were about to board a ferry to northern ireland for the 
funeral of an ira man 
mcilkenny hunter johnny walker patrick hill hugh callaghan 
and billy power were convicted of murder for the bombings which 
killed 21 and injured 162 
they were the deadliest bombings the ira has carried out in 
england in its campaign against british rule in northern ireland

as white house reporters prepared to fly off 
with president bush to europe and the middle east they got the 
startling news that they may not have places to stay when bush goes 
to south america next month 
hotel rooms will be arranged by the white house in santiago 
chile brasilia and caracas but reporters are on their own in 
buenos aires and in montevideo and punta del este uruguay 
the only explanation given by white house officials was that 
hotel rooms for white house staff and the full press corps could 
not be procured 
the rooms had been all arranged for the original dates of the 
trip in september but bush had to postpone the trip under pressure 
of budget negotiations with congress and the military buildup 
against iraq in the persian gulf 
in buenos aires where bush addresses the national congress and 
meets with president carlos menem a jehovahs witness convention 
was said to have taken all available rooms 
all press travelling on the trip are advised to make proper 
hotel reservations in buenos aires as soon as possible the white 
house said in its notice 
there was no announcement on what caused the shortage in uruguay 
where bush will stay one night in punta del este 
there is no further hotel space available in either montevideo 
or punta del este the white house notice said 
the press charter plane that accompanies bush will fly to buenos 
aires after bushs uruguay appearances and those who have been 
able to find rooms there will have shelter for the night 
generally the white house travel office canvasses the press 
corps to see who will accompany bush and then takes care of all the 
travel and hotel arrangements with news organizations paying the 
bills incurred by their employees

although he failed to win formal british support for lithuanian 
independence 
in a speech to the parliament of the baltic republic 
landsbergis said the political forces of britain support 
lithuanias striving for independence even though the stand of 
the thatcher government is more restrained

the state department of justice 
refused to block the sale of a handgun to a man who later held 
dozens hostage in a berkeley tavern and killed a student a gun 
shop owner said friday 
gun dealer bob weaver said he tried to prevent sale of a weapon 
to mehrdad dashti a former mental patient before his sept 27 
rampage in the durant hotel bar 
john sheehy 22 was killed and nine other university of 
california students were wounded before police stormed henrys 
publick house amp grille freed 33 hostages and killed dashti a 
30yearold iranian immigrant 
weaver said he went so far as to file down the hammer of a 9mm 
ruger pistol before he handed it over to dashti dashti soon 
returned the defective weapon and weaver said he finally had to 
sell dashti a working gun 
the type of gun dashti used in the shootings remains unclear 
details of the sale surfaced in a thick file obtained by the san 
francisco chronicle from berkeley police under the state freedom of 
information law 
we knew the guy was loopy weaver said we told the 
justice department about him but they said there was nothing they 
could do about it 
repeated telephone calls friday for comment from the state 
justice department were unsuccessful weaver saying he feared 
retribution refused to give the name of the person he spoke with 
at the justice department 
the police records backed weavers story saying that all 
through the statemandated 15day waiting period in handgun sales 
weaver had the gun in the store but was very reluctant to 
release it to dashti 
the waiting period for anyone who wants to buy a handgun in 
california is used for checks with the state justice department in 
sacramento to see whether the potential buyer has been convicted of 
a felony or certified as insane by a court 
although dashti got into minor trouble with the law and had been 
a patient at the berkeley mental health clinic it was legal for 
him to buy handguns alameda county authorities had assessed dashti 
as a paranoid schizophrenic 
police records said dashti bought the defective ruger from 
weaver in march during the 15day waiting period two of dashtis 
friends came to the store pleading with weaver not to sell dashti 
the gun the records said 
weaver who owns the old west gun room in el cerrito said he 
and berkeley police were convinced dashti was mentally unstable 
on the night he took the hstages dashti called a friend to 
have a latenight drink after ordering dashti opened up his 
briefcase produced a handgun and opened fire police said

negotiators agreed to continue talks beyond 
a friday strike deadline that was set by about 4500 union 
employees of the san francisco bay areas three largest daily 
newspapers 
ten unions and management of the san francisco chronicle san 
francisco examiner and san jose mercury news made progress on 
salary proposals and stopped the clock on the threatened 5 pm 
strike said johnny miller a negotiator for the newspaper guild 
its an indication there was some movement he said 
the unions asked for a 20 percent pay raise and a fourday 
workweek management suggested a wage freeze during the proposed 
threeyear contract with 80 lump sum payments every six months to 
each employee 
jessie knight management spokesman and senior vice president at 
the examiner said that despite the gap negotiations were 
productive 
knight refused to confirm managements specific pay offer 
talks were to continue into the night 
sally lehrman spokeswoman for the newspaper guild and an 
examiner business writer said workers wouldnt be satisfied with a 
3 percent to 4 percent pay raise although some nervous employees 
said they could live with that rather than give up paychecks in a 
strike 
all the old threeyear contracts most of which expired in 
february gave employees an average of 3 percent to 5 percent pay 
and benefit increases each year the union workers covered include 
reporters editors drivers secretaries librarians and press 
operators 
a federal mediator was brought in this week to help resolve the 
contract dispute 
nearly every reporter and photographer withheld bylines and 
credits lines friday and planned to continue the protest until a 
contract is approved it was the first byline strike in the 
125year history of the two san francisco newspapers 
mercury news managers have prepared for weeks to publish without 
union staff the san francisco newspapers also planned to publish 
san franciscos last newspaper strike was in 1968 when workers 
for the examiner and the chronicle walked the strike lasted 55 
days the mercury news was last struck in 1959 for four months 
whatever happens today theres a general feeling that well 
be happy one way or another to get off this tightrope weve been 
walking on without a contract said angelo figueroa examiner 
city hall reporter theres been so much speculation about a wage 
freeze that theres just this desire to get this over with 
top scale pay is 800 a week for reporters and editors 669 for 
clerical and library workers and 675 for drivers 
noneconomic issues were resolved by thursday night said 
richard jordan chief negotiator for the san francisco newspaper 
agency which operates the chronicle and the examiner under a joint 
operating agreement 
the agreement merges the two newspapers advertising 
circulation and business operations but maintains separate 
editorial departments 
neil chethik chairman of the newspaper guild for the mercury 
news and other union officials said the strike deadline was set to 
force management to talk on pay issues 
the morning chronicle with weekday circulation of about 
560000 publishes jointly with the examiner on sunday for a 
combined circulation of about 725000 the afternoon examiner has a 
weekday circulation of about 138000 the two newspapers entered 
into the joint operating agreement in 1965 
the san jose mercury news has a daily circulation of about 
275000 during the week and about 329000 on sundays

a jury on friday said ramon salcido 
should die in the gas chamber for killing his wife two of his 
daughters and four other people in a 1988 wine country rampage 
salcido 29 had a faraway stare when a spanish interpreter 
translated the jurys decision one juror wept as the verdict was 
delivered 
he doesnt know where he is defense attorney marteen miller 
said hes not insane but hes a little goofy 
jurors said salcidos aloof demeanor and apparent lack of 
remorse during the trial played a significant role in their 
decision to give him the death penalty instead of life in prison 
without parole 
defense attorneys claimed cocaine alcohol and jealousy 
triggered salcido to kill his wife two young daughters 
motherinlaw two sistersinlaw and his boss another daughter 
2yearold carmina survived after salcido slit her throat and 
dumped her in a ravine with her sisters 
i was expecting a maddog killer and i didnt see that jury 
foreman dr john williams 36 a medical researcher from portola 
valley said of his first reaction to salcido i saw him then as 
a deer caught in the headlights an almost pathetic man who may 
have gone crazy for awhile 
but in going over the evidence i decided this was not the 
case williams said his crime fit his personality he did it 
in a coldhearted way and he deserved the death penalty 
sonoma county prosecutor peter bumerts described salcido as 
fairly cold and calculating more like a fox than a mad dog 
juror dory horn 49 of south san francisco wept as the verdict 
was read she said deciding the case was the hardest thing ive 
ever had to do 
you know youre deciding to take somebody elses life she 
said its not over and it wont be theres no peace at all 
superior court judge reginald littrell on assignment from 
sierra county set formal sentencing for dec 17 
an appeal to the state supreme court is automatic in california 
death penalty cases and the defense believes it may have at least 
two other chances to save salcidos life a protest by the mexican 
government and a ruling by federal court 
miller said he would file a writ with the us district court in 
san francisco arguing the county did not have jurisdiction over the 
death penalty because of an extradition treaty with mexico 
salcido who fled to his home in mexico after the killings was 
delivered to sonoma county officials by mexican authorities 
miller claimed the mexican government was fraudulently 
misled into releasing salcido under us officials claims he was 
an american citizen 
the state supreme court already turned down millers petition on 
salcidos release in mexico 
california has not held an execution since 1967 and about 280 
condemned prisoners are now on death row 
the jury on oct 30 found salcido guilty of six counts of 
firstdegree murder one count of seconddegree murder and two 
counts of attempted murder 
he was convicted of shooting or slashing to death his wife 
angela his 4yearold and 22monthold daughters sofia and 
teresa his motherinlaw marion richards her 12yearold and 
8yearold daughters ruth and maria and tracey toovey 35 the 
winemaster at grand cru winery in glen ellen 
the jury also convicted salcido of attempting to murder his 
daughter carmina and kenneth butti his supervisor at the winery 
the defense never disputed salcido was the killer 
but miller had sought a verdict of seconddegree murder or 
manslaughter saying drugs had put salcido in a psychotic 
depression

immense majorities of the south remains a fraud that generates

a record store owner convicted of 
obscenity for selling a sexually explicit album by the rap group 2 
live crew lost his bid for a new trial on friday 
an allwhite jury convicted charles freeman 32 on oct 3 for 
selling the miamibased rappers album as nasty as they wanna 
be 
freemans attorney bruce rogow argued friday his client should 
be granted another trial because broward county judge paul backman 
gave jury instructions that both defense attorneys and prosecutors 
had not agreed to 
during deliberations jurors had backman define again the 
states obscenity law rogow said backman went beyond the 
definition in his answer adding that jurors did not have to rely 
on the testimony of expert witnesses 
backman denied rogows request saying his instructions were 
guidelines for defining obscenity 
what the court did is what it felt its obligation to be under 
the law and that was to reinstruct the jury from start to finish 
as it related to the totality of the law on obscenity backman 
said 
im not surprised freeman said afterward you expect the 
worst and that way you deal with it a little better i think the 
whole thing is a joke its a circus 
the misdemeanor conviction carries a possible oneyear jail 
sentence and 1000 fine sentencing has not been set 
rogow said he would appeal 
a federal judge in june ruled the albums lyrics obscene and 
banned the albums sale in three south florida counties freeman 
was arrested two days later when he sold the album to undercover 
police officers at his fort lauderdale record store 
three 2 live crew members were acquitted oct 20 of misdemeanor 
obscenity charges stemming from a performance at a nightclub in 
nearby hollywood

president bush got lastminute briefings on 
the persian gulf crisis friday before embarking on a weeklong 
journey that will include a thanksgiving visit with american forces 
sent to the middle east 
bushs first stop early saturday was to be in prague to lay a 
wreath commemorating the first anniversary of czechoslovakias turn 
to democracy the visit was the first ever by an american 
president hundreds of thousands of people were expected to pack 
into wenceslas square to hear him speak 
after celebrating czechoslovakias velvet revolution bush 
is scheduled to fly to germany to meet with chancellor helmut kohl 
before heading on to paris there hell be reunited with longtime 
american allies in europe and former foes as well in a 
treatysigning ceremony that will push the cold war further into 
the depths of history 
bush went jogging friday as he prepared for the transatlantic 
flight he also wrapped up details on some domestic work signed 
some legislation and went over briefing materials for his eightday 
trip a large part of the official talks during his travels will 
center on the us military buildup in the persian gulf 
the president left from andrews air force base near washington 
shortly before 7 pm 
the white house announced that congressional leaders senate 
majority leader george mitchell house speaker thomas foley senate 
republican leader bob dole and house republican leader robert 
michel accepted bushs invitation to join him in saudi arabia for 
the holiday 
dole said the leaders will leave washington tuesday evening and 
return friday i think its a good indication he said it 
sends a good signal not only to the american people but hopefully 
to saddam hussein that there is bipartisanship and politics does 
stop at the waters edge 
before he left bush wrote foley and senate president pro tem 
robert byrd dwva to announce formally his latest deployements 
in my august 9 letter i indictaed that i did not believe that 
involvement in hostilities was imminent and that the buildup 
would facilitate a peaceful resolution of the crisis 
my view on these matters has not changed bush wrote 
the war powers act of 1973 which no president has accepted as 
constitutional requires notice of overseas deployments if 
hostilities are imminent and mandates a withdrawl of troops if 
congress does not approve the action within 90 days no one has 
invoked the act in the kuwait crisis but congressional unease with 
the prospect of war has been palpably rising recently 
bush flies from paris to saudi arabia to spend thanksgiving day 
with the troops he ordered to the gulf region to stand against the 
iraqi army of president saddam hussein in the wake of the invasion 
and takeover of kuwait 
bush vowed thursday that despite the massive buildup that will 
put more than 400000 us troops in the region he does not intend 
to embark on a nowin war akin to vietnam 
i will not as commanderinchief ever put somebody into a 
military situation that we do not win ever he said in an 
interview with cnn 
and theres not going to be any long drawnout agony of 
vietnam 
but bush also said he could understand the publics growing 
uneasiness with his military buildup because they are thinking 
we dont want to have a drawnout vietnam 
he said he wanted a strong us offensive capability in the 
middle east to send a clear clarion signal to saddam hussein we 
are deadly serious about iraq retreating from kuwait which it 
invaded aug 2 
during his trip bush will take the opportunity to discuss the 
persian gulf problem with members of the 34nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe including soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
bush has repeatedly touted the international solidarity against 
saddam and has rigorously solicited support from other countries 
for the us military buildup 
he plans to sound out britain france and other csce 
participants on the wording of a pending united nations resolution 
that would authorize use of military action to oust iraq from 
kuwait

away according to a report saturday in the independent 
the london newspaper said us intelligence sources believe the 
britishmade guns may have been delivered to iraq before the 
supergun development program known as project 839 was uncovered 
by british customs officers in april 
it said it was not known if the guns were operational 
the report noted that charges were dropped thursday at sheffield 
magistrates court against two men charged with breaching britains 
arms embargo against iraq both had denied any knowledge of the 
alleged gun 
reports had indicated the two men businessman peter mitchell 
and metallurgist christopher cowley were linked to ballistics 
expert gerald bull who helped design the iraqi supergun but was 
shot to death outside a brussels belgium apartment last march 
british reports speculated israeli agents may have killed bull 
a canadian who became a naturalized american citizen to halt work 
on the weapon bull reportedly was hired by iraqi president saddam 
hussein to develop a supergun capable of lobbing shells hundreds of 
miles or launch satellites cheaply 
the independent said the ecision to drop charges against the 
two men is understood to have been made at the highest level with 
cabinet knowledge 
it suggested that technical intelligence services in britain and 
the united states had been infuriated by the withholding of data 
about the weapons system while the case was pending 
now that britain and america face a possible war with iraq 
the need to know the full capability of any superguns in iraqi 
hands has become pressing the paper said 
on april 12 british customs officers seized eight large 
sections of steel tubing at teesport dock in northeast england as 
they were about to be shipped to iraq 
the iraqi government and the manufacturer sheffield 
forgemasters of rotherham in northern england said the tubes were 
intended for an iraqi petrochemical plant 
but military experts at that time said they believed the tubes 
were destined to form the barrel of a huge iraqi gun 
the independent reported saturday however further customs 
investigations revealed that these tubes were not part of a gun but 
were part of a ballistic test bed designed to allow the iraqis to 
devise a cheap way of launching satellites by literally firing them 
into space 
however it was later discovered that at the same time the 
iraqis had been taking delivery of other components which customs 
learned were designed to be assembled into working artillery 
pieces 
turkish customs officers in april seized a 30ton steel cylinder 
from a hungarianregistered truck heading for iraq british customs 
officers said they thought this was also due to form part of an 
iraqi gun other suspected parts were seized in greece and italy 
cowley 52 is a former associate of bull according to press 
association the british domestic news agency mitchell 43 is 
managing director of forgemasters walter somers ltd of halesowen 
manufacturers of the pipe found in turkey 
both had been charged with organizing illegal exports from 
england 
press association said cowley acted as bulls project 
coordinator in contacts with walter somers 
the independent said saturday that cowley designed project 
babylon the experimental system seized at teesport

theres not going to be any long drawnout agony of vietnam

lita belga hadnt heard from her 
husband in months when she learned he was killed in a car accident 
in saudi arabia she wept and millions of other filipinos wept 
with her 
mrs belga received news of her husband benjamins death in a 
telephone call to his saudi employers paid for and broadcast by 
private radio station dzrh as part of its program around the 
world with love 
the program in its seventh year features telephone 
conversations between filipinos and relatives working abroad it 
has become a reallife soap opera a daily litany of money 
troubles loneliness death and other family crises 
rey langit the host said the beauty of the program is the 
spontaneity it is truetolife drama unfolding right before 
you it is both entertaining and educational 
most people who appear on the show cannot afford to pay for 
overseas calls themselves 
you have not been sending money gloria abalos said in a 
recent call to her husband ernesto in saudi arabia i will kill 
myself thats what ill do i dont care how long you stay 
there as long as you send us money 
with millions listening relatives tried to muster the courage 
to tell boy santos also working in saudi arabia that his 
4yearold daughter had died 
none would admit the girl was dead but santos figured out what 
they were trying to say 
what have you done to my baby he cried you killed her 
potential callers come to the dzrh studios every morning to sign 
up all except emergency cases are put on a waiting list two months 
long 
langit said the station makes little profit from the program 
because the calls are expensive an average of six a day are made 
during the twohour program broadcast six days a week 
the program is both a commitment and moral obligation to give 
good advice and help the poor with their problems langit said in 
an interview 
they say they do not have hope in the government they 
complain that government reaction is too slow and they come to us 
pleading and telling us that we are their only hope 
mrs belga turned to the station after being told by a filipino 
who returned from saudi arabia that her husband was dead neither 
his employers nor the philippine government had notified her 
may i talk to my husband please she asked the saudi on the 
other end of the line in riyadh dead dead he muttered in 
arabic eventually another filipino came to the telephone and 
confirmed the death 
many conversations are embarassingly candid in one a jealous 
husband in saudi arabia harangued his wife until langit passed the 
telephone to their young daughter 
why are you angry at mother the girl asked mother now 
has to wash clothes for other people just to feed us she weeps day 
and night 
after the daughter spoke langit scolded the husband about his 
family responsibilities 
the success of that call was that i was able to instruct the 
guy to say i love you to his wife before he hung up langit 
boasted 
some calls have happy results 
a 14yearold girl asked the station to help find her father 
who had abandoned his family and moved to the united states 
we really wanted to help her but how can we when the only 
clue she had of his whereabouts was that he worked at a restaurant 
in new york with huge glass panes in front langit said 
using a manhattan hotel directory the station began calling 
until they found the father working as a bartender under an assumed 
name 
you dont know me but im the child you abandoned the girl 
said as the nation listened you never sent us money and that is 
the reason why i have to sell flowers in the street and miss 
school 
in a quivering voice the father replied it is my fault my 
daughter but you must understand that if i did not remarry here i 
would not have survived 
the girl now lives in the united states with her father langit 
said

austria a neutral bridge between east 
and west during four decades of cold war is in an ideal position 
to be the middleman in a new age of political and economic 
cooperation 
it seems predestined to act as interpreter of both eastern needs 
and western requirements for development 
herbert krejci general secretary of the conservative federation 
of industrialists said austria could use its historical experience 
to function as a transmission belt between the two halves of 
europe 
austria once was an empire encompassing hungary czechoslovakia 
and parts of yugoslavia poland and italy now it is a small 
republic of 76 million at the crossroad between east and west 
with strong ties to both 
many austrians have relatives in the east or parents who grew 
up there but their country has established itself as a western 
democracy it has a strong economy and applied in july 1989 for 
membership in the 12nation european community 
membership in the ec is a logical consequence of our 
geographic situation and the already existing strong economic 
ties between austria and the ec said heinz fischer a socialist 
party legislator and speaker of parliament 
krejci a member of the conservative peoples party said 
austria belongs to this western community 
the socialists are the senior partners in a coalition government 
with the conservative peoples party 
fischer sees austria as the mediator with western europe for 
nations of the former soviet bloc however attractive the ec is 
for budapest and prague he said frankfurt london and 
brussels will nevertheless be more foreign to them than vienna 
jan vit a spokesman for the czech regional government was 
quoted by the austrian newspaper die presse as saying there was a 
growing feeling of belonging together with austria because of 
the common history 
a former hungarian premier andras hegedus said recently his 
country should seek its future in some form of alliance with other 
nations of the old austrohungarian empire 
vienna has long been a center for eastwest trade and is likely 
to remain so 
poor facilities for communications and travel in eastern europe 
make it difficult to conduct business efficiently telephone rail 
and road connections often are unreliable 
ibm plans a computer information network connecting universities 
in the east but vienna is the hub 
a major question in austria is whether it needs to continue a 
neutral policy now that nato and the warsaw pact no longer menace 
each other 
austria became neutral by tacit agreement after the withdrawal 
in 1955 of the occupying powers the united states soviet union 
france and britain that neutrality and austrias position on the 
eastwest divide made it a logical meeting place for the two 
sides 
vienna has been the site of eastwest arms talks since 1970 a 
twoyear meeting of the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe was held in the austrian capital and some un agencies have 
their headquarters here 
an official policy of neutrality could create problems with 
austrias application for ec membership some ec officials have 
said neutrality might affect common stands on security 
fischer the parliament speaker cautions against writing off 
neutrality just because eastwest conflict appears to be over 
one cant treat permanent neutrality like a share that one 
immediately considers selling when the prices rise he said 
many austrians say the policy already had been redefined when 
the government gave permission for us and british military planes 
carrying troops and supplies to the persian gulf to use austrian 
airspace 
some feel the country must heed its past when reconsidering 
neutrality 
as an ally of germany in 1914 and part of it after annexation by 
hitler in 1938 austria was both initiator and accomplice in the 
most horrible wars of human history said johannes voggenhuber 
head of the greenalternative party 
in the view of krejci the industrialist ec membership could 
offset the danger of overdependence on germany austrias leading 
trade partner 
there was a surprising lack of emotional reaction to german 
unification in austria and state television did not provide 
extended live coverage of the event the lack of emotion appeared 
to reflect austrias sense of its own independent identity since 
world war ii 
krejci explained the seeming indifference with a quote from 
former chancellor julius raab 
german is our mother tongue but austria is our mother 
country

its easy to tell when a tv movie is written in 
los angeles at times of crisis the characters say things like 
i cant believe this is happening or this isnt 
happening 
indeed in thanksgiving day airing tonight on nbc mary 
tyler moore plays a freshly minted widow who gets grossed out by 
her oldest sons tasteless eulogy and mutters is this really 
happening 
it is it is part of what nbc calls an offbeat black comedy 
in which max schloss tony curtis a wealthy maker of industrial 
gloves in detroit dies at thanksgiving dinner his head falling 
into the turkey hes carving 
this causes hunger mourning and later crises that include 
veteran tv yeller morton downey jr briefly loose as a lech who is 
hot for maxs widow moore he vomits into the bushes not once but 
twice when she says no dice 
that is offbeat but look at it this way the script is by steve 
zacharias and jeff buhai whose previous biggie was revenge of 
the nerds 
on the bright side the show includes a cameo appearance by 
sonny bono who once sang half of i got you babe 
and its actually fitfully funny 
this is largely because of the valiantly deft direction by gino 
tanasescu and wonderful comic turns first by curtis in his 
toobrief stay then by joe bologna as ned monk a ruthless 
billionaire once engaged to the widow schloss 
and the show does get off to a good start its initial scenes 
have the sly sardonic tone of a traditional midwestern family 
reunion on thanksgiving engineered by the maestro of americana 
jean shepherd 
alas it starts sputtering after max dies in midcarve and his 
industrialglove empire is turned over to randy jonathon 
brandmeier his divorced womanizing happygolucky slob of an 
older son 
the authors try to keep things lively randy who has his two 
kids with him still fights with his sister curtis daughter 
kelly just like old times only now shes a lesbian activist 
with gasp a lover 
and theres a second schloss son try saying that rapidly 
played by andy hirsh his character michael just watches tv 
well that might be considered lively in hollywood 
moving right along now randy whose inherited business is 
rapidly going poof would be very happy for the wealthy monk to 
marry his mother he even says you ought to go out with my mom 
ned shes got a great body 
little does he know that the evil mogul still in love with the 
widow schloss after 30 years will resort to crushing the familys 
glove empire 
the idea is to drive her into his arms to save her family she 
broke off their first engagement due to what you might call a 
mothers love 
all this unfolds with the aid of strained writing one spoken 
crudity that would have had nbc censors shouting bingo in 
their glory days and an inspiring moment when the sister threatens 
to drool on randys face 
the fine silly bits scattered about usually go to bologna 
during a banquet honoring ned for his aid to the homeless for 
example ned declares himself pleased to give them a taste of 
what they need nouvelle cuisine 
another worthy scene ned wooing the widow does it with a 
string quartet and serenades her by playing mozart on the 
bassoon 
but the good times are frittered away by such things as a silly 
south seas musical fantasy number involving moore or the family 
butler posing this question to another of randys sweeties a 
dental hygienist 
ive been flossing my teeth for three years now but let me 
ask you is it all right to eat the little food particles once you 
get em out from between your teeth 
too bad nbc should have had the script tuned up by an old pro 
an old pro is someone who knows that too much truly tasteless humor 
usually means the authors are film school students who graduated 
magna cum porkys 
 
elsewhere in television 
the simpsons get down responding to public demand maybe the 
bestknown of foxs the simpsons will make his singing debut 
tuesday when geffen records releases do the bartman its a 
single part of the longawaited the simpsons sing the blues 
album that will be released on dec 6 at that time fox also will 
air a do the bartman music video it runs just over five 
minutes at the end of the simpsons

in a country where hawkers sell cocacola 
beside monuments to martyrs of us invasions plans for a 
freetrade agreement with mexicos powerful northern neighbor rouse 
both hope and dread 
president carlos salinas de gortari says free trade and a 
liberalized economy will help mexico become a part of the first 
not the third world 
he and president bush are to meet in monterrey mexico on nov 
27 to advance their plans for free trade formal negotiations are 
to start in the first half of 1991 and could be finished in two 
years 
mexican businessmen are eager to sell in a market 40 times 
larger than their own but fear greater competition from richer 
american rivals 
labor leaders see a chance for new jobs and a risk of losing old 
ones 
intellectuals look upon free tradeas part of a reform pattern 
that is transforming mexico turning it from government control to 
a freer market 
a country that has struggled for decades to remain apart from 
the colossus across the rio grande now is on the verge of embracing 
it 
we are at the end of the mexican revolution or at least we 
are at the end of the identity of the national state with mexican 
revolution said francisco valdes a political scientist 
canada may join the talks which could lead to a north american 
freetrade zone of 350 million people 
for decades mexican industry hid behind high tariff walls that 
made legally imported goods unavailable or extremely expensive the 
resulting lack of competition often led to inefficient local 
companies producing shoddy goods 
opening the gates to better and cheaper products from the north 
has some managements wondering if they can survive the mexican 
decision to join the tarifflowering general agreement on tariffs 
and trade exposed some industries to serious foreign cometition for 
the first time 
businessmen like viktor miklis president of the national 
chamber of the clothing industry are excited by access to the us 
market 
he told journalists imports had captured 30 percent of the 
domestic market because of tariff cuts but that mexico could vastly 
increase exports to the united states which now gets less than 3 
percent of its imported clothing from this country 
these new treaties just as they could be very beneficial 
they could be damaging if we dont think about them and if we are 
not prepared he said 
his organization and other groups opened a design and style 
center this year to help mexican companies track international 
fashions they once could ignore and to offer computerized design 
and cutting services 
this is state of the art said the centers technical 
director robert demmer who returned to mexico from the new york 
city garment district to help run the center you cant find 
anything better than this 
he showed off usmade computer terminals that plot clothing 
designs and patterns and guide a machine that slices through 50 to 
200 pieces of fabric at a time 
miklis and demmer say they hope such knowhow will help keep 
mexico from being a sweatshop that assembles imported parts in 
foreignowned factories 
if mexican businessmen cant keep up youll have japanese 
people coming in here and setting up a plant with their own manager 
and methods and were going to be cleaning and sweeping and doing 
the crappy work once again demmer said 
mexicans dont want to be in the trade agreement only because 
of cheap labor 
mexicos minimum wage of 340 to 410 a day depending on the 
area lures many foreign investors most business leaders and 
economists say however that free trade should push wages up by 
creating competition for more skilled and productive workers 
in his annual state of the nation speech this month salinas 
said mexico would suffer stagnation technological backwardness 
social tension and finally national weakness in other words 
effective loss of sovereignty if it did not join the world 
economy 
mexico city newspapers carry daily stories about the trade 
agreement even though no details are known many critics express 
fear that mexico will swap its independence for foreign investment 
we are removing all of our traditional outlooks to arrive 
at a national surrender which is the plan for negotiating a 
freetrade treaty political scientist alfonso aguilar said at a 
seminar on global political change 
valdes a researcher at the national autonomous university of 
mexico said increased integration of the us and mexican 
economies is inevitable but the problem is how it is 
negotiated 
he complained that little information about the forthcoming 
treaty was available and said mexico has a poor record of 
negotiating 
mexico is bargaining from weakness valdes said and the 
united states has a tendency to take advantage of the weak 
many mexicans say us companies already operating in mexico 
ignore safety and environmental standards they would have to meet 
in the united states 
what mexico is selling perversely is a country without 
regulations aguilar said but added that a freetrade agreement 
treaty would pressure business to meet us standards 
noting that mexicos prosperity and stability is important to 
the united states miklis gave us companies a message join us 
dont use us

they could have become statistics in the 
predicted shakeout of the nations airline industry but eastern 
airlines and pan am corp are still here 
for the time being anyway 
the two carriers among the weakest in an industry burdened by 
rising fuel costs signed new leases on life this past week one 
in bankruptcy court the other in the boardroom 
both deals went down within minutes of each other late wednesday 
night 
eastern operating under bankruptcy court supervision persuaded 
judge burton r lifland to release cash from an escrow account and 
reject a creditors request to liquidate the airline 
pan am weighed down by heavy operating losses completed the 
sale of transatlantic routes to stronger rival ual corp that will 
bring in 400 million and set the stage for joint marketing efforts 
by the two carriers 
rejuvenation was far from assured in either case eastern only 
got half of a requested 30 million from the escrow account and 
could hit another financial flash point within weeks pan am 
meanwhile must develop a plan for succeeding as a smaller carrier 
it hinted at a worst case scenario thursday announcing that in the 
unlikely event it stopped flying ual would honor up to 100 
million of pan am tickets 
both eastern and pan am faced a tough climb against the same 
economic conditions that drove them to their separate fates fuel 
prices have risen relentlessly since the persian gulf crisis began 
in august and air travel has become a victim of the nationwide 
economic downturn 
observers were most skeptical of easterns chances since it is 
trying to rebuild its customer base by attracting firstclass 
business at coach fares creditors of the airline argued that 
strategy was hopeless 
eastern trustee martin r shugrue jr who has been running the 
airline since frank lorenzo was ousted in april was unbowed by the 
challenge although he had to admit easterns reputation was 
damaged by the creditors push for liquidation 
their actions in public and in the media are nothing short of 
reckless and shameful he said after the bankruptcy court ordeal 
the ninehour bankruptcy hearing wednesday had attracted legions 
of reporters photographers and television film crews who had put 
the eastern story on the back burner the past few months

in another bankruptcy drama drexel burnham lambert inc was hit 
with billions of dollars worth of claims from the government and 
private investors allegedly defrauded by the investment firm 
the biggest bombshell hit wednesday when government thrift 
regulators filed claims seeking 113 billion total claims from 
all those who say they were defrauded could approach 30 billion 
far more than whats left to be doled out by drexel in its chapter 
11 reorganization 
lawyers are negotiating how much drexel will set aside to pay 
all the claims it only has about 3 billion in assets plus 
various investments and a long list of other creditors waiting to 
be paid 
most fraud claims are related to drexels 1989 guilty plea to 
six felony counts of illegal trading the thrift regulators laid 
some of the blame for the ampl crisis at drexels door alleging 
that the firm ran a corrupt junkbond network that helped ruin 
dozens of savings and loans 
drexels junkbond ace michael milken facing a criminal 
sentencing in federal district court wednesday asked judge kimba 
wood to show him mercy in an 11page letter to the judge milken 
admitted he broke the law but said he feared prison and hoped to be 
sentenced to community service 
in one revealing passage from the letter he told the judge of 
his emotional reaction to the motion picture field of dreams 
in which an iowa farmer has a mystical reunion with his dead 
father who returns to play baseball on a diamond the farmer has 
hewn from a cornfield 
i found myself wondering what i would be saying to my father 
if he was alive today milken wrote 
in a signal of what could be in store for milken judge miriam 
cedarbaum gave john a mulheren jr a years worth of prison time 
and a 168 million fine on a stock manipulation conviction the 
judge said the former friend of wall street felon ivan boesky 
deserved jail because he tampered with the integrity of the stock 
market

donald trump was pressured by his junk bondholders to put the 
eighth wonder of the world the taj mahal casino in atlantic 
city into bankruptcy after his missed a deadline for a 473 
million interest payment 
but the socalled prepackaged bankruptcy would theoretically 
last only a matter of weeks while trump and the bondholders work 
out a new payment schedule on 675 million worth of junk 
trump put a positive spin on the episode but it erected still 
another hurdle for the developercasino baron who has junk bonds 
outstanding on all three of his gaming establishments and owes 2 
billion to banks 
one of trumps interested bondholders was investor carl icahn 
whose influence in the negotiations with trump was hard to measure 
but icahn was making news on two other fronts with a bid to buy 
pan am and fresh demands for usx corp 
the pan am idea fizzled quickly since it was only a backup for 
the ultimately successful deal between pan am and ual but usx 
faced continuing pressure from icahn who is the energy and steel 
companys biggest shareholder 
in a letter to usx chairman charles corry icahn praised the 
companys plans to transfer its steel operations to a separate 
subsidiary but he reiterated his threat to seek seats on the board 
unless usx pursued a major restructuring icahn would like to see 
the steel business sold off and the proceeds distributed to 
shareholders 
elsewhere dallas investor harold simmons was stirring updating 
a play for defense giant lockheed corp simmons rebuffed in a 
previous attempt to increase his 20 percent stake in the company 
offered to take it private in a 2 billion deal if lockheed put up 
half the cash the company responded cautiously and market reaction 
was lukewarm

for stockmarket investors looking for relief 
from a steady barrage of recession news the picture presented by 
corporate profits offers scant encouragement right now 
more than a year after earnings at many businesses started to 
slump wall street analysts are still busy cutting their profit 
estimates for 1990 and 1991 as well 
the stock market meanwhile has been demonstrating that it is 
still vulnerable to disappointments on the bottom line 
the latest gloomy message came via longdistance telephone when 
mci communications one of the stalwarts of the overthecounter 
market announced a restructuring plan 
the company said the costs of the changes it would be making 
plus intense competition loomed as a drag on earnings for the 
next several quarters 
the ensuing selling pressure on mci spread to stocks of other 
companies in the longdistance phone business including american 
telephone amp telegraph with its 25 millionplus shareholders and 
united telecommunications and gte the two owners of us sprint 
communications 
atampts assertion that its longdistance business remained strong 
did little to calm investors 
the mci problem of course concerned a specific company in a 
specific business but it also echoed a broader theme 
the outlook for corporate profits is dismal said suresh 
bhirud at oppenheimer amp co in his latest appraisal of the 
stockmarket outlook 
technical rallies notwithstanding the fundamentals remain 
largely negative for the stock market in our opinion even at 
current levels the market is still somewhat overvalued

the 1980s were a decade of expansion on wall 
street the 1990s promise to be just the opposite 
moodys investors service said in its annual report on the 
securities industry that wall street faces weak profits and more 
consolidation through the end of the century as bad times erase 
happy memories of a decade of growth 
big companies will continue to take over and bail out weakening 
securities firms but some nonetheless will go under moodys said 
competition will increase as banks push into the industry and 
foreign firms threaten us turf 
firms across the board face costcutting pressures moodys 
said likely targets for reductions are reducing the ballooned 
compensation of the 1980s eliminating whole businesses and exiting 
from unprofitable foreign markets 
the 1980s goal of becoming a global player in a broad range of 
products is fading for many firms moodys said in its report 
released thursday managements are refocusing on core business in 
which they can build sustainable competitive advantages 
moodys said wall street firms overhead expenses at the end of 
1989 quadrupled from their 1980 level to 577 billion the 
companies aggregate pretax earnings last year were 18 billion 
slightly lower than in 1980 
the industry has struggled since the october 1987 stock market 
crash more than 45000 jobs have been erased and the key business 
lines of investment banking leveraged buyouts and mergers and 
acquisitions have nosedived 
the outlook now is that those three areas will be much much 
smaller and in some cases nonexistent said moodys vice 
president christopher mahoney who helped prepare the report 
the street was subsidizing a lot of growth domestically and 
internationally from lucrative businesses that are drying up or 
diminishing he said 
moodys predicted further consolidation leading to domination by 
firms created through acquisition by wealthy companies 
ultimately there may be few if any large independent wall 
street securities firms the report said 
the report said that overcapacity in the industry will take 
years to reduce and will put fundamental downward pressure on 
securities firms returns 
the power of diversified strong owners has been a theme of the 
industrys woes this year in which several major securities firms 
have been bailed out of severe financial difficulty by 
deeppocketed parents 
most recently cs first boston inc this week received a 300 
million equity infusion from its swiss parent cs holding which 
took majority control of the investment banking firm cs first 
bostons main us subsidiary is first boston corp 
mahoney said a problem with the trend is that the survival of 
the fittest is thrown on its head wall streets failed firms used 
to be acquired by the successful ones 
one impediment to that now is that a lot of weak firms are 
owned by strong parents so they dont die a natural death 
mahoney said theyre not absorbed by strong firms theyre 
maintained as independent entities 
the moodys report said intense competition continued 
overcapacity and the decline in major business segments mean weak 
prospects for profitability on wall street through the end of the 
century 
additional risks are the temptation for managements to ease 
profit pressure by taking greater risks and the likelihood of more 
aggressive involvement in us and overseas securities markets by 
powerful foreign securities firms and banks moodys said 
the report also cited a recent erosion of the depressionera 
glasssteagall act that prevented commercial banks from entering 
the securities industry 
it said several us bankholding companies including jp 
morgan citicorp and bankers trust are eager to expand further 
into the securities business and they pose important competitive 
threats to us securities firms 
a similar trend is occurring in japan moodys said increasing 
the challenge to us firms core businesses and markets

government regulators for the first time have 
laid much of the blame for the savings and loan industry collapse 
on the junk bond dealings of drexel burnham lambert inc 
in a 60page legal claim federal thrift regulators accuse the 
failed investment firm of bribery fraud market manipulation and 
other serious crimes they allege hastened the demise of 48 savings 
and loan institutions 
the claim which seeks 113 billion on behalf the thrifts was 
released thursday a federal bankruptcy judge denied the government 
more time to investigate drexels junk bond dealings with other 
savings and loans 
sackfuls of claims by investors companies former employees and 
other parties against drexel arrived at us bankruptcy court to 
meet a thursday deadline lawyers said total litigation claims 
would exceed 20 billion 
drexel has only about 3 billion in assets plus a portfolio of 
investments which wont come close to meeting the legal claims and 
those of secured creditors those who definitely are entitled to 
money in the bankruptcy case 
attorneys for drexel investors and the government agencies are 
negotiating to establish an estimate of how much the firm will set 
aside to pay the litigation claims that figure would have to be 
approved by a federal judge 
the charges by the federal deposit insurance corp and 
resolution trust corp are the most detailed yet by the government 
in the sampl collapse which is expected to cost taxpayers 500 
billion over the next 30 years 
thrift industry analysts said that without judging whether 
drexel broke the law blaming the firm for the industrys failure 
was excessive drexel managed most of the 15 billion in highrisk 
highyield bonds bought by thrifts in the 1980s 
the fact is junk bonds played a very small role overall but 
its an area the sampls shouldnt have been in at all in the first 
place said kenneth h thomas a miami consultant who has studied 
the portfolios of failed thrifts thomas estimates that total 
thrift junk bond losses could hit 7 billion 
drexel controlled a network of thrifts that invested billions of 
dollars of federally insured money in the securities some of it 
swapped among the sampls when the market collapsed a year ago much 
of the holdings was wiped out 
the sweeping allegations describe a market rigged by drexel in 
concert with thrift executives the fdic and rtc allege drexel gave 
the junk market the appearance of liquidity by fixing prices 
mandating who would buy which securities and providing investment 
opportunities to favored customers 
thrift executives were induced to buy and sell the bonds at 
drexels behest to share in the plunder of their own 
institutions and to obtain other benefits including assistance in 
evading regulatory discipline of their sampl the agencies said 
other thrifts were victims of alleged fraud and conspiracy the 
agencies claim the firm and its coconspirators also ran an 
extensive propaganda campaign to mislead the public about junk 
bonds the filing states 
the allegations are likely to be challenged in court and 
several creditors and outside observers complained that the 
government which was responsible for regulating the savings and 
loans was ignoring its own role in the thrift debacle 
the fdic monitored the operations of all these thrifts while 
they were in business and did not take any steps to stop it while 
the actual conduct was going on said barry dichter attorney for 
one of drexels largest creditors 
nonetheless the fdic and rtc detail alleged securities price 
manipulation secret parking arrangements bogus transactions 
payoffs loans among members of the junk network and rampant 
violation of federal disclosure laws 
in total the agencies seek 68 billion in damages for junk 
bond and other frauds they also want another 45 billion on 
behalf of columbia savings amp loan association of beverly hills 
calif which has not yet been taken over by the government 
among the allegations 
drexel helped centrust bank chairman david paul skirt florida 
laws by falsifying records about the thrifts purchase of more than 
1 billion in securities paul also is accused of illegally holding 
millions of shares of securities for drexel 
drexel through a series of investments with associates helped 
install a new management of imperial savings association of san 
diego which then became a major purchaser of drexelissued junk 
bonds imperial in one year increased its junk bond investments 
from 1 million to 1 billion the thrift has lost 56 million on 
sales of drexel junk bonds 
drexel enabled nowindicted financier charles keating to gain 
control of lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif 
and gave him stock kickbacks in exchange for huge linoln 
investments in drexelunderwritten junk bonds some in major 
takeover deals of the 1980s

united airlines parent company has agreed to 
honor up to 100 million of pan am corps tickets at face value if 
the troubled airline should stop flying 
cashstrapped pan am insisted it was not trying to signal any 
pending problems pan am said that the unusual guarantee was being 
offered in an effort to calm any fears that the current sluggish 
economy could leave anyone holding worthless tickets 
we recognize that our financial condition has been weakened 
and certainly the current fuel situation is having a negative 
impact on the companys finances pan am spokeswoman pamela 
hanlon said thursday hanlon was unaware of any similar guarantees 
ever taking place in the air travel industry 
the arrangement is part of a marketing agreement struck by the 
rival carriers in a 400 million deal that gives united airlines 
five coveted london routes that had been some of the most prized 
possessions of pan am in the marketing pact the two carriers also 
agreed to coordinate some flights in an effort to feed passengers 
to one another 
pan am and ual signed the deal late wednesday night after first 
announcing it in october ual is also getting additional routes 
pan ams facilities at san francisco international airport 
washingtons dulles airport and londons heathrow airport two 
boeing 747s two spare engines and spare parts 
in a statement outlining the details pan am said thursday 
evening that united will redeem up to 100 million face value of 
pan am tickets for travel on united if pan am were to cease its air 
transportation operations 
pan am chairman thomas g plaskett said the customer 
protection guarantee program is yet another demonstration of pan 
ams and uniteds commitment to the traveling public 
hanlon said the ticket guarantee isnt intended to raise 
suggestions that we would stop flying but it should certainly 
alleviate any travel agency or consumer fears that travelers would 
be left with worthless tickets if indeed the carrier ever did stop 
flying there is certainly no plan or intention to stop 
operations 
pan am was merely trying to calm any travelers who are concerned 
about the overall health of the air travel industry which has been 
rocked by soaring fuel prices and the sluggish us economy 
industry executives predict the airlines will lose up to 2 billion 
in 1990 
asked for the face value of pan ams tickets that are currently 
outstanding hanlon said those figures are not made public 
united issued a statement on the marketing agreement that said 
it will honor up to 100 million in pan am tickets should the 
carrier cease operation

the us merchandise trade deficit narrowed 
33 percent to 94 billion in september the first improvement 
since june the government reported today but petroleum imports 
were at their highest level in nine years because of escalating 
costs due to the persian gulf crisis 
the commerce department said imports dropped 24 percent to 
413 billion despite a huge 285 percent jump in petroleum 
imports but exports also fell down 22 percent to 318 billion 
the deficit is the difference between the two 
the cost of imported oil rose to 62 billion as the price per 
barrel shot ahead 244 percent to 2431 volume increased 67 
percent to 85 million barrels a day it was the largest oil bill 
since october 1981 when it rose to 63 billion the price per 
barrel then was 3250 
the september deficit pushed the gap to a seasonally adjusted 
rate of 991 billion for the first nine months of the year the 
deficit peaked at 152 billion in 1987 and the fell to 11853 
billion in 1988 and to 10940 billion last year 
before the persian gulf crisis pumped up oil prices government 
officials and economists believed the gap would fall below 100 
billion for the first time since 1983 
bush administration officials still view exports as one of the 
few nets available to keep the economy from falling into or too 
far into a recession 
it has accounted in recent years for a third of the nations 
economic growth consumer spending the other twothirds has been 
fading recently in the face of adverse economic news acerbated by 
the persian gulf crisis 
some officials hope that a weaker dollar will help prop up 
exports by making us products less expensive overseas at the 
same time they say a cheaper dollar will make imports more 
expensive and thus less attractive to americans 
excluding oil products the deficit totaled 38 billion down 
12 billion from the august nonoil gap the government contends 
this is a better measure of the nations overseas competitiveness 
the price of oil was driven up when iraq stormed kuwait on aug 
2 and disrupted world markets in the month that followed the cost 
of oil imports jumped 209 percent to 48 billion although volume 
also dropped 
economist michael p niemira of the mitsubishi bank in new york 
said in advance of the report that the persian gulf crisis also had 
an effect on exports 
exports transported by air during september again were 
disrupted by the military operation in the middle east when some 
domestic air cargo companies that usually haul shipments overseas 
were diverted to transport military goods he wrote in the banks 
weekly economic indicator report 
imports of foreignmade cars declined 42 percent in september 
imports of capital goods and consumer goods also fell while 
industrial supplies increased 
the decline in exports was widespread except for capital goods 
which rose fractionally 
the biggest deficit continued to be with japan a 305 billion 
imbalance down from 378 billion in august 
other deficits included taiwan 103 billion china 107 
billion canada 125 billion south korea 406 million hong 
kong 231 million and brazil 105 million 
the united states posted a 882 million surplus in its trade 
with western europe after a 374 million imbalance a month earlier

mci communications corp the nations 
secondlargest longdistance telephone company cited weak economic 
conditions and increased competition in announcing that it may lay 
off as many as 1500 workers over the next six months 
company officials said it was too early to say where the layoffs 
would occur 
according to plans announced thursday mci will fold its seven 
domestic divisions into four and create two new units to deal with 
network services and consumer markets 
president bert c roberts jr said the slowing economy the 
costs of changing the companys structure and the costs of a recent 
125 billion acquisition are negative constraints on the 
companys financial performance for the next several quarters 
mci based in washington has seen its expansion slow to a crawl 
as market leader american telephone amp telegraph co has moved to 
recapture market share 
the expansion of the longdistance market has also faltered 
because of the economic downturn 
roberts said if current trends continue mcis revenue growth 
would flat for the quarter compared to the previous quarter 
analyst geoff johnson with argus research of new york said 
longdistance calling has slowed significantly because customers 
are cutting back on the number and length of calls he said the 
trend was expected to continue 
mci spokesman bernard goodrich called the 1500 job losses 
really kind of slim given that the company has about 25000 
workers 
mci had revenues in 1989 of 65 billion 
in july the federal communications commission approved mcis 
merger with telecom usa inc the fourth largest us long distance 
company

general dynamics electronics division plans to 
cut the units unionrepresented work force by up to 15 percent in 
january labor officials said 
general dynamics also said it will lay off 61 convair 
machinists effective jan 12 and has notified labor 
representatives that more of the divisions employees may be laid 
off after the first of the year 
the company told the international association of machinists 
which represents almost 6000 workers at the companys san diego 
divisions in a letter earlier this month that the electronics 
division employees would be laid off effective jan 28 iam 
district lodge 50 president ed maudlin said thursday 
company spokesman jack isabel acknowledged that it is possible 
that we will make staff adjustments before the end of the year 
if there is a work adjustment notices will be given after 
thanksgiving and will be effective after the holidays isabel 
said 
however he declined to comment on the number of workers who 
could be lad off or the divisions that would be affected the san 
diego divisions employ 17900 people 
the announcement comes as aerospace firms from san diego to 
seattle are paring payrolls in an effort to blunt the effects of 
defense cutbacks 
union officials said a 15 percent reduction in the electronics 
division would put about 120 machinists out of work approximately 
800 of the units 2900 employees are represented by iam 
there arent too many jobs out there right now maudlin 
said the picture really isnt that bright 
the layoff notice came less than four months after general 
dynamics reported a 240 million loss due to cost overruns on 
contracts to build the a12 navy bomber and field radios for the 
army 
the two programs resulted in a 500 million onetime charge 
against secondquarter earnings the largest in company history 
the electronics division which was awarded the army radio 
contract two years ago opened a new facility in tallahassee fla 
to manufacture 265000 of the handheld devices

he also signed bills to award teachers grants for environmental

over the next decade automobiles must emit 40 to 60 percent 
less pollution industrial plants must cut toxic air emissions by 
90 percent the oil industry must supply cleanerburning gasoline 
in cities with the worst smog and coalburning electric plants 
will have to cut in half their emissions of sulfur dioxide which 
causes acid rain 
environmentalists although praising bush and lauding the new 
law expressed concern over hether the provisions will be 
aggressively implemented and enforced 
some suggested that polluters a few of whom already are 
complaining that some of the new requirements cannot be met will 
seek to water down the law as the environmental protection agency 
writes the regulations to implement it 
sen max baucus dmont a key architect of the legislation and 
chairman of the senates subcommittee on environmental protection 
said now its a matter of oversight and making sure it works 
epa administrator william reilly said the agency has already 
begun to hire several hundred additional employees to deal with the 
new regulations and said he has no doubts the law will be 
administered aggressively 
its the most ambitious law that epa has ever administered 
said reilly we recognize how ambitious it is i believe 
were up to the challenge 
the epa anticipates issuing at least 27 major new regulations 
under the clean air law over the next two years eventually more 
than 2000 people will be involved in administering clean air 
regulations officials said 
william rosenberg the epa associate administrator who will 
oversee those regulations said the task of cleaning up the air 
will be a decadelong effort its not going to happen overnight 
but we should see some progress in a couple of years he said 
most of the bills major provisions do not take effect fully 
until the end of the decade many cities will have 10 to 15 years 
to meet federal air quality standards 
richard ayres executive director of the clean air coalition 
said that in every respect this bill is an advance over todays 
law but maintained that its effectiveness will depend on how the 
requirements are implemented and enforced 
the tools are in the presidents hands and regulations can 
be either pursued aggressively or in a halfhearted manner said 
ayres also an attorney for the natural resources defense council 
if george bush succumbs to polluter pressure to emasculate the 
clean air act with ineffective regulations americans will never 
breathe the clean air their president has promised them said 
ruth caplan executive director of environmental action 
environmentalists noted that the original clean air law enacted 
in 1970 directed that cities achieve smogfree healthy air by 
1987 last year 96 cities had yet to meet those requirements 
the 1970 law called on utilities to achieve cleaner air by 
curtailing chemical emissions a few years later the utilities 
received permission to meet the requirements by sending the 
pollutants high into the air through tall smokestacks 
sulfur dioxide from those midwestern smokestacks later were 
found to be responsible for the acid rain that has damaged lakes 
and aquatic life in the northeast

a federal appeals court has lifted a 
controversial nationwide ban on imports of yellowfin tuna from 
mexico 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals on thursday ended an 
embargo ordered oct 4 by a federal judge in san francisco the 
threejudge panel gave no reason for its action but scheduled oral 
arguments in the case for next february 
imposed under a us dolphinprotection law the embargo has 
stirred some antius feeling in mexico and has affected the 
debate over establishment of a joint freetrade zone for the two 
countries 
a lawyer for environmental groups that fought for the ban said 
the government submitted declarations to the court from 
administration officials saying the embargo was disrupting 
relations with mexico on issues that included antidrug efforts nd 
petroleum sales 
the officials included commerce secretary robert mosbacher and 
john negroponte the us ambassador to mexico said joshua floum 
lawyer for the earth island institute and the marine mammal fund 
congress knew if an embargo was imposed mexico wouldnt like 
it were surprised that agents of the us government are so 
hostile to the law the courts action will allow the continued 
slaughter of dolphins by mexico without the consequences 
contemplated by congress floum said 
floum said he would seek reconsideration of the ruling signed 
by judges thomas tang jerome farris and alex kozinski 
martin hochman regional counsel for the commerce departments 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration said the 
government hopes to gain foreign cooperation in reducing dolphin 
kills in meetings over the next several months 
one reason for the kind of reaction weve gotten from foreign 
nations is that it is unilateral action by the united states 
hochman said the hope is something can be achieved that will do 
what the us domestic legislation is aiming at but in a 
cooperative way with the foreign countries 
he said a us delegation including environmental and tuna 
industry representatives has been meeting with eastern pacific 
tuna fishing nations to discuss a possible international 
organization or agreement on the issue 
hochman said mexico has the largest foreign tuna fleet but sells 
most of its tuna to europe 
the suit was filed under a law aimed at reducing the killing of 
dolphins that swim above yellowfin tuna in the eastern pacific 
some commercial tuna fleets deliberately drop their nets on 
dolphins 
the law requires the us government to embargo tuna from 
nations that fail to reduce their dolphinkilling below certain 
levels for 1989 twice the kill rate of the us tuna fleet and 
for any year a total kill that includes no more than 15 percent 
eastern spinner dolphins a protected subspecies 
us district judge thelton henderson ordered a ban aug 28 on 
imports of tuna from mexico panama ecuador venezuela and the 
pacific island nation of vanuatu saying the commerce department 
had failed to show that their 1989 dolphin kill rates were less 
than twice the rate of the us fleet 
the commerce department never imposed the embargo on ecuador 
venezuela or vanuatu saying new figures from the first eight 
months of 1990 showed that they were in compliance panama did not 
meet the limit and is being embargoed 
the department also said mexico would not be embargoed because 
it was below the limit for the first eight months of 1990 but 
henderson ordered an embargo on mexican tuna oct 4 and extended it 
oct 19 citing mexicos excessive kills of eastern spinner 
dolphins in 1989 
though commerce department figures showed mexico below the 15 
percent limit for eastern spinners in the first eight months of 
1990 henderson said the law protecting eastern spinners required 
compliance for an entire year before an embargo could be lifted 
government lawyers argued that henderson should have deferred to 
the departments interpretation of the law

telephone companies reported normal operations 
today after bracing for a possible disruption of service somewhere 
in the country by computer hackers breaking into the phone 
network 
nonspecific threats had been made to invade the massive 
computers that control the telephone network but not to attack 
physical facilities industry sources said 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
threats apparently were in connection with a sentencing scheduled 
in atlanta this afternoon for three members of a hackers group 
called the legion of doom who had broken into bellsouth corp 
computers 
franklin e darden jr and robert j riggs pleaded guilty 
earlier this year in federal court to one conspiracy count each 
adam e grant pleaded guilty to possessing 15 or more access 
devices with intent to defraud 
but late morning on the east coast no problems had been 
reported 
this has been a normal weekday and theres been no indication 
of trouble anywhere in the network said herb linnen a spokesman 
for american telephone amp telegraph co 
on thursday linnen had said atampt was aware of a purported 
threat to try and disrupt at least part of the nationwide 
network and that company security officials had alerted atampt 
managers nationwide to be alert 
we have not been able to assess the validity of the threats 
but we certainly take any threats seriously and weve taken 
precautions to minimize the risk of intrusion bellsouth 
spokesman bill mccloskey said 
linnen said the purported threat was not against any single 
company he said the rumor of the attempted disruption was 
discussed at a regular meeting wednesday of technical executives of 
a number of phone companies 
we have no idea how widespread the threat might be but its 
our understanding that the group may be national said peter 
goodale a spokesman for nynex corp parent of the new england 
telephone and new york telephone companies weve taken the 
appropriate security measures to ensure the integrity of our 
network 
fbi and defense department officials said they were unaware of 
any such threat 
federal prosecutors in chicago last year charged that members of 
the legion of doom had used their computers in february 1989 to tap 
into the 911 system of atlantabased bellsouth and copy the 
program 
the information then was published in an electronic newsletter 
in chicago for hackers but the 911 network was not disrupted 
charges against the chicago publisher were dropped in july

when it comes to youngsters studying the 
economy has about the same appeal as eating vegetables says 
suzanne gallagher of virginia commonwealth university 
just give it a chance said ms gallagher sounding like a 
parent trying to get a child to take a mouthful of brussels 
sprouts economics has a bad press but its not dull or 
difficult 
ms gallagher who came to the school in july to teach teachers 
how to teach economics calls her class economics the science of 
common sense 
i think we all need to be economists on our own behalf she 
said my favorite analogy is that you wouldnt send a child out 
to play ball without explaining the rules of the game you 
shouldnt do that for the economy either 
through the efforts of the schools center for economic 
education hundreds of teachers in public and private schools in 
the state are mixing lessons on supply and demand inflation and 
economic alphabet soup gnps and cpis with regular studies on 
social studies science and other subjects 
you think you have to sit and teach an economics lesson 
said michelle via who took a course at the school last year for 
ideas to show her firstgrade students at mary munford school in 
richmond but you dont have to do that at all youre already 
doing so many things that relate to it 
ms via decided to incorporate economics into a school project 
on recycling aluminum cans besides learning math by counting the 
cans and science by weighing them ms vias 25 students talked 
about the scarcity of natural resources and why it is cheaper to 
recycle aluminum than to mine the ore used to make the metal 
her students also learned about the capital resources needed for 
recycling they got to see the truck come in and pick up the 
cans she said 
as the grade level increases so does the sophistication of the 
economics lesson 
carole sandy who teaches ancient history to eighthgraders at 
richmonds collegiate schools has her students become citizens of 
rome some are nobles some are soldiers and some are slaves all 
learn that their social status reflects their economic status 
you either gain or suffer under the rule of caesar augustus 
said ms sandy who first gained a respect for economics while 
attending a ucla pilot program in 1979 
i was basically very cynical about economics she said 
coming back as a promoter of economics was a pretty interesting 
change around here 
robert c jameison a brookland middle school social studies 
teacher helps his seventhgraders learn about what he called the 
cottonball economics that played a role in precipitating the 
civil war the students take on the roles of three sides in the war 
the industrial north the agrarian south and cottoncustomer 
england 
jameison said ms gallaghers ideas on teaching economics are 
excellent for getting students pulled into the subject she makes 
students realize theres more to a situation than meets the eye 
and it makes it fun he said 
ms gallagher who came here from the university of west 
floridas center for economic education said school activities 
that relate to economics range from opportunity cost lessons 
choosing say to go out for pizza instead of studying to 
auctioning a candy bar to determine its market value 
virginia also has about 1000 teams in various schools playing a 
stock market game a 10week investment simulation program each 
team starts with 100000 in pretend money and buys sells and 
trades stocks to increase the teams wealth 
its a whole lot like the real world she said the kids 
love it it gives them something to talk to their parents about 
and the parents can learn something right along with their kids

fax machines big enough to send blueprints 
computers that fit into a pocket and gizmos of every size in 
between line the miles of aisles at the worlds largest computer 
show 
and if the machines dont catch the eye the displays and 
exhibitors probably will 
at one booth at the comdex show a companys representatives 
played pingpong at another they pranced around dressed as 
football players and cheerleaders across the hall exhibitors wore 
roaring 20s gangster getups 
pop music blared from displays hawking multimedia the 
combination of music text graphics and video that is one of the 
hot items at this years show 
overhead green laser light danced across the ceiling of the 
cavernous las vegas convention center conventioneers beneath it 
lined up for free software and raffles that gave away cd players 
and personal computers 
a software display area featured giant dixon pens and crayola 
crayons symbolizing the software industrys theme of easytouse 
graphicsbased programs intel corps exhibit was anchored by a 
walkthrough computer where inside the semiconductor companys 
employees extolled the virtues of its microprocessor technology 
despite the circus atmosphere many of the 120000 attendees 
appeared to be doing business at the show which ended friday 
technical specifications on products were traded as freely as 
business cards conventioneers arms were laden with shopping bags 
emblazoned with company logos that brimmed with glossy brochures on 
new products 
there was little evidence amid the hype that the economy may be 
entering a recession and that the computer industry has been in a 
slump for several years both attendance and the number of 
exhibitors was up from last year said comdexs organizers 
but a computer executive from a major insurance company said 
corporations may start to think twice about buying new highend 
computer gear he said makers of cheaper clone computers which 
mimic brandname lines could benefit 
here is a sampling of the more interesting items at comdex 
where exhibits covered the equivalent of 50 football fields 
the video toaster this 1595 device converts a commodore 
amiga personal computer into a video editing machine newtek the 
tiny topeka kan company that developed it says video toaster 
can do the same things as professional tv studio gear costing 
20000 it can cut from one video to another with various special 
effects add titles and logos and colorize blackandwhite images 
computers that recognize handwriting probably the most 
advanced on display is the gridpad from grid systems corp a 
subsidiary of tandy corp the 2370 gridpad which resembles an 
etchasketch can recognize numbers and block letters written on 
its screen with a special pen 
desktop offices canons 2495 navigator combines a small 
personal computer phone answering machine fax and printer into a 
desktop unit designed for the home office 
portable offices this category includes kodaks 3pound 
batteryoperated printer aimed at laptop computer users and 
ricohs 3pound portable copier which can be converted into a fax 
machine by plugging in a 1pound adapter 
portable computers with improved color screens several makers 
demonstrated models based on a technology called active matrix in 
which each pixel or dot on the screen is connected to a separate 
transistor it produces crisper deeper colors than conventional 
laptop color monitors 
palmtop computers these models are so small they fit in a 
coat pocket probably the most sophisticated is the 1995 poqet 
machine from poqet computer this 1pounder runs most programs 
written for the popular dos operating system used by international 
business machines corp computers and ibm compatibles 
among cheaper palmtops ataris 299 portfolio contains a 
calculator address book word processor work organizer and diary 
but doesnt run dos programs 
but palmtops have a major drawback tiny keyboards which could 
be awkward for many adult hands and make their wordprocessing 
programs of limited use 
car adaptors for portable devices several companies offered 
products that plug into the cigarette lighter to provide current 
for computing on the go 
but the most novel products at comdex may be whereabouts by a 
company called artsoft its a series of humorous graphical 
messages that a personal computer user can call up on the screen 
before leaving the office 
among the messages are out to lunch accompanied by a 
picture of a pizza and in a meeting with a space for the 
meetinggoer to type in the location

how long can a bear market last 
for a gloomy answer to that question ask anyone in the 
shrinking band of wall street investors who specialize in 
smallcompany growth stocks 
fans of emerging growth companies get a lot of practice 
being patient enduring lengthy dry spells in their quest to 
discover the budding ibms mercks and philip morrises of the 
future 
but even their fabled stamina has been wearing down of late 
given the continued drubbing their favorites have been subjected to 
in the market decline since midsummer 
by most gauges the last period of sustained prosperity in their 
chosen field of expertise ended around the middle of 1983 
almost everyone involved in small growth stock investing 
throughout the 1980s knows how it feels to get up off the canvas 
observes analyst l keith mullins in a current morgan stanley amp co 
appraisal 
however if you think the latest series of blows have been 
particularly severe you are right from a historical perspective 
the small growth sectors abysmal recent performance is without 
precedent 
when junior growth stocks started to lag behind the mighty bull 
market in the mid1980s their admirers had several explanations to 
console themselves with 
no matter how bright small companies futures might look most 
of them lacked the kind of undervalued assets corporate raiders 
were looking for in the takeover boom on wall street 
these upandcomers didnt have the marquee names that attracted 
big foreign investors they got little benefit from the vogue for 
indexfund investing in which money managers bought up stocks of 
big companies in order to duplicate the performance of some 
yardstick such as standard amp poors 500stock composite index 
by the time wall street had weathered the crash of 1987 many 
analysts figured that the small growth stocks were ready for a 
comeback 
after a shortlived burst of enthusiasm however investors 
turned their backs on the group once again 
then when the market as a whole ran into trouble this year 
junior growth stocks took yet another pounding from the start of 
july through september the t rowe price new horizons fund a 
traditional standardbearer of the emerginggrowth camp fell 264 
percent 
that was almost double the 137 percent loss recorded over the 
same period by the sampp 500 
the third quarter was one of the most difficult periods in the 
funds 30year history john laporte the funds president said 
in a report to shareholders 
we were surprised by the susbtantial underperformance of small 
company stocks because valuation levels were already at the low end 
of historic ranges 
how low has the group gone now well at sept 30 the 
priceearnings ratio of the new horizons fund was 96 of the 
standard amp poors 500s pe equaling lows reached just twice 
before in 1977 and again after the 87 crash 
in theory small growth stocks should carry a normal pe of 
perhaps 15 times that of the overall market if only because these 
companies are in position to post greaterthanaverage profit 
increases in the future 
by an old rule of thumb emerging growth stocks are a bargain 
when their multiple vs the overall market shrinks much below 15 
and should be sold as the multiple gets closer to 2 
if you apply any standard of that sort now says laporte 
emerging growth stocks look incredibly cheap 
from mullinss perspective the point is clear the present 
valuations for small growth stocks are either a temporary anomaly 
or the group has sunk permanently into uncharted valuation 
waters

dow jones amp co inc said friday it was boosting 
advertising rates by 7 percent for barrons national business and 
financial weekly effective in january 1991 
the rate hike is the latest in a recent series of increases 
announced at publications such as time newsweek us news amp world 
report magazines despite the recent slump in demand for print and 
broadcast advertising 
it also comes only two weeks after the weekly announced it was 
boosting its cover price by 50 cents to 250 effective with the 
dec 3 issue and subscription prices by 10 a year to 109 in 1991

ago this years 7 percent increase applies to its national and 
regional editions 
the national rate for a fullpage ad will rise to 15488 
robert paradise publisher of barrons said the increase was 
fair and reasonable given the publications efficiency in reaching 
top corporate executives financial professionals and individual 
investors 
barrons weekly circulation averaged 250789 in the latest 
reporting period ad volume for the first nine months of the year 
was off 43 percent 
barrons sister publication the wall street journal announced 
last week it was boosting its ad rates starting next year by 6 
percent for national ads 7 percent to 9 percent for regional 
editions and 10 percent to 12 percent for overseas editions

americas merchandise trade balance narrowed 
to 94 billion in september the government said friday analysts 
said the improvement probably likely sprang from consumer 
retrenchment in the face of a weakening economy 
imports were weak and that confirms the weakness in the 
economy itself said economist robert brusca of nikko securities 
co international in new york 
consumers cut their purchases of imported goods by 24 percent 
to 413 billion despite a 285 percent jump in the cost of 
imported oil 
exports also dropped down 22 percent to 318 billion 
the difference meant a 33 percent improvement over augusts 
97 billion gap 
bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch capital markets 
in new york noted that nonoil imports fell 2 billion and 
predicted that this will continue 
that is as consumer spending and capital spending weakens 
americans will cut back not only on domestic goods but imported 
goods as well 
many economists believe the economy has slid into a recession 
a possibility president bush acknowledged for the first time 
thursday 
i am concerned that we are in a downturn here he said in an 
interview with cable news network 
both the value and the volume of oil imports rose pushing 
americas foreign oil bill to 61 billion in september that was 
the highest since october 1981 when it reached 63 billion during 
a period of global shortages 
oil prices in september boosted by the persian gulf crisis 
jumped 244 percent to 2431 a barrel at the same time shipments 
rose 67 percent to 85 million barrels a day 
among the imports shipments of foreign cars and both capital 
and consumer goods fell foods and beverages were virtually 
unchanged while both industrial supplies including oil and other 
merchandise rose slightly 
except for capital goods almost all general categories of 
exports fell 
export growth is supposed to be one of the factors that helps 
this economy along and moderate the extent of the recession said 
economist john silvia of kemper financial services in chicago 
but if exports continue to grow less than we expect it means the 
economy may go through a deeper recession than what were going 
through 
bush administration officials have been counting on exports to 
cushion a falling the economy particularly as consumer spending 
fades 
exports have accounted in recent years for a third of the 
nations economic growth consumer spending represented the other 
twothirds 
some economists believe a weaker dollar will help prop up 
exports by making us products less expensive overseas but both 
brusca and steinberg said they do not expect much improvement 
before next year 
thirty percent of us exports go to countries that are in a 
recession brusca said you shouldnt hold your breath for 
exports to save the economy 
nevertheless j antonio villamil commerce department chief 
economist pointed to the surplus the united states has posted with 
western europe so far this year including 882 million in 
september 
for the first nine months of 1990 the trade surplus with 
western europe stood at 35 billion compared with a deficit of 
600 million in 1989 and 88 billion during the same period of 
1988 he said 
but at the same time the biggest deficit continued to be with 
japan a 305 billion imbalance down from 378 billion in 
august 
other deficits included taiwan 103 billion china 107 
billion canada 125 billion south korea 406 million hong 
kong 231 million and brazil 105 million 
the september deficit pushed the gap to a seasonally adjusted 
rate of 991 billion for the first nine months of the year the 
deficit peaked at 152 billion in 1987 and then fell to 11853 
billion in 1988 and to 10940 billion last year

foreign buyers may be returning to the us 
treasury debt market despite higher interest rates at home and a 
weak dollar that depresses the securities value 
early numbers from the federal government indicate foreign 
investors added 14 billion to their net holdings of us 
treasuries between july and september 
although that doesnt come close to the levels at which overseas 
investors were financing the federal deficit in the late 80s it 
is a sharp increase from a trend that appeared to be developing 
earlier this year 
in the first three months of 1990 foreign investors were net 
sellers of 66 billion in treasury securities and net buyers of 
only 6 billion in the second quarter 
with higher real interest rates available in japan germany 
france and britain who would buy a security denominated in weak 
dollars to earn low yields 
salomon brothers bond market researchers look to the middle 
east 
politically saudi arabia and other gulf countries have more to 
gain by supporting us bond prices than by picking up a few extra 
percentage points elsewhere 
we suspect that the principal foreign purchasers have been 
official or quasiofficial institutions the investment firm said 
in its weekly research report 
salomon brothers cited a 10 billion thirdquarter rise in the 
amount of treasury securities held in custody at the federal 
reserve for international authorities as another sign that the 
purchasers are tied to foreign governments 
japanese investors participated moderately in the treasurys 
record november refunding auction buying 10year notes and 30year 
bonds but shortly after the auction they turned around and sold 
the securities in the open market 
dealers said the japanese institutions were trying to show 
support for the us government but with the weak dollar and 
interest rates relatively unattractive to those in japan they 
moved to get rid of the securities 
the real interest rate the nominal rate minus projected 
inflation is 4 percent on 10year us notes according to philip 
m hubbard director of londonbased consensus economics inc an 
economic survey firm the real rates on 10year bonds in japan 
germany france and britain are around 6 percent hubbard said 
although there has been more activity recently it is unlikely 
that foreign investors are substantially bolstering the us 
treasury market said carol a stone senior economist at nomura 
securities international inc 
while foreign investors have taken large portions of treasury 
debt they have never dominated domestic investors their recent 
reduced participation has not at all resulted in higher interest 
rates she said in a weekly report 
at the peak of foreign purchases of us treasuries 1988 
overseas investors bought 62 billion or 44 percent of the 
treasurys total net issues in 1989 net foreign buys were 303 
billion or 20 percent of the total 
in the same period yields on 10year treasuries averaged 885 
percent in 1988 and fell to an average of 857 percent so far this 
year she said 
investors intent on keeping thier money in the united states 
meanwhile have had plenty of reason to choose the treasury market 
over other securities 
the weak us economy and expectations of monetary easing by the 
federal reserve prompts many to expect lower interest rates soon 
by buying now they hope to lock in higher yields that might not be 
available much longer 
for quality investors cant beat the us government with 
fears about the effects a recession would have on state and local 
governments to stay current with their municipal bond payments and 
the junk bond market collapse many investors are looking for less 
risk

computer giant hewlettpackard co on 
friday reported an 18 percent drop in fourthquarter earnings 
which it attributed to increases in operating expenses and the cost 
of goods sold 
net earnings totaled 202 million or 83 cents per share in the 
quarter ended oct 31 compared to 246 million or 104 per 
share in the same quarter last year 
net revenue rose 6 percent to 36 billion from 34 billion 
last year 
john a young president and chief executive officer said the 
drop in income was due to slower revenue growth a weaker dollar 
pushing up the cost of overseas operations and a higher cost of 
goods sold 
to offset such setbacks hewlettpackard has consolidated some 
manufacturing operations offered voluntary severance and early 
retirement programs and slowed hiring 
even though weve made good progress toward reducing our 
expense structure we havent yet seen the full benefits of our 
initiatives this quarter young said

consumer inflation slowed slightly in october 
and the countrys trade deficit narrowed but economists attributed 
fridays seemingly upbeat developments to the near certainty that 
the nation has slid into a recession 
meanwhile president bush wrapped up a week of hastily called 
meetings with his economic advisers and leading us business 
executives as the administration scoured for ways to alleviate the 
pain from any economic downturn 
bush received a generally bleak assessment of the economys 
prospects from the executives leading the president to acknowledge 
the possibility of a recession for the first time he continued to 
insist however that any downturn would be brief and relatively 
mild 
most seem to feel that if we have a recession it will not be 
deep and that well come out of it relatively soon six months at 
most and i would like to think that is true bush said in an 
interview with cable news network 
the labor department reported that the consumer price index rose 
06 percent in october better than the 08 percent spurts that hit 
in august and september as oil prices surged after iraqs invasion 
of kuwait 
prices rose a modest 03 percent last month for products not 
related to energy economists said this core rate often seen 
as a better barometer of inflation probably stayed relatively low 
because the economic slump is holding down prices 
the sliding economy is preventing the oil and energy shock 
from causing a runaway on inflation said allen sinai chief 
economist at the boston co 
theres a hint here that we may get through this inflationary 
shock from oil in reasonably good shape but only at the cost of a 
sharp downturn in the economy keeping inflation from getting out of 
hand sinai said 
added analyst david wyss of drimcgraw hill 
theres some good news on the inflation side but bad news on 
the real side which is that the real economy is a mess 
the slightly improved inflation rate might give room to maneuver 
to the federal reserve which has been uner pressure from the bush 
administration to ease its inflationfighting campaign and lower 
interest rates to spur the economy analysts said 
with inflation stable or coming down the fed has some room to 
fight a recession wyss said 
also friday the commerce department reported that the us 
merchandise trade deficit narrowed 33 percent in september the 
first improvement since june but the value of petroleum imports 
was at its highest level in nine years because of escalating costs 
due to the persian gulf crisis 
imports dropped 24 percent to 413 billion despite a huge 285 
percent jump in petroleum imports but exports also fell down 22 
percent to 318 billion the deficit is the difference between the 
two 
the improvement in the trade deficit as with the better 
inflation rate was probably due to the economic slowdown shaking 
consumer confidence and pushing down import buying analysts said 
in a separate report the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation plunged 21 
percent in october it was the largest decline since a 23 percent 
drop in april 1979 the average weekly wage before adjusting for 
inflation was 34985 
the weakness in the economy was reflected in the comments 20 top 
business executives made thursday and friday during white house 
meetings with the president 
there is a general feeling that we are either in a recession 
or very close said amoco chairman dick morrow following fridays 
session 
white house budget director richard darman who attended the 
meetings along with other top economic advisers said that the 
general consensus among the executives and the presidential 
advisers was that the country was in a downturn a word bush 
himself used during his cnn interview 
as to what to do about it that is the purpose of having these 
meetings darman said he said bush will probably not make any 
decisions on policy proposals until middecember at the earliest 
the 06 percent increase in consumer prices in october capped 
the worst threemonth bout of inflation since 1982 
since iraq invaded kuwait americans cost of living has risen 
at an annual rate of 89 percent nearly double the 46 percent 
inflation rate for all of last year 
fuel oil prices have shot up more than 50 percent in the last 
three months gasoline prices have soared nearly 27 percent 
however analysts expect that inflation without the outbreak 
of a shooting war in the persian gulf will return to more normal 
levels in coming months as oil prices stabilize 
if oil prices do not go up one can expect the inflation fire 
to basically be out by next spring sinai said 
a recession could keep the oil price shock from filtering 
through to the thousands of other energyrelated products such as 
chemicals plastics and air fare 
the economys just not growing if the economys not growing 
people cant pass on price increases if they want to maintain 
market share said peter radford an analyst with national 
westminster bancorp in new york 
so far this year inflation has risen 67 percent well above 
the 47 percent rate for the similar 10month period last year the 
government said 
in october food costs rose 04 percent double the 02 percent 
increase of september the government said a slight drop in fruit 
and vegetable prices was more than offset by larger increases for 
other grocery store products such as meats poultry and eggs 
clothing costs were down 02 percent as prices fell for mens 
womens and childrens apparel footwear prices were up 01 
percent 
medical care prices jumped 08 percent following similar sharp 
increases in august and september those prices are now 94 percent 
higher than they were a year ago 
new car prices rose 05 percent in october while housing costs 
were up 03 percent the report showed 
the various changes put the index for all consumer items at 
1335 in october that means a hypothetical selection of goods and 
services that cost 100 in the 198284 base period would have cost 
13350 last month up from 12560 a year earlier

american airlines battling with united airlines 
for global dominance announced friday that its sabre reservations 
system is linking up with europes largest network 
the combination with the amadeus system gives american a network 
with 126000 reservations terminals 40000 more than uniteds 
covia system and its european partner galileo 
sabre and amadeus announced in paris that they had reached a 
longterm agreement to combine technology and marketing to offer a 
joint product worldwide 
american is the worlds second largest airline in terms of 
revenue passenger miles and united is third according to the air 
transport association in washington the soviet airline aeroflot 
is no 1 
uniteds covia system already is a 256 percent shareholder in 
galileo a european system that is smaller but more advanced than 
amadeus 
madridbased amadeus gains access to sabres considerable 
computer system and marketing muscle which should help it compete 
with galileo 
amadeus so far has been the least effective system said 
david richardson an independent travel industry expert in oxford 
england 
sabre with 85000 terminals in travel agencies and airlines 
worldwide claims to be the worlds largest computerized 
reservation system 
as air travel becomes increasingly global reservation systems 
become more crucial to the success of airlines who want to sell 
their products as far afield as possible 
the systems provide wider faster and more efficient 
distribution not only of air tickets but hotel rooms and car 
rentals 
in the long term all the major airlines listings will be on 
all the major systems said richardson 
united and american last month fought over pan american world 
airways london routes which united won with a 400 million deal 
united also recently won a new route from chicago to tokyo but 
american already had acquired easterns south american routes last 
year united won pan ams pacific routes in 1985 
john hotard an american spokesman in fort worth texas said in 
a telephone interview that sabre is not buying a stake in amadeus 
and the two databases will remain separate the deal will last at 
least 20 years he said 
this is a marketing agreement which will give much more access 
to sabre in europe hotard 
madridbased amadeus was formed in 1987 by equal partners air 
france spains iberia airlines lufthansa german airlines and the 
scandinavian airlines system 
although it has 41000 terminals amadeus was hampered when its 
shareholders switched to a different computer system to get the 
capability they wanted 
galileo also founded in 1987 has 21000 terminals and is based 
in swindon england covia corp the 65000terminal system owned 
by united is one of 10 shareholders who include british airways 
swissair and klm royal dutch airways

the national the ninemonthold daily sports 
newspaper running into financial problems even as it tries to 
expand has laid off 18 editorial employees to cut costs a 
spokesman said friday 
the layoffs which amount to 65 percent of the companys total 
employmnet of about 275 offer the most concrete evidence to date 
of the privately held papers difficulties in establishing itself 
with readers and advertisers as the first national sports daily in 
the united states 
the newspaper has encountered a very difficult environment for 
advertising as companies appear cut back on spending as the economy 
weakens 
that poor advertising market has driven some magazines out of 
business and has prompted some media companies to close bureaus 
lay off reporters seek concessions from remaining employees and 
impose austerity measures 
spokesman stephen hammond said those being laid off at the 
national include mostly editorial support workers such as layout 
designers and copy editors at sites nationwide 
the national currently publishes nine metropolitan editions in 
cities spread from boston to san diego and plans to launch three 
more in philadelphia atlanta and baltimorewashington in the 
next three months 
but the paper has apparently been spending more than expected 
when it was launched last winter with editions in new york chicago 
and los angeles 
last week the newspaper announced it was suspending publication 
of its sunday issue after nov 25 because of low circulation and 
distribution difficulties it will continue to publish on weekdays 
monday throught friday 
also last week the president and publisher of the paper peter 
o price was stripped of daytoday responsibilities for the 
operation and three top executives the circulation director 
assistant publisher and the finance and administration director 
were fired 
the largest shareholder in the partnership that runs the paper 
the univisa unit of mexicos televisa entertainment and publishing 
company put one of its us executives jaime davila in charge of 
the nationals operations 
a week ago editor in chief frank deford told editorial staffers 
that a handful of jobs may have to be eliminated but that he hoped 
to do it through attrition rather than layoffs 
that is what we hoped but nobody left hammond said 
efforts to reach deford on friday were unsuccessful price and 
davila also were said to be unavailable to the media 
hammond was asked whether the layoffs which he said reduce the 
number of editorial staffers at the paper to about 210 complete 
the cutbacks 
i cant give you an honest answer on that he said 
john morton who follows newspaper companies for the brokerage 
lynch jones amp ryan in washington dc said this was bound to 
happen 
they are trying to create something we have not had before 
whenever you are inventing something new there will be unexpected 
events he said 
morton said the national has had trouble competing for readers 
with the sports sections of metropolitan dailies 
in addition it was launched during a media recession he 
said 
these are the worst conditions in the newspaper business in 20 
years that is very painful for a new newspaper that is trying to 
achieve a standing with readers and advertisers morton said 
he said the question of whether the national will survive much 
longer depends on how much its owners are prepared to lose 
at the time of the launch it was reported that emilia azcarrga 
the head of televisa was prepared to spend 100 million over five 
years to make the paper profitbale 
morton declined to give odds on the papers chances but said 
they were worse than when the paper was launched the newspaper 
environmnet has gotten worse and that is going to cause them to 
spend money faster he said

top us and european community 
officials failed friday to resolve differences over cutting 
subsidies for farmers putting world trade talks in jeopardy 
us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter estimated the chances 
of a successful conclusion of the talks at much less than 
5050following the meeting with officials of the 12nation 
european community 
yeutter secretary of state james a baker iii and trade 
representative carla hills met with members of the ec executive 
commission to try to close gaps in world trade talks 
many problems do remain and not much time remains said 
baker but i think it is fair to say all of us are committed to 
intense discussions at the highest level to resolve our 
differences 
these gaps have brought the uruguay round of talks a fouryear 
effort involving more than 100 nations to the brink of collapse 
two weeks before the negotiations are to be completed 
both sides said they were committed to successful completion of 
talks to liberalize world trade under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
but each side warned the talks could break down if the other did 
not change its positions especially on agriculture one of 15 
areas under negotiation in the global trade talks 
an ec offer to cut farm subsidies by 30 percent over 10 years 
beginning in 1986 is at odds with a proposal by the united states 
and other major farm exporting countries to cut subsidies by 75

the dollar declined broadly friday and settled 
at a new low against the german mark as the specter of lower us 
interest rates drove investors from the market 
gold prices were mixed on new yorks commodity exchange gold 
settled at 37890 a troy ounce down 20 cents from thursday 
republic national bank quoted a late bid for bullion at 379 up 25 
cents an ounce 
much of the days activity centered on the mark which has been 
rising on expectations that germanys bundesbank may be on the 
verge of hiking interest rates such a move would make german 
fixedincome securities more attractive to investors thereby 
enhancing their need for marks 
further hurting the dollar was the continuing expectation that 
the federal reserve is preparing to lower interest rates 
anticipation that the differential between us and german interest 
rates is about to widen worked against the dollar 
in new york the dollar settled at a postwar low of 14705 
german marks down from 14755 marks on thursday 
currency trading was active following a labor department report 
showing that consumer prices were up a steep 06 percent in 
october but once volatile food and energy prices were subtracted 
the socalled core inflation rate registered a moderate 03 
percent 
the market seized on the figure said john mccarthy chief 
dealer at amsterdam rotterdam bank here he said that because 
inflationary pressures seem to be stabilizing the fed has more 
room to maneuver interest rates downward 
around midday the fed announced it would injected reserves into 
the banking system by buying treasury bills with the promise of 
repurchasing them soon usually after the weekend 
it looks like a clear signal of fed easing said michael 
malpede a senior analyst at refco group inc in chicago the 
federal funds rate the rate charged on overnight loans between 
banks also shifted lower but several analysts said they wanted to 
track the rate over the course of a few days to determine whether 
it signified the easing the markets have been expecting 
the fed typically loosens credit to spur a flagging economy but 
the central bank has been inhibited by fear lowering interest rates 
might heat up inflation 
in tokyo the dollar rose to a closing 12973 japanese yen from 
12930 yen late thursday later in london it fell to 12945 yen

rupert murdochs news corp ltd is seeking a 600 
million bridge loan to help alleviate a shortterm liquidity 
squeeze brought on by tough market conditions bankers said friday 
murdoch and other senior news corp executives presented their 
proposals to creditors earlier this week in sydney and at a meeting 
thursday in london with british and european bankers 
australianbased news corp is trying to line up support for a 
new credit facility of 65 billion to replace much of its existing 
debt bankers said speaking on condition of anonymity 
several key institutions have given conditional support to the 
proposal the bankers said but added it was too soon to say 
whether news corps more than 100 lenders would accept the 
proposal in full or in part 
the shortterm financing would be used largely as a guaranteed 
line of credit until the media markets improve and the company can 
begin disposing of about 1 billion in assets they said 
news corp is currently saddled with 29 billion australian 
dollars or 22 billion in shortterm debt the bulk of which is 
coming due in july 
murdoch and other news corp executives told bankers that the 
rescheduling coupled with asset disposals and cost controls would 
better position the company to service its debts after 1991 when 
trading conditions are expected to improve the bankers said 
news corp on thursday reported a 31 percent drop in its fiscal 
first quarter operating profit after taxes largely due to costs 
associated with its european satellite television venture and 
exchange rate factors 
news corp confirmed murdoch discussed a proposal to 
reschedule bank debts through a new threeyear agreement 
it added that he also assured bankers the company would seek to 
reduce its debt load through disposals of noncore businesses 
over the period 
news corp declined to identify what operations would be put up 
for sale but bankers said news corps 50 percent stake in 
australian paper mills british coated paper manufacturer townsend 
hook and certain australian printing operations were mentioned in 
the talks 
some us operations were also mentioned bankers said 
including the daily racing form a newspaper dedicated to horse 
racing and delux labs an affiliate of twentieth century fox corp 
murdoch also assured bankers that news corp would seek to hold 
down operating costs by deferring major capital projects news 
corp said

oil fell below 30 a barrel on the futures 
market friday as perceptions that war in the persian gulf would be 
delayed dragged crude to its lowest level in weeks 
the whole thing looks like its getting further and further 
away said brian tagler a broker with shearson lehman brothers 
inc 
light sweet crude settled at 2978 per barrel down 134 
after falling as low as 2925 for december delivery contracts at 
the new york mercantile exchange contracts for crude delivery in 
later months all traded lower as did the rest of the energy 
futures traded on the exchange 
for the week december crude fell 411 a barrel 
crude for nextmonth delivery had last traded below 30 per 
barrel on oct 23 when oil hit as low as 2830 before settling at 
2937 
traders said the drop below 30 was having a psychological 
effect on the market just as oils rise above 40 had 
its a big number everybody looks at it tagler said 
the trading was partly technical as traders liquidated their 
positions on the december contracts which go off the board on 
monday 
otherwise they were looking mostly at the bearish implications 
of news coming in from the gulf 
the market was responding in part to an abctv interview with 
iraqi president saddam hussein who said he wanted peace in the 
middle east as well as reports that iraq had told iranian leaders 
that it had not ruled out the idea of withdrawing from occupied 
kuwait 
there have also been recent reports that the egyptians the 
soviets and some members of congress are urging president bush to 
avoid an immediate confrontation 
bushs planned trip to visit us troops in the gulf for 
thanksgiving which is observed next thursday has also led traders 
to doubt any military actions are imminent 
we may be seeing a grace period where nothing will happen 
said peter beutel an oil analyst with pegasus econometric group 
inc in hoboken nj 
other energy futures also fell sharply on friday 
home heating oil for december delivery dropped 225 cents to 
8442 cents a gallon with later delivery months all moving lower 
for the week heating oil fell 582 cents on december contracts 
unleaded gasoline futures fell for all delivery months with 
december contracts off 253 cents at 7763 cents per gallon for 
the week unleaded gasoline fell 1060 cents 
natural gas contracts fell 65 cents to 2335 per 1000 cubic 
feet for december delivery later months all moved down mostly by 
several cents 
for the week natural gas was off 84 cents per 1000 cubic

indiana business leaders fed up with poorly 
trained workers offered education remedies including granting 
parents the right to choose the schools their children attend 
if the business community in this state really believes that 
education has to get a lot better and believes that it has a 
vested interest in making sure that happens then the burden is on 
us to come forward with ideas with a plan to make it better 
said james k baker chairman of arvin industries in columbus ind 
executives from eli lilly amp co cummins engine co and other 
large firms said the state is threatening its own economic 
development by producing workers who cannot read write compute or 
communicate 
indiana high school graduation rates after peaking at just over 
80 percent in 1983 and 1984 have steadily worsened to about 75 
percent last year the state also ranked 19th among 22 states who 
make wide use of the scholastic aptitude test a college entrance 
examination 
baker who is also chairman of the us chamber of commerce 
presented the executives fourpoint state reform package at a 
gathering of business officials educators and public policymakers 
at the indiana convention center 
the plan proposed 
preparing children at an early age for the rigors of 
education 
tighter school standards so students are prepared for the work 
force 
freeing teachers from burdensome regulations 
allowing parents to send their children to the schools of 
their choice 
the proposals echoed a study last spring by the brookings 
institution advocating broad school choice as the key to better 
schools 
it also follows numerous studies suggesting us schools are 
failing to produce workers equipped to compete in a global 
marketplace 
the time has come to put the education spotlight on the child 
not the system baker said public education should mean tax 
dollars to educate children not to support school systems 
richard wood chairman of indianapolisbased lilly asked 
business officials to contribute to a lobbying effort to change the 
state school system state superintendent of public instruction h 
dean evans applauded the involvement of the business community 
adding it could provide a breakthrough for reforms including the 
controversial principle of school choice 
i see no problem whatsoever in injecting competitive spirit 
into the school environment he said

when the lawyers and accountants complete their 
tally total fraud claims against drexel burnham lambert inc are 
expected to approach the ridiculous sum of 30 billion 
the firm has only about a tenth of that amount in assets no one 
has yet proved the allegations of systematic fraud deception and 
other forms of cheating by drexel and its junk bond empire have any 
validity 
but in bankruptcy court as in budget proposals and turkish 
bazaars the idea is to exaggerate negotiate and hope the middle 
ground is a little higher than expected 
everyone is inflating their initial claims said john c 
coffee jr a securities law professor at columbia university 
people see this on the outside as a fight between drexel and 
these claimants its not its a fight among drexels creditors 
committees 
the battle involves entities that claim they were stiffed when 
drexel the wall street prima donna whose comeuppance was a 1989 
criminal securities fraud guilty plea filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy court protection in february 
legal experts said no group of creditors is likely to receive 
even half its claims but inflated requests can improve leverage 
during negotiations among creditors who ultimately must approve 
any reorganization plan 
while drexels resources are limited and the filing deadline for 
claims passed last week claimants plan to bring separate cases 
against other entities who actually have money 
the governments efforts are expected to focus on a drexelled 
network of individuals and savings and loan institutions that 
regulators charge manipulated the nations junk bond market in the 
1980s 
in their claim against drexel two federal thrift agencies are 
seeking 113 billion for allegations that rigged junk bond 
dealings helped topple 48 sampls the federal deposit insurance corp 
and resolution trust corp described a conspiracy among major 
thrift institutions that did business through drexel if the court 
supports the theory dozens of individuals and institutions named 
in the claim could face lawsuits from the government 
legal experts said likely targets are former drexel executives 
such as ceo frederick joseph and convicted junk bond financier 
michael milken drexels insurance companies stillfunctioning 
savings and loans indicted and unindicted thrift executives and 
companies swept up in drexels dealmaking 
those people are solvent coffee said they have deeper 
pockets michael milken has a few million or so sitting around 
claims can be brought against a lot of people in this alleged 
conspiracy he said 
the fdic said it is continuing an investigation of failed 
thrifts with ties to drexel which controlled about twothirds of 
the risky highyield debt securities that sampls bought with 
federally insured deposits 
entities outside the thrift industry someday also could be 
exposed sampl holdings were only a small percentage of the entire 
junk bond market about 15 billion of 200 billion in securities 
issued 
for now the government and other claimants want to recover 
money from drexel attorneys are negotiating to try to reach a 
settlement figure of all the litigation that would be passed onto a 
federal judge for approval 
the fdic and rtc are seeking 68 billion from 47 failed thrifts 
in connection with junk bond losses securities fraud and other 
alleged lawbreaking by drexel a separate claim for 45 billion 
was filed on behalf of columbia savings and loan association of 
beverly hills calif which has not been seized by the government 
but has huge junk bond losses 
another 93 billion is sought by investors shareholders and 
companies who allege they were defrauded in the deals to which 
drexel pleaded guilty add on at least 8 billion more from drexel 
and milkenrelated cases consolidated before a federal judge in new 
york other actions scattered nationwide seek 2 billion lawyers 
said all the claims reflect tripled damages under organized crime 
laws 
in a bankruptcy reorganization the legal claims would fall 
somewhere below those of secured creditors such as banks or 
financial firms who lent drexel money but the threat of such 
massive claims is that they will dilute the pie for everyone a 
reorganization plan will allot a percentage of drexels assets to 
creditors 
plaintiffs lawyers admit the claims are inflated but that is 
part of the bankruptcy game 
to get our proper percentage of drexels assets we have to 
assert our full claims against it said melvyn i weiss a new 
york lawyer whose firm filed the 93 billion claim alleging 18 
separate securities frauds and listing scores of defendants each 
of whom is individually liable 
thats what bankruptcy is all about dded david berger a 
philadelphia plaintiffs lawyer who also is suing drexel 
before any money is apportioned claimants have to persuade 
drexels lawyers and a bankruptcy court judge their allegations are 
substantial enough to merit a large settlement 
legal experts said the fdic and rtc will have to prove that 
thrifts bought junk bonds from drexel despite knowing they were a 
bad investment with the intent of manipulatively propping up prices 
and deceiving outside investors 
if no settlement is reached the judge may call a trial to 
resolve the claims to prevent a trial from delaying the bankruptcy 
reorganization the judge could set aside a portion of drexels 
estate as potential compensation depending on a verdict

nearly onethird of the workers at 
newly formed mgmpathe communications co have been handed pink 
slips since giancarlo parretti bought the mgmua studio two weeks 
ago 
as with any merger there was duplication in a number of areas 
that could not be maintained on any sound economic basis a 
pathemgm statement said friday 
the italian financiers pathe communications corp which 
operates movie theaters in europe and makes films paid 136 
billion for mgmua communications co 
spokesman craig parsons said nearly 300 of the companys 1000 
workers lost their jobs since the merger the cuts were completed 
by wednesday and no more are expected he said 
lowerlevel employees who agreed not to sue were paid through 
the end of the year plus a weeks notification pay and a week for 
every year with the company middle level managers got nine months 
pay top managers under contract were negotiating 
however haste and snarled communications angered and upset many 
workers including some at top levels 
one was a senior executive who was asked to take some names 
off the distribution list on a confidential report because they 
were no longer going to be with the company said one official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the guy looked at the list and his own name was on it he 
said 
parretti bought mgmua from kirk kerkorian a billionaire who 
made his fortune in the used airplane and casino businesses 
kerkorian sold many of the companys assets over the years 
including the studio buildings and most of the rights to the 
historic mgm film library new movie production has been dormant 
for the two years mgmua has been on the block 
one stillthriving mgmua business was its network television 
operation thirtysomething in the heat of the night the 
young riders a division that was spared the ax 
but parretti who has hired alan ladd jr as his filmmaking 
chief let go virtually all the remaining film production staff 
still unsettled was the future of richard berger mgmuas 
studio president he said hed been negotiating with parretti but 
had received offers to work elsewhere and would probably decide

federal reserve policymakers agreed in early 
october to ease interest rates if a federal budgetcutting 
agreement was reached and to permit further easing if economic 
conditions warranted records released friday showed 
four weeks after the oct 2 meeting of the federal open market 
committee the federal funds rate dropped to 775 percent from 8 
percent as the bush administration and congress agreed to a 
deficitreduction package 
no further easing occurred but the committee met again on 
tuesday and some economists predicted it had voted to again lower 
interest rates to stimulate an economy that many analysts contend 
has skidded into a recession 
until recently the fed has been reluctant to ease credit 
because of fears the country was on the verge of an inflationary 
spiral caused by the jump in oil prices after iraq invaded kuwait 
in fact three of the four committee members opposing the easing 
of rates that eventually occurred oct 29 dissented because they 
felt the committee risked losing sight of its fundamental 
objective of controlling and ultimately bringing down inflation 
however oilprice increases have not spread to other costs in 
fact the labor department reported on friday that the core rate of 
inflation the rate excluding food and energy rose only 03 
percent in october 
according to the committee meeting minutes released on friday 
fed governor martha seger dissented from the majority vote because 
she favored permitting lower interest rates immediately 
the other dissenters governor wayne d angel district bank 
presidents robert h boykin of dallas and w lee hoskins of 
cleveland opposed any easing 
the majority included fed chairman alan greenspan governors 
edward w kelley jr john p laware and david w mullins jr and 
presidents edward g boehne of philadelphia e gerald corrigan of 
new york and gary h stern of minneapolis there is one vacancy 
the federal funds rate which banks charge each other for 
overnight loans has been used for two years in combating 
inflation it had peaked at 975 percent in the spring of 1989 but 
the central bank has let it drop in quarterpoint increments since 
then to stimulate economic growth it had fallen to 8 percent last 
summer 
some analysts said they thought the fed might have voted on 
tuesday to cut the discount rate it charges commercial banks for 
loans that rate has stood at 7 percent for more than four years 
the committee is composed of the seven fed governors and five of 
the 12 presidents of fed regional banks it meets in secret eight 
times a year to formulate monetary policy minutes are released 
about six weeks later a few days after the next meeting

phone company stocks took a pounding friday 
after mci communications corp said its financial performance could 
falter due to steppedup competition from atampt the economic slump 
a costcutting program and a recent acquisition 
the decline was accelerated by a number of wall street stock 
analysts who lowered their earnings forecasts for the nations no 
2 longdistance phone company they also cut their forecasts for 
the parent of no 3 us sprint 
mci stock lost more than a quarter of its value plunging 737 
to close at 2262 in national overthecounter trading mci is a 
mainstay of the overthecounter market as one of nasdaqs most 
widely followed and actively traded stocks 
though the news appeared to favor american telephone amp telegraph 
co the stock price of the dominant longdistance company also 
suffered falling 112 to close at 32 atampt was the most active 
issue on the new york stock exchange with more than 37 million 
shares changing hands 
the concern is that if mci is hurting they might have to get 
more aggressive with pricing and the whole industry could be 
affected said joe bellace a merrill lynch amp co analyst 
atampt took the unusual step of releasing a statement about its 
stock activity atampt is the nations most widely held stock 
todays decline in atampts stock price apparently is a result 
of concern among investors about the telecommunications industry 
the fundamentals of atampts business are sound our thirdquarter 
longdistance volumes were strong and current volume and revenue 
trends are consistent with those results the company said 
share prices of united telecommunications inc the majority 
owner of sprint and of gte corp which owns the remaining 199 
percent of sprint also fell united telecom dropped 287 to 
close at 2250 while gte slipped 62 cents to 2762 
mci disclosed its costcutting plan the after the stock markets 
closed thursday it said it may lay off up to 1500 employees in a 
restructuring prompted by the sluggish economy and a more 
competitive longdistance phone market 
the washingtonbased company also cited the cost of its recent 
125 billion acquisition of longdistance carrier telecom usa 
mci president bert c roberts jr said these factors are 
negative constraints on the companys financial performance for the 
next several quarters 
merrill lynchs bellace said mci officials painted an even 
bleaker picture in a conversation with him 
increased competetion from atampt is resulting in lower customer 
retention rates he said this is the first time we have a high 
risk that mcis market share penetration may slow 
analysts said atampt has become more aggressive in fighting to 
retain its existing customers and to win back customers who 
defected to mci and sprint 
gregory sawers of the investment firm sanford c bernstein amp co 
traced atampts stronger marketing moves to a decision by the federal 
communications commission about a year ago that gives the phone 
giant more latitude in cutting rates 
atampt is getting its competitive act together at a rate far 
faster than anyone expected he said 
in recent months the company redeployed 5000 employees to its 
marketing force boosted its advertising budget substantially and 
started mentioning mci by name in its ads he said 
investors are fearful were going to go through a period when 
these guys beat on each others heads with clubs ultimately 
thats not how this will work some type of implicit understanding 
between the three carriers will emerge sawers predicted 
he added that atampt in the end does not expect to lose 
endless amounts of market share

the new york mercantile exchange the oil market 
that has come under criticism as a forum for speculation on war 
fears is sponsoring a holiday party for families of soldiers in 
the persian gulf 
the rock star tiffany will ppear at the dec 2 event set up at 
manhattans roseland ballroom by uso of metropolitan new york with 
money from the mercantile exchange organizers said friday 
the members of this exchange have been deeply concerned about 
the families of these servicemen and women during the holiday 
season said z lou guttman chairman of the futures market 
for many of them it is the first time they have not been able 
to celebrate the holiday together as a family unit this is one 
small way of expressing our gratitude for the selfless sacrifice 
and bravery they are demonstrating 
the mercantile exchange and uso said they expected about 1000 
relatives of soldiers from new york new jersey and connecticut to 
attend the party which they said will feature carnival games face 
painting magicians teenage mutant ninja turtles bart simpson 
and clowns 
the mercantile exchange wanted to do something for the 
families over there and also get some good press over it uso 
spokesman michael gray said friday 
an exchange spokeswoman said the boards decision to host the 
party had nothing to do with recent controversies over oil prices 
this has to do with the fact that the exchange wants to help 
the families said the spokeswoman who under exchange policy 
cannot be identified by name 
the exchange said it has profited from the oil crisis though 
not as much as some successful oil traders 
weve had increased volume said the exchange spokeswoman 
its like a dollarsomething we make on each trade its not like 
major major income youre not putting us in a category with a 
successful trader 
during august the month that iraq invaded kuwait the exchange 
brought in more than 44000 extra each day when numbers are 
compared with the yearly average according to figures provided by 
the exchange 
by october when activity had tapered off the exchanges 
increased volume was resulting in more than 8000 a day in 
increased money for the market according to those same figures 
the exchange is spending 92500 on the event according to a 
source who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
among the invited guests are politicians from the tristate 
area including sen joseph i lieberman dconn who held a 
hearing into the trading on the exchange and characterized its 
participants speculator sharks 
liebermans spokesman jim kennedy said friday that the senator 
might attend the exchangesponsored party because many of his 
constituents would be there and he hoped it would be a success 
liebermans earlier remarks were targeted more to the activity 
on the exchange rather than the entity of the new york mercantile 
exchannge itself kennedy said

northwest airlines chairman alfred 
checchi is exploring a buyout of eastern airlines using up to 150 
million in pension funds of easterns union pilots according to a 
report friday 
the saint paul pioneer press reported that officials of the 
eastern air line pilots association have said union leaders are 
agreeable to a northwest acquisition the officials also said their 
leaders are willing to pitch the idea of lending checchi the 
pension funds the paper reported 
a spokesman for northwest based in eagan said only that 
dealings involving eastern are a private matter 
easterns courtappointed trustee martin r shugrue jr 
succeeded wednesday in getting a 15 million cash infusion from a 
bankruptcy judge in new york shugrue said the next day he would be 
happy to talk to anyone interested in eastern 
a northwest buyout of eastern is viewed as a long shot prospect 
by some analysts creditors are pressing a bankruptcy judge to have 
eastern liquidated and such a buyout would take time to put 
together 
they have to act awful quick said paul karos airline 
analyst for first boston corp in new york 
checchi has long been interested in acquiring selected eastern 
assets but he has had little success in winning creditors 
attention a series of bids he submitted earlier this year included 
an offer to liquidate eastern but little cash 
the pioneer press quoted an unidentified source who is familiar 
with recent talks between checchi and the eastern pilots as saying 
both sides are exploring the idea 
the eastern pilots are dead serious the source said 
checchi is likewise viewing the idea seriously the source said 
union leaders said that for checchi to borrow money he would 
have to agree to buy the entire airline and hire the union pilots 
to fly easterns jets union spokesman ej breen said members 
would have to agree to the loan and it is not clear whether they 
favor it 
another union official ernest dodson said leaders would also 
insist on preferred stock in northwest status as a secured 
creditor or other assurances that their investment is worthwhile 
and safe 
precisely how much money could be raised also is unclear union 
officials acknowledged that the funds could total as much as 200 
million but even if many pilots agree to allow their pension funds 
to be used for the loan the total amount available could be 
reduced sharply by pilots who choose not to participate

bond prices rose sharply friday amid intense 
speculation among traders that the federal reserve has moved to 
lower interest rates 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond jumped 1316 point or 
813 per 1000 in face amount its yield which falls when prices 
rise was down to 845 percent from 853 percent late friday 
traders said they viewed a drop friday in the federal funds rate 
as a clear indication that the fed has moved to relax credit 
policy the federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other 
on overnight loans and is closely watched to determine a change in 
monetary policy 
the rate late friday was 7 916 percent down from 8 percent 
late thursday 
a lowering of interest rates is viewed by credit market 
participants as a positive development because it generally 
increases the value of bonds 
i think its finally getting down there todays operation 
more clearly indicates they have eased said carol a stone 
senior economist at nomura securities international inc 
stone and others said the final test of whether the fed has 
moved to ease interest rates will be if the federal funds rate 
remains around the 7 percent level after this weekend the feds 
target had been 7 percent 
the timing of the easing is important it puts additional 
pressure on banks to reduce their prime lending rate during the 
crucial holiday shopping season said steven r ricchiuto chief 
economist at barclays de zoete wedd securities inc 
traders said release early in the day of the governments 
monthly measure of consumer prices which showed a relatively low 
inflation rate for prices of key retail goods provided the fed 
with impetus to lower rates 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy components the 
socalled core rate were up a more moderate 03 percent in 
october the same as in september but under the 05 percent rise in 
august the government said 
the report of only moderate inflation was another factor giving 
the credit markets a lift because inflation generally erodes the 
value of bonds 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds shortterm 
maturities rose 116 point to 532 point intermediate maturities 
were up 316 point to 1732 point and longterm issues rose 2132 
point to point according to the telerate inc financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 393 to 117263 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 730 percent as the 
discount fell 1 basis point to 708 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills fell to 737 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to 
702 percent yields on oneyear bills were down to 726 percent as 
the discount fell 7 basis points to 680 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose point to 91 1132 the average yield 
to maturity was down to 748 percent from 752 percent late

threed graphics blaring dance music and 
mtvlike images lured conventiongoers at the comdex computer show 
this week as nearly every major computer maker promoted 
multimedia the marriage of computing graphics and 
television 
but some industrywatchers say the hype may be premature since 
the multimedia market is small and has yet to find its bearings 
that didnt stop ibm from driving home the point that it is 
serious about multimedia a breakfast gathering sponsored by the 
worlds largest computer company for several hundred computer 
dealers and other industry insiders was a multimedia show in 
itself 
as the lights dimmed in the basketball stadium where the group 
assembled smoke filled the air and a green laser streaked across 
the ceiling then from the stadiums balcony an inflated ibm 
spaceship the size of a small car floated across the ceiling 
and hovered above a stage 
the ship sent down a transporter signal modeled after tvs 
star trek and an ibm executive appeared in the mist to the 
sound of eerie music meanwhile outerspace scenes flashed on 
giant screens 
ibm later demonstrated a more practical use for multimedia with 
a computer program that spiced up a high school english lesson on 
the poem ulysses 
on a computer screen it depicted the text of the poem along with 
a window featuring pictures of several actors when an 
onscreen arrow was moved to one of the photos a video clip of the 
actor reading the poem appeared in another window 
the program also featured video clips of critics discussing the 
poem and its historical background 
mike braun ibms vice president for multimedia called the 
technology the next wave of the computer revolution 
its technology that will push the computer into our everyday 
lives he said 
ibm demonstrated another use of multimedia a program that 
electronically ages a persons photograph on the computer 
screen for this demonstration it used a photo of bill gates the 
35yearold chairman of software giant microsoft corp who 
happened to be in the audience 
ibm said the program is designed for lawenforcement authorities 
to simulate the aging of a suspect or a missing child 
at a comdex panel discussion on multimedia industry officials 
listed a number of current and future uses for the technology 
including corporate training programs pointofsale merchandise 
displays education programs and entertainment 
some people learn better visually said nick arnett editor 
of an industry newsletter on multimedia 
the panelists showed videotapes depicting several uses of 
multimedia in one used by volvo dealers a customer can see 
combinations of colors and wheel covers on a car depicted on a 
computer screen 
in a program for interior designers the color scheme of a room 
can be altered on a screen the furniture moved around and even the 
effects of various types of lighting can be depicted 
a third demonstration showed how a magazine could be represented 
in multimedia the magazines pages could be turned on screen 
the articles could be read by a narrator and photographs and 
graphics could be enlarged or rotated this electronic magazine 
also could highlight key words and provide an outline of the 
articles 
what were allowing the reader to do is get into that 
magazine said john colligan president of authorware a maker of 
multimedia software 
but despite multimedias promise even those involved in it 
admit the market has yet to find its place or to earn much money 
right now its a lot of effort but not much return said 
william nisen president of owl international another company 
developing multimedia software 
a key to multimedias popularity could be the development of 
longpromised highdefinition television nisen said that would 
allow vastly sharper images and compactdiscquality sound on tv 
sets 
if those future tvs also are based on digital technology rather 
than todays analog multimedia would get a further boost because a 
digital tv essentially would be a computer said richard shaffer 
editor of technologic computer letter an industry newsletter 
in a telephone interview shaffer said computer companies are 
being driven toward multimedia by the fear that as computer 
technology becomes cheaper they could lose the emerging home 
computer market to consumer electronics companies 
with multimedia computer makers hope to stake their claim in 
any home entertainment and information market that will be based on 
multimedia he said 
the potential for an entertainment medium is enormous he 
said

casino executives and politicians are 
touting atlantic city as a good place to do business in spite of 
the financial troubles facing donald trump and the resorts dozen 
casinos 
they also said trumps bartering on an overdue 47 million bond 
payment underscores the overdependence on junk bonds 
highinterest paying notes in a weak economy that witnessed the 
collapse of the 1980s junk bond market 
i think atlantic city is a good place to invest in right 
now said state sen william gormley nobody said it was going 
to happen overnight it does take decades 
if what had happened were isolated to atlantic city you would 
have to rethink where we are going said mayor jim whelan this 
is a problem that is national and international 
whelan said the city would recover when the economy improves and 
that in preparation it must repair its tattered image but any 
indication of an economic upturn seems a long way off 
atlantic city has 12 casinos and no new gambling halls are in 
the planning 
the last one to open the trump taj mahal on april 2 reached 
an agreement friday to restructure the 675 million in notes on 
which an interest payment was due thursday 
trumps deal with investors of the mammoth casino will briefly 
put it under bankruptcycourt protection and give them a 50 percent 
stake the deal also allows trump to remain as chairman 
the concept of junkbond financing included the knowledge that 
junk bond financing was always present said ed tracy director 
of trumps three atlantic city casinos and one noncasino hotel 
unfortunately today that isnt true you cant boil it down 
and say the taj mahal was a huge mistake 
it can weather a bad economy for a long period of time said 
tracy who said the upcoming year would prove difficult for each of 
the citys 12 casinos 
the industry which according to state figures is saddled with 
more than 3 billion in debt is working to repay it at a time when 
the casinos have posted flat numbers all year the poor showing is 
partly due to a declining economy and gamblers weariness with the 
resort analysts say 
but several casino officials said the city would rise above its 
troubled present and enjoy a prosperous future 
thomas carver president of the casino association of new 
jersey said the industry and city are experiencing tough times 
but would survive he reiterated his belief that an expanded 
airport would broaden the citys base 
since taking office in january gov jim florio and his staff 
have promised to help strengthen the casinos florio has said he is 
committed to upgrading atlantic city international airport to bring 
more air passengers to the resort 
we can accomplish so much were in our embryonic stage 
carver said twelve years is not a long period of time
