dealing with persistent political banditry they scattered my work

q how come 
q civilian aircraft to be outside of its normal air 
corridors in that part of the world 
a i dont know that i can answer that question it seems to me 
that two things are pretty clear first of all flying in that kind 
of constrained environment that you would be very careful 
particularly given the warnings and the notams we had issued and 
secondly i dont understand the responsibilty of a country that 
while it is attacking other ships making a war zone out of a 
certain area of the ocean and then goes ahead and flies a 
commercial airliner over that part of the ocean at the time that 
attacks and hostilities are under way 
q was there anything else unusual in terms of speed or altitude 
of this aircraft other than it did not respond and that hey were 
out of their normal flight corridors 
a as i said at the conclusion of my statement not all the data 
is in but we do have indications that the people on the ship were 
led to believe from the flow of information and we are 
reconstructing this now that the aircraft was not only on steady 
bearing and closing but that it had gone up in altitude and was 
increasing or decreasing in altitude as it neared the ship 
q what was the altitude 
a at what point 
q the point at which the attack was commenced 
a well it was somewhere between 9000 and i think the 
missile was at about 7000 feet somewhere in 
q inaudible thousand feet is the attack 
a again im qualifying this because were having to 
reconstruct and draw out all that data from the aegis system 
q did you say that the speed 
a its not easy to do 
q the speed of the aircraft was 450 knots is the attack 
speed of the f14 not somewhat higher than that 
a it could be the f14 there were indications that as he got 
closer his speed was increasing but not dramatically just 
increasing 
q are there any indications that the iranians are now heading 
up to take some further action or some response in addition in 
response to this 
a there was an attack this afternoon after this mornings 
incident on a i believe it was a norwegian norwegian ship 
further south not in the vicinity of this event 
q were there any awacs either saudia arabian or did we have 
awacs off our carrier in the indian ocean supporting the 
a no there was not no there was no air cover there was no 
either an e2 or an awacs in the vicinity 
q why was that 
a because we were not escorting an earnest will mission these 
ships were returning from a convoy coming through by themselves 
through the strait and we just dont use our cover for that 
q heightened state of alert since they permanently 
deployed the silk worms anticipated fourth of july attack 
a but we were anticipating units that wouldnt require that in 
any event there was not 
q admiral what did we do to find survivors and what is it 
doing to search for the black box 
a the wreckage if in fact there is wreckage is inside of 
iranian territorial waters they are conducting a sar search in 
there we are not in there weve gone pretty close to try and 
follow events what they are doing but no we are not in the 
vicinity of the wreckage 
q how far out of the corridor 
q f14s operating out of bandar abbas they operated 
tandem with the f4s can you tell us whether there were any other 
iranian aircraft of any description in the area 
a there was an f4 up later whether it had been up all the 
time or earlier were not able to determine 
q was there a way to avoid these 
q how much later 
a well a few minutes i dont know exactly but it did not 
come out it didnt go feet wet and it didnt play a part in 
this 
q have you determined what precipitated the first attack 
a this is sort of a simplistic chart were trying to keep it 
simple the incident this morning when it all started was in this 
are this is the vincennes their helicopter was fired on in 
this vicinity and about in that same area in this direction 
somewhere the aircraft was impacted about here the iranians 
are reporting the wreckage in this vicinity and that is 
southwest or rather southeast of qishum island and were still 
in the vicinity there trying to follow those events the this is 
the commercial air route and the attack this afternoon was in 
this area

donald and ivana trump proud new owners of an 
opulent yacht gave the press a preparty peek at their nearly 
300foot jewel of the sea 
this is the ultimate in boats and i feel strongly that this 
country should have it trump said with fourth of july spirit 
monday 
the trump princess with its six decks 210 telephones and crew 
of 31 is the jewel of the sea he said 
the original owner saudi arms dealer adnan khashoggi got into 
financial trouble and borrowed a lot of money from the sultan of 
brunei with the yacht as collateral when khashoggi defaulted the 
sultan decided to sell it 
trump who picked up the ship at the fire sale price of 30 
million also saved money by registering it outside the united 
states under a flag of convenience 
a bahamian flag flies from the stern but trump noted that the 
american flag is right on top 
but the stars and stripes was a notch below the trump insignia 
on the mast 
as liveried servants made preparations for the trumps inaugural 
party a fourth of july bash for 100 close friends photographers 
snapped pictures of the luxurious fittings 
everything that looks like gold is gold said yacht manager 
jonathan beckett everything that looks like suede is suede 
heavyset guards distinguished by their black suits trump 
insignia lapel pins and walkie talkies made sure reporters and 
photographers didnt sit on the silk featherstuffed couches or 
lean on the creamy leather bar rails or set equipment on the 
gleaming marble tabletops one reporter was ejected for lighting a 
cigarette 
the trumps said they bought the boat sight unseen for fun 
its different from a building trump said were getting 
tired of buildings he said they would use the yacht for 
business pleasure and charity fund raisers 
were going to have a lot of fun with it mrs trump said 
were going to watch the fireworks and celebrate the fourth of 
july its what america is all about 
you can get used to it she said her eyes sweeping the onyx 
vases stuffed with lilies and orchids 
apparently the lavish yacht refitted for 10 million does take 
some getting used to 
beckett said the first night he spent aboard as he brushed his 
teeth i looked down into that goldplated basin and thought i 
cant possibly spit in that but that was two years ago you learn 
to live with it 
for nearly an hour the trumps obliged the press giving tours 
and answering questions 
what does this tell you mrs trump was asked 
dreams can come true she said 
her husband disagreed it really tells her you have to have a 
smart husband trump said

as a reminder that the call to holiness is universal and does not 
know the boundaries of nation political system culture or race

indians when she founded the sugar creek mission among the 
potawatomi tribe in kansas 
after only a year illness and old age forced her back to the 
convent in st charles mo where she died in 1852 but in the

its energy to work among the underprivileged 
speaking to the 20000 pilgrims gathered in the basilica for the 
canonization the pope recalled philippine duchesnes radical 
commitment to the poor and said it should be a living 
inspiration to the society and to all religious of today

a soviet diplomat denounced as 
inhumane east germanys policy of having border guards shoot to 
kill people who try to flee to the west a radio station reported 
it appeared to be the first time a soviet official has publicly 
criticized communist east germany for its longstanding policy of 
shooting anyone trying to escape to west germany 
yuri akvilyanov second secretary at the soviet embassy in bonn 
said nations have every right to protect their borders west german 
radio reported on sunday 
but as far as these shootings go in these times that seems 
inhumane the radio quoted him as saying 
i dont believe what occurs on the germangerman border is a 
result of orders from moscow he reportedly said 
he also said the situation on the germangerman border must 
become much safer if relations between the two states are to 
improve the radio reported 
akvilyanov made the remarks saturday night in an address to west 
german university students in bonn the radio said 
there have been no reports of east germans being killed in 
attempts to escape to the west this year 
but in berlin alone according to west berlin police 59 people 
have been shot to death trying to escape over the berlin wall since 
the communists erected it in 1961 and effectively slowed the flood 
of refugees to the west 
east german border guards reportedly fired at a 31yearold man 
who climbed the berlin wall on april 19 but he escaped to west 
berlin unharmed the west german government condemned the incident

cardinal jeanmarie lustiger said mass in latin at 
notre dame cathedral on sunday and appealed to traditionalist 
followers of rebel archbishop marcel lefebvre to stay loyal to the 
roman catholic church 
lustiger the roman catholic archbishop of paris performed the 
traditional mass as part of an effort to persuade lefebvres 
followers not to join the renegade archbishop in breaking with the 
vatican 
on thursday in econe switzerland lefebvre consecrated four 
bishops in defiance of pope john paul ii and was excommunicated 
lefebvre contends the vatican has broken with true catholicism 
by adopting mass in languages other than latin and in taking other 
modernist steps since the 1960s 
lustiger announced thursday that mass would be said in latin in 
three churches in paris each sunday as part of an effort to woo 
followers of the frenchborn lefebvre who has many supporters here 
in his sermon delivered in french before thousands of tourists 
and worshippers in notre dame the famous gothic cathedral in 
central paris lustiger called on the faithful to remain in the 
sole house of god 
one cannot pretend to belong to the catholic church while 
cutting oneself off from the college of apostles lustiger said 
follow the word of love of god which is within you he said 
you should stay within the catholic house 
at the church of st nicolas du chardonnet nearby in the latin 
quarter occupied illegally by traditionalist followers of lefebvre 
since 1977 there was no indication that lustigers appeal would be 
wellreceived 
outside the church sunday hundreds of traditionalists crowded 
around a stand where photographs of lefebvre consecrating the four 
bishops were selling for 8 each the french news agency agence 
francepresse reported 
in truth there has been neither excommunication nor 
schism the agency quoted one unidentified worshipper at st 
nicolas du chardonnet as saying sunday all that is 
disinformation by journalists

i am saddened to report that it appears that in a proper 
defensive action by the uss vincennes this morning in the persian 
gulf an iranian airliner was shot down over the straight of hormuz 
this is a terrible human tragedy 
our sympathy and condolences go out to the passengers crew and 
their families 
we deeply regret any loss of life 
the course of the iranian civiliian airliner was such that it 
was headed directly for the uss vincennes which was at the time 
engaged with five iranian boghammer boats that had attacked our 
forces 
when the aircraft failed to heed repeated warnings the 
vincennes followed standing orders and widely publicized 
procedures firing to protect itself against possible attack 
the only us interest in the persian gulf is peace and this 
tragedy reinforces the need to achieve that goal with all possible 
speed

secretary of state george shultz crosses the 
pacific this week to visit nine capitals and hold major policy 
talks including discussion of security at the seoul olympics 
shultz also is likely to be dogged by questions about sundays 
us missile attack on an unarmed iranian passenger jet which 
immediately provoked comparisons to the soviet downing of korean 
air lines flight 007 in 1983 
already on shultz agenda before sundays incident were issues 
including the olympics cambodias future american military bases 
in the philippines chinese missile exports us trade deficits 
with newly prosperous pacific nations boat people refugees 
from vietnam and other problems lingering from the indochina war 
shultz also expects to brief asian officials on the moscow 
superpower summit and the wests economic summit at toronto last 
month 
shultzs twoweek journey is scheduled to begin tuesday and will 
be his longest to east asia as secretary of state meetings begin 
thursday in bangkok thailand with a threeday pacific rim 
ministerial summit of asean the association of asian nations also 
attending will be foreign ministers of their major trading partners 
including japan australia new zealand canada australia and the 
european common market 
the secretary is scheduled to continue on to malaysia 
indonesia the philippines hong kong china south korea japan 
and the new marshall islands republic 
talks on the future of cambodia could dominate shultzs bangkok 
and beijing stops 
we are in an evolving situation said a senior us official 
who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity people on all 
sides seem to want a political solution the soviets vietnam 
asean prince sihanouk ourselves 
in bangkok shultz is expected to meet cambodian prince norodom 
sihanouk who is supported by asean and should emerge as head of 
state of an independent cambodia said the us official 
recent announcements of a partial end of the 10year vietnamese 
occupation of cambodia have focused us and asean attention on 
whether cambodia could be taken over again by the khmer rouge 
blamed for the deaths of millions of cambodians 
the united states has been emphasizing that a cambodian 
settlement must include not only a complete vietnamese pullout but 
also guarantees against return of the khmer rouge 
us relations with china are basically pretty good the 
official said but shultz will stress to the chinese main 
supporters of the khmer rouge that return of the cambodian group 
is unacceptable 
the state department has declined to comment on a published 
report that the chinese have offered asylum to khmer rouge leader 
pol pot to remove him from cambodia while confirming that beijing 
has indicated support for nonkhmer rouge rule in cambodia 
shultz also will again voice us concern about a reported flow 
of chinese missiles to hot spots in the middle east and persian 
gulf war the us source said such weapons threaten stability in 
various parts of the world and we will make it very plain this is 
something all countries have to be worried about including 
china he said 
in addition to discussing prospects for successful and 
troublefree olympic summer games in seoul shultz expects to make 
a major speech there july 18 on expanding democracy and human 
rights in south korea 
us use of philippine military bases will probably be aired 
with other asean countries interested in the us presence in 
southeast asia as well as the philippines the us official said 
also to be discussed in manila are plans for multilateral aid to 
president corazon aquinos government 
in bangkok shultz will urge asean countries against cutting 
back on providing vietnamese refugees first asylum pending 
arrangements to transfer them elsewhere the us official said 
the united states on its part will continue doing what it can to 
help an increasing flow of boat people including absorbing 
as many as we can into our country he said 
the united states took in 32000 indochinese refugees last year 
and hopes to take 29500 this year he said

the uss vincennes which mistakenly shot down 
an iranian civilian jetliner is stuffed full of electronic 
wizardry that one admiral once called star wars at sea 
but the pentagon says even with such sophisticated gear it is 
difficult for the ships crew to identify approaching aircraft 
especially a headon target from the radar blip 
it has not solved all of our problems and it does not defy the 
laws of physics adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff said sunday of the aegis system of radars computers and 
weapons carried by the cruiser 
the pentagon has called aegis the most capable 
surfacelaunched missile systems the navy has ever put to sea 
the system was designed to protect a naval task force of about 
10 vessels from the increasing threat posed by the type of 
antiship missiles which have already taken a heavy toll in the 
persian gulf 
the aegis system uses phased array radar to simultaneously 
track scores of planes and targets at ranges up to 2000 miles and 
destroy them up to 300 miles away it can launch track and target 
up to 80 of the surfacetoair missiles it carries 
phased array radar emits a constant stream of radio signals and 
uses computers to assemble a comprehensive and constant picture 
from the electronic echo unlike earlier radars which rotated and 
showed periodic blips that were much harder to track and analyze 
aboard the vincennes officers watch banks of video and computer 
displays of the naval battlefield and can fire harpoon and 
standard antiship and antiair missiles heavier tomahawk cruise 
missiles two 5inch guns and two phalanx closein rapidfire 
guns for use against antiship missiles 
crowe who briefed reporters after sundays shooting down of an 
iran air jetliner said the crew had about four minutes from the 
time they picked up this target until it was declared hostile 
with the aircraft approaching at 450 knots he said time 
presented a severe constraint in making an identification 
one of the most difficult problems is from a radar blip 
particularly from a headon target to identify the type of 
aircraft crowe said 
the cruiser is equipped with gear to intercept and interpret 
electronic emissions such as radar or radio identify the aircraft 
or ships most likely to emit such signals correlate that with data 
from its own radar and determine the likely identify of a target 
crowe told reporters that there were electronic indications on 
vincennes that led it to believe that the aircraft was an f14 a 
usmade fighter that is the most lethal aircraft iran owns 
crowe cited only electronic information which is classified 
and i am not willing to discuss but the indicators could have 
included radio signals to or from the plane or nearby ground 
stations or emissions from the aircraft 
us warplanes and many commercial aircraft travelling in war 
zones send out signals to prevent mistaken identity 
most aircraft also monitor standard military or civilian radio 
frequencies the vincennes said crowe warned the iranian airplane 
on the civilian air distress network three times in these few 
minutes and four times on the military air distress net 
we received no answers nor did he vary course nor did he 
indicate in his conduct that he had received our communications 
said crowe 
following the attack by an iraqi fighter against the uss stark 
in the gulf last year said crowe the navy adopted more aggressive 
defensive tactics and last september issued a notice to airmen 
notam which advised all aircraft in the persian gulf region that 
us navy ships were taking additional precautions and of the need 
to identify themselves and to state intentions 
additionally they were advised that failure to respond to 
requests for identification or warnings and operating in a 
threatening manner could place the aircraft at risk by us 
defensive measures crowe told reporters 
an independent observer capt richard sharpe editor of janes 
fighting ships said it is absolutely inevitable that mistakes in 
classification are always going to be made 
if you remember the captain of the stark in exactly the 
reciprocal case was criticized heavily for failing to take 
appropriate action early enough said sharpe in a telephone 
interview from his home in kingsley england well now here you 
have a commanding officer who clearly has taken early action and 
will of course be criticized probably even more fiercely than was 
the captain of the stark 
the commander of us forces in the persian gulf marine corps 
gen george b crist told reporters last week he had stationed the 
vincennes at the mouth of the gulf to protect merchant shipping 
against a battery of irans antiship silkworm missiles no 
silkworms were involved in the fighting on sunday 
the vincennes has a speed in excess of 30 knots is 563 feet 
long displaces 9600 tons fully loaded and can carry two 
helicopters for reconnaissance

discovery moved into the glare of 
spotlights early monday on its longawaited trip to the launch pad 
and a giant step toward americas first space shuttle flight since 
the challenger tragedy 
a flagwaving fourth of july crowd of several hundred space 
workers cheered as the 85ton spaceship edged out of an assembly 
building at 1250 am riding upright on the broad back of a giant 
tracked transporter called a crawler 
the 42mile journey to launch pad 39b was scheduled to take six 
to seven hours attached to discovery were a 154foottall external 
fuel tank and the two 149foot solid fuel booster rockets that will 
hurl the craft into space on a flight scheduled for early september 
as the rollout began kennedy space center director forrest s 
mccartney presented astronaut dave hilmers one of discoverys five 
assigned crew members with an autograph book containing the names 
of 15240 engineers technicians managers secretaries clerical 
workers and other center employees who have labored to return the 
shuttle fleet to flight 
the astronauts will carry the book into orbit with them 
mccartney hilmers and other nasa officials watched the rollout 
from a flagbedecked grandstand outside the assembly building 
the early morning move was planned to avoid thunderstorms and 
lighting which are common during the day this time of the year 
center officials originally said all five of discoverys 
astronauts and nasa administrator james c fletcher would be here 
for the rollout but four of the crew members elected to spend the 
holiday weekend with their families in houston and fletchers 
office said friday he couldnt make it 
the failure of a seal in a booster rocket joint doomed 
challenger 73 seconds after it lifted off on jan 28 1986 all 
seven crew members perished in the massive explosion 
since then the booster has been significantly redesigned and 
tested and hundreds of other modifications have been made to the 
shuttle main engines and other systems 
once at the pad discovery will be readied for a critical july 
24 test of modifications to the three main liquidfuel engines 
with the spaceship bolted firmly to its launch mounts the power 
plant will be ignited for 194 seconds at the end of a practice 
countdown 
the following day one final preflight testfiring of a 
redesigned booster rocket is planned at the morton thiokol plant in 
utah both tests must be passed before discovery is certified for 
flight 
on sunday a test of an intentionally damaged version of the 
shuttle rockets redesigned joint was apparently successful morton 
thiokol said the test was conducted at a plant near brigham city 
utah 
it appears no gas leaked outside the joint in spite of the 
very severe intentional flaws said thiokol spokesman rocky raab 
that has really raised our confidence for the fullscale test 
at the end of the month 
the 1 pm mdt test was performed on a simulator that uses three 
shortened rocket cases two joints and 385 pounds of propellant to 
mimic pressures present during when a fullscale rocket motor is 
fired 
last week nasa announced that it had changed the liftoff date 
from late august to early september because it was taking longer 
than expected to prepare discovery for flight 
hilmers and four other veteran shuttle pilots will be at the 
controls when discovery blasts off to mark what nasa is counting on 
to revive americas manned space program the others are commander 
rick hauck dick covey mike lounge and george nelson 
during their fourday mission the astronauts will deploy a 
communications satellite conduct scientific and technical 
experiments and check out changes made to the orbiter systems

an unappreciative listener once doused him 
with cold water al capone bought him drinks and people played his 
records on jukeboxes coast to coast 
glenn howard doesnt sing in barbershop quartets anymore but at 
86 hes got a lifetime of fond memories in fourpart harmony 
howard plans to be on the lead float saturday in a san antonio 
texas parade marking the 50th anniversary of the society for the 
preservation of barber shop quartet singing in america 
the central illinois man has attended all 50 of the 
organizations conventions from the first in tulsa okla in 1939 
to this years in san antonio 
i have to stand up every year and say i made it again 
chuckled howard who began singing on street corners around 1920 
but this year will be the biggie as far as im concerned 
many of the societys 38000 members including some from other 
countries are attending the convention which features a 
competition to pick the best quartet 
the groups have names like rural route four most happy fellows 
and side street ramblers popular songs include when irish eyes 
are smiling youre a grand old flag and in the shade of 
the old apple tree 
the music reflects wholesome values something people are 
holding onto said society president jim warner of memphis tenn 
interest is not waning when people know there is going to be a 
barbershop show the response is tremendous 
the uniquely american style of music featuring four 
unaccompanied male voices sometimes in a smalltown barbershop 
setting gained popularity late in the 19th century and flourished 
during the vaudeville era 
a 1910 song written for these popular quartets gave the music 
its name mr jefferson lord play that barbershop chord 
glenn howard was a just a boy then growing up in central 
illinois he enjoyed listening to a quartet that performed on the 
streets and one day when the bass didnt show up his singing 
career began 
we did it all by ear howard recalled if a group came 
through town wed sit through all their shows and learn and 
steal their harmony 
howard sang with many quartets through the years performing on 
street corners at county fairs in theaters on radio shows and 
at the illinois state fair 
one latenight street concert apparently woke someone up 
we had water thrown down on us from upstairs seemed like 
five gallons howard recalled 
after a radio broadcast in chicago howards quartet and another 
group went to a tavern and continued singing someone at the bar 
enjoyed it and sent a round of drinks after each song later 
howard asked who it was 
al capone said howard luckily he liked us 
howard worked for a baking company and a paintbynumber 
producer and farmed but often he also performed three or four 
times a week 
a group he sang with the capital city four recorded the first 
album of barbershop quartet music for the society in 1939 
featuring songs like sweet adeline and dear old girl it 
gained national success 
we could go into most any restaurant across the united states 
put a nickel in the jukebox and hear ourselves sing said howard 
holding the 78 rpm records from the album 
howard said he decided to quit singing when he throat started 
tightening up about 15 years ago but he remains a dedicated 
student of barbershop music 
some young singers want to pep things up and forget about the 
original tempo said howard but at least they stick with many of 
the old songs if youre going to perpetuate something thats 
the way to do it

the justice department says it is ultimately 
cheaper to relieve overcrowding in penal facilities by building new 
prisons and jails than by releasing repeat offenders 
a report released sunday by the departments national institute 
of justice concluded that new crimes committed by released 
prisoners cost society about 430000 a year through such things as 
police and court work losses to victims and private security 
expenses 
but it costs about 25000 for each prisoner each year to build 
a new cell and maintain the inmate the study said 
confinement is not too expensive when weighed against the 
price of crimes that would otherwise be prevented by 
incapacitation said james k stewart the institutes director 
the report was based on a study of 2190 inmates from 
california texas and michigan who were repeat offenders and given 
early release the study found those inmates committed an average 
of 187 crimes a year 
public debate has mistakenly focused on the cost of 
imprisonment compared with the cost of probation said stewart 
the institute said sentencing 1000 additional offenders to 
prison annually would have required about 25 million a year but 
would have averted 187000 felonies that cost society a total of 
430 million 
onehalf the 2190 prisoners said they had committed fewer than 
15 crimes a year twentyfive percent said they committed more than 
135 crimes and 10 percent said they committed more than 600 
the study concluded that the 86 billion cost of operating the 
nations prisons and jails in 1983 was just onetenth the overall 
cost of crime to society 
the study said the bill for other criminal justice programs such 
as police courts and probation ran about 25 billion in 1983 also 
included in the total costs of crime to society were 35 billion in 
victim losses and 31 billion spent on private security to avert 
crime

a growing blight threatens to destroy the 
nations entire hazelnut crop and experts here are trying to find 
a way to control the plant disease 
all of the united states 20000ton hazelnut harvest comes from 
oregons willamette valley where favorable conditions enable 
farmers to turn out hazelnuts or filberts prized worldwide for 
their size and high quality 
but eastern filbert blight once confined to the eastern united 
states has taken hold here since its discovery in washington in 
1970 and is spreading in an everwidening arch in the northern 
willamette valley 
the united states produces just 3 percent of the worlds 
hazelnut crop experts say the nations share could grow if they 
can develop a variety that shares the qualities of the current 
filbert strains and is immune to the blight 
the worlds other major hazelnut producers are turkey italy and 
spain where the blight is unknown 
eastern filbert blight is endemic to north americas native 
eastern hazelnut and because it also attacks european varieties 
farmers have been unable to successfully grow hazelnuts east of the 
rocky mountains 
however the european varieties prospered in the pacific 
northwest where the native western hazelnut is immune to the 
blight until the disease took hold among the european stock 
the european varieties are preferred because they have desirable 
commercial qualities lacking in the western variety which grows 
wild along fence rows and is known as hazel brush 
scientists are working to control the blights spread until a 
breeding program at oregon state university produces a strain 
immune to the disease an accomplishment believed to be years away 
we need a way to slow down the spread of the disease so we 
still have an industry when the resistant strains become 
available said shawn mehlenbacher an assistant professor at 
oregon state and director of the breeding program 
the disease spreads when spores that develop on infected wood 
are washed by the rain or blown by the wind to other plants 
hazelnuts in the wild grow like a bush but growers prune the 
bushes to make them grow from a single stem like a tree to check 
the spread of the blight further pruning is used to remove 
diseased parts of the trees infected wood is then burned 
growers also use a copperbased fungicide that kills spores 
to find a permanent solution researchers have begun seeking an 
alternative to the daviana variety of hazelnut which is used as a 
pollinizer 
in a typical orchard 89 percent of the plants will be of a 
variety such as barcelona and 11 percent daviana mehlenbacher 
said the daviana plants pollinate the barcelona variety which 
cannot pollinate itself 
but daviana appears to be particularly susceptible to the 
blight mehlenbacher said 
as an alternative research has focused on a variety known as 
gasaway which is immune to the blight but has drawbacks such as 
poor kernel quality and a small nut 
distribution of offspring of four blightresistant seedlings 
bred from the gasaway variety will begin in january mehlenbacher 
said nurseries will graft these plants onto rootstock to produce 
new plants that will be immune to the blight mehlenbacher said 
the breeding program eventually will offer a replacement for the 
barcelona variety probably a plant descended from the gasaway 
type but that will take about 18 years 
additional sources of resistance are being sought in hybrids of 
the western and european varieties but those will take 25 years or 
more to develop mehlenbacher said 
growers are confident alternatives will be found to protect the 
industry said jay nelson chairman of oregons filbert commission 
well conquer it nelson said itll just take us time

when mohammed hamadi goes on 
trial on charges of hijacking a twa jetliner to beirut he will 
face some of the 39 americans he is charged with holding hostage 
for 17 days 
the trial for hamadi a shiite moslem charged with murder and 
air piracy begins tuesday in a heavily fortified frankfurt 
courtroom 
navy diver robert stethem of waldorf md was shot to death by 
the hijackers 
several former hostages have been asked to testify about how 
their abductors abused them dozens have given depositions to west 
german prosecutors 
im ready to go said kurt l carlson a chicagoarea native 
who said he was beaten by the hijackers for two consecutive hours 
i feel strongly about what the hijackers did all the beating 
and the terror our lives were threatened every minute on that 
plane carlson told the associated press 
were very much interested in seeing justice done said 
george lazansky of algonquin ill 
its an ongoing story it continues every day he told the 
ap 
lazanskys wife joanne was also on twa flight 847 when it was 
hijacked by gunmen en route to athens from rome 
west german court documents indicate that in addition to being 
beaten many passengers were threatened and robbed stethem was 
shot in the head and his body thrown onto the tarmac at beiruts 
airport 
carlson and other former hostages said they were disappointed 
that the trial was not being held in the united states where 
hamadi could have faced the death penalty hamadi faces a maximum 
sentence of life imprisonment in west germany if the court convicts 
him as an adult under west german law an adult is 21 years old 
hamadi contends he was under 21 during the hijacking 
west germany last year refused a us request to extradite 
hamadi to the united states the decision angered us officials 
and caused weeks of tension between the two countries 
the differences have since been patched up and us justice 
department officials have been assisting west german investigators 
and prosecutors in the case 
court spokesman falk thomas said eight americans including six 
people who were on the hijacked airliner have formally intervened 
in the prosecution that means attorneys for the eight can question 
hamadi during the trial 
two of the eight are relatives of stethem thomas said 
thomas a frankfurt judge acting as spokesman for the hamadi 
trial said hamadi will be tried in a specially constructed 
courtroom in preungesheim prison where he has been held since his 
arrest 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 after 
a search revealed he was carrying liquid explosives 
west german prosecutors later said his fingerprints matched 
those of one of the twa hijackers 
thomas said more than 75 million was spent constructing the 
high security courtroom the defendant judges and witnesses will 
be separated from the public by bulletproof glass 
after the trial opens thomas said a juvenile court will decide 
whether hamadi was 21 years old when the hijacking preparations 
started 
the west german indictment lists hamadis birthdate as june 13 
1964 hamadi has claimed he was born in 1966 
if the court tries him as an adult and convicts him hamadi 
could receive life in prison but if he is tried and convicted as a 
juvenile the maximum term would be 15 years under west german 
law a juvenile is less than 18 
the court can also rule that hamadi should be tried as an 
adolescent someone 18 19 or 20 years old 
if convicted as an adolescent the court could sentence hamadi 
either as an adult or a juvenile depending on how mature it 
decides he was at the time of the hijacking 
thomas said actual testimony on the murder and air piracy 
charges is scheduled to begin in september he said the trial would 
last at least three months 
hamadis older brother abbas ali hamadi was sentenced in april 
by a duesseldorf court to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two 
west germans in beirut in an attempt to gain freedom for his 
brother 
one of the hostages alfred schmidt was released in september 
businessman rudolf cordes is still being held in beirut

episcopalians at the churchs 69th general 
convention saying it would take time to act on more difficult 
issues such as homosexuality and the selection of female bishops 
focused on procedural matters 
the real strain for the convention is that so many things 
happen so fast in life today regarding justice and moral issues 
bishop frederick borsch of los angeles said sunday its hard to 
deal with them and find a way of speaking about them that is 
helpful 
the denominations governing bodies the house of deputies and 
the house of bishops spent sunday dealing with organizational 
matters 
the conventions committee on social and urban affairs will 
debate homosexual and aids issues before those topics are sent back 
to the two houses for general discussion the committee debate is 
scheduled to begin tuesday 
the general convention meets every three years to set policy for 
the 26 millionmember church the convention runs through july 11 
among the resolutions expected to come before the 3000 
delegates are a ban on discrimination against people with acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome a requirement that each of the churchs 
7500 us parishes adopt aids education programs and funding for 
those programs the question of whether the church should recognize 
singlesex marriages also will be discussed 
some bishops said they didnt think the delegates will resolve 
much 
the church is not clear on homosexuality and we have to wait 
until it is clear before we can move on it bishop george l 
reynolds of tennessee said it will take some time years 
listening before people get a clear mind on it 
another potentially divisive issue is the ordination of women 
bishops said nancy lawton a lay delegate from massachusetts 
there are no women bishops in the episcopal church but one could 
be elected within the next six months she said 
the consecration of a woman bishop would anger churchs 
conservative wing and could cause a schism said the rev jerome 
politzer president of the conservative prayerbook society of the 
episcopal church 
about 10000 worshipers began sundays activities by attending 
eucharistic services at cobo hall 
during his sermon presiding bishop edmond l browning called 
for unity 
we need to take care of each other as we go forward fully 
conscious of the ambiguities and imperfections of all that we do 
browning said 
on saturday browning urged delegates not to let issues such as 
marriage among homosexuals and the aids epidemic dominate the 
meeting

long before their forces shot down an 
iranian civilian jet over the persian gulf us navy officers said 
their constant fear was making a mistake in a war zone bustling 
with civilian activity 
iran said all 290 people aboard the iran air jet were killed 
sunday when the us guided missile cruiser vincennes fired at it 
during a routine flight from iran to dubai in the united arab 
emirates 
while not officially at war us sailors are in a combat 
environment where ships remain at a high state of alert for weeks 
on end and weapons are tested every few days 
there are many threats out here and maybe the worst one is 
the possibility of somebody making a mistake one ships 
commander said in a confined area like the gulf and with the 
weapons on hand the potential for disaster is incredible 
navy personnel reacted with disbelief after servicemen aboard 
the vincennes one of their most sophisticated warships mistook an 
iranian civilian jet for a warplane and shot it down 
basically theyre beating their heads against the walls 
trying to figure this out said a source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity some people are even wondering the worst could 
they the iranians have done this on purpose 
the source said that in the hightech command information center 
of the vincennes all indicators showed that the plane was an f14 
jet fighter that was descending on the ship from six to eight miles 
out 
the decision by the vincennes skipper capt will c rogers 
iii to fire his sm2 standard antiaircraft missiles was 
ultimately based on one indicator the iff or identify friend or 
foe which tells radar operators what kind of aircraft is 
approaching and what it appears to be doing 
that plane did not answer calls on the radio and it was flying 
an attack profile toward the vincennes the captain did what he 
should have done under the circumstances said the source 
rear admiral rg zeller who returned to the united states on 
sunday from six months in the persian gulf said us sailors 
constantly had to be on the lookout for civilian shipping and 
aircraft 
during a battle between us and iranian forces on april 18 
commercial airliners continued to fly as though they were 
oblivious to what was going on around them and i think they 
were he said in an interview in san diego i dont think they 
got the word you have to be very very careful 
its not a war in the sense that we think of wars where the 
land and sky is filled with combatants he said its a third 
world kind of thing where you have innocents and combatants and you 
have to stay extremely careful 
the vincennes is the first of the billiondollar 
stateoftheart aegis cruisers assigned to duty in the gulf 
the 9600ton san diegobased warship arrived in the gulf may 
27 and has been assigned since then to antiaircrart surveillance 
patrol in the southern gulf at the edge of the strait of hormuz 
the ships aegis system is a computerrun phased array radar 
system linked to the missile batteries the ship designed for 
fleet air defense can see vast distances with its radar and 
conduct dozens of surveillance and firing missions simultaneously 
us officials have said the vincennes multiple task capability 
could ease the burden on other ships serving in the gulf and give 
the navy a far more potent weapon that it has had in the waterway 
from the american standpoint concern about mistakes stems 
mainly from the experience of the us missile frigate stark which 
lost 37 crew members and nearly sank after it was mistakenly 
attacked by an iraqi f1 mirage on may 17 1987 
us officers and sailors say that while they dont dwell on the 
stark incident it is never far from their minds and has led to 
major changes in shipboard fire and damage control procedures that 
are practiced on a regular basis 
the us force in the gulf region known as the joint task force 
middle east is about 29 ships overall including the carrier 
forrestal and its battle group in the arabian sea and some 16 
ships usually in the gulf 
the gulfbased middle east force part of the joint task force 
has been escorting 11 usflagged kuwaiti tankers since july last 
year it includes missile cruisers missile frigates destroyers 
an amphibious landing ship with 400 marines on board and six 
minesweepers

bank for three days starting tuesday in an effort to limit student 
participation in the nearly sevenmonth arab uprising 
in jerusalem police strengthened their forces after a riot in 
the walled old city on sunday in which 15 palestinians and several 
israeli police officers were injured the protest began over an 
israeli archaeological dig near a site holy to moslems and jews 
the disturbances were among the most violent since dec 8 when 
palestinians began their uprising against israels 21year 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip at least 215 
palestinians and four israelis have died in the violence 
israeli officials view arab schools as major centers of the 
uprising so in february the army closed about 1200 schools in 
the west bank and gaza strip in a move affecting about 475000 
students 
schools in gaza have been operating on and off since but 800 
west bank schools with 120000 students stayed closed until the 
army reopened them in a threestage operation ending june 6 
brig gen shaike erez head of israels military administration 
in the west bank said reopening the schools had not quieted the 
students 
instead of studies there are disturbances he said adding 
that he hoped the army decision would bring home to students and 
parents that the current level of disturbances is unacceptable 
erez said the closing was timed to coincide with a palestine 
liberation organization call to rename all arab schools on tuesday 
giving them more palestinian nationalistic names 
in bethlehem five miles south of jerusalem hundreds of 
students demonstrated on the main road today hurling stones at 
troops who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets 
officials at beit jalla hospital said they treated dozens of 
students for tear gas inhalation the army said it was checking the 
reports 
an associated press reporter saw one bethlehem school that was 
renamed and had a sign intefadeh arabic for uprising 
apparently in compliance with a plo leaflet 
police released new figures on unrest within israel 
commissioner david krauss said more than 1000 protests had 
occurred in the last three months including 730 in the jerusalem 
area 
he said there were 51 firebomb attacks and blamed arab 
nationalists for 114 out of 210 cases of arson in forests and 
pastures he also said 900 arabs had been arrested on a variety of 
charges 
krauss said 55 of the detainees were suspected of arson and 
investigations of more than 20 suspected arsonists would be soon be 
completed 
he said police found it difficult to operate in the occupied 
territories after the plo called for the resignation of arab 
officers noting that only 300 policemen now remain in the occupied 
lands out of the previous 850strong force 
sundays clash began when workers for the ministry of religious 
affairs started digging a hole on the biblical via dolorosa 30 
yards from a gate leading to the temple mount 
the temple mount or haram al sharif in arabic houses the dome 
of the rock and al aqsa mosques and is the third holiest site in 
islam 
government archaeologist dan bahat said the dig was intended to 
open a stairway giving access to an ancient tunnel running 
alongside the wailing wall judaisms holiest site the tunnel is 
on the outside of the temple mount 
moslem religious leaders using mosque loudspeakers called on 
arabs to rush to the defense of the holy site and said they feared 
the israelis would dig a passage into the mosque area 
dozens of youths some of them masked darted out of the narrow 
twisting alleyways to throw rocks at police 
the police rushed in reinforcements closed off most of the 
gates leading into the old city and blocked off some of the main 
streets to keep more arabs from joining the fray 
they waged a twohour running battle with the protesters firing 
tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them police said seven 
arabs were arrested 
an arab girl about 6 years old was seen with her flowerprint 
dress covered with blood witnesses said she was hit by a rubber 
bullet 
the violence spread to other parts of jerusalem in one 
incident three passengers were injured when the bus they were 
riding was hit by stones as it drove past an arab neighborhood

teams of soviet experts traveled to five missile sites in four 
western states to begin inspections mandated by the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
the 70 soviets who arrived friday night at travis air force 
base in northern california departed in small groups sunday for 
two sites in arizona and one each in utah colorado and southern 
california said travis spokesman capt tom dolney 
a group of us inspectors traveled to the soviet union at the 
same time to begin their work under the treaty signed by president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev last december 
under the complex procedures outlined in the treaty the soviets 
had the right to conduct spot checks at the five sites this 
weekend and they didnt have to say how many of them they wanted 
to visit until the last minute 
the soviets dolney said chose to send teams to all five sites 
the pueblo army depot activity in pueblo colo 
a general dynamics plant in san diego 
the dugway proving ground a remote army installation in the 
western utah desert 
a cruise missile testing and training site at fort huachuca 
ariz about 60 miles south of tucson 
davismonthan air force base near tucson ariz a missile 
training center 
teams also plan to visit several sites in the eastern states 
but the soviets have yet to announce those locations 
the socalled baseline inspections verify information 
provided during the treaty negotiations the soviets may spend up 
to 24 hours at each site us officials said 
at dugway proving ground where the cruise missile was test 
fired spokeswoman kathy whittaker said the 10 soviets notified the 
base of their impending visit about 230 am mdt sunday they 
arrived less than 3 hours later and completed their inspection 
about 415 pm she said later they headed for travis 
theres not much out there for them to see since the site 
was stripped after the last cruise missile test firing she said 
whittaker said the inspection not only fulfilled the 
baseline provision of the treaty but also served as the 
closeout inspection to ascertain that activities banned under 
the treaty have ceased 
in san diego 10 inspectors arrived at general dynamics plant 19 
to see what was once the ground launch cruise missile launcher 
assembly and program office those operations were discontinued in 
december 1987 said air force lt col jb kump 
in arizona spokesmen at davismonthan and fort huachuca said 
the visits were extended from 24 to 32 hours by mutual consent 
each base was visited by a team of 10 soviets 
in addition to the brief spot checks at the five sites a group 
of 22 soviet onsite inspectors was welcomed saturday to salt lake 
city to begin its check at the hercules aerospace co missile plant 
in magna utah where pershing ii missiles banned under the inf 
treaty were produced 
the inspectors assigned to the hercules plant will be the only 
permanently based soviets who can stay for up to 13 years under 
the treaty 
the inf pact the first to allow such onsite inspection is 
viewed as a trial for the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty 
which would slash arsenals of longrange superpower nuclear weapons 
by 30 percent to 50 percent and involve much more complicated 
verification procedures

the commission set up by the most 
powerful mob families to settle their disputes appears to be out of 
commission authorities say 
the latest example of the ruling groups declining power came 
last week when authorities handed down indictments that indicated 
rivalry between the nations two most powerful mob families had 
escalated into a plot to kill reputed mob boss john gotti 
i think you can say with some degree of certainty there is a 
bankruptcy of leadership says fred martens director of the 
pennsylvania crime commission 
the ruling body that generally stabilized the five major mafia 
families genovese gambino lucchese bonanno and colombo for 
more than a halfcentury was effectively dismantled by the 1986 
commission trial 
three reputed bosses were convicted a fourth reputed gambino 
head paul castellano was shot to death on a new york city street 
about the same time 
experts say a new wave of prosecutions has thrown the underworld 
into further disarray 
last month two indictments against reputed top genovese leaders 
were returned by a newark federal grand jury closing arguments are 
scheduled next week in newark in the federal trial of 20 alleged 
lucchese family members and associates and a powerful member of 
the decavalcante family which operates mainly in new jersey is to 
go on trial in camden in september 
there are some more organized crime indictments coming said 
us attorney samuel a alito jr 
the commission trial was a major source of disruption for 
organized crime experts say 
with the commissions end the mob families lost a body to 
settle disputes and handle business matters said ronald goldstock 
director of the new york state organized crime task force 
the alleged plan to kill gotti reputed head of the gambino 
crime family and his brother gene was contained in an indictment 
aimed at reputed new jersey figures in the genovese family 
the indictment returned tuesday charges racketeering loan 
sharking illegal gambling and a labor payoff scheme seven other 
reputed genovese operatives were named in a second indictment 
gambino efforts to move into northern new jersey led to the 
murder plot which state police superintendent col clinton l 
pagano said is a very dramatic sign the commission is not 
operating 
when the commission was functioning the gambino family might 
have sought permission for expansion plans and the genovese family 
might have tried to settle differences through the group instead of 
through killing pagano said 
he said the tussle focuses on the northern new jersey gambling 
loan sharking and labor racketeering operations once controlled by 
nicodemo little nicky scarfo whose operatives hold sway in the 
atlantic city and philadelphia areas 
scarfos grip has been loosened by recent prosecutions and the 
northern turf now is up for grabs pagano said

the soviet union and china today urged the us navy to get out 
of the persian gulf after an american warship shot down an iranian 
jetliner with 290 people aboard governments around the world said 
the attack underscores the need to end the 8yearold iraniraq war 
britain backed the united states assertion that the navy was 
exercising its right to defend itself and that the us warship 
that fired on the iran air airbus on sunday had warned the airliner 
to keep its distance 
the united states said its forces mistook the jetliner for an 
iranian warplane during a confrontation with iranian gunboats and 
shot it down as it flew from iran to dubai in the united arab 
emirates 
iran said everyone aboard was killed and vowed revenge 
gennady k zhuravlev the soviet ambassador to egypt said in 
cairo that the presence of us and other western military 
increases tension in the area and leads to incidents that are 
hard to predict such as the iranian airliner incident 
ever since us warships were sent to the gulf last year to 
protect kuwaiti oil tankers from iranian attack the soviet union 
has criticized the move as an effort to expand us influence and 
has said that it could further destabilize the area 
it has called for an international force in the region to 
protect shipping 
britain france italy the netherlands belgium and the soviet 
union itself have warships and mine clearance units in and near the 
gulf the united states has deployed more than two dozen units in 
the region the largest single national contingent 
the chinese foreign ministry said the involvement of the 
superpowers in the persian gulf is not conducive to peace and 
stability in the region 
we condemn this action and express our condolences for the 
victims it said it is our hope that there will be a peaceful 
settlement of the iraniraq war at the earliest possible date 
china is officially neutral in the iraniraq war the united 
states says china has sold iran millions of dollars worth of arms 
including landbased silkworm missiles but china denies it 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain said her government 
deeply regretted the loss of life 
but she added we understand that in the course of an 
engagement following an iranian attack on the us force warnings 
were given to an unidentified aircraft apparently closing with a 
us warship we fully accept the right of forces engaged in such 
hostilities to defend themselves 
she said the incident underlines the urgent need for an early 
end to the iraniraq conflict including an end to all attacks on 
shipping 
france said nations should work together to avoid a recurrence 
of such events and to assure a settlement that could bring peace 
and stability to this region of the world 
prime minister bob hawke of australia today called the disaster 
a case of mistaken identity and expressed sympathy for the victims 
and their families 
japans foreign ministry said japan hopes the incident will 
not lead to the widening of tensions in the persian gulf and 
appeals again for the necessity of an early peaceful solution to 
the iraniraq conflict 
peter van vliet spokesman for the dutch foreign ministry said 
the shooting was a very regrettable incident in a complicated 
situation 
the libyan official news agency jana called the downing a 
disgraceful terrorist act 
jana in a broadcast monitored by the british broadcasting 
corp also called for the withdrawal of all us fleets and 
military bases outside us territory and territorial waters 
several british newspapers criticized the us action 
londons independent said in an editorial that president reagan 
appeared to deny the possibility that the attack had been 
foolish overly aggressive an act of retaliation stemming from 
recently changed rules of engagement or the result of panic and 
inexperience 
there was no hint of american concern that one of the most 
advanced naval vessels in the world had somehow failed to identify 
a civil airbus 
the conservative london newspaper the daily telegraph said it 
was an appalling mistake with possibly profound longterm 
consequences for american policy in the middle east and irans 
relations with the west 
unfortunately for britain and other european countries which 
have naval patrols in the gulf tehran is unlikely to differentiate 
between america and its allies it said 
in west germany the conservative die welt newspaper defended 
the us action saying it resulted from the confused situation in 
the wartorn persian gulf 
no one can seriously make the accusation that this catastrophe 
resulted from premeditation by the united states the newspaper 
said

a computer virsus destroyed information 
stored in personal computers at nasa and other government agencies 
the new york times reported today 
the rogue computer program designed to sabotage a private 
company in dallas destroyed computer files over a fivemonth 
period beginning in january the newspaper said 
damage to government data was limited but files were destroyed 
projects were delayed and hundreds of hours were spent tracking the 
electronic culprit the times said 
it was not known whether the program was deliberately introduced 
or brought in accidentally but national aeronautics and space 
administration officials have asked the fbi to investigate the 
paper said 
also affected were the environmental protection agency the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the us 
sentencing commission the times said 
the program infected close to 100 computers at nasa 
facilities in washington maryland and florida nasa officials said 
viruses are computer programs that can lie dormant until they 
are set off wiping out files or having other effects some viruses 
are not activated until a particular time or until another program 
is run 
the loss of information was isolated and limited to personal 
computers rather than larger mainframes according to david 
lavery a senior computer systems scientist with nasa 
the virus was designed to sabotage computer programs at 
electronic data systems in dallas said company spokesman bill 
wright the program did little damage he said 
the times said it was not known how the program spread from the 
company to personal computers but some government officials 
suspect the virus was spread through informal networks of 
government computer users who exchange publicly available software 
the spread of the virus worsened when private contractors in 
washington and north carolina inadvertently sold dozens of 
computers carrying the virus to government agencies the newspaper 
said 
private computer consultants have warned that government 
computer networks inlcuding those with national security 
functions are vulnerable 
i would hate to be an astronaut and have that virus expose 
itself two years down the line said a computer systems analyst 
with the general services administration who requested anonymity 
the agency manages contracts for the government

the fbi as part of its probe of pentagon 
dealings and the securities and exchange commission are 
investigating the competition between two groups for a navy blimp 
contract the new york times reported today 
in 1986 the navy decided to develop a model blimp that could be 
used for radar surveillance sparking feverish competition between 
the goodyear aerospace corp a unit of the goodyear tire and 
rubber co and a joint venture of the westinghouse electric corp 
and airship industries a british blimp maker 
the two military contractors envisioned a potential 5 billion 
project involving 48 airships the times said 
the competition is now a subject of the fbi inquiry into alleged 
pentagon bribery and fraud in awarding military contracts 
according to present and former executives of the companies 
federal investigators and others familiar with the case 
it also is being examined by a separate sec investigation 
looking at whether information leaks from the navy affected trading 
in the stock of airship industries the executives and 
investigators told the times 
the 1689 million airship prototype contract was awarded to 
westinghouseairship in june 1987 
information suggests the fbi is looking at the airship 
consultants used by the loral corp which acquired goodyear 
aerospace during the competition the times said the information 
also suggests the sec is looking at whether navy leaks affected 
trading in airship stock before the winning bid was announced it 
said 
the price of airship stock which trades over the counter in the 
united states soared to 31 from 16 in the weeks before the 
contract award was announced the report said 
the stock is currently trading near 4 reflecting financing 
troubles for the airship after the navy terminated the project 
earlier this year and passed it on to another pentagon branch 
goodyear aerospace retained at least two washingtonarea 
consultants who have figured in the pentagon fraud inquiry william 
m galvin and william parkin aerospace executives familiar with 
the program told the times 
federal investigators searched lorals akron ohio offices in 
june focusing on company consultants used for the airship 
competition according to thomas m seese president of the united 
auto workers local which represents about 1400 workers at lorals 
akron plant 
a loral spokeswoman elizabeth allen said the company felt it 
was inappropriate to comment on the investigation but said loral 
was cooperating with investigators and believed the its activities 
were within the letter and the spirit of the law 
the westinghouseairship team retained for its liaison with the 
navy a washington lawyer who was a friend of thennavy secretary 
john f lehman jr according to airship officials 
there is no indication that activities of the lawyer or lehman 
are under investigation in the blimp matter the times said lehman 
did not return telephone calls the lawyer declined to comment 
a westinghouse spokesman dick king declined to comment on the 
use of consultants in the airship competition but said the company 
was cooperating with an sec inquiry into the trading of airship 
stock 
officials of both agencies declined to discuss their inquiries 
no one has been charged with wrongdoing navy officials declined to 
say why westinghouse got the contract the times said

officers aboard an italian frigate in the persian 
gulf say the iranian jetliner shot down by an american warship was 
flying outside the commercial air corridor an italian navy 
spokesman said today 
the route of the iranian airbus was detected by officers aboard 
the espero which was escorting the italian cargo ship jolly 
smeraldo through the strait of hormuz said the spokesman speaking 
under the usual groundrules of anonymity 
he said italian radar screens showed that the iranian plane on 
a 150mile flight from bandar abbas iran to dubai in the united 
arab emirates was outside the route reserved for civilian planes 
the spokesman didnt elaborate but adm william crowe chairman 
of the us joint chiefs of staff said in washington on sunday 
that the aircraft approached the cruiser vincennes four or five 
miles outside a commercial corridor used by civilian craft in the 
area 
iran has claimed the plane was inside a commercial corridor 
the italian military spokesman said the italian officers heard 
the commander of the vincennes send four radio warnings to the 
pilot of the iranian plane but there was no response 
the italians later heard the americans announce they had downed 
an iranian f14 the spokesman said 
italy sent a naval task force to the gulf last year to protect 
italian merchant ships in the waterway

lead to further aggravation of tensions in the region and 
intensification of the iraniraq war

the cheers of thousands echoed on a 
hillside here as a tongue of flame atop the eternal light peace 
memorial burst skyward for the first time in 15 years 
more than 20000 people witnessed the relighting sunday of the 
memorial that was first ignited 50 years ago in memory of those who 
fought and died in the civil war battle of gettysburg 
its time for us to learn from the sacrifice of those who fell 
here and it is time to act astronomer carl sagan said in his 
dedication address 
the real triumph of gettysburg was not i think in 1863 it 
was 50 years later when the veterans the remnants of the 
adversary forces the blue and the gray met in celebration and in 
solemn memorial sagan said it is time to emulate them 
the flame will be kept burning continuously atop the limestone 
and granite monument which was dedicated 50 years ago by president 
franklin d roosevelt in a ceremony that drew more than 450000 
people 
the light burned unceasingly for 35 years except for a twoyear 
break during world war ii in 1973 it was extinguished by a 
congressional order banning all ornamental uses of energy during 
the height of the oil crisis except for the flame on president john 
f kennedys grave in arlington national cemetery 
the monument remained dark for three years the natural gas 
light then was converted to an electric light that has burned for 
the past 12 years 
the relighting of the gasfueled flame is a dream come true 
for state rep ken cole of adams his uncle paul roy who was then 
editor of the gettysburg times conceived the idea for the original 
flame and monument and mounted a nationwide fundraising effort to 
build it 
when they put the light bulb up there and extinguished the 
flame it kind of took the heart out of the monument cole said 
the relighting was not lost on arthur rice who witnessed the 
original lighting in 1938 and whose relatives helped plan that 
ceremony 
i think the idea of rededicating it for peace for a world 
united is something they would be happy with he said 
three central pennsylvania companys have offered to pay for the 
first years fuel bill

space shuttle discovery made its 
longdelayed trip to the launch pad today cheered on by 
flagwaving workers who have waited 2 years for a rebirth of the 
american space program 
america the dream is still alive astronaut dave hilmers 
told a fourth of july crowd of several hundred engineers 
technicians and others who watched as the 85ton spaceship edged 
out of an assembly building into the glare of floodlights at 1250 
am 
what more fitting present can we make to our country than this 
on the day of its birthday said hilmers one of five crew 
members scheduled to fly discovery on the first postchallenger 
mission set for early september 
discovery attached to its external fuel tank and two solidfuel 
booster rockets was perched on the broad back of a giant tracked 
transporter that lumbered along at less than 1 mph in covering the 
42mile route to the pad in 6 hours 
the shuttle arrived at pad 39b at 730 am and technicians 
began connecting its various systems to the launch tower including 
airconditioning and electricity and extending platforms from the 
pad so workers can have access to the shuttle 
nasa scheduled the move in the early morning to avoid 
thunderstorms and lightning that are common during the daytime in 
the summer months 
for three hours starting at 8 am space center workers and 
their families were permitted to drive personal cars past the 
launch pad for a good look at discovery before a service structure 
enclosed it 
a recording of the star spangled banner was played as the 
shuttle began the move to launch pad 39b the same pad from which 
challenger was launched on the flight that killed seven astronauts 
on jan 28 1986 
its been a long 2 years since challenger and im very 
pleased with the progress weve made during that time forrest s 
mccartney director of the kennedy space center said at the 
rollout ceremony its been a team effort this is a proud 
day 
mccartney presented hilmers with a book containing the names of 
more than 15000 kennedy space center workers who have labored to 
return the shuttle fleet to space 
hilmers said the astronauts would carry the book bearing the 
inscription the ksc team is with you into orbit aboard 
discovery knowing that our journey will be safer because of 
you 
it kind of brings tears to your eyes after so long a time of 
struggling and looking at ourselves inwardly and outwardly and 
here it is its finally a reality hilmers said 
this is what i call a happy fourth of july said astronaut 
bob crippen a veteran of four shuttle flights who is now deputy 
director of shuttle operations 
workers were to spend several hours securing discovery on the 
pad and then begin preparing it for a critical testfiring of its 
three main liquid fuel engines the test with the spaceship bolted 
firmly on its launch mounts is set for july 24 
the following day a final preflight testfiring of the 
redesigned solidfuel booster rocket is planned at the morton 
thiokol plant in utah both tests must be passed before discovery 
is certified for flight 
the failure of a seal in a booster rocket joint doomed 
challenger 73 seconds after liftoff since then the booster has 
been significantly redesigned and tested and hundreds of other 
modifications have been made to the shuttle main engines and other 
systems 
hilmers and four other veteran shuttle crew members will be at 
the controls when discovery blasts off on a fourday mission the 
others are commander rick hauck dick covey mike lounge and george 
nelson 
they will deploy a communications satellite conduct scientific 
and technical experiments and check out changes made to the orbiter 
systems

the soviet union announced today it would grant an 
amnesty to any of its troops who deserted their units in 
afghanistan during the nations eightyear involvement in the war 
there 
prosecutor general a y sukharev told a news conference in 
moscow the amnesty was being offered to about 200 soviet soldiers 
who either deserted or became separated from their units during the 
war 
the soviet union began pulling its forces out of afghanistan on 
may 15 under accords signed in geneva and units still in 
afghanistan awaiting withdrawal are not taking part in offensive 
operations 
sukharev said any soldier who returns to the soviet union will 
enjoy all political social and all other rights guaranteed by 
soviet law 
asked specifically if the amnesty applied to deserters he said 
it would apply to all servicemen who became victims of extreme 
conditions in afghanistan and that from the standpoint of 
humanism an amnesty will be applied to them 
the soviet union has listed 312 soldiers missing in action in 
afghanistan 
sukharov said authorities have determined that about one third 
of that number died and that perhaps 200 remain on the territory of 
neighboring pakistan many of those may be prisoners of rebel units 
that have operated with pakistani aid 
sukharev said some soldiers are believed to be in the united 
states canada or western europe he gave no indication how many

members of congress today generally defended 
the us missile attack on an iranian passenger jet but they called 
for a thorough investigation and a review of us policy in the 
persian gulf 
house majority leader tom foley interviewed on nbctvs 
today program said all information about the destruction of 
the jet should be released publicly to demonstrate that the 
united states does not make war on innocents that this was a 
terrible accident that we deeply regret it 
but the washington democrat said it would be a great mistake 
for the united states to abruptly withdraw its forces after this 
tragic accident 
sen dale bumpers dark said the us policy in the persian 
gulf was never a very good one to begin with and this incident 
this sort of thing was very predictable 
if our policy remains the same well see more of these things 
happen he said on cbstvs this morning program the 
magnitude of this tragedy demands we take another look at this 
policy 
sen richard lugar rind also interviewed on the cbs program 
said the policy of trying to protect commercial shipping in the 
gulf is absolutely right 
other members of congress defended the response of the commander 
of the cruiser that fired the missle but they also want answers 
from the reagan administration to some tough questions 
american military forces must always have the right to defend 
themselves and preliminary information indicates that the onscene 
commander believed his forces were in imminent danger said sen 
sam nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee 
but nunn dga said he wants answers to such key questions as 
how the us navy has previously handled commercial airline traffic 
in the region and what rules of engagement and decisionmaking led 
to sundays decision to shoot down the plane all 290 people aboard 
iran air flight 655 were presumed dead after the jetliner was hit 
by a us missile and exploded in midair 
president reagan and other administration officials said the 
crew of the cruiser uss vincennes mistook the approaching jetliner 
for an iranian f14 attack plane and fired in selfdefense 
some members of congress coupled expressions of regret with 
criticism of the administration policies that put us forces in 
the gulf in the first place 
rep tony coelho dcalif the no 3 man in the house 
leadership said the persian gulf operation lacks definition and 
reason and this kind of tragedy is the inevitable result if a 
retaliatory act of terror is irans response who will remember 
this mission to protect commercial shipping or its purpose 
sen paul simon dill a member of the senate foreign 
relations committee said that much of the responsibility rests 
with the government of iran for its irresponsible conduct during 
these past years but policy errors have led the united states to 
become more involved in the persian gulf than our security needs 
and the defense of freedom of the seas require 
but republicans such as sen phil gramm of texas defended 
reagans policy of deploying us forces in the gulf to provide 
us protection to neutral shipping 
gramm said he did not believe the incident showed any flaws in 
us olicy we have saved lives by being in the persian gulf 
he said 
sen carl levin dmich said that from what he knows so far 
it seems reasonable to believe that the us navy acted in an 
appropriate manner 
but he called the downing of the jetliner a horrible horrible 
tragedy and said i too have many unanswered questions ill 
reserve final judgment until i have more details 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan predicted the incident would cause 
major disruptions in the arab world but said friction could be 
reduced by having a body like the un step forward and provide a 
forum for some of the tensions that are going to be incurred 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the armed 
services committee said americans should give the navy every 
benefit of the doubt until all the facts are in with regard to what 
was done to defend the lives of american sailors 
sen strom thurmond rsc said the deaths were regrettable 
but the actions of the iranian plane left the us navy no other 
recourse 
sen alan dixon dill called the incident unfortunate 
although he added i dont think the captain had much of 
alternative 
he said that even if the plane had been identified as an airbus 
jetliner the us ships captain could have reasonably feared it 
was a kamikaze plane since it ignored warnings and was outside 
a normal commercial air channel 
sen warren rudman rnh said he was saddened that such a 
tragedy should happen in a part of the world that already has known 
too much human suffering 
one member of house armed services committee rep buddy darden 
dga said such a tragedy could have been foreseen because of 
irans actions in the gulf 
im not saying the iranians deserved what they got but the 
iranians helped create the climate which led to the destruction of 
this airliner he said 
another member of the house committee rep dave mccurdy 
dokla said the incident just has to weigh heavy on the captain 
of the vessel but also on the entire us navy 
but with any operation like that there is also going to be 
some risk danger to us forces or innocent bystanders 
mccurdy continued

rightwing politicians and a 
progovernment newspaper today urged the government to retaliate 
against african national congress guerrillas for a bombing outside 
a rugby stadium 
the anc should be killed at its origin even if it is in 
london or lusaka zambia said moolman mentz a parliament 
member for the farright conservative party 
two white men were killed and at least 35 people most of them 
white were injured in saturdays bombing which occurred as 
thousands of spectators were leaving johannesburgs ellis park 
after a rugby match 
twelve of the injured remained hospitalized today 
the citizen a progovernment newspaper said top south 
african government sources were predicting retaliation for the 
act 
police said the bomb placed under a stolen car that had been 
parked near the stadium since friday night contained 220 pounds of 
explosives the largest ever detonated in johannesburg 
sports administrators said they would tighten security at 
stadiums 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu deplored the bombing and 
offered to mediate between the government the african national 
congress and another outlawed group the pan africanist congress 
until the authorities agree to sit down and negotiate real 
powersharing with the authentic leaders of our people this 
dreadful carnage will not end tutu said in a statement 
there have been more than 90 bombings in south africa since a 
national state of emergency was declared in june 1986 since 
january 27 explosions killed 12 people and injured 110 
the african national congress said recently it intended to step 
up its military campaign but the organization has declined 
specific comment on recent attacks including saturdays bombing 
the sowetan the countrys only daily newspaper for blacks 
called the bombing distasteful and unwarranted but indicated 
doubt that the anc was responsible for involving civilians in 
violent attacks 
the paper blamed the bombing on the governments policy of 
apartheid which establishes a racially segregated society in which 
the 5 million whites control national affairs while denying a vote 
to the 26 million blacks 
we have always said that apartheid is institutionalized 
violence it said referring to a government proposal last week 
to tighten enforcement of residential segregation 
the citizens editorial described the anc as a terrorist 
organization 
any steps taken against the anc will have the support of the 
great majority of people it said

yasser arafats guerrillas today held off 
syrianbacked plo dissidents seeking to storm the arafat loyalists 
last beirut stronghold police said at least 21 people were killed 
and 67 wounded 
six hours of fierce fighting which included rocket barrages and 
mortar fire began at dawn in the bourj elbarajneh refugee camp 
the latest casualties raised the toll to at least 148 killed and 
594 wounded since battles broke out may 1 between col saeed 
mousas dissident fatahuprising faction and arafats fatah group 
todays fighting ended a weeklong lull in the battle between 
the rival factions for control of beiruts two remaining 
palestinian refugee camps 
mousas men overran the nearby chatilla camp june 27 and had 
been expected to move on bourj elbarajneh 
police said 20 rounds a minute were exploding today in the 
sprawling shantytown on beiruts southern outskirts and that the 
fighting forced the closing of the airport highway that runs 
parallel to the camps western edge 
airport officials said flight schedules were not affected 
travelers reached the airport by sidestreests 
black smoke billowed from bourj elbarajneh as mousas gunners 
deployed in syriancontrolled hills overlooking beirut pounded the 
camp with 120mm and 160mm mortars rockets and 106mm recoilless 
guns police reported 
they said arafats loyalists responded with 62mm mortars 
an official of fatah the main component of the palestine 
liberation organization said by telephone that his men repulsed 10 
attacks by dissidents trying to push into the camp today 
fatah pushed mousas followers out of bourj elbarajneh and 
chatilla in earlier fighting 
the dissidents then regrouped along the syriancontrolled edges 
of the camps and overran chatilla last week in a 13hour battle 
that demolished the shantytown and displaced hundreds of refugees 
the next day libyan mediators sponsored the evacuation of about 
150 arafat guerrillas from chatilla to fatah bases in the port city 
of sidon 25 miles south of beirut 
the fall of chatilla was a serious setback for arafat and the 
fatah official said his fighters were determined to hold out and 
defend bourj elbarajneh to the last man 
he said 80 percent of the camp was devastated by earlier 
bombardments and that only 3000 out of its original 20000 
residents remain 
dozens of civilians fled the camp during the weeklong lull in 
fighting after chatilla fell 
the camps have been largely destroyed by fighting that began 
when the israelis invaded lebanon in 1982 besieged west beirut and 
hammered the shantytowns with air raids and shellfire for months 
proisraeli christian militiamen massacred hundreds of civilians 
in chatilla and the neighboring sabra camp in september 1982 
and syrianbacked lebanese shiite moslems besieged the camps in 
1985 
they pounded them for more than two years in an abortive effort 
to prevent arafat from rebuilding the power base he lost when the 
israelis drove the plo out of beirut in 1982 
the shiites bulldozed sabra flat but chatilla and bourj 
elbarajneh held out until the shiites lifted their siege earlier 
this year 
mousa broke away from the plo in 1983 in a syrianbacked mutiny 
by radicals opposed to arafats policies mousa set up his 
headquarters in the syrian capital of damascus 
the beirut fighting has flared despite a reconciliation between 
arafat and syrian president hafez assad last april to end a 
5yearold feud over control of the palestinian movement

vice president george bush today 
expressed deep regrets about the downing of an iranian civilian 
aircraft but says the captain of the us warship that fired on the 
aircraft appeared to have made the right decision 
bush speaking to reporters at the detroit airport on his way to 
an independence day parade here said it appears the captain of 
the ship followed the rules he did what he had to do 
the vice president the certain republican presidential nominee 
dismissed any comparison between sundays tragedy and the soviet 
destruction of a korean airliner that strayed into russian airspace 
on a trip from new york to seoul south korea in 1983 
i would just reject the comparison bush said this plane 
was warned this plane was flying in a combat area its totally 
separate totally different 
bush said he did not think the episode would jeopardize 
president reagans persian gulf policies and said he believed that 
americans were pulling together in support of the captain of the 
uss vincennes 
obviously as we celebrate our great national holiday our 
hearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who were 
lost bush said 
asked how significant the disaster was in terms of us policy 
in the persian gulf bush said i dont think its more 
significant than other incidents but it is significant 
asked whether his decision to campaign today might send the 
wrong signals in view of the gravity of the situation bush said 
this is a national holiday it is appropriate that we celebrate 
it there is nothing i could be doing about this matter in 
washington dc 
life goes on and our mission goes on and the world keeps 
turning he said 
bush who spent the weekend at his vacation home in 
kennebunkport maine was to march in this detroit suburbs morning

nicosia that we wish to warn that the american government will 
have to suffer the consequences of its recent crime in the persian 
gulf he did not elaborate 
the official islamic republic news agency said said 168 bodies 
had been recovered by today including at least 38 foreigners 
it listed them as 12 united arab emirates citizens eight 
indians eight pakistanis six yugoslavs two kuwaitis and italian 
and an afghan airline officials said the rest of the passengers 
were iranians 
the casualty toll of 290 would make it the sixthworst 
commercial air disaster in history 
the criminal united states should know that blood unlawfully 
shed in the disaster will be avenged in the same 
bloodspattered sky over the persian gulf tehran radio said in 
an earlier broadcast also monitored in nicosia 
it accused the united states of directly aiding iraq irans 
enemy in the nearly 8yearold gulf war the united states says its 
warships are in the gulf to keep international sea lanes open to 
neutral shipping 
the united states has entered a more direct war with our 
nation irna quoted iranian prime minister hussein musavi as 
saying 
the government of the islamic republic of iran considers this 
a premeditated coldblooded murder said a statement read by 
mohammad javad zarif counselor of irans mission to the united 
nations 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati said in a message 
to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar that the world 
body should openly condemn the perpetrator of this atrocity 
irna reported 
but irans ambassador to the united arab emirates mustafa 
foumeni haeri said if the united states says it will change its 
policy in the gulf and stop its interference in the region the 
case will then be closed 
iran air flight 655 was on a routine 150mile flight between 
irans coastal city of bandar abbas and dubai across the gulf in 
the united arab emirates irna said the jet left bandar abbas 
where iran has a big naval and air base at 1015 am sunday 
two us missiles hit the iran air jet 15 minutes later and the 
plane exploded at an altitude of 7500 feet irna said 
adm william crowe chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff 
said the plane was outside the prescribed commercial air corridor 
but staterun tehran radio monitored in london said it had 
been flying precisely in the international corridor 
crowe said the iranian jetliner flew directly at the uss 
vincennes as the warship exchanged fire with several of irans 
boghammar gunboats in the strait of hormuz entry to the gulf 
the cruiser and a smaller us frigate the uss elmer 
montgomery fired 5inch guns at the boats sinking two and 
damaging a third the pentagon said 
irna said two iranian sailors listed as missing in sundays 
clashes were rescued unharmed in the gulf several hours later it 
gave no details 
crowe said the vincennes fired two standard surfacetoair 
missiles at the airliner seven minutes after it was detected by 
radar during the seven minutes the jetliner ignored three 
warnings on a civilian distress network and four on a military 
distress network he said 
there was no word on whether the iranians had recovered the 
airliners black box which contains recordings of the planes 
systems and radio communications 
the gulf air corridor is one of the worlds busiest despite the 
hazards of flying over the waterway where iran and iraq have been 
at war for nearly eight years 
crowe said the american forces acted with good judgment 
the statement from the iranian mission said we are outraged 
that the american officials have considered the shooting down of a 
passenger plane by their missiles a good judgment on the part of 
the naval unit 
us officials said there were no american casualties in 
sundays clash the second major skirmish between us and iranian 
forces in the gulf in three months 
on april 18 american warships and planes retaliating for the 
mining of a us missile frigate destroyed two iranian oil rigs 
and sank or disabled six of irans naval craft including two of 
its best frigates 
on may 17 1987 the frigate uss stark was hit in the gulf by a 
missile fired by an iraqi warplane and 37 crew members died iraq 
called the attack a mistake and washington accepted the explanation 
and apology

this as vigorously as we should have done it

were presumed dead the pentagon said the us vessel that shot 
down the jetliner believed it was under attack by a fighter plane

european hostages in lebanon to free their captives 
their captivity has reminded us that none of us is free until

better understanding he said in a message taped sunday in 
chicago a text was released in washington 
the jackson campaign said the tape would be distributed to 
lebanese news organizations but provided no details

members of congress and vice president george 
bush today rejected any comparison between the us destruction of 
an iranian airliner in the persian gullf and the 1983 soviet 
downing of a korean jet because the us action occurred in a war 
zone 
this plane was warned this plane was flying in a combat area 
its totally separate totally different bush told reporters in 
wyandotte mich where he was campaigning 
rep lee hamilton dind a member of the house foreign affairs 
committee agreed saying that unlike the korean jet the iranian 
plane had been warned on both civilian and military frequencies 
there are a lot of differences between the two situations 
he said in an interview on abcs good morning america 
adm william crowe the nations top military officer also drew 
distinctions between the two attacks he said the iran air plane 
was descending toward the uss vincennes and that its flight profile 
and failure to respond to warnings led us to believe it was a 
military aircraft 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said that in the case 
of korean air lines flight 007 shot down by the soviets the plane 
had been flying at a very high altitude and the soviets never 
claimed to believe it had been out to bomb or destroy 
the fundamental differences of course are that it was not a 
war zone crowe said sunday when asked to compare the iran air 
shooting with the kal incident there was not combat in progress 
there was not combat there normally 
us officials say the navy ship was defending against what its 
commander believed was a hostile military aircraft iran said all 
290 people aboard the commercial jetliner were killed 
the pentagon initially reported that the vincennes had shot down 
an iranian f14 attack plane crowe acknowledged that the downed 
aircraft was in fact a civilian airliner about 10 hours after the 
incident occurred early sunday 
on sept 1 1983 the soviets shot down kal 007 after it strayed 
from its designated route into soviet airspace after leaving 
anchorage alaska on the last leg of a trip of trip to seoul 
south korea from new york all 269 people aboard were killed 
it wasnt until sept 6 that the official soviet news agency 
tass admitted that soviet pilots had terminated the flight the 
soviets claimed the plane has been spying for washington and that 
their pilots had a duty to destroy it president reagan assailed 
the soviets at the time for barbarity in shooting down an 
unarmed plane 
on sunday reagan called the persian gulf incident a terrible 
human tragedy but defended the us decision to fire on the 
iranian airliner 
crowe said the kal pilots had received no warning prior to the 
soviet attack while the iranian aircraft failed to heed repeated 
warnings to steer clear of the cruiser uss vincennes 
the kal 007 was not warned in any way form or fashion 
crowe said nor was as far as i can tell or determine any 
attempt made to warn 
it was accused of being an intelligence gatherer he said 
that was certainly not the case 
after the kal plane was shot down reagan said the united states 
shared the disgust that the entire world feels at the barbarity 
of the soviet government in shooting down an unarmed plane words 
can scarcely express our revulsion at this horrifying act of 
violence

the commander of the uss vincennes said before 
leaving for the persian gulf that he would defend his ship if 
threatened and the pentagon is standing by his decision to shoot 
down an approaching iranian airliner 
capt will c rogers iii received support sunday from the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william crowe who said 
the airliner was outside commercial air lanes and ignored repeated 
warnings to pull away from us ships in the gulf he said the 
airliner was mistaken for an iranian f14 attack plane and was shot 
down with 290 people aboard 
a full investigation will be conducted but it is our judgment 
that based on the information currently available the local 
commanders had sufficient reasons to believe their units were in 
jeopardy and they fired in self defense crowe said at a pentagon 
briefing 
rogers was born in fort worth texas and now lists his home as 
san diego the vincennes home port pentagon officials said they 
did not have his date of birth 
in a radio interview before the vincennes departed for the 
persian gulf in april rogers was asked what the ships response 
would be if attacked and said if we are attacked or hostile 
intent is demonstrated we will defend ourselves 
there is a very clearcut set of engagement rules which we go 
by and were certainly not there to initiate hostilities rogers 
said were there to defend ourselves and carry out what national 
command authority dictates 
crowe noted that those rules of engagement were changed after 
the may 1987 attack on the uss stark in which 37 us sailors 
died us commanders in the region are under orders to act more 
quickly and forcefully if their ships are threatened 
rep bill lowery rcalif said he toured the vincennes during 
exercises off the san diego coast in february and found rogers to 
be a firstrate professional 
its a welltrained and disciplined crew and skipper lowery 
said 
rogers also was supported by a former navy lieutenant who 
survived the may 1987 attack on the uss stark in which 37 us 
sailors died basil e moncrief jr who resigned from the navy in 
the wake of the attack said rogers had no choice but to defend his 
ship 
if the plane was unfortunate enough to be flying toward the 
vincennes while the vincennes was engaging iranian patrol boats 
im not surprised this kind of thing would happen he told the 
corpus christi callertimes i dont think the vincennes had much 
choice other than to fire 
before taking command of the vincennes rogers served in the 
pentagon as head of a section in the planning division of chief of 
naval operations the commander of the navy according to a 
biography released at the pentagon 
his first command was the destroyer uss cushing from september 
1981 to august 1984 the statement said 
he was commissioned in december 1965 through officer training 
school and spent his first tour of duty aboard the aircraft carrier 
uss independence qualifying as a main watch officer a main 
propulsion division officer and an assistant combat information 
center officer 
rogers is married to sharon rogers also from fort worth texas 
they and their son will rogers iv live in san diego calif a 
main navy base for the pacific ocean 
the captain is not related to the late american humorist will 
rogers according to the humorists son will rogers jr

president reagans personal interest may keep 
immigration officials from breaking up a chicago couple and sending 
the wife back to portugal according to sen alan dixon 
dr margarida magalhaes a native of portugal came to this 
country seven years ago to study medicine on the condition that she 
would practice in her own country for at least two years 
but in the meantime she married a chicago physician dr 
william silverman 
when the expiration of her visa became imminent the couple 
applied for a special waiver to allow her to remain in this 
country it was denied in march when federal officials ruled their 
separation did not pose an exceptional hardship 
i was devastated said silverman my whole world fell 
apart i couldnt imagine that an american wouldnt be allowed to 
live with his wife in this country 
this weekend however reagan telephoned dixon a democrat and 
asked what he could do to help the senator had been writing 
letters to federal agencies in the couples behalf with little 
success 
with the president interested its a totally different 
case dixon said sunday if he reagan says that this ladys 
going to stay in the country you can bet on it 
the president is to discuss the case with members of his staff 
tuesday dixon said 
meanwhile the silvermans have accepted fellowships at case 
western reserve university in cleveland where they hope to be 
together for two years of study

at least two university of california 
libraries are canceling use of a computerized nasa information 
service because noncitizens are banned from using it 
the federal restriction which applies to both classifed and 
nonclassified material violates the uc antidiscrimination policy 
and would be hard to enforce because of the number of foreign 
students on campus university officials told the los angeles times 
also librarians fear prosecution if they mistakenly give 
research material to the wrong person 
a recent letter by calvin moore uc associate vice president for 
academic affairs urged libraries on all nine campuses to cancel 
contracts with the national aeronautics and space administration 
for the service 
the database summarizes hundreds of thousands of scientific 
documents on such topics as space flight and tells where the 
complete versions are located 
ucla and uc berkeley libraries will sign up for a competing 
service that is more expensive the times said 
of course librarians are not interested in doing anything to 
overthrow the government but on the other hand they are very 
interested in confidentiality and freedom of information said 
nancy koller who works at uc riverside and is president of the 
librarians association of uc 
the citizenship restriction has been in all contracts for at 
least nine years and uc may simply have overlooked it said john 
wilson nasas manager of the database 
wilson said that to his knowledge no one has been prosecuted 
for letting a foreigner use the service

this former gold mining town in the high 
desert has a childhood cancer rate five times the average for a 
town its size and health officials say they are mystified as to a 
cause 
the only known similarity among the cases is that all the 
children lived in the city during the same period said gary euler 
public health epidemiologist for kern county 
there is no link to any particular area or playground euler 
said if we cannot link any common denominator then its not 
likely that they are caused by the same factor or set of factors 
then they are not a true cancer cluster 
eight children were stricken from 1976 to 1986 and only one has 
survived california health services department officials say 
theyre especially perplexed by four children who all contracted a 
rare form of cancer of the brain stem known as medulloblastoma 
the citys average rate of cancer cases is 72 per 100000 
annually for people 20 and younger compared to 14 per 100000 a 
year in an average community euler said 
rosamond about 60 miles north of los angeles has a population 
of 2869 according to the 1980 census figures for the 20 and 
younger population were unavailable 
state health officials are testing soil from some industrial 
sites said ron baker spokesman for the toxic substances control 
divison of the health services department 
rosamond is known mostly for its former gold mines mercury and 
sodium cyanide both toxic were used to extract gold from ore and 
cyanide is still used said tom anderson a senior geologist for 
the california division of mines and geology

oil prices spurted briefly monday and then settled 
back down on news that the us navy shot down an iranian civilian 
jetliner in the persian gulf 
the spot price of brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil jumped to 1435 a barrel in far eastern 
trading up 20 cents from the close of trading in new york on 
friday 
but later in london the price had retreated to 1415 a barrel 
thats the usual kneejerk reaction to anything happening in 
the gulf said fergus macleod an oil expert at the london 
investment firm barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
an oil broker in the energy department at shearson lehman hutton 
inc in london who didnt want to be identified further said 
it didnt last all it did was bring sellers into the markets 
since then it has been sold down 
there was obviously a lot of interest from the us to find 
out what was happening she said 
macleod added the basic perception is that unless that 
incident changes the us public opinion about having the fleet in 
the gulf then it wont have much impact 
the market is still weak because of oversupply and high stock 
levels the experts said 
the broker said the underlying trend is bearish at the 
moment 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries is producing 
about 19 million barrels a day macleaod said that is far above 
the ceiling of 1506 million barrels a day agreed to by 12 of 
opecs 13 members in an effort to support prices at 18 a barrel

the only survivor among a group of aliens 
locked in a railroad boxcar under the broiling desert sun says his 
survival has made him an outcast in his hometown because people 
blame him for the deaths 
among those bitter that miguel tostado rodriguez survived while 
18 others suffocated is the widow of mario garcia alvarez 
tostados best friend 
mario and miguel were like brothers yet i blame miguel for 
marios death i cant help it he is to blame rosa emma puga 
said 
we all wanted someone or something to blame for the tragedy 
miguel the united states the railroad la migra border patrol 
anything she said 
tostado said many others in his hometown of pabellon de arteaga 
in the central mexican state of aguascalientes are hostile 
i am being blamed by the families of the men who died they 
want to know why i survived and their loved ones didnt its not 
my fault i survived what really hurts is that they hate me for 
what happened tostado told the el paso times 
border patrol officials say tostado was not involved with the 
smuggler who locked the men in the boxcar but rumors persist in 
mexico that tostado was working with the man said tostados 
mother socorro tostado 
people were out to get my son even people he had known all 
his life they blame him for what happened she said some of 
the people told us they would not rest until they had avenged the 
death of their relative they said if they dont get miguel 
theyll get one of us 
tostado 22 was the only man found alive on july 2 1987 when 
border patrol agents at sierra blanca checked the boxcar 
the 19 men were seeking jobs in the united states the man who 
smuggled them across the border put them aboard a boxcar in el paso 
and closed and locked the door 
the train was supposed to go to fort worth but was held back at 
sierra blanca 90 miles east of el paso sitting on a siding for 
about 14 hours under the desert sun 
temperatures in the boxcar reached 130 degrees and 18 men 
suffocated tostado survived by punching a breathing hole in the 
floor with a railway spike 
tostado has special permission from the immigration and 
naturalization service to work in the united states and is free to 
travel back and forth to mexico 
he returned to his hometown on april 2 and met in the mayors 
office with the families of the six men from pabellon de arteaga 
who died tostado said he returned because he feared for his 
familys safety 
all i wanted was to see my family but i was being warned 
about the danger in going back mexican newspapers were saying i 
was responsible for the deaths but i had to confront the 
situation it was getting out of hand 
an el paso psychologist said the hatred toward tostado is not 
surprising 
in the us it would be considered a great accomplishment that 
tostado managed to survive said guido barrientos but in 
mexico the fact he is the only survivor is highly suspect why did 
he survive and not the others 
tostado said he doubts he will return to mexico again 
he is becoming comfortable in the united states hes learning 
english and he says he likes this country more than his native 
mexico 
the us is a lawabiding country tostado said i like 
the orderly way of life in the united states my country is too 
much in disarray everything is for the government nothing for the 
people 
i only hope the smuggler is caught one day because hes 
probably the only one who can vindicate me i would love to learn 
his whereabouts i know for sure however that one of these days 
he will be caught then we shall learn the entire truth 
then people will know im not to blame

about two dozen black ministers representing 
some of the citys largest churches have stepped up their criticism 
of city manager philip hawkey for firing a black community 
development department official 
the ministers said sunday they would file a lawsuit against the 
city in an attempt to suspend the citys share of us department 
of housing and urban development funds the suit also would draw 
attention to the unjust way blacks have been treated by the 
city they said 
we are unified as never before the rev floyd rose pastor 
of the family baptist church told about 350 people during a rally 
at the st paul baptist church 
he said civil rights leaders do not condone mismanagement but 
that bernard pete culp former renewal operations commissioner 
was not given a hearing to explain the problems in his department 
hawkey fired culp on friday claiming he was responsible for 
many of the housing programs deficiencies another black who was 
director of the community development department was demoted to 
special assistant 
the rev robert culp bernard culps brother told supporters 
the ministers lawyers would seek a preliminary injunction to shut 
down the citys community development department the shutdown 
would allow their lawyers to investigate how the citys has spent 
us department of housing and urban development funds since 1979 
we have been saying the problems are larger than the issue of 
community development it goes into serious questions about the way 
federal funds intended for minorites have been spent since 1979 
said the rev ronald barnett one of 13 civil rights leaders 
arrested last week after refusing to leave council chambers in 
protest of the suspensions 
barnett said the present city administration has turned a deaf 
ear when it comes to hiring and promoting minorities 
mayor donna owens said sunday she was concerned about the 
response to the firing by toledos black community and said she 
would try to set up a meeting with the black ministers this week 
a preliminary report released by the city friday concentrated on 
problems in the community development departments home ownership 
program which receives the bulk of its money from the department 
of housing and urban development 
the report contends there were irregularities in grants awarded 
to at least 50 people it also said grants were awarded to people 
who live outside the city and that the city lent 29000 to a man 
so he could buy a home from culps son william 
a yearlong investigation of the citys housing programs by hud 
revealed deficiencies that included doublebilling for some 
improvements and failure of houses to meet city codes after being 
rehabilitated

president reagan said today us warships will 
remain in the persian gulf in the wake of a us missile attack on 
an iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard 
we want peace in the gulf but we also want the right of 
navigation in international waters reagan told reporters upon 
his return to the white house from a weekend at camp david 
reagan said the downing of the plane was an understandable 
accident asked whether he was concerned about possible iranian 
retaliation for the attack he said you have to think about that 
knowing who they are 
rear adm william m fogarty and a team of us navy 
investigators started for the middle east today to piece together 
the facts behind the downing of the civilian aircraft 
meanwhile an iranian official said the action was an act of 
terrorism that demanded revenge 
mohammad jaafar mahallati iranian ambassador to the united 
nations said on the cbs this morning program that the downing 
of the jet was premeditated and he called it coldblooded 
murder 
by definition it was an act of terrorism that should be 
severely punished he said 
he added we will not put any limit on our act of 
selfdefense we will retaliate very strongly wherever we find 
american interests 
fogarty the head of the us team investigating the incident 
departed the united states this morning but details of his 
itinerary were not available said lt cmdr chris baumann a 
pentagon spokesman 
reagan promised a full investigation into stillunanswered 
questions about the persian gulf tragedy 
reagan who was scheduled to return to the white house today to 
wrap up his july 4th holiday issued a statement sunday afternoon 
saying our sympathy and condolences go out to the passengers 
crew and their families 
but he strongly defended the missile attack early sunday morning 
by the cruiser uss vincennes saying the approaching jetliner 
ignored warnings and the american ship followed standing orders 
and widely publicized procedures firing to protect itself against 
possible attack 
the incident immediately provoked comparisons to the soviet 
destruction of a korean air lines jetliner in 1983 an attack that 
killed 269 people and led reagan at the time to denounce the 
barbarity of the soviet government in shooting down an unarmed 
plane after it veered into soviet airspace 
adm william crowe the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
rejected such comparisons saying the iranian airliner was flying 
in a combat zone where iran itself wages war 
but numerous questions remain about how the mistake occurred 
including why the navys most sophisticated naval defense system 
did not distinguish the large airbus jetliner from irans much 
smaller usmade f14 attack fighters 
crowe said the aegis defense system cannot defy the laws of 
physics and that one of the most difficult problems is from a 
radar blip particularly from a headon target to identify the 
type of aircraft he also said the vincennes crew had only about 
four minutes to make a decision after picking up the approaching 
aircraft 
members of congress are scheduled to end their july 4th holiday 
on wednesday with the incident certain to renew debate over the 
reagan administrations policy of military deployment in the gulf 
a white house official asked whether the incident will force a 
reassessment responded there is no change in policy he 
refused to be identified by name 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said he would reserve judgment until receiving further 
information 
another member of the committee sen carl levin dmich said 
his initial impression was that us forces acted appropriately 
but he added i too have many unanswered questions 
democratic presidential nomineetobe michael dukakis home in 
brookline mass said plainly our armed forces have a right to 
defend themselves when attacked 
he said however the downing of the plane is further evidence 
that the war between iran and iraq must end we and the 
international community have a responsibility to stop it 
dukakis republican counterpart vice president george bush 
declined to comment sunday while vacationing at his summer home in 
kennebunkport maine 
the islamic republic news agency said the plane was on a routine 
150mile flight between irans coastal city of bandar abbas and 
dubai located across the strait of hormuz in the united arab 
emirates it said the airliner was hit by two us missiles and 
that all aboard were presumed dead 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus denounced the action as new 
evidence of american crimes and mischiefs 
crowe acknowledged the incident at a midday pentagon briefing on 
sunday hours after an erroneous initial pentagon report that the 
vincennes had shot down an iranian f14 while skirmishing with 
iranian gunboats 
iran air flight 655 was destroyed on the second of two days of 
fighting between iran and the united states on oil lanes through 
the strait of hormuz at the mouth of the persian gulf no american 
casualties were reported in the exchanges 
reagan who was informed of the developments while vacationing 
at his camp david md retreat said the defense department 
will conduct a full investigation 
while he defended the decision to fire on the airliner he 
called the outcome a terrible human tragedy 
at his briefing crowe said the two standard surfacetoair 
missiles were fired before the airliner was sighted but that 
eyewitnesses did see the craft disintegrate in midair about 
six miles from the vincennes 
crowe defended the vincennes commander capt will c rogers 
iii he said rogers believed his ship was in jeopardy and thought 
the incoming aircraft was an f14 the most lethal plane owned by 
iran 
in the aftermath of the iraqi attack on the uss stark in the 
gulf in may 1987 us military commanders in the region were 
placed under new rules of engagement requiring them to take faster 
defensive action when threatened 
crowe expressed deep regret over the loss of life but said 
rogers and other commanders in the area acted with good 
judgment because they believed american ships were being 
approached by a hostile aircraft 
the vincennes is a san diegobased 9600ton aegis class 
cruiser that has been on patrol in the strategic hormuz area for 
the past month under reagans policy of offering us protection 
to neutral shipping in the gulf it is equipped with an array of 
sophisticated radar and missiles including the sm2 standard a 
longrange antiaircraft weapon 
crowe said the aircraft approached the vincennes four or five 
miles outside a commercial corridor used by civilian craft in the 
area 
a us officer who just returned from six months in the gulf 
said however that commercial planes in the region have 
continued to fly as though they were oblivious to what was going 
on around them 
i dont think they got the word rear admiral rg zeller 
said in san diego 
crowe said the iranian airliner dropped in altitude and 
accelerated to about 450 knots as a warplane would do if preparing 
to fire an antiship missile 
those actions and electronic transmissions led us to believe 
it was a military aircraft he said 
before firing the missiles crowe said the us warship sent 
three warnings on a civilian distress network and four warnings on 
a military distress network 
the iranian aircraft neither answered nor changed its 
course he said

hollywood memorial park cemetery the final 
resting place of such stars as rudolph valentino and tyrone power 
has become an eyesore of overgrown grass and damaged mausoleums 
critics charge 
state officials say it has prompted more complaints in the past 
five years than any other california cemetery relatives of those 
buried at the 57acre memorial park complain of vandalism unkempt 
grounds and leaky mausoleum roofs 
weve averaged about six to eight letters per year and more 
phone calls than id care to recall said john gill executive 
secretary of the state cemetery board which oversees more than 200 
cemeteries 
last year heirs of makeup artist max factor who was entombed 
in 1938 transferred his remains and those of other relatives to 
another cemetery 
the cemetery founded in 1899 bears the remains of such stars 
as janet gaynor peter lorre tyrone power douglas fairbanks sr 
rudolph valentino and director cecil b demille among its 73000 
graves crypts and niches tourist maps point out the noted resting 
places 
by law cemeteries must invest some of their earnings in an 
endowment care fund and spend the interest for upkeep hollywood 
memorial had 143568 in interest last year according to cemetery 
board records 
but gill and others said even twice that much would be 
insufficient to restore the cemeterys former glamour 
lack of money is a universal problem among older cemeteries 
some just happen to be harder hit than others he said 
yet hollywood memorial remains profitable and has done its best 
to keep up appearances said principal owner jules f roth 
for someone buried here in 1901 5 went into a perpetual care 
fund roth said now you tell me how much income can you get 
from 5 but we still have to take care of that grave we do the 
best we can with what weve got 
in 1984 roth was called before the cemetery board to answer 
complaints about poor maintenance the board cannot impose 
sanctions however 
its a disgrace whats happened over there said minni 
schoenburg 70 whose parents are buried in the beth olam jewish 
section of the grounds 
eight years ago i was humiliated when we buried my mother and 
the grass was a foot high around the other graves she said 
the cemetery has faced other problems recently vandals have 
struck several times once overturning or desecrating 114 
tombstones in one night a stained glass window was taken from a 
mausoleum but later recovered and a womans head was taken from a 
crypt and found outside the cemetery two men were convicted of 
desecrating the remains 
yet for some the cemetery retains a special ambiance 
sure it may have seen better days but that antiquated kind 
of grownover feeling you get when you enter is what makes it a 
storybook kind of place said frank cooper who conducts an 
annual tour of the grounds for the art deco society

the man who trained dolphins for the television 
series flipper and tamed orca the killer whale is going to 
china to help save the rare chinese river dolphin from extinction 
the freshwater dolphins called baiji once flourished in 
chinas rivers and lakes but pollution and river traffic have 
reduced their numbers 
fewer than 300 are left in the yangtze river 
ric obarry 48 is leaving this month for a monthlong 
factfinding trip he says getting the chinese government to 
understand what it will take to save the baiji from extinction may 
be half the battle 
the chinese plan to build a seminatural preserve by closing off 
a loop of the river then obarry hopes to capture as many of the 
dolphins as possible and move them to the preserve 
they have to be taken to this place settle down fall in love 
and start making babies obarry said were talking about 
repopulating the species and that could take many years 
obarry said moving the dolphins could be as dangerous as 
leaving them in the river unless its done right 
keeping dolphins calm during jolting moves in trucks or 
helicopters is vital because they dont breathe automatically 
obarry said any time they want to end their life they simply 
dont take the next breath 
since marine mammal husbandry is practically an unknown field in 
china obarry also hopes to communicate his love for the playful 
dolphins to the chinese 
they need to be as careful as they can and build a beautiful 
spot for them to survive he said its the same problem they 
had with the panda until they got worldwide exposure no one knew 
about the problem 
obarry is borrowing 3000 from his sons college fund to make 
the trip and is looking for a corporate sponsor for the baiji 
project 
the chinese government is not putting much money into this 
obarry said not that they dont care theyre just overwhelmed 
by human problems 
chinese scientists have been studying several wounded baiji they 
nursed back to health in a tank but capturing and moving an entire 
population was beyond their expertise and their budget obarry 
said dr xhou kaiya dean of nanjing normal university contacted 
him in hopes of leading a worldwide effort to save the species 
as a trainer at miamis seaquarium in the 1960s obarry taught 
five dolphins to play the part of flipper on tv but to hear 
obarry tell it the dolphins were the ones training him 
dolphins are far more intelligent in our world than we are in 
theirs obarry said its taken about 25 years but i can see 
things from their point of view 
through the dolphin project obarry has spent years lobbying 
marine animal shows and other organizations to release captive 
dolphins into the wild he admits that his solution to the baijis 
predicament isolating them in a manmade preserve is sadly 
ironic 
its like the pandas he said the only ones to survive 
will be born in captivity its either that or let them become 
extinct

henry kissinger was shocked george bush had 
been a loyal soldier as chairman of the republican national 
committee in the aftermath of watergate and now in late 1974 
president ford was offering a choice of glittering rewards london 
or paris 
no thanks bush said how about the ambassadorship to china 
when henry heard id turned down the ambassadors posts in 
london and paris in order to go to beijing he was baffled bush 
wrote in his memoirs therell be some substantive work from time 
to time bush remembered kissinger as saying but for the most 
part youll be bored beyond belief 
kissinger may have been right according to bush and several 
people who worked with him those 13 months the us liaison 
mission in beijing was set up in the early 1970s to exist not to 
do anything in particular 
kissinger himself handled the tricky diplomacy there were few 
bilateral cultural military or economic ties and there wasnt much 
of a social whirl not at a time when chinese leaders were still 
wary of the west bushs predecessor david bruce rarely left the 
us compound 
boring or not the time bush spent in beijing and as us 
representative to the united nations from 1971 to 1973 gave him 
something rare on a presidential resume service as an ambassador 
only former president william howard taft came close with service 
as governor general of the philippines 
bush now set to become the republican presidential nominee 
became a member of the diplomatic set in 1970 after he lost a 
senate race in texas to democrat lloyd bentsen the consolation 
prize was an appointment to the united nations by president nixon 
who took a lot of heat for putting a diplomatic rookie like bush in 
the prestigious post 
the major controversy during bushs tenure was the fight over 
chinese membership in the world body 
kissinger and nixon eager to foster good relations with china 
without appearing to abandon longstanding allies in taiwan favored 
dual representation that would permit both chinas to stay 
bush lobbied for dual representation but on oct 25 1971 the 
proposal was defeated by the un general assembly and taiwan was 
expelled 
bush said later that when he left the united nations in january 
1973 to head the republican national committee he was more critical 
of the world body than he had been before having seen its flaws 
and limitations first hand 
in september 1974 bush his wife barbara and their newly 
acquired cocker spaniel c fred bush headed for beijing where 
they spent the next year and a month living in a walled compound 
guarded by greenuniformed soldiers of the peoples liberation army 
the pla guards were really there to keep an eye on us and to 
make sure no chinese people could get in to talk to us a member 
of bushs beijing staff said in a recent interview the diplomat 
who still works in the us government spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
i remember one time a us ambassador to another country came 
to visit and the guards wouldnt let the ambassadors wife into the 
compound because she was asian they wouldnt believe she wasnt a 
chinese citizen the diplomat said 
bush found out about it and went crazy he called up the 
foreign ministry and demanded an apology i think if he had an 
ak47 he would have gone down there and shot up the ministry it 
was the only time i saw him lose his temper 
according to the diplomat and others who worked on bushs staff 
including john holdridge the deputy chief of mission there was 
little contact between american diplomats in beijing and the 
chinese government 
for one thing it was not until the carter administration that 
full diplomatic relations were exchanged and in the waning days of 
mao tsetung chinese officials cautious about the succession were 
not eager to stick their necks out and become friendly with any 
western diplomats much less americans 
we were very much isolated said holdridge who later became 
ambassador to indonesia we tried to keep busy to make contacts 
and to carry on diplomacy but there was very little interraction 
with the chinese 
it was tough duty said peter bergin a member of the 
mission staff there really wasnt very much to do 
by all accounts bush spent much of the time improving his 
alreadygood tennis skills he played on courts at beijings 
international club with other diplomats and a club pro provided 
by the chinese government 
the envoy and his wife also spent hours cycling through the 
dusty and windy streets of beijing drawing stares from chinese 
citizens unaccustomed to westerners the sight of bushs dog was 
also a novelty in a country where canine was as common on a menu as 
on a leash 
bush used the time very wisely in a political sense the 
diplomat who spoke privately said in those days it was nearly 
impossible to get a visa to visit china but you could get around 
it by getting an invitation from the head of the liaison office 
bush used it like a political plum and there was a steady 
stream of important visitors from the states it was his way of 
keeping his hand in us politics 
bush wrote that one of the highlights of his tour was a meeting 
with mao who lived in seclusion and died the next year 
i am going to heaven soon bush quoted mao as saying i 
have already received an invitation from god 
bush soon got an invitation too ford asked him to run the 
central intelligence agency and his diplomatic career was over

when talk show host phil donahue razed an 
experimental allconcrete house recently the architect accused 
him of betraying his nickname mr sensitivity but donahue 
isnt the only one swinging the wrecking ball these days on 
connecticuts gold coast 
the rising value of land along this area of long island sound 45 
miles from new york city has encouraged property owners to tear 
down older buildings said lucinda mcweeney who is using a 25000 
federal grant to identify westports cultural resources buildings 
and sites 
within one recent twoweek period she said the town of about 
26000 received applications for the demolition of six buildings 
four of which are historically or architecturally significant 
were finding people who arent necessarily natives of 
westport but are interested in the economic value of property are 
tearing down what we feel are significant structures mcweeney 
said and its not just in westport its happening throughout 
fairfield county 
donahue raised the hackles of preservationists last month when 
he had the 26yearold house torn down designed by internationally 
known architect john m johansen the house was described by some 
as the towns most architecturally significant 
oak boards were used as forms in building the house so that the 
concrete walls had the texture of wood including knots the walls 
were extended above the flat roof some rooms were lined with 
silken wall coverings 
when he learned that the house had been razed johansen said 
this wasnt a very exemplary act from a public figure and 
theyve nicknamed him mr sensitivity 
donahue who bought the house and 72 acres of land around it 
for 68 million several months ago said he wanted more space 
privacy and security for his wife actress marlo thomas and their 
family 
he said the house which adjoined their property and had been 
vacant for some time had become a hostel for vagrants lovers 
and other strangers and denied that he wanted to improve the view 
of long island sound from his mansion donahue and miss thomas live 
in a 35 million tudorstyle home on 31 acres overlooking the 
sound 
mcweeney said westport which is also home to actor paul newman 
and his wife actress joanne woodward has changed drastically in 
the last 20 years 
it used to be a community of local artists and business men 
who commuted to new york now it has turned into an office park 
she said 
small local business cant afford to open here theyre 
closing schools because young families cant afford to live here 
mcweeney added 
her emphasis she said is on persuading developers to be 
sensitive to local concerns about preservation before undertaking a 
project 
they have individual property owner rights but we have visual 
rights she said 
there are some protections for older buildings in westport 
the town mcweeney said has two local historic districts which 
means the exteriors of the buildings in those areas are protected 
from change by state statute and three districts on the national 
register of historic places the historic districts include 
18thcentury and 19thcentury residential buildings some of which 
are are now used for commercial purposes 
in addition westport has a demolition delay ordinance which 
protects buildings older than 50 years and larger than 500 square 
feet from immediate demolition those buildings cant be razed for 
at least 90 days from the time of application 
will tressler a member of a citizens group in easton said that 
town also is encountering development done without regard for the 
character of the surroundings 
the citizens for easton organization he said is going to ask 
the town of about 6000 people about 8 miles northeast of westport 
to establish a design review board that would evaluate plans for 
new development in terms of its effect on the character of the 
surrounding area

the shuttle discovery made its 
longdelayed trip to the launch pad monday a milestone in the 
rebirth of americas space program that was hailed by workers who 
streamed by the pad in an 18milelong line of cars 
america the dream is still alive astronaut dave hilmers 
told an earlier crowd of 2000 space center employees who cheered 
as the 85ton spaceship rode a giant tracked transporter out of an 
assembly building into the glare of spotlights at 1250 am 
seven hours later discovery was perched on launch pad 39b to 
be readied for an early september liftoff the first since the 
challenger disaster 2 years ago 
then the space center gates were opened to permit engineers 
technicians managers secretaries and others here to bring their 
families out on the fourth of july holiday to view the spectacle 
security officials reported more than 4000 cars came through 
and at times the line stretched to 18 miles and the drive to the 
pad took nearly two hours but no one seemed to mind once they got 
there and viewed discovery standing majestically glistening in 
the blazing morning sun 
a large sign at the pad gate proclaimed americas pridethe 
journey continues 
as the cars drove by the pad they slowed and cameras protruded 
from windows and sunroofs many mostly children waved small 
american flags 
reporters asked the drivers how they felt about once again 
seeing a shuttle on the pad and the replies were unvarying in 
their enthusiasm wonderful its great were back in 
business very fourth of july 
two major hurdles remain before discovery can be certified to 
fly 
a 194second firing of the spaceships three main liquid fuel 
engines is set for july 24 with the shuttle locked firmly on the 
launch pad this will test scores of modifications made to the 
powerplant and will provide the launch team with valuable countdown 
practice 
the following day a final preflight firing of the shuttles 
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket is scheduled at the morton 
thiokol plant in utah 
a faulty booster rocket seal allowed flame to escape and trigger 
the explosion that doomed challenger and its sevenperson crew 73 
seconds after liftoff on jan 28 1986 
forrest s mccartney director of the kennedy space center 
presented hilmers one of discoverys five crewmen with a book 
containing the signatures of more than 15000 space center workers 
who have labored to return the shuttle to space 
hilmers said the discovery crew will carry the book into orbit 
and will return it to the workers 
you havent given this book this shuttle just to the five 
members of the crew he said indeed youve given it to all 
america 
it kind of brings tears to your eyes after so long a time of

hundreds of israeli 
arabs many dressed in white prayer robes crossed this israeli 
checkpoint into jordan on monday during the annual pilgrimage to 
mecca 
about 5000 moslems from israel will make the pilgrimage or 
hajj this month the highest number since 1977 when saudi 
arabia first permitted israeli arabs to visit mecca the holy city 
of islam in saudi arabia 
but the arab uprising has reduced the number of pilgrims from 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip to 1300 down 75 percent 
from last year palestinians blamed lower incomes following a rash 
of strikes and additional exit restrictions imposed by israel to 
quell the uprising in which 215 palestinians and four israelis 
have died 
it hurts my heart that so many of my brothers cannot go this 
year said ali mohammed jaber 35 from the israeli arab village 
of taibeh i will pray for them and for peace everywhere in the 
moslem world 
jaber dressed in a white robe and prayer cap spoke in the 
parking lot of the allenby bridge checkpoint where about 25 buses 
carrying pilgrims waited to make the crossing into jordan 
around him other whiterobed pilgrims stood amid their 
belongings to prepare for a last security check the parking lot 
was filled with suitcases bedrolls and plastic yellow shopping 
baskets filled with arab pita bread and olives 
in one corner of the lot israeli officials and arab dignitaries 
held a brief ceremony to send off the pilgrims 
zvulun orlev the directorgeneral of the religious affairs 
ministry cited israels religious tolerance and reminded the 
audience of religious persecution suffered by jews 
he also said this years pilgrimage was overshadowed by last 
years riots in mecca that demanded a high price in blood and 
desecrated the most sacred site of islam 
more than 400 people most of them iranians moslems were killed 
and hundreds injured in the clashes between iranian pilgrims and 
saudi security personnel the saudis accused the iranians of 
holding demonstrations including anti us protests in defiance 
of a ban on political activity 
in april saudi arabia broke off diplomatic relations with 
tehran citing terrorism and subversion 
im lucky i wasnt there last year said abed gunna 49 
from taibeh who is embarking on his third hajj but im not 
worried about my safety this time 
religious affairs ministry officials said three doctors were 
accompanying the pilgrims partly to ensure medical care in case of 
renewed clashes 
the israeli arab pilgrims leave for mecca during a threeday 
period ending wednesday and must return by early august 
according to the moslem lunar calendar the pilgrimage month is 
expected to begin july 14 the high point of the hajj should fall 
on july 22 
pilgrims must get special permits to pass through jordan both 
jordan and saudi arabia are technically at war with israel 
israeli officials barred pilgrims from returning with more than 
1200 to block the flow of funds that might be used to finance the 
nearly 7monthold uprising israel radio reported 
udi bahat a spokesman for the religious affairs ministry said 
the number of israeli arab pilgrims was up 20 percent from last 
year he cited as reasons for the increase the islamic revival in 
the middle east and the fact that israel this year reduced the 
minimum age for pilgrims from 35 to 30 
however under the age restrictions those between 16 and 36 who 
go to jordan are ordered to stay there for nine months before 
returning the measure was adopted several months ago to try to 
prevent messages from being passed to and from members of the 
palestine liberation organization

even before the united states downed an 
iranian airliner with a navy missile a number of nations in the 
mideast had stepped up efforts to strengthen their military might 
by obtaining longrange ballistic missiles according to a study 
done by the congressional research service 
the pace of ballistic missile proliferation has quickened 
considerably said sen daniel quayle rind who sought the 
study 
ballistic missiles are weapons that leave the earths atmosphere 
and then fall back they have longer ranges and capability to carry 
a much larger warhead than shortrange missiles like the one that 
felled the iranian airliner 
clearly these pose a threat to us and allied peace keeping 
efforts in the persian gulf the middle east and the far east 
said quayle 
the study did not address the problem of shortrange missiles 
which have also been proliferating particularly in the mideast it 
was a shortrange standard missile that was used by the navy to 
shoot down the iranian airbus early sunday 
the study noted that china has been aggressively exporting its 
missile technology particularly in the middle east 
until recently most nations in the area didnt have ballistic 
missiles israel already has in its arsenal the jericho i and 
jericho ii two mediumrange weapons 
but the study noted saudi arabia has agreed to purchase 
chinese east wind missiles a weapon with a 2700kilometer 
range that could be an eventual threat to israel the deal was kept 
from us intelligence agencies for two years until the weapons 
were installed 
a number of other countries in the region are also joining the 
ballistic missile club the crs said it cited egypt which is 
developing the 800kilometer range condor ii missile in conjunction 
with brazil and is also acquiring the modified scudb a 
sovietdeveloped missile also used by iraq and north korea egypt 
said the condor ii is needed to offset the israeli jericho 
a version of the scud is also being used by iran the study 
said both iran and iraq have fired scuds at each others capitals 
in the war of the cities that is part of the 8yearold 
iraniraq war 
in addition both nations have the chinesebuilt silkworm 
missiles which have a large warhead but which are not particularly 
accurate 
libya is also trying to develop missiles according to the 
study the regime of libyan leader moammar khadafy has offered 
brazil 2 billion to help develop a whole new family of short and 
mediumrange ballistic missiles and has also tried to buy the 
weapons from china in addition libyans are working on a 
homegrown missile with a 500kilometer range a test facility has 
been built in the desert near tauwiwa the crs said 
syria also may be near having a ballistic missile the study 
said the syrians reportedly are trying to buy chinas m9 a 
600kilometer weapon that would hit most points in israel the m9 
is being tested by the chinese and the deal is not yet final the 
study said 
in latin america argentina and brazil have both taken steps to 
upgrade their missile arsenals in the past year the crs said 
brazil besides discussing the development deal with libya is 
working on yet another variant of the scudb which would have a 
300mile range and is also working on the sonda iv that missile 
would give the brazilians the capability to launch their own space 
satellites by 1990 the study said 
argentina is working on the condor ii with the eygptians and 
also dealing with the chinese on a joint version of a 
1500kilometer range weapon 
the condor ii would have enough range to reach the falkland 
islands where there has been a large contingent of british troops 
ever since the 1982 war between the two nations over the remote 
territory argentina claims the islands which it calls the 
malvinas 
the crs review also noted that pakistan and india two longtime 
enemies have escalated their competition in the ballistic missile 
arena the two nations have fought three wars since the countries 
were created by the 1947 partitioning of the british colony 
india has successfully tested a 250kilometer missile the 
prithvi which is the countrys first ballistic missile designed 
solely for the military in addition the indians are nearing 
completion of an advanced space launch missile that would have an 
intercontinental range 
pakistan recently tested a missile with a range of up to 1000 
kilometers and the capability to carry a nuclear warhead the study 
said pakistan has denied that it is building atomic weapons but 
nuclear nonproliferation officials say the country is developing a 
nuclear capability

a group of 19 soviet missile 
specialists arrived monday to verify compliance with the superpower 
treaty scrapping intermediaterange nuclear missiles

last week while american inspectors went to the soviet union

of missile sites in west germany

with good wishes for americans on the fourth of july 
we congratulate you on the occasion of independence day

our team has arrived today to conduct inspection outlined by

relations between our countries 
he added that the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty would 
contribute to saving mankind from the nuclear holocaust 
alimenkov speaking to reporters at the us rheinmain air 
base did not specify where the soviet inspectors were heading in 
keeping with treaty regulations 
missile specialists according to the treaty are not allowed to 
identify inspection sites until four hours after their arrival 
said us navy capt james connell of the washingtonbased onsite 
inspection agency which was established to implement the 
inspection provisions of the treaty 
the soviets were welcomed by us air force col david williams 
and col onno oldig of the west german armed forces 
earlier the us european command in stuttgart said the soviets

the soviet union said monday the us navy was 
triggerhappy but most governments appeared to view the 
downing of an iranian jetliner as the kind of tragedy made 
inevitable by eight years of war between iran and iraq 
arab nations in the persian gulf renewed their call for an end 
to the conflict that has turned the entire waterway into a war zone 
javier perez de cuellar un secretarygeneral said the 
destruction of the jet sunday by the us guided missile cruiser 
vincennes appears to have been a tragic error all 290 people 
aboard were killed 
he asked for the greatest restraint in these difficult moments 
for the peace and security of the region his statement was read 
to reporters after perez de cuellar met in geneva with iranian 
ambassador sirous nasseri 
vatican radio called it an absurd tragedy in which innocent 
people paid the price of a neverending conflict that has already 
sowed so much death and destruction the possibility of tragic 
errors that add themselves to the destructive iniquities of war 
is particulary worrisome 
gennady gerasimov spokesman for the soviet foreign ministry 
said the incident shows american naval officers were not very 
competent or to use an american phrase triggerhappy 
he said it proved american actions in the region were dangerous 
and demanded us naval forces must immediately leave the waters 
of the persian gulf 
according to the us defense department the vincennes mistook 
the airbus for an iranian f14 fighter and the plane did not 
respond to radio warnings 
another soviet official said privately that the tragedy 
strengthened the soviet position that a unsponsored 
international peacekeeping force should replace us forces in the 
gulf 
britain france italy the netherlands belgium and the soviet 
union have warships and mine clearance units in and near the gulf 
the united states has deployed more than two dozen vessels in the 
largest national contingent 
citing the downing by soviet fighters sept 1 1983 of a south 
korean jetliner in which all 269 people aboard were killed 
gerasimov said the korean plane was over a strategically 
sensitive area of the soviet far east while the iranian jet was 
flying only over its own territory and territorial waters 
the soviet union denounces sundays attack but will not follow 
the bad example of wild american criticism after the event 
in 1983 he said 
kuwait which iran accuses of being iraqs ally in the war 
issued an urgent appeal for and end to the fighting and 
predicted more painful incidents if it continues 
abu dhabis official newspaper alittihad airbus passengers and 
crew were the victims of the 8yearold iraniraq war and said 
the disaster might be repeated 
gulf news an english language paper published in dubai the 
planes destination called the incident the worst ever in the 
region in recent times 
dubais other englishlanguage daily the khaleej times said 
why the plane was permitted to take off when there was a naval 
engagement in the area must remain a mystery and has yet to be 
fully explained how the americans failed to distinguish between an 
airbus and an f14 despite their sophisticated equipment is an 
equal mystery 
the vincennes had sunk two iranian attack boats and damaged a 
third just before the plane took off from bandar abbas iran on 
the short hop to dubai 
a qatar daily the gulf times said continuing of the conflict 
was senseless 
bahrains akhbar alkhaleej said editorially if there is a 
lesson to be gained from this tragedy it is that the gulf war must 
stop immediately 
greece put the onus on the united states but washingtons 
allies in europe generally used the occasion to call for an end to 
the iraniraq war which began in september 1980 
in athens government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said this 
tragic event is an international responsibility of the united 
states the parties involved must display above all calmness and 
selfrestraint only this way will it be posible to find the 
real reasons for the airliners downing and attribute 
responsibilities 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany said on 
a visit to seoul south korea this tragic event proves the 
necessity of all efforts to contribute to peace in the region by 
adhering to un security council resolution 598 which was 
adopted unanimously a year ago and calls for a ceasefire in the 
war 
britain has accepted the us explanation of the event italy 
said a special cabinet meeting will be held friday to discuss the 
persian gulf situation 
switzerland which handles us diplomatic interests in iran 
sent condolences to tehran but would not say whether it had 
forwarded a formal iranian protest to washington foreign ministry 
spokesman michel pache said switzerlands policy of providing good 
offices required discretion about its activities 
japan which gets slightly more than half its oil from the 
persian gulf appealed for an early and peaceful end to the war 
our country considers it extremely regrettable that 
valuable lives were lost and express our heartfelt condolences to 
the victims and their bereaved family members government 
spokesman keizo obuchi said

the head of the nations largest teacher 
union proposed today that each state name at least one school 
district a learning laboratory where teachers and others could 
freely experiment with reform 
such districts would have broad freedom to redefine not only 
what we teach but how we teach americas children said mary 
hatwood futrell president of the 19 million member national 
education association which is holding its annual convention here 
this week 
futrell proposed the learning laboratories idea which she 
called our most ambitious reform effort to date in her keynote 
address delivered t the conventions opening session 
the more than 8000 nea delegates meeting at the superdome were 
to vote on the proposal later today 
in an explanatory paper being distributed to delegates the 
union said among the reforms learning laboratory districts might 
devise include more flexible school scheduling partnerships with 
area colleges financing by means other than property tax and 
curricula managed by classroom teachers 
but futrell stressed that the reforms could take many different 
shape that change should not be dictated from outside the 
laboratory district but should be determined by local teachers 
school administrators parents businesses and others 
delegates of the rival american federation of teachers holding 
its annual meeting in san francisco endorsed a reform 
experimentation idea of its own on sunday the aft version would 
pave the way for experiments in a thousand or more districts where 
groups of six or more teachers would be free to operate schools 
within schools 
at a news conference prior to her speech futrell called the aft 
schools within schools proposal not a new idea and more 
narrow than what we have proposed 
she also revealed that she had presented democratic presidential 
hopeful michael dukakis with a list of four preferred running 
mates the rev jesse jackson tennessee sen al gore jr ohio 
sen john glenn and florida sen bob graham 
i believe any of the four would be very strong additions 
she told reporters 
aft delegates also supported a resolution calling for curbs on 
standardized testing of kindergarten children an idea that has 
caught on in minneapolis and georgia in recent years 
aft leaders were expecting a spirited debate today on the 
unions stand on bilingual education 
both unions seemed agreed that school reform dictated from 
onhigh by state governments had either failed outright or had gone 
as far as it could both argued that reform could only move forward 
if schools themselves and teachers in particular were free to 
initiate improvements 
despite the nea leaderships oftstated political 
openmindedness futrells keynote address was sharply partisan 
she repeatedly blasted the reagan administrations education and 
civil rights policies and praised democratic candidate michael 
dukakis 
the nation needs a president who will give us a fair deal 
instead of an arms deal a drug deal or an insider deal a 
president who will invest more to make every american child a star 
than he will to fill gods heaven with star wars she said 
at futrells urging the nea board of directors last week 
endorsed dukakis for the democratic nomination making it the first 
large union to do so this election year theoretically bush is 
still in the running for the unions backing for the november 
election after both parties meet this summer but the odds are 
minimal considering that fewer than 30 percent of nea members 
consider themselves republican 
the son of a teacher a teacher himself governor dukakis 
understands and embodies the link between education and the 
american dream futrell said 
the aft has said it will not endorse any candidates until after 
this summers political conventions

ron perlman who plays the beast vincent on 
televisions beauty and the beast says he has been amazed to 
find himself a sex symbol because of the role 
more than 95 percent of the people who write to me are 
women he said in an interview published in the july 9 issue of 
tv guide magazine their letters are filled with sexual 
fantasies 
the 37yearold actor whose halfman halfbeast characters 
love affair with catherine chandler linda hamilton is 
unconsummated in the show has received up to nine letters from one 
viewer 
women say that vincent is the ultimate fantasy lover someone 
who asks nothing in return but gives 110 percent perlman said 
he evokes deep unconscious feelings of longing for a connection 
to someone who understands things on a very emotional level 
perlman said at first he didnt want the role because he had 
been hidden behind makeup in previous roles including salvatore 
the hunchback in the name of the rose and a prehistoric man in 
quest for fire 
but vincent whose fangs and lionlike appearance belie his 
soothing voice is so romantic and heroic and poetic its like 
playing hamlet every week perlman said this may just be the 
greatest role of my life 
perlman who is married to fashion designer opal stone and has a 
4yearold daughter blake amanda studied acting at lehman college 
in new york city and the university of minnesota he performed in 
plays by shakespeare chekhov and pinter with the classic stage 
company in new york and in 1976 was picked to star in a 
twocharacter play the architect and the emperor of assyria 
directed by tom ohorgan 
his artistic success did not mean he was living well 
i was one of these actors who landed wonderfully artistic 
projects once a year and then just sat around because nobody ever 
thought of me as a commercial property perlman said i never 
did soaps i never did commercials i tried but i never did the 
things actors do while they are waiting for the good stuff i only 
did the good stuff 
for perlman quest for fire seemed like an opportunity to 
achieve commercial success as well but after that role no offers 
came 
perlman withdrew from acting and went through what he recalls as 
a purging of his depression 
it was like an incredible dividing line between my childhood 
and my adult life he said 
now that he is receiving attention as vincent perlman said he 
feels as if his career is actually beginning

president reagan says that unlike other soviet 
leaders hes met with mikhail gorbachev you dont get any 
feeling of cunning 
he is himself no imitation of anyone that ive ever known 
the president said in the august issue of life magazine hes 
straightforward 
reagan said the one question he did not get to ask during the 
moscow summit was whether gorbachev believes in god 
i had that curiosity for a time because i was so surprised at 
his use of the name god and i couldnt figure how i could really 
get into a oneonone conversation with him knowing where atheism 
stands in their country 
the president said he never got the opportunity to ask but a 
soviet interpreter said that gorbachevs usage of god was 
commonplace it was just a form of expression god with a small 
g 
asked if one has to believe in god in order to be an ethical 
person reagan said i dont know how people who dont believe 
set their rules of conduct 
im sure there are people who are atheists who at the same 
time abide by the general rules of conduct that we all believe 
in he said

three years after a spate of murderous 
bedroom attacks terrorized californians the night stalker case 
has cost los angeles county more than 1 million and the defendant 
still has not come to trial 
last thursday the fourth start date for the trial of richard 
ramirez had to be abandoned when defense attorneys who had 
promised to be ready challenged the judge for bias 
the prosecutor awaiting a ruling on the lastminute defense 
motion to remove the judge says this is the last gasp of delay 
he can envision 
i have high hopes said deputy district attorney p philip 
halpin the issue is straightforward it should be decided by the 
time we come back to court on july 7 
he said the trial could start immediately after that but even 
if it does begin in july both sides have estimated that jury 
selection could take up to eight months 
two defense lawyers who have been berated by the judge and by 
halpin for being dilatory and unprepared arent saying what their 
next move will be arturo and daniel hernandez who are not 
related did not return repeated calls to their san jose offices 
last week 
meanwhile the legal clock is ticking the defense in promising 
to be ready for trial june 30 did not waive ramirez right to a 
speedy trial within 10 days of that date 
we intend to start the trial by the 10th of july said 
halpin 
but halpin acknowledged that technically the 10day limit dates 
from the time the motion is resolved and the defense could still 
choose to waive the time limit if the trial must be delayed again 
the county has spent 128 million on court and investigatory 
fees according to the county auditorcontrollers office that 
does not include 15000 a month for ramirez private jail cell 
halpin has worried aloud that witnesses who have waited three 
years to testify may become reluctant to relive now distant 
memories of nightmarish events if the case is postponed yet again 
ramirez 28 a drifter from el paso texas is charged in los 
angeles county with 13 counts of murder and 31 other felonies 
allegedly committed during a string of nighttime assaults in the 
summer of 1985 
attacks also took place from mission viejo in orange county to 
the lake merced district of san francisco 
the socalled night stalker generally entered homes through 
unlocked doors and left pentagrams a symbol often associated with 
devil worship scrawled at some crime scenes and on some victims 
ramirez shouted hail satan and flashed a pentagram drawn on 
his hand during an early court appearance 
in their challenge to the judge the hernandezes said superior 
court judge michael tynan showed that he believed ramirez was a 
satanist when he asked if the defendant wished to swear to god or 
would rather affirm before testifying at pretrial proceedings 
the lawyers also say tynan called them a security risk during a 
chambers conference 
although the defense would have wished that the judge had been 
able to overcome his bias and tendencies toward prejudice it has 
become increasingly obvious that judge tynan cannot do this the 
defense team said in an affidavit 
when the hernandezes were hired in late 1985 municipal court 
judge elva soper advised ramirez that his counsel did not meet the 
courts standards for appointment because they had never tried a 
death penalty case before 
arturo hernandez had practiced for two years and daniel 
hernandez for three years their opponent halpin has been a 
prosecutor for 23 years and handled many capital cases 
at one point tynan assigned a lawyer to assist the two novice 
defense attorneys in completing their pretrial motions but trial 
dates of sept 30 feb 1 and march 22 had to be postponed one 
delay was due to an appellate court ruling giving the defense 
access to massive police records which had to be compiled for them 
weve been delayed too long halpin said after a brief 
hearing thursday this is about the last gasp were ready to 
go

the ruling institutional revolutionary party 
which has dominated mexican politics for almost 60 years faces a 
tough test wednesday in which its credibility is at stake 
few doubt that the the pri will win in the july 6 presidential 
elections 
the question is whether this party which has monopolized past 
contests will emerge with a landslide victory or clinch barely 
enough votes to continue its mandate 
the pri has defied political logic by never losing a 
presidential election or gubernatorial race in any of mexicos 31 
states since it was founded in 1929 but it also has been accused 
of stuffing ballot boxes to give itself almost incredible 
victories with anywhere from 74 to 95 percent of the vote 
this time party officials privately admit that they would be 
satisfied with 50 percent of the vote 
the pri is under pressure both from its members and the 
opposition to change the system that has kept many poor mexicans 
politically passive although it has pushed the economy to grow 
but many mexicans were angered by the economic crises of the 
1970s and early 1980s which they believe were brought on by the 
partys inept administration reckless borrowing and brazen 
corruption 
as a result president miguel de la madrid has spent his six 
years in office trying to control inflation and a foreign debt now 
exceeding 100 billion and to push up the mexican peso whose 
value dropped from 23 to the dollar in 1980 to 2300 to the dollar 
this week 
de la madrid has managed to pull inflation down to 36 percent 
for the first five months of this year compared to a record 159 
percent in 1987 
neverthless his party is virtually under political siege 
the erosion discredit and lack of credibility of the 
political system is such that even if it wins the elections its 
capacity to govern will depend on how it wins wrote political 
analyst jorge castaneda 
carlos salinas de gortari a certain winner as the presidential 
candidate of the pri is a harvardeducated economist who sounds 
like a reformist pointing out the vices of the system once 
elected de gortaris term will last until 1994 
 
in his campaign de gortari speaks of the need to democratize a 
system his party has run since 1929 and to admit what he calls 
our defeats at the polls 
we are going to lead the democratic reform that the nation 
demands he said recently in a speech 
the balding mustachioed de gortari presents himself as part of 
a more dynamic generation of pri leaders 
but manuel j clouthier the second major presidential candidate 
and a member of the rightist national action party blames the pri 
for mexicos economic problems and hammers away at corruption in 
the administration 
clouthier a bearded businessman from the northwestern coastal 
state of sinalosa is demanding changes in the name of the middle 
class 
the group in power since 1929 has failed and has lost its 
opportunity clouthier says they cant present themselves as 
the saviors of today they are the same people who have brought us 
to the situation in which we find ourselves 
cuauhtemoc cardenas a dissident who broke with the pri last 
year is the third major presidential candidate and represents the 
national democratic front an alliance of disaffected leftist 
groups a former governor of the central state of michoacan 
cardenas unsuccessfully tried to reform the pri before abandoning 
it

a judge will hold a hearing tuesday to set 
conditions for releasing two tuscarora indians who have been held 
without bond for five months since a newspaper office takeover 
defense attorney william kunstler said monday 
we tried to get them out today monday kunstler said in a 
telephone interview from new york we thought independence day 
would be a great day for them to come out 
but the hearing could not be scheduled until tuesday at the 
federal courthouse in new bern because of the holiday kunstler 
said 
eddie hatcher 30 and timothy jacobs 19 are set to go to 
trial july 11 on federal charges of hostagetaking and 
manufacturing illegal firearms the two are charged with holding up 
to 20 people hostage feb 1 at the robesonian newspaper office in 
lumberton in robeson county near the south carolina line 
they are being held at the craven county jail in new bern 120 
miles east of lumberton 
conditions of release were discussed monday during a conference 
call that involved kunstler and bob warren a defense attorney from 
the christic institute south in carrboro nc the us attorneys 
office in north carolina and us district court judge terence 
boyle kunstler said 
they will be released he said the circuit court has 
ordered it 
the terms of release discussed in the conference call include 
that the two stay out of robeson county that they live with 
friends or relatives and that they not violate any aspect of the 
law even though they may consider it symbolic free speech kunstler 
said 
these are the conditions we proposed to the judge months 
ago he said they are our conditions 
assistant us attorney john stuart bruce would not comment on 
the conference call which kunstler said came after the 4th us 
court of appeals ruled thursday that a federal magistrate failed to 
hold a detention hearing within the required five days 
kunstler said he received a copy of the opinion saturday the 
appeals court in richmond va was closed for the holiday weekend 
and the ruling could not be independently confirmed 
the court of appeals minced no words in its opinion he said 
monday adding that the court called the detention a flat 
violation of the time requirements 
the two men had gone before magistrate wallace dixon on feb 2 
but didnt have their detention hearing until feb 17 at that 
time dixon ordered them held without bond boyle upheld the 
decision at a hearing in april 
kunstler said dixon contends the two indians waived their 
detention hearing saying they were afraid to be released but 
kunstler said defendants cannot legally waive their own hearing 
although the trial is scheduled to begin july 11 kunstler said 
there probably will be a continuance he also said he would try to 
have the trial held in the fayetteville division court which 
includes robeson county

when three teenagers were negotiating to 
buy 13 miles of abandoned rail lines they had to send an adult 
member of their board to represent them 
all the adults said this cannot be done said coowner 
jeffrey dobek we as naive teenagers said why cant it be 
done and kept working 
today dobek dale pape and john shaw say their southern 
michigan railroad society inc is chugging along swell the trio 
all 23 and college students lined up support in august 1982 from 
state and local politicians and both of michigans us senators to 
buy the lines from conrail 
in 1984 they struck a deal for 100000 to buy the lines 
volunteers helped them restore the track and rail cars 
the society operates tourist trains on weekends that travel a 
4mile route between clinton and tecumseh in the autumn the 
railroad offers a 9mile leafpeeking tour 
dobek said at first conrail didnt know it was negotiating with 
teenagers 
we didnt tell them he said we did everything by mail 
when we had a meeting we sent one of our adult board members 
when conrail officials learned the potential buyers were high 
school students they were skeptical that the teenagers could 
raise the money to buy the abandoned track dobek said 
but the youths who studied tourist trains in other parts of the 
country convinced conrail the debt could be paid off through 
society membership donations and ticket revenues so far thats 
exactly what has happened

us commanders in the persian gulf are 
operating under hairtrigger rules of engagement designed to 
prevent unexpected attacks on american warships such the one on 
the uss stark last year that killed 37 servicemen 
the number one obligation of the commanding officer of a ship 
or units is the protection of his own people said the chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff adm william crowe defending the 
navy against charges that the uss vincennes overreacted sunday when 
it shot down an iranian jetliner carring 290 people 
the imperative for selfdefense combined with the cramped 
quarters in the gulf the introduction there of advanced weapons 
that allow adversaries to kill quickly from a great distance and 
the large number of onagain offagain combatants have produced 
an explosive situation 
pentagon officials refuse to spell out publicly the rules of 
engagement the standing orders under which commanders are 
authorized to open fire whatever they are the commander of the 
vincennes apparently is convinced he followed them 
pentagon sources who spoke on condition they not be further 
identified said monday that the commander capt will c rogers 
iii had sent a message to his superiors stressing that he had 
followed procedures and would make the same decisions if faced 
again with the situation 
the sources were unable to provide quotes from the 
communication which they described as secret 
despite official silence events and statements over the past 14 
months have given a fairly detailed picture of when american forces 
will shoot 
we can go on what is known as hostile intent that is to say 
if a fellow has a weapons system aimed at us and we have a pretty 
high assurance that he going to shoot at us we can take it out 
the commander of us forces in the region marine corps gen 
george b crist told reporters last thursday 
crowe said us commanders do not have to be shot at before 
responding a condition that was made known in the form of a 
notice to airmen or notam to all nations and parties involved in 
the gulf including commercial air air carriers operating there 
rogers said in an interview before sailing his ship to the 
persian gulf that there is a very clearcut set of engagement 
rules which we go by and were certainly not there to initiate 
hostilities 
since the us navy increased its presence in the persian gulf 
in the spring of 1987 and began to escort reflagged kuwaiti 
tankers last summer crowe said we are of course constantly 
surveying and reviewing not only the circumstances under which we 
operate but also the rules of engagement 
we do not discuss the rules in detail he told reporters 
sunday after the airliner was shot down but this obviously will 
put increased emphasis on such a review 
until sunday the greatest loss of life in a single incident 
involving the us navy in the gulf came from what was later 
described as a mistaken attack by an iraqi fighter which fired two 
exocet missiles into the unsuspecting cruiser uss stark on may 17 
1987 
the explosions and fire killed 37 american seaman and ended the 
careers of the starks commander capt glenn r brindel and other 
senior officers who were severely criticized and forced to retire 
on sunday one of those chastised officers defended rogers 
saying the vincennes had no choice but to fend off what appeared to 
be a attacking warplane 
if the plane was unfortunate enough to be flying toward the 
vincennes while the vincennes was engaging iranian patrol boats 
im not surprised this kind of thing would happen said basil e 
moncrief 
according to the pentagon account rogers followed what appeared 
to be carefully laid out procedures the sophisticated aegis radar 
and tracking system aboard the vincennes one of the most advanced 
ships in the navy detected an aircraft approaching from iranian 
airspace at 1047 am local time 247 edt officials said 
at the time the vincennes was exchanging fire with three 
iranian boghammer gunboats 43footlong vessels that iran has used 
to attack tankers they said 
one of the most difficult problems is from a radar blip 
particularly from a headon target to identify the type of 
aircraft said crowe 
if the vincennes had a side view of the plane or had more time 
it might not have mistaken the airbus which is 177 feet long for 
an f14 which is 62 feet long pentagon officials said 
the vincennes broadcast three warnings on a civilian emergency 
network which airliners normally monitor and four warnings on a 
frequency normally monitored by warplanes crowe said 
additionally he said the ship intercepted and analyzed 
electronic indications which the admiral declined to discuss in 
detail 
the approaching aircraft appeared to descend and accelerate as 
would a warplane preparing to launch an antiship missile and was 
declared hostile four minutes after it was spotted by radar he 
said three minutes later when the plane was about nine miles from 
the vincennes the american warship fired the first visual 
sighting of the plane came with the impact of at least one of the 
missiles when the aircraft was about six miles from the vincennes 
said crowe 
crist indicated to reporters last week that the rules of 
engagement varied depending on the threat and that the biggest 
threats were perceived to be antiship missiles such as the 
chinesemade silkworm 
use of a weapon like the silkworm he suggested would call for 
destruction not only of the missile but the battery that fired it 
if they fire a silkworm at me we can go get them he said 
but in recent months the iranians have avoided attacking us 
forces making it doubly hard for american commanders to guess 
whether they may be about to face hostile fire 
they have been most circumspect said crist theyve been 
very careful not to antagonize us we had an iranian f4 come out 
the other day and our ships challenged him and he said im 
on my way to engage an iraqi

vice president george bush on monday 
voiced regret over the accidental destruction of an iranian 
jetliner by a us warship but said the tragic incident would not 
alter us policy in the persian gulf 
my respects to families and loved ones of those who lost 
lives but life goes on our mission goes on and the world keeps 
turning bush said as he campaigned through the midwest 
the allbutcertain republican nominee echoed the views of 
president reagan who said us warships will remain in the gulf in 
the wake of sundays us missile attack on an iran air airbus with 
290 people aboard 
we want peace in the gulf but we also want the right of 
navigation in international waters reagan told reporters upon 
his return to the white house from a weekend at camp david 
the vice president who broke his silence on the incident said 
he would just reject the comparison to the soviet unions 
destruction of a korean airliner that strayed into soviet airspace 
in 1983 
this plane was warned this was flying in a combat zone 
bush said he claimed the two episodes were totally separate 
totally different 
bush also said he would not suspend his presidential campaigning 
because of the gulf tragedy telling reporters there is nothing 
i can be doing about this matter in washington dc 
however the vice president planned to return to washington late 
monday after participating in independence day festivities in 
wyandotte a detroit suburb and in two other midwestern cities 
aides said bush had been in telephone contact with military 
advisers and would attend a white house briefing on tuesday 
bush learned of the attack sunday morning while attending church 
services in kennebunkport maine the seacoast town where he has a 
vacation home he later participated in a conference call with 
reagan and senior white house officials said craig fuller bushs 
chief of staff 
bush told reporters at detroit international airport he was 
saddened by sundays events 
obviously as we celebrate our great national holiday our 
hearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who were lost 
and also hearts go out to those kids those young americans who 
are defending freedom half way around the world he said 
en route to a fourth of july parade in this detroit suburb bush 
adhered closely to the reagan administrations support for the 
captain of the uss vincennes and said he thinks most americans 
share his feelings 
it appears the captain of that ship followed the rules and did 
what he had to do protect american life bush said 
questioned as to why the warships sophisticated radar equipment 
could not distinguish between the widebodied airliner and the 
smaller f14 fighter bush a world war ii pilot responded 
testily ever been in combat combat is quite different than the 
laboratory 
and asked about iranian threats of retaliation bush said 
from time to time iran makes such threats but our people are 
alert we cant be deterred by threats 
the republican candidate said he didnt think the episode would 
figure in the presidential race saying americans are together 
on this 
he also said there was no reason to halt campaign activity 
because of the tragedy this is a national holiday it is 
appropriate that we celebrate it he said 
the vice president said he did not think the downing of the 
commercial airliner is more significant than other incidents but 
it is significant bush cited the loss of us servicemen aboard 
the uss stark which was hit by an iraqi missile on may 17 1987 
as a significant incident in the gulf 
bush was also scheduled to participate in an independence day 
celebration in elmwood ill a chicago suburb and attend a rally 
for new us citizens and watch an airshow in st louis

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini reads the 
koran islams holy book seven times a day takes the radio with 
him to the bathroom to keep up with the news and is an obsessive 
clock watcher his daughter zahra says 
in a talk earlier this month to students at roshd high school in 
tehran she gave an insight into the home life of irans 
revolutionary patriarch 
his selfdiscipline is unbelievable you wouldnt believe it 
unless you saw it for yourself she told the children 
the talk was published in the islamic revolution martyr 
foundations magazine and reprinted in an unofficial 
englishlanguage newsletter received recently in nicosia 
khomeinis daughter whose married name is mostafavi made no 
mention of the 82yearold leaders health reported to be 
deteriorating 
mrs mostafavi 49 painted a portrait of a loving if 
demanding father who used to take his family on summer vacations 
in the mountains before he became a revolutionary leader banished 
into exile by the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
thats a far cry from his public image of the stern unsmiling 
zealot whose fundamentalist moslem revolution eliminated former 
allies and brought iran into a seemingly endless war with iraq 
mrs mostafavi was quoted as saying her father observes a strict 
schedule at his home in the north tehran suburb of jamaran and 
becomes so engrossed in his studies of the koran or affairs of 
state that he sometimes doesnt talk for hours 
hes so punctual that if he doesnt turn up for lunch at 
exactly 120 pm everyone gets worried she said he 
regulates his day in such a way that he turns up for lunch at 
exactly that time 
she said to him such things as i sleep whenever i like or 
i feel like going to sleep are meaningless he eats exactly on 
time he wakes up exactly on time he goes to bed exactly on time 
mrs mostafavi noted he goes walking three times a day each 
time for exactly 20 minutes when he gets back he looks at his 
watch to see if its been 20 minutes 
if its not he turns around and takes a few more steps just 
to make everything complete 
she said that khomeini engrossed in some activity or other 
sometimes wont even talk to her when she goes to his study 
just because im his daughter doesnt mean that we have a 
conversation each time she said i go into the room and say 
hello and just sit there because hes either listening to the radio 
or watching television or reading letters and reports 
hes not free even for a minute even in the bathroom he has 
the radio with him 
she said khomeinis income includes taaroufi or personal 
gifts from wellwishers and admirers to show their respect for his 
religious standing 
she said these gifts include some money or gold which he 
sometimes spends on home expenses 
mrs mostafavi said her fathers income is a lot he usually 
received a lot of gold but he spends moderately he leads a 
simple life 
referring to khomeinis religious devotion she said he reads 
the koran seven times a day at special times there are also prayer 
books he reads and he doesnt care whos there 
diplomats who have visited khomeini at home said he regularly 
listens to the british broadcasting corporations persian service 
a habit that dates back to his exile in iraq from 1963 to 1978 
khomeini was expelled from iraq in 1978 and went to france he 
lived in paris for four months before returning to iran in 1979 
when his islamic revolution toppled the shah 
the visitors said khomeini often wears a small transistor radio 
on a cord around his neck he also is reported to be a fan of 
mickey mouse and often watches cartoons on a videocassete recorder 
mrs mostafavi is one of khomeinis three daughters his son 
ahmed 48 is one of his closest advisers and carefully screens the 
hundreds of people who want to visit him every day 
diplomats who have been based in tehran said ahmed only allows 
two or three people to see his father every day usually at 
breakfast or lunch so as not to tire him 
another son mustafa died in iraq during khomeinis exile there 
khomeini married khanom batool saqafi in the iranian holy city 
of qom when he was a 29yearold theology student and she was a 
teenager mrs mostafavi said her mother who is rarely seen in 
public is very sedate and cool she went with him everwhere in 
all that time she has never complained or grouched 
despite his unyielding religious and political beliefs mrs 
mostafavi said khomeini is very easy with his children he has 14 
grandchildren and a greatgrandchild now he allows the children a 
large degree of freedom 
he doesnt preach to the grownups that they should do this or 
that he sets examples by his actions but he gets very angry at 
the slightest act forbidden by religion 
he tells us not to waste things once i cooked him something 
and burned it i put it in front of him but he didnt eat it 
he said it was bad i asked jokingly but you shouldnt be 
ungrateful for the blessing of god 
he anwered back is it me who is ungrateful or is it you who 
have done such a thing to gods blessing 
hes somewhat formal with people other than his family but 
hes very kind to his family 
khomeini returned to tehran feb 1 1979 from exile in paris to 
a tumultuous welcome after more than 14 years in exile 
ten days later when the revolutionaries took over the symbols 
of government the shahs palace state buildings and army 
barracks mrs mostafavi said she was with khomeini listening to 
the radio 
suddenly he jumped up and said its over its over she 
said 
the radio and television station had been seized i realized 
that meant the fall of the regime ive never seen such joy on his 
face as i did then she said

bethlehem and the army slapped a threeday closure order on all 
west bank schools 
troops in this biblical town fired tear gas and dozens of 
students were overcome by the gas hospital officials said 
foreign minister shimon peres meanwhile announced the nearly 
7monthold arab uprising in the occupied territories had cost the 
defense ministry 162 million and israels economy was in danger if 
the rebellion continued israel radio said 
the radio reported scattered incidents of stone throwing in the 
west bank and arab east jerusalem where arab protesters briefly 
erected a roadblock on the main commercial thoroughfare 
police arrested five palestinian schoolgirls for allegedly 
stoning israeli cars near the east jerusalem neighborhood of 
silwan the radio said 
releasing new figures on incidents of unrest inside israel 
police commissioner david krauss said arab nationalists were 
responsible for 114 out of 210 forest and pasture arsons 
krauss said more than 1000 protests broke out inside israel in 
the last three months including 730 demonstrations in the 
jerusalem area and 51 firebomb attacks 
he said 900 arabs had been arrested on a variety of charges 
including 55 suspected of arson 
in bethlehem five miles south of jerusalem hundreds of 
students demonstrated on the main road hurling stones at troops 
who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets 
in an effort to limit student participation in the uprising the 
army announced it would close all palestinian schools in the west 
bank for three days starting tuesday 
the move was timed to coincide with a plo call to rename all 
arab schools with more nationalistic names on that day said brig 
gen shaike erez head of israels military administration in the 
west bank 
the order was the first west bankwide shutdown of arab schools 
since the areas 800 schools were reopened on june 6 after a 
fourmonth closure 
at the height of the uprising in february the army closed 1200 
schools attended by 475000 students in the west bank and gaza 
strip 
erez said he hoped closing schools again would bring home to 
students and parents that the current level of disturbances is 
unacceptable 
but bethlehem high school senior adnan mohammed blamed the army 
presence in the territories for the student protests and said they 
would continue as long as israeli occupation continued 
there is no atmosphere to study with soldiers at the entrance 
to schools mohammed said adding that only 19 of the 30 students 
in his class showed up for studies 
where are the others one was shot and killed during the 
uprising four are in jail and the other six are under curfew in 
the deheishe refugee camp nobody is in the mood to study 
mohammed said 
history teacher hisham mughrabi said students were commited to 
calls by underground leaders to hold protests and would not heed 
admonishments from school adminstrators not to demonstrate 
it used to be the teacher got respect but thats all changed 
if we tell them not to demonstrate they say its the leaderships 
order we cant argue with them mughrabi said 
an associated press reporter saw one bethlehem school that was 
renamed intefadeh or arabic for uprising apparently in 
compliance with the call to give schools more nationalistic names

fighting between rival palestinian 
guerrilla groups monday killed 24 people as artillery shells 
pulverized the bourj elbarajneh refugee camp according to police 
they said 67 others were wounded in the battle between col 
saeed mousas syrianbacked fatahuprising and fatah guerrillas 
loyal to yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization 
that raised the known casualty toll since fighting broke out may 
1 to at least 151 killed and 594 wounded 
bodies littered the terrain along the camps edges as the two 
warring factions launched a series of attacks and counterattacks 
witnesses said 
the shelling is the worst weve had in years said a woman 
who took advantage of an afternoon lull in the bombardment to flee 
bourj elbarajneh 
sultan abulainen fatahs commander in bourj elbarajneh said 
25 people most of them women and children were wounded when a 
160mm mortar slammed into entrance of a bomb shelter 
police said they were among the 67 wounded in todays fighting 
the fighting shattered a weeklong lull in the interpalestinian 
war for control of the beirut camps 
mousas fighters overran the nearby chatilla camp june 27 and 
had vowed to move into bourj elbarajneh in an attempt to crush 
arafats forces in the lebanese capital 
at times shells and rockets rained at a rate of 20 a minute on 
the sprawling shantytown on beiruts southern outskirts police 
said 
they said the fighting forced the closing of the beirut airport 
highway which abuts bourj elbarajneh flight schedules were not 
affected and travelers got to the airport through sidestreets 
columns of black smoke billowed from the camp mousas gunners 
deployed in syriancontrolled hills overlooking beirut hammered 
the camp with 120mm and 160mm mortars rockets and 106mm recoilless 
guns police reported 
they said fatah guerrillas responded with 62mm mortars and 
rocketpropelled grenades 
abulainen fatahs commander said his men repulsed 13 attempts 
by the dissident fighters to push into the camp in a fierce 
eighthour confrontation 
abulainen reached by telephone in bourj elbarajneh said at 
least five corpses of the attackers lay on the battlefield the 
dissidents could not evacuate them due to the intensity of the 
fighting 
the fall of chatilla was a serious setback for arafat who has 
called on arab leaders to help end the fighting abulainen said 
his fighters are determined to defend bourj elbarajneh to the 
last man 
we warn these collaborators that bourj elbarajneh will not 
face the same fate as chatilla he said 
fatah the largest group of arafats palestine liberation 
organization dislodged mousas followers from bourj elbarajneh 
and the nearby chatilla refugee camp in fighting over the past two 
months 
the dissidents regrouped along the edges of the camps and 
overran chatilla after a 13hour battle that demolished the 
shantytown and displaced hundreds of refugees 
libyan mediators supervised the evacuation of about 150 arafat 
loyalists from chatilla to fatah bases the port city of sidon 25 
miles south of beirut 
fatah and other plo officials said 80 percent of bourj 
elbarajneh has been knocked down in bombardments in the past 60 
days only 3000 of 20000 residents remain in the camp 
scores of civilians fled the camp during the weeklong lull in 
fighting after chatilla fell 
the camps have been largely devastated by fighting that began 
when israel invaded lebanon in 1982 besieged west beirut and 
hammered the shantytowns with air raids and shellfire for months 
syrianbacked lebanese shiite moslems besieged the beirut camps 
in 1985 pounding them for more than two years in a failed attempt 
to prevent arafat from rebuilding the power base he lost when 
israel drove the plo out of beirut in 1982 
mousa who has vowed to chase the plo out of lebanon again 
broke away from the organization in 1983 the syrian government 
backed the mutiny by radicals opposed to arafat and mousa set up 
his headquarters in the syrian capital of damascus 
the beirut fighting has flared despite a reconciliation between 
arafat and syrian president hafez assad in damascus in april to end 
their 5yearold feud but since the fighting erupted arafat has 
accused the syrian government of fomenting the battle in order to 
assert its control over all of beirut

the soviet union on monday offered an amnesty to 
soldiers who turned against their country during the red armys 
8year intervention in afghanistan the countrys chief legal 
officer said 
those who could not resist hostile propaganda who failed to 
withstand suffering and privations of captivity and committed 
offenses damaging our state all of them will be amnestied out of 
supreme considerations of socialist humanism prosecutor general 
alexander sukharev told a news briefing 
asked if the conditions included deserters sukharev said they 
would be included with those who suffered because of the extreme 
conditions of the war in afghanistan to whom the amnesty will be 
applied 
it was not immediately clear if the amnesty was unconditional 
or whether there would be a review procedure 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 replaced 
one prosoviet government with another and remained there to help 
fight antimarxist insurgents the soviet military said in late may 
that more than 13000 soldiers had been killed in afghanistan and 
more than 35000 wounded 
sukharev said the soviet union had identified 312 soldiers who 
had been taken prisoner during the war and had established that 
about a third of them had died many of them in the act of trying 
to escape 
some of them were shot on the spot some of them were tortured 
to death he said 
those who remain captive are subject to torture they are 
manacled they are under psychological pressure including scant 
food supplies he said 
most of the 200 are on pakistani territory in the hands of 
afghan guerrilla groups but an undetermined number are in the 
united states canada and western europe the prosecutor general 
said 
he said he did not know how many soldiers could be classified as 
deserters 
sukharev said in offering the amnesty the presidium of the 
supreme soviet the countrys highest executive body wanted to 
refute what he said were rumors in the west that prisoners of war 
and deserters would face severe punishment if they returned to the 
soviet union 
the presidium already has pardoned one soldier who was punished 
for desertion he said 
prisoners of war who return will enjoy in full measure all 
political social and all other rights guaranteed by the 
constitution of the ussr to soviet citizens he said 
the legal official said his country was using all channels to 
obtain the release of our soldiers and bring them back home 
he appealed to the united states pakistan and other countries 
to help soviet soldiers who are on their territory to return home 
the soviet union began pulling its 100000 soldiers out of 
afghanistan on may 15 and units still there awaiting withdrawal 
are not taking part in offensive operations 
lt gen boris gromov commander of the soviet force in 
afghanistan told reporters in moscow last week that 20000 
soldiers already had left the country 
according to an agreement signed in geneva on april 14 the 
soviet force is to be withdrawn completely by feb 15 1989 
however the soviet union and afghanistan repeatedly have 
accused pakistan of continuing to aid antimarxist guerrillas and 
the soviets say they reserve the right to alter the withdrawal 
schedule because of it 
the soviet union has appealed to pakistan several times in 
recent weeks to help return soviet prisoners of war held by the 
guerrillas 
return of missing soviet soldiers has become an issue of serious 
concern discussed in the official media and by top soviet leaders 
in public forums since the withdrawal began

stung by 1984 charges that it blacklisted 
liberals the us information agency this year is sending both 
republicans and democrats around the world to speak about the us 
political system and the presidential election campaign 
the effort part of a 17 million overseas speakers program run 
by usia involves about 120 speakers including political 
professionals from both parties election officials university 
political scientists lawyers and writers 
four years ago the american participants program known as 
amparts came under fire accused of rejecting 38 proposed 
speakers on partisan or ideological grounds but capitol hill 
overseers say the programs problems appear to have been dealt with 
adequately 
we dont have any complaints that are pending now said rep 
dan mica dfla chairman of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on international operations i think its a 
tremendous program but it was abused for a while weve 
straightened that out 
joseph oconnell an official at usias public liaison office 
said the agency tries to take a politically balanced approach to 
selecting speakers for the program 
he said that for obvious reasons we dont want to make it look 
like were leaning toward vice president george bush who is 
all but certain to be the republican nominee running against 
democrat michael dukakis in the fall presidential race 
in some cases usias approach this election year has led to 
sending of democratrepublican teams to appear sidebyside before 
foreign audiences 
for example political consultant ed rollins manager of 
president reagans 1984 reelection campaign this month traveled 
to west germany with les francis another consultant who served as 
deputy chief of staff in the carter white house 
francis said that during the weeklong trip they spoke to 
political professionals academics students journalists and 
business people in four cities bonn hamburg nuremberg and 
mannheim 
he found german audiences already well versed in the basics of 
american politics but eager to learn more about the nuances of this 
years campaign 
they can read about what dukakis might think about the mx or 
the midgetman mobile missile or they can read about what george 
bushs resume is in terms of foreign policy experience 
but to get a feel for how these guys conduct their campaigns 
the kind of people around them thats ultimately as important to 
the presidency as position papers or biographical sketches and i 
think thats what they were interested in as much as anything 
francis said 
another speaking team involved thomas susman a washington 
attorney active in democratic politics and loren smith a 
conservative republican who served as counsel to reagans 1980 
campaign and is now chief judge of the us claims courts they 
spent three weeks in march visiting the philippines pakistan 
turkey and egypt 
susman noted that we went to countries where the party which 
is out of power doesnt want to just win the next election they 
want to kill the people in power they want a new constitution 
they want new forms of government 
and so the example of people from the united states who have 
opposing perspectives but who talk rationally about issues and 
personalities with each other was something that we were told was 
quite impressive he said 
other speakers include 
benjamin ginsburg director of cornell universitys institute 
for public affairs who traveled to west germany norway spain and 
portugal 
you always understand your own politics better from afar 
ginsburg said americans are very ethnocentric we see the 
universe revolving around the united states and its very useful 
to step outside the united states and see the us through somebody 
elses eyes it freshens your own perspective 
jerry hagstrom author of a recently published book beyond 
reagan the new landscape of american politics and a 
contributing editor of the national journal a washingtonbased 
weekly he visited finland switzerland and china 
hagstrom said his chinese audiences included young scholars 
who had just returned from spending five years in the united 
states but within the same audience you would have young 
graduate students who have never left china with them you had to 
explain what is a caucus and what is a primary 
james lengle a professor of government at georgetown 
university who lectured gave press interviews and made other 
appearances in australia and fiji on fiji he said everyone was 
very much confused about how the parties go about picking their 
nominees and how actually the president is elected 
samuel shipley chairman of the delaware democratic committee 
who traveled to denmark italy and iceland shipley said he was 
impressed at how much less it costs candidates to run for office in 
those countries by comparison with the united states where money 
has become the cancer of politics 
in may 1984 usia director charles z wick appeared before 
micas international operations subcommittee as it investigated the 
blacklisting charges 
richard w mcbride the subcommittees staff director said the 
panel was satisfied that there are now nothing in the way of 
political litmus tests being given to the amparts participants 
they really learned a lesson mcbride said i think it was 
one of the real object lessons to wick that he could not run that 
agency without paying due attention to congress

investigators abused their authority by publishing 
allegations that some delegates to last weeks communist party 
conference had taken bribes the soviet unions chief law 
enforcement officer said monday 
but procurator general alexander sukharev said he had not plans 
to take action against the investigators or the magazine ogonyok 
which published their charges june 26 
publication of the charges against unidentified delegates caused 
a storm of criticism by delegates to the fourday conference that 
ended friday in the kremlin 
on thursday ogonyok editor vitaly korotich personally turned 
over to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev papers that he said 
proved the charges he told the conference that an overlapping 
system of party and court control prevented the suspects from being 
brought to justice 
asked about the case at a news briefing monday sukharev said 
the investigators abused their authority by turning to ogonyok 
with their material 
we have the principle that people are regarded as not guilty 
in this country he said this is a constitutional principle 
queried whether that meant he would be taking action against the 
magazine sukharev said i can say i dont have such an intention 
as yet 
he said the matter still was being investigated and that his 
office should be able to draw its final conclusions soon 
ogonoyok said investigators trying to unravel corruption in the 
central asian republic of uzbekistan came across evidence that four 
delegates to the party conference had taken bribes 
stories this year have laid open systematic corruption that led 
all the way to yuri churbanov soninlaw of late president leonid 
i brezhnev 
sukharev said ogonyoks report was true that some people tried 
to block the investigation but he added that there had been 
arrests and convictions of such people 
churbanov who served as first deputy interior minister faces 
trial soon on charges of bribery and abuse of power the procurator 
general said

frazzled by freeways try zen buddhism 
thats the advice two brothers are giving in zen driving a 
book that explores how harried motorists can enjoy life in the 
notsofast lane 
no religious conversion is necessary for this moving 
meditation say kevin and todd berger in zen driving they say 
you simply accept a traffic jam and become one with it 
a master of the art might even learn to see all the honking and 
crowding as a path to enlightenment a sort of nirvana on wheels 
zen driving is a heightened sense of awareness and 
mindfulness said todd berger 39 a psychotherapist from marin 
county in a weekend telephone interview 
if somebody cuts you off you simply acknowledge your anger 
and then let it go he said youre aware of what you 
experience and you experience what youre aware of 
todd and his brother kevin the 31yearold editor of a rock 
music magazine in san francisco hope anyone whose mind stalls over 
that concept will buy their newly released book 
it represents the culmination of a discovery that todd who has 
been studying zen since the late 1960s made a dozen years ago 
spending three hours a day commuting from home to work near los 
angeles he found he had little time to do his zazen the 
technique of sitting meditation that is the core of zen buddhism 
so he decided to do it on the road 
not only did my driving ability improve but i got to work 
feeling a lot less uptight he said 
kevin also learned the method or nonmethod as his 
brother calls it a car enthusiast he too found it relaxing even 
though he is not a practicing buddhist 
zen is a philosophy not a religion said kevin who drives 
a latemodel pickup truck to be a buddha behind the wheel 
doesnt mean you have to take the plastic jesus off your 
dashboard 
in the book the brothers berger describe exercises on how to 
practice the method they advise letting go of emotions and 
focusing on the feel of the wheel the car the road 
soon they promise the cursing fistshaking and heartpounding 
associated with car trips will be only a memory and you can 
converse and meditate at the same time 
babe ruth was a colorful personality off the field but at the 
moment the pitcher released the ball you can be assured babe ruth 
was nothing but experience and awareness they write and 
thats how we want to be in traffic 
todd now professes to commute almost effortlessly over the 
golden gate bridge to his office in san francisco 
in fact being a practicing buddhist hes virtually 
unflappable but it does upset him that some have described zen 
driving as esoteric he hopes the book will be as useful for 
iowans as it is for those cruising la freeways every day 
it chagrins me that this is being labeled as a new age book in 
bookstores he said it was really designed to be a driving 
book for the everyday driver i guess most stores dont have a 
driving section

conservationists moved 10 captive 
philippine eagles to safer ground after fighting between government 
forces and rebels raged near a camp established to save the species 
it made common sense to move although we might be sacrificing 
the breeding cycle for 1988 said ronald kruppa a consultant to 
the philippine eagle conservation program 
kruppa of northbrook ill said the eagles were moved saturday 
after at least 12 explosions near the breeding camp which kruppa 
established in 1977 
the explosions were from artillery fired by government forces at 
hideouts of communist rebels 
kruppa moved the breeding camp closer to davao city from the 
foothills of mount apo about 20 miles from davao city and 600 
miles southeast of manila the eagle is found only in the 
philippines and conservationists estimate there are only 300 of the 
species left

president reagan asserted monday there was a 
great difference between the us navys destruction of an 
iranian commercial airliner and the soviet air forces 1983 
destruction of a korean air lines jet 
vice president george bush concurred this plane was warned 
he said speaking of the iranian jet downed sunday by missiles from 
the navy cruiser vincennes in the strait of hormuz 
this plane was flying in a combat area its totally separate 
totally different bush told reporters in wyandotte mich 
rep lee hamilton dind a member of the house foreign affairs 
committee agreed with bush and reagan saying that unlike the 
korean jet the iranian plane had been warned on both civilian and 
military frequencies 
there are a lot of differences between the two situations 
he said in an interview on abcs good morning america 
the comparison between the two incidents was raised immediately 
after us officials said the vincennes thinking it was shooting 
at an iranian f14 knocked iran air flight 655 into the persian 
gulf 
kal flight 007 a boeing 747 enroute from anchorage alaska to 
seoul south korea was shot down by the soviets on sept 1 1983 
it was hit by an airtoair missile fired by a soviet fighter 
the kal shootdown was first revealed by the united states which 
released intercepted tape recordings of the soviet pilot telling 
his ground controller that the target is destroyed 
at the time reagan criticized the barbarity of the soviet 
government in shooting down an unarmed plane and us officials 
asserted that the soviets knew they were shooting at a commercial 
airliner 
the soviet reaction monday was less critical gennady gerasimov 
a spokesman for the foreign ministry said the soviets didnt 
intend to follow the bad example of wild criticism 
gerasimov said the us explanation that the vincinnes mistook 
the iranian plane for an f14 jet appeared to be strange it 
shows american naval officers were not very competent or to use an 
american phrase triggerhappy 
reagan asked monday about comparisons between the two 
incidents repeated the assertion that the soviets knew they were 
targeting a commercial plane remember the kal a group of soviet 
fighter planes went up identified the plane for what it was and 
then proceeded to shoot it down theres no comparison he said 
at the white house 
the kal plane was shot down after flying over restricted soviet 
airspace first above the kamchatka peninsula and later over 
sakhalin island the plane crashed into the sea of japan 
initially the soviets refused to admit they had shot at a 
commercial plane asserting that the plane was on a reconnaissance 
mission a week later the soviets said they had down the plane 
but said the soviet pilot had not known it was a commercial craft 
the soviets also said the su15 jet had fired warning rounds at 
the kal plane before the missile was launched an assertion first 
disputed by the united states and later accepted 
us officials also asserted that the wellknown shape and size 
of the 747 made it difficult to mistake for another plane but the 
soviets said their jet was below and behind the plane and it was 
dark meaning it couldnt be visually identified 
in addition the soviets asserted they were targeting an 
american reconnaissance plane and four days after the kal plane was 
downed us officials admitted that a us rc135 plane had been 
in the general area of the kal jetliner when the 747 was near the 
kamchatka peninsula the rc135 is a military version of the boeing 
707 
crowe said sunday there were fundamental differences between 
the two incidents 
the kal shootdown was not in a war zone there was not 
combat in progress there was not combat there generally crowe 
said and secondly the kal 007 was not warned in any way form 
or fashion nor as far as i can tell or determine was any attempt 
made to warn 
but crowes statement is at odds with state department 
statements 
although originally asserting the kal plane wasnt warned the 
state department later changed that assessment shortly after the 
soviets asserted there had been warning shots fired 
on sept 11 1983 the state department said additional 
analysis of the tapes indicate that the soviet pilot told his 
ground controllers that he had fired his cannons nearly six minutes 
before the missiles were launched

president reagan stood fast monday behind his 
policy of defending the right of free navigation in the persian 
gulf a position supported by members of congress as washington 
weighed the impact of the us downing of an iranian passenger 
plane 
we want peace in the gulf but we also want the right of 
navigation of international waters reagan told reporters after 
returning to the white house from a weekend stay at his retreat in 
camp david md 
asked whether us ships will stay in the gulf reagan said 
yes 
meanwhile members of congress interviewed monday generally 
agreed that the united states should maintain its military presence 
in the gulf in the wake of sundays tragedy in which 290 lives 
were lost 
house majority leader tom foley dwash said it would be a 
great mistake for the united states to abruptly withdraw its 
forces from the gulf 
rep lee hamilton a member of the house foreign affairs 
committee said i think our policy to maintain freedom of 
navigation of the seas to respond to third country vessels in 
distress upon request is a sound policy and one that will remain i 
do hope that out of this will come a reinvigorated effort to try to 
get peace us interests in the gulf will best be protected if we 
can stop the war 
sen dale bumpers dark said the administration should review 
its gulf policy because the next time a tragedy occurs american 
lives may be lost instead of iranian he stopped short however of 
calling for a us withdrawal 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson said the united 
states has a right to have military forces stationed in 
international waters of the persian gulf and we should not move 
out unilaterally 
but he indicated the administration should seek ways to bring 
its forces home 
the policy is without end he said to what end are we 
there 
state department officials insisting on anonymity left open 
the possibility that there may be a review of the rules specifying 
when us military commanders in the gulf are permitted to engage 
in hostile action 
the commanders were given greater latitude in taking such action 
a year ago after a iranian jet fired on the frigate uss stark 
killing 37 crewmen 
on monday the state department continued to make a studied 
effort to avoid the appearance of a crisis atmosphere there was no 
requirement for any major decisions to be made and all senior 
officials took off for the july 4 holiday the sources said 
secretary of state george p shultz was on a holiday weekend 
outside of washington and was planning to go ahead with a planned 
2week trip to asia starting tuesday morning 
the only reported diplomatic activity was the dispatch of 
messages to some foreign governments explaining that the shooting 
down of the iranian plane was a case of mistaken identity the 
officials said 
it was unclear whether the administration planned an apology 
beyond the expression of deep regret sunday by adm william crowe 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and reagans description of 
the incident as a terrible human tragedy 
another unresolved issue is whether the administration should 
pay reparations to families of the victims officials recalled that 
at the time of the downing of korean airlines flight 007 by soviet 
jet fighters the administration had called on moscow to pay 
compensation to the victims families 
reagan acknowledged that the possibility of iranian retaliation 
was a concern for the administration 
you have to think about that knowing who they are he said 
interiewed on the cable news network mohammad jaafar 
mahallati irans ambassdor to the united nations called sundays 
incident a blatant act of terrorism that should be severely 
punished 
the incident occurred at a time when the united states had been 
exploring the possibility of pursuing a dialogue with iran 
although us officials had denied reports of secret meetings 
between american and iranian envoys the two countries are said to 
have exchanged messages in recent weeks 
robin wright an associate at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace said she was told by iranian officials during 
a recent visit to tehran that the reported exchanges provided a 
hopeful sign on a variety of issues 
but the prospects for any improvement in relations appear dashed 
for the time being as a result of the airliner incident 
the united states broke diplomatic relations with iran in april 
1980 during the period in which american diplomats were held 
hostage in iran

an annual rock extravaganza in this 
danish town drew more than 60000 people western stars and groups 
from developing countries but a major ingredient was still 
missing artists from the flourishing rock scene in the soviet bloc 
three hundred acts played this years roskilde festival 
including sting canadian bryan adams australias inxs and leonard 
cohen of the united states 
only two minor acts were from eastern europe 
most of the bands from the communist countries play 
10yearold copies of what we all know said leif skov the 
festivals chief booking agent 
however if we want to develop further this is a corner 
thats not been covered yet skov told the associated press 
the festival a major fixture on the european music scene 
closed sunday with the secondlargest attendance in its 18year 
history visitors came from scandinavia britain and west germany 
organizers said 
under glasnost the openness policy of soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev soviet rock music is enjoying more freedom than ever 
with many formerly banned bands now playing 
the estimated number of rock bands in the soviet union is 
30000 with about 300 of them playing professionally a danish 
newspaper reported recently 
two soviet bands were in denmark in may said the amtavisen 
randers daily both came in their free time and paid their own 
expenses to give promotional performances 
it cost me 1200 rubles about 1400 to be here but to me 
denmark is worth much more oleg gusev lead singer of the 
leningradbased rock group avgust was quoted as saying 
in previous years the festival has had a few acts from poland 
and some hungarian bands 
the problem is that it takes at least two years of paperwork 
to negotiate a deal in those countries said nils traeden a 
talent scout involved in the festival they simply must be more 
flexible than that to make it here 
vladimir merta a folk singer from czechoslovakia made it to 
roskilde after a twoyear ban on his music was lifted in his home 
country the other east bloc performance was from a folk group from 
hungary 
this is a marketplace for different ideas and influences with 
enthusiastic crowds pushing you to do things you never tried 
before merta said in an interview 
boris grebenshchikov the leader of the soviet band aquarium 
recently signed a deal with cbs records to sell his recordings in 
the united states 
the way western audiences perceive rock music is still quite 
narrow and heavily dominated by the american influence skov 
said one of the purposes of this festival is to do something 
about it 
in previous years some of the profits were contributed to 
various charities including amnesty international and the 
britainbased world of music arts and dance 
wed like to have some of the soviet or east bloc bands 
involved in that too skov said

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said monday 
he will donate my worthless life to fighting the united states 
after an american warship shot down an iranian jetliner and killed 
all aboard 
iranian navy divers searched for more bodies from the iran air 
airbus 300 that was destroyed sunday while on a flight from bandar 
abbas to dubai across the strait of hormuz 
leaders of the iranian clergy and military demanded revenge for 
the deaths of the 290 people aboard the jet most of whom were 
iranians 
the 87yearold khomeini said we must all be prepared for a 
real war and go to the war fronts and fight against america and its 
lackeys i donate my worthless life for the sake of our victory 
iran accuses the united states which it calls the great satan 
of being iraqs sponsor in the war between the persian gulf 
neighbors that began in september 1980 
in the statement read on tehran radio khomeini referred to a 
message sent him by ayatollah hussein ali montazeri his designated 
heir asking the revolutionaary patriarch to sanction war on the 
united states 
fighting a fullscale war against america cannot be done by 
slogans and propaganda campaigns alone montazeri declared he 
said the nation needs plans for a principled fight against the 
main enemy america on the political economic cultural and 
military fronts 
iran often has promised to wage war against the united states 
following clashes between the two nations in the persian gulf since 
us forces began escorting commercial vessels in the waterway last 
summer 
state television in tehran began its evening news program with 
the two statements and scenes of protest it said were occurring 
throughout iran mass funeral services for those on the jet are 
scheduled for tuesday and wednesday in tehran 
the iranian mission to the united nations in geneva demanded 
that us military personnel responsible for the attack be tried 
that washington pay full compensation and that us forces be 
withdrawn from the gulf 
ambassador sirous nasseri delivered the note during a meeting 
with javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral to 
reporters nasseri read a statement describing as ridiculous 
the official us position that the airliner was destroyed because 
the crew of the the uss vincennes mistook it for an iranian f14 
fighter 
the attack contrary to the claims by the united states is 
indeed a deliberate one he said 
perez de cuellar said the destruction of the jet appears to 
have been a tragic error and asked for the greatest restraint 
in these difficult moments for the peace and security of the 
region 
iranian news reports said 168 bodies had been recovered and the 
search area in the southern gulf had been expanded 
the commander of the search and rescue operation said bodies had 
been recovered up to five miles from the area where most of the 
jetliners debris fell it was hit at 7500 feet by at least one of 
two missiles fired by the vincennes a guided missile cruiser 
reports from tehran quoted the unidentified commander as saying 
currents may have swept bodies away from the wreckage the plane 
was hit about 30 miles south of bandar abbas a coastal city off 
irans hengam island 
he said frogmen were looking for missile fragments at a depth of 
about 100 feet 
according to the iranian reports the 38 bodies of foreigners 
recovered were those of 12 united arab emirates citizens eight 
indians eight pakistanis six yugoslavs two kuwaitis an italian 
and an afghan 
military and aviation officials in iran denied american 
statements that the plane was outside civilian aviation corridors 
us military spokesmen said the image on radar screens appeared 
to be that of an f14 tomcat fighter the plane did not respond to 
warnings and it appeared to dive toward the ship the united states 
supplied f14s to iran before khomeinis revolution overthrew the 
monarchy in february 1979 
the plane began the short flight to dubai just after an 
engagement in the strait of hormuz in which the vincennes and 
another navy ship the montgomery sank two iranian attack boats 
and damaged a third 
brig gen mansour sattari commander of the iranian air force 
said statements by adm william crowe chairman of the us joint 
chiefs of staff were a pack of lies in a bid to justify the 
inhuman crime 
crowe told reporters sunday in washington the suspect aircraft 
was outside the prescribed commercial air corridor 
in rome an italian navy spokesman said officers on an italian 
frigate near the scene said it tracked the airliner on radar and 
noted it was flying outside the civilian air corridor 
sattari said it is quite easy to distinguish a huge airbus 
passenger plane from a tiny f14 jet fighter 
iran air announced it had suspended flights between bandar abbas 
and dubai and dubai said it would stop gulf air flights to bandar 
abbas japan air lines and cathay pacific airways said they would 
alter their routes over the gulf

before it fell won a competition monday to design new jerseys 
vietnam veterans memorial and he thanked american soldiers for 
rescuing his family

a ceremony on the grassy knoll at the garden state arts center 
where the memorial will be built 
i want to thank the country for taking us in and making us 
americans said nguyen 35 an architect from marlboro whose 
entry was selected from 425 proposals 
speaking of the nations vietnam veterans he said if not for

lucky ones 
soon after he announced that he was donating his 5000 
winners check to fund efforts to find and return soldiers missing 
in action and reunite amerasian children with their american 
parents

granite lining the interior of a 200footdiameter oval the 
granite will be inscribed with the names of 1419 new jersey

oak tree will stand in the center of the memorial 
about 200 veterans and their families at the ceremony applauded 
nguyens work and some in uniforms embraced him 
sal mione a veteran who was on the committee that selected

bring together new jersey veterans the way the vietnam memorial in 
washington did for american veterans 
nguyen who became a us citizen five years ago was evacuated 
from saigon in an american airlift on april 30 1975 with his 
mother and sister they were taken to a refugee camp in arkansas

arts coordinator for the state council on the arts and the 
competitions manager 
moran said a fourmember panel of architects artists and 
designers picked the seven finalists from among more than 400 
entries 
moran said nguyens design provides a space for solitude when 
you enter you must be overcome by a wall of stone that provides 
seclusion and private moments away from the outside world 
nguyen said he visited the war memorial in washington and read 
books by vietnam veterans to get a sense of how they felt about the 
war

jesse jackson urged president reagan on monday to 
offer reparations to the families of victims of the downed iranian 
airliner saying an immediate goodwill gesture was needed to save 
the lives of american hostages held in lebanon 
jackson called for an investigation and reevaluation of us 
policy in the persian gulf he held a brief news conference at his 
chicago home before departing for boston for a fourth of july visit 
with democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis 
jackson criticized what he called the administrations failed 
and vague policy in the gulf 
reagan said the us navys shooting down of the iranian 
jetliner with 290 people aboard was an understandable accident 
and ordered a full investigation by the defense department the 
pentagon said the airliner was mistaken for an attacking warplane 
and failed to heed warnings 
but jackson said the administration was using the same 
arguments the russians were making after they shot down a korean 
air lines jetliner in 1983 killing all 269 people on board 
when the kal plane was shot down we did not accept those 
arguments as being valid and most people in the world will not 
accept our arguments to this point as being valid jackson said 
the democratic presidential candidate said there was no 
evidence that the uss vincennes was under attack when it shot 
down the civilian airliner early sunday 
i am sincerely concerned that we make a gesture of goodwill 
immediately so as to protect the lives of americans who are in the 
region specifically the americans who are held hostage there he 
said 
jackson said the incident complicates the situation in the gulf 
at a time when there were indications that forces in iran favoring 
negotiations were gaining strength 
reading a prepared statement jackson urged reagan to go on 
television to express genuine regrets about the planes downing 
and offer reparations to the families to ease some of the pain 
the president has already expressed deep regret over the loss of 
life 
jackson called for a united nations force under international 
command to keep the gulf waterways open rather than rely on 
unilateral us military actions however the navies of several 
other nations are also patrolling in the gulf 
the reagan administrations policy left us troops trapped in 
the gulf under these warlike conditions without civilian 
oversight jackson said

the communist party says every soviet citizen has 
an inalienable right to any information on public affairs but 
state and military secrets the tass news agency reported monday 
in one of a series of resolutions adopted at last weeks party 
conference the delegates said any citizen attacked in the press 
should have the right to respond in the same newspaper 
the soviet press also must not publish unobjective information 
injurious to a citizens honor and dignity tass said in 
summarizing the resolutions 
the national conference the partys first since 1941 was 
called by mikhail s gorbachev to chart political reforms and 
reassess the role of the 20 millionmember party in soviet life 
as well as setting certain limits for the kremlin policy of 
glasnost or openness the 5000member conference decreed a 
sweeping agenda of political and legal reform 
the central committee the partys policymaking body will meet 
at the end of july to discuss how to put the conferences 
resolutions into effect tass said 
further indicating the speed with which the soviet leadership 
wants to move the politburo the partys supreme body held an 
extraordinary monday session to discuss how to fulfill the 
resolutions 
the 13member body led by gorbachev ordered all party and 
government bodies to act without delay in implementing the 
decisions of the conference which ended friday 
gorbachev the partys general secretary has repeatedly said 
past efforts at reform failed because they were not accomplished by 
political changes 
as summarized by tass the party conferences resolutions 
state that more openness is an indispensable condition for 
unfolding the processes of democratizing every aspect of life and 
updating socialism but they say the press is not free to act 
to the detriment of the interests of the soviet state and 
society 
acknowledge that gorbachevs program for political and social 
restructuring known as perestroika is proceeding more slowly 
than planned many causes of all this are to be sought in the 
flaws of the present work of the party government and economic 
bodies and public organizations 
attach prime importance to improving drastically food 
supplies to the population the shortest route to that goal the 
conference said is for bureaucrats to stop meddling in the 
operations of collective and state farms 
give top priority to sweeping political reform including 
a 10year limit on the tenure of elected party and government 
officials and a reinforced role for the governing councils who 
often were supplanted in practice by local party committees 
party officials have said the political changes include the 
creation of a fulltime legislature and of a more powerful 
presidency that could be filled by the 57yearold gorbachev 
himself 
other resolutions adopted include instructions on fighting 
bureaucracy reforming the legal system and changing the apparatus 
of the party 
the delegates to the fourday conference rejected the legacy of 
totalitarian methods bequeathed by dictator josef stalin and also 
repudiated the complacency and corruption now viewed as endemic 
under the reign of president leonid i brezhnev 
the party the resolutions said shall never allow the 
repetition of anything similar to what is associated with the 
periods of the cult of personality and stagnation which caused 
profound deformations in socialist society retarded its 
development for whole decades and brought about immense human 
casualties and immeasurable moral and ideological losses 
in a further break with stalins legacy the politburo on monday 
approved the construction of a monument in moscow to the victims of 
illegality and repression during the 29 years stalin led the 
nation 
gorbachev had proposed at the conference that such a memorial be 
built and said friday this would be an honest step and it will 
be supported by the entire soviet people 
at the conference some delegates had called for publication of 
the responsibilities of members of the party hierarchy which until 
now had not been mentioned by staterun media 
the communique on mondays politburo meeting distributed by 
tass spelled out for the first time which leaders had been charged 
with specific tasks by the ruling body 
apparently heeding some delegates complaints that food supplies 
were wholly inadequate in some regions the politburo directed 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov fellow politburo member viktor p 
nikonov and other officials to improve food production and supply

michael dukakis on monday urged iran to reconsider its threats 
to use terrorism to avenge the us shooting down of an iranian 
jetliner with 290 people aboard george bush expressed his regrets 
about the tragedy but said the incident should not change us 
policy in the persian gulf 
jesse jackson meanwhile urged president reagan to offer 
reparations to the families of victims of the downed iranian jet 
saying an immediate goodwill gesture was needed to save the lives 
of us hostages held in lebanon 
both dukakis and jackson later focused their attention on the 
democratic ticket meeting for dinner at the massachusetts 
governors brookline home and later attending bostons independence 
day celebrations 
aides to the likely democratic nominee described the evening as 
a social gathering but said dukakis search for a running mate 
would likely be discussed 
jackson has said he has decided whether he would accept a vice 
presidential offer but refuses to disclose his decision he 
contends that he deserves to be offered the no 2 spot on the 
ticket 
dukakis has said jackson is being considered but says he owes no 
candidate an offer 
at the charlestown navy yard dukakis departed from the prepared 
text of a fourth of july speech to appeal to iran not to try to 
seek revenge through terrorism he renewed his call for an 
international effort to end the nearly 8yearold iraniraq war 
while we all deeply regret the tragedy this is no time for 
acts of terror or revenge in response to the incident dukakis 
said at the berth of the uss constitution so i urge the 
government of iran to reconsider its threats and to join us and the 
entire international community to ending a war that already has 
taken the lives of more than one million people 
mohammad jaafar mahallati iranian ambassador to the united 
nations said the downing of the iran air airbus was premeditated 
and he called it coldblooded murder 
by definition it was an act of terrorism that should be 
severely punished he said 
the uss vincennes shot down the commercial jetliner on sunday 
while engaged in battle with iranian gunboats the pentagon said 
the vincennes crew believed the widebodied airbus was a smaller 
f14 fighter about to attack the ship 
clearly we have the right to defend our forces against 
imminent threat and apparently the shooting down of the airliner 
occurred over what appears to have been an unprovoked attack 
against our forces dukakis said 
vice president bush campaigning in the midwest spoke out for 
the first time on the incident expressing deep regret 
obviously as we celebrate our great national holiday our 
hearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who were lost 
and also hearts go out to those kids those young americans who 
are defending freedom halfway around the world he said 
the allbutcertain republican nominee said he believed us 
policy in the gulf will remain the same life goes on our 
mission goes on and the world keeps turning bush said 
the vice president continued his campaign schedule saying 
there is nothing i can be doing about this matter in washington 
dc 
however bush planned to attend a white house briefing on the 
gulf incident on tuesday according to aides 
prior to leaving chicago for his meeting with dukakis jackson 
said the shooting incident complicates the situation in the gulf 
region at a time when there were indications that forces in iran 
favoring negotiations were gaining strength 
i am sincerely concerned that we make a gesture of goodwill 
immediately so as to protect the lives of americans who are in the 
region specifically the americans who are held hostage there he 
said 
jackson urged reagan to go on television to express genuine 
regrets about the planes downing and offer reparations to the 
families to ease some of the pain the president has already said 
he deeply regrets the loss of life 
jackson also called on the reagan administration to reevaluate 
its middle east policy but said the united states should maintain a 
presence in the wartorn gulf 
we should not move out unilaterally the fact is they are 
international waters we do have a right to be there jackson 
said

substances as the worst drought in years continues to decrease the 
freshwater flow 
were concerned about the toxics going down the river and are 
seriously taking a look at it now said maureen oneill the 
department of environmental qualitys assistant secretary in charge 
of water quality were not seeing the same dilution factor 
that is normally present 
so far levels of toxic substances still are very low but the 
environmental agency will begin taking weekly samples from the 
river instead of the monthly tests that are normally taken oneill 
said public warnings will be issued if toxic levels are found to 
be unacceptable she said 
the department is getting help in analyzing the samples from the 
new orleans sewerage and water boards laboratory because its own 
laboratory is understaffed and backed up with other work oneill 
said 
meanwhile communities that get their drinking water from the 
lower part of the mississippi river are seeing chloride 
concentrations rise as salt water moves rapidly up the river due to 
a lack of freshwater flow 
at port sulphur drinking water already is nearly double the 
federal standard for chlorides

a shiite moslem goes on trial 
tuesday for the 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner in which a us 
navy diver was slain and several of the american passengers say 
theyre ready to take the stand 
the trial for mohammed hamadi charged with murder and air 
piracy begins amid highsecurity in a courtroom at a state prison 
in frankfurt 
four armed men hijacked the twa plane on june 14 1985 on a 
flight from athens to rome and forced it to land in beirut 
thirtynine americans were held captive for 17 days and us navy 
diver robert stethem of waldorf md was beaten and shot to death 
several former us captives aboard the twa plane have been 
asked to testify about the abuse at the hands of their abductors 
scores have given depositions to west german prosecutors 
im ready to go to the trial said kurt l carlson a 
chicagoarea native who said he was beaten by the hijackers for two 
consecutive hours 
i feel strongly about what the hijackers did all the beating 
and the terror our lives were threatened every minute on that 
plane carlson told the ap 
the frankfurt juvenile court will spend the first part of the 
trial looking into the vital question of hamadis age to determine 
whether the lebanese defendant should be tried as a juvenile young 
adult or adult 
under west german law a juvenile is less than age 18 an adult 
is age 21 and older while a young adult is between 18 and 21 
hamadi faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if the 
court convicts him as an adult at the time of the crime the west 
german indictment lists hamadis date of birth as june 13 1964 
but he claims he was born in 1966 
if he is tried and convicted as a juvenile the maximum term 
would be 15 years if convicted as an adolescent the court could 
sentence hamadi either as an adult or a juvenile depending on how 
mature it decides he was at the time of the hijacking 
officials say the actual testimony centering on the murder and 
air piracy charges is scheduled to begin in september 
west germany last year refused a us request to extradite the 
hijacker to the united states government sources in bonn told the 
associated press that concern for the fate of two german hostages 
then held in lebanon influenced their decision 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 after 
a search revealed he was carrying liquid explosives 
his older brother abbas ali hamadi was sentenced in april by a 
duesseldorf court to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two west 
germans in beirut in an attempt to gain freedom for the defendant 
one of the hostages alfred schmidt was released in september 
businessman rudolf cordes is still being held in beirut by the 
proiranian holy warriors for freedom shiite moslem group

lawyers for six people 
sentenced to hang for the mob killing of a black official filed an 
application monday seeking to appeal a judges refusal to reopen 
the case 
the five men and a woman known as the sharpeville six were 
convicted of participating in the 1984 killing of a black town 
councilor there has been an international campaign seeking 
clemency for the six and several western european countries have 
threatened to recall their ambassadaors if the hangings take place 
the six were granted a stay of execution march 17 one day 
before they were to hang in june a judge extended the stay until 
july 19 but rejected a bid to reopen the trial to consider 
allegations that police coerced state witnesses 
justice willem human said only president pw botha could 
intervene to save them botha has rejected a clemency petition 
on monday defense lawyers filed an application with the chief 
justice of the appellate court in bloemfontein seeking permission 
to appeal humans ruling 
the case has generated controversy in part because the 
defendants were not convicted of contributing physically to the 
death of khuzwayo dlamini 
they were convicted under the doctrine of common purpose which 
held them responsible because they actively participated in the mob 
which killed the councilor in the black township of sharpeville

vice president george bush is a distant cousin of 
queen elizabeth ii and has blood ties with every other european 
royal family on or off the throne according to the publishing 
director of a blueblood directory 
going by precedent that bodes well for bush in novembers 
presidential election predicted harold brooksbaker an american 
who has made a name for himself analyzing royal lineages 
especially where they link up with the white house 
without any shadow of doubt vice president george bush is 
connected to more imperial royal and noble houses than any 
previous president he said 
no other american running for office in the primaries in the 
republican or democratic party is of european royal descent every 
time there has been an election in the united states where a man of 
royal descent was featuring the man with royal descent won 
brooksbaker said 
on tuesday he released a copy of bushs family tree traced by 
his directory burkes peerage back to the 1400s 
it found that bush is a longlost relative 13th cousin twice 
removed of britains current monarch and is a direct descendant 
of king henry vii of one of charles iis mistresses and of henry 
viiis younger sister mary who married king louis xii of france 
charles mistress barbara villiers who lived from 1641 to 
1706 was a sixth cousin of the vice presidents 
greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandmother elizabeth 
wellington fay he said 
miss villiers liaison with the king lasted 12 years during 
which she bore seven children of whom only five were publicly 
acknowleged as his 
bushs american roots were planted by dr richard palgrave his 
grandfather seven times removed who crossed the atlantic in 1630 
brooksbaker said 
bush is related to all 60 royal families on the european 
continent including the children of monacos prince rainier and 
his late american wife grace kelly in five different ways he 
said he is also a distant cousin of the king of albania and the 
pretender to the french throne 
brooksbaker said that while very few americans are descendants 
of european monarchs an unbelievably high proportion of american 
presidents are connected to the blood royal 
mr bush is without doubt connected to more great royal 
families than any reigning head of state today except his serene 
highness prince franz josef of liechtenstein 
the vice president also is related to 21 of britains 26 dukes 
he said 
brooksbaker said burkes peerage traced bushs family tree 
without his official approval but a copy has been sent to him 
because mr bush is so determined to be sort of the common 
man he shies away from this sort of thing he said in an 
interview 
after documenting every president from george washington 
burkes peerage felt that to have a possible president who was as 
royal as this and who is basically related to everyone you could 
imagine is too good a chance to show our genealogical strength 
it was burkes peerage who discovered that president reagan was 
a descendant of irelands 11th century warrior king brian boru 
former american presidents with royal connections include 
richard nixon a descendant of britains edward iii william henry 
harrison and benjamin harrison descended from henry iii ulysses 
s grant whose forefathers were of byzantine nobility and 
theodore and franklin d roosevelt who were descended from dutch 
nobility

president reagan scoffing at iranian charges 
that the united states intentionally shot down a passenger jet 
said monday the attack was an understandable accident that does 
not justify withdrawing us forces from the persian gulf iran 
renewed its vow to retaliate 
i wont minimize the tragedy reagan said 
but as iran continued to pull the bodies of men women and 
children from the water the president sidestepped questions about 
compensating their families ive ordered an investigation and 
im going to wait until i hear the result he said 
to that end rear adm william m fogarty and a team of us 
navy investigators left monday for the middle east to probe the 
downing of iran air flight 655 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said in a 
tehran radio message we must all be prepared for a real war and 
go to the war fronts and fight against america and its lackeys 
i donate my worthless life for the sake of our victory said 
the 87yearold khomeini who is rumored to be suffering from 
terminal cancer 
iranian president ali khamenei vowed to fight american 
aggression 
we wish to warn that the american government will have to 
suffer the consequences of its recent crime in the persian gulf 
khamenei said in an interview on tehran radio monitored in 
nicosia he did not elaborate 
the official islamic republic news agency said 168 bodies had 
been recovered by monday including at least 38 foreigners 
it listed them as 12 united arab emirates citizens eight 
indians eight pakistanis six yugoslavs two kuwaitis and italian 
and an afghan airline officials said the rest of the passengers 
were iranians 
all told iran said 290 people perished in the attack and 
declared monday a day of mourning 
reagan when asked about iranian accusations that the us navy 
intentionally shot down the passenger jet replied well i dont 
go much by what the iranians say ever 
pentagon sources who spoke on condition they not be further 
identified said that the commander of the vincennes capt will c 
rogers iii 50 had sent a message to his superiors stressing that 
he had followed procedures and would make the same decisions if 
faced again with the situation 
the sources were unable to provide quotes from the 
communication which they described as classified 
the reagan administration amid a rising crescendo of 
questioning about the us role in policing the sea lanes of the 
wartorn gulf strove to adopt a businessasusual posture the 
white house pentagon and state department were mostly quiet as the 
nation observed independence day reagan had no meetings scheduled 
monday 
reagan proceeded with plans monday to host friends for a fourth 
of july dinner and viewing of this citys annual fireworks display 
from the south balcony of the white house 
vice president george bush and his likely democratic rival 
michael dukakis kept to their campaign schedules 
and in both this country and abroad there were increasing calls 
for an end to the long iraniraq war 
administration officials here stayed out of reporters range 
and it could not immediately be learned whether the united states 
had apologized through private channels to the government of iran 
both reagan and bush said they regretted the planes downing 
and several congressmen said they accepted the administrations 
version that the aegis cruiser the uss vincennes had fired two 
sm2 standard antiaircraft missiles because it thought it was 
under enemy attack 
reagan dressed in casual clothes waved and smiled as he 
returned from camp david md at midday but the president turned 
grim as he stopped briefly to talk with reporters 
we all know that it was a tragedy but were talking about an 
incident in which a plane on radar was observed coming in the 
direction of a ship in combat and the plane began lowering its 
altitude he said and so i think it was an understandable 
accident to shoot and think that they were under attack from that 
plane 
mohammad jaafar mahallati iranian ambassador to the united 
nations appearing on cbstvs this morning program saw it 
differently by definition it was an act of terrorism that 
should be severely punished we will not put any limit on our 
act of selfdefense we will retaliate very strongly wherever we 
find american interests 
asked whether he was worried about a surge in terrorism or some 
other iranian retaliatory move reagan said you have to think 
about that knowing who they are 
but reagan made clear that he had no intention of pulling us 
military forces out of the gulf where the united states has taken 
on the role of protecting reflagged kuwaiti tankers 
we want peace in the gulf but we also want the right of 
navigation in international waters he said 
the soviet union and china on monday urged the us navy to get 
out of the region although the prevailing view of governments 
around the world was that the accident dramatized the need to end 
the 8yearold war between iran and iraq 
clovis maksoud ambassador for the league of arab states said 
in a statement said the downing of the plane should be a 
powerful incentive to end the iraniraq war and that if the 
iranians can transcend vengeance into vision then the innocent 
victims would have not died in vain 
he added prompt us compensation would assuage the 
legitimate feelings of outrage of the families in the same manner 
as the speedy admission of the tragic error by the us 
administration mitigates speculative ruminations and hasty 
antagonisms 
brent scowcroft national security adviser during the ford 
administration said such payments would be the humanitarian 
thing to do 
on the presidential campaign front bush hewed to his schedule 
making a threestate foray and refusing to apologize for that 
this is a national holiday it is appropriate that we celebrate 
it he told reporters in wyandotte mich 
bush said the captain of the uss vincennes followed the rules 
he did what he had to do 
life goes on and our mission goes on and the world keeps 
turning he said 
dukakis renewed his call for an international effort to end the 
war he also urged iran to reconsider its threats to respond with 
terrorism to the us navys downing of an iranian passenger jet 
as long as this senseless war between iran and iraq continues 
as long as we and the entire international community fail to 
use our combined efforts to stop it there will be more tragedies 
more heartaches and the everpresent risk of more accidents in the 
persian gulf he said in boston 
jesse jackson implored the administration to reevaluate its 
middle east policy but said the united states should maintain its 
presence in the wartorn region 
we should not move out unilaterally jackson said in 
chicago the fact is they are international waters we do have a 
right to be there said jackson 
among members of congress the statements of reaction were 
restrained and cautious 
house majority leader tom foley interviewed on nbctvs 
today program said all information about the destruction of 
the jet should be released publicly to demonstrate that the 
united states does not make war on innocents that this was a 
terrible accident that we deeply regret it 
sen dale bumpers dark said the us policy in the persian 
gulf was never a very good one to begin with and this incident 
this sort of thing was very predictable 
the magnitude of this tragedy demands we take another look at 
this policy he said in a cbs interview 
sen richard lugar rind also interviewed on cbs said the 
policy of trying to protect commercial shipping in the gulf is 
absolutely right

american flags were removed from a heathrow 
airport terminal for us flights on monday and some british 
lawmakers deplored the deadly us missile attack on an iranian 
airliner 
iran demanded a stronger antiamerican response 
prime minister margaret thatchers government expressed sorrow 
over the attack sunday on the iran air jet that went down with 
nearly 300 people aboard but also said it understood the us 
navys reason for shooting at the plane 
irans top diplomat in london charge daffaires mohammed basti 
hinted that the attack might endanger the lives of 18 western 
hostages believed held by proiranian extremists in lebanon 
the family of one of the british hostages anglican envoy terry 
waite appealed to iran not to retaliate against the captives 
in recent months britain and iran have been trying to improve 
their badly strained relations raising hopes of freedom for three 
britons missing in lebanon 
at heathrow airport police armed with submachine guns patrolled 
the terminals baggage loaded onto american airlines came under 
close scrutiny because of fears of iranian reprisals 
authorities removed american flags put up in honor of the fourth 
of july in a terminal that services most us flights an airport 
statement said it was a mark of respect for those who died 
mrs thatchers government issued a statement sunday night 
saying it profoundly regretted the disaster but backed the us 
navys right to defend itself 
navy officials said the airbus 300 was mistaken for an iranian 
f14 fighter jet as it flew toward the uss vincennes during a 
usiranian skirmish in the persian gulf all aboard the plane 
were presumed killed 
basti said he relayed irans dismay with the statement in a 
onehour visit monday to the foreign office and said it compared 
unfavorably with the responses of other western countries 
britain should immediately make a condemnation of this 
barbaric act and show that british statements are not only 
based on a special political relationship basti told reporters 
outside the foreign office 
asked whether the foreign hostages nine of them americans were 
now in greater jeopardy basti replied it is a natural human 
reaction people in the area they have seen this thing with 
their own eyes naturally they do not remain indifferent 
asked earlier at a news conference how iran would respond to the 
disaster basti said i do not disclose what kind of response 
but naturally i prefer a measured response to the magnitude of the 
crime 
several legislators from the governing conservative party and 
the opposition deplored the attack 
conservative lawmaker robert adley called the americans 
triggerhappy saying they are burdened with this massive 
firepower but they still have not learned the lessons of the 
vietnam war 
labors tom clarke who last month visited iran with an 
unofficial british delegation on a fencemending expedition 
complained that mrs thatcher might have distanced herself just a 
bit more than she did from the american action 
clarke told british broadcasting corp tv that the us response 
to what appears to have been a colossal mistake really should 
have been much more apologetic than it was 
waites brother john urged iran not to retaliate against the 
hostages 
two wrongs do not make a right he said 
i think the british nation is horrified by this appalling 
tragedy and i want to get that over to the iranians so that 
they dont feel isolated at least in their grief from the feelings 
that all civilized people have john waite said in a bbc 
interview 
terry waite disappeared in beirut in january 1987 while trying 
to win the release of western hostages 
the longestheld of the hostages is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped in 
beirut on march 16 1985

us house speaker jim wright said monday that 
while mistakes were made in the us navys downing of an iranian 
civilian aircraft with nearly 300 people aboard iran bears some 
responsibility for the incident 
the leader of the democraticcontrolled house also said that the 
issue warrants discussion in congress but that he accepted the 
administrations statements that the jetliners downing in the 
persian gulf was a regrettable mistake 
this is an awkward and uncomfortable situation for americans 
to be in the texas democrat told reporters at a hastily arranged 
news conference during a longplanned fiveday trip to london 
it was certainly never our intention in any instance to bring 
death to the gulf wright said it was a great tragedy 
obviously mistakes were made nobodys trying to minimize that and 
i dont believe the administration seeks to minimize that 
however wright said the iranians do bear some responsibility 
i think their government must realize that it places its 
civilians in jeopardy when it engages in military attacks on the 
sea at the very time a civilian aircraft is scheduled to fly over 
the sea 
us officials said the commander of the cruiser uss vincennes 
ordered the attack on the airliner on sunday after the plane which 
he believed was an f14 military jet ignored warnings while flying 
in a combat zone all aboard are presumed dead 
wright who earlier met separately with prime minister margaret 
thatcher and foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe refused to say 
whether he wanted to see congressional debate on the incident but 
said he expected discussion on the issue it warrants it 
but he said it was more important to close ranks and 
defended the us commander involved capt will c rogers 
he was responsible for the lives of the men on his ship 
and he must have been mindful of the stark incident when 
an iraqi plane fired on the frigate the uss stark killing 37 men 
in may 1987 
washington accepted iraqs apology and explanation that it had 
mistaken the stark for an iranian warship 
asked if president reagans statements of regret had not been 
sufficient as some british newspapers and politicians have said 
wright replied i take his expressions of deep and sincere regret 
at the loss of human lives at face value i dont know what more 
you expect him to do 
wright said mrs thatcher was very supportive and completely 
understanding of our anguish during their 40minute meeting 
he and an official from mrs thatchers office who was not 
identified according to british custom said the issue was touched 
on briefly during their talks of bilateral relations the us 
trade bill and other topics 
a foreign office official also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said howe and wright spoke briefly on the subject of the 
airliner during their 40minute meeting he said they talked mostly 
of northern ireland and us politics

the us and iranian versions of the downing 
of iran air flight 655 differ on at least three major points 
including whether the jetliner was warned and whether it was 
outside a commercial air corridor 
the two nations also contradicted each other on whether the navy 
cruiser vincennes knew the plane was a commercial airliner with 
the united states saying no and the iranians saying yes 
in addition to those points there are a number of unanswered 
questions in the wake of sundays missile attack on the iranian 
airbus in the strait of hormuz which iran said killed 290 persons 
at a news conference sunday confirming that the united states 
had shot down the plane adm william j crowe jr chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff said the vincennes sent seven warnings to 
the airbus three on civilian radio channels and four on military 
channels none were answered he said 
mohammad jaafar mahallati irans ambassador to the united 
nations said monday that we definitely reject that there has 
been any warning and this case could be verified by international 
independent investigation 
mahallatis comments were made on abctvs good morning 
america 
the us contention was partially supported by the italian navy 
which was escorting an italian cargo ship through the strait at the 
time 
the italian naval vessel espero heard the vincennes send four 
radio warnings to the pilot of the iranian plane but there was no 
response according to a navy official in rome 
the italians didnt say if the four broadcasts were the military 
warnings referred to by crowe nor did the italians say if their 
radios were monitoring commercial traffic 
crowe said the plane was hit by one missile the iranians say it 
was struck by two 
the planes location and height at the time of the attack also 
were subjects of disagreement 
crowe said the iranian plane was four or five miles outside the 
established air corridor for the heavily traveled region that 
statement was also supported by the italian naval officials 
but mahallati rejected the us argument it was indeed in 
the recognized corridor he said 
in addition us officials said the plane was at 9000 feet 
but the official islamic republic news agency said the airliner was 
at 7500 feet 
the third major contradiction is whether the navy knew what it 
was shooting at crowe said navy officials believed the plane was a 
usmade f14 flown by iran 
but mahallati said it was a premeditated attack it was a 
coldblooded murder 
abc news quoted pentagon sources monday as saying the captain 
ordered a check of civilian air schedules in the area but that the 
check was not completed at the time the plane was shot down the 
flight left nearly an hour late the report said 
president reagan on monday described the incident as an 
understandable accident asked about iranian claims the 
president declared well i dont go much by what the iranians 
say ever 
reagan returning to the white house from the presidential 
retreat at camp david md said were talking about an incident 
in which a plane on radar was observed coming in the direction of a 
ship in combat and the plane began lowering its altitude and so i 
think it was an understandable accident to shoot and think that 
they were under attack from that plane 
reagans statement raised one of the unanswered questions which 
had been first asked sunday after crowes statement that the plane 
was descending toward the vincennes 
if the plane had just taken off from bandar abbas enroute to 
dubai as iran claimed it likely would not have been descending at 
the point where it was hit said a pentagon source who declined to 
be identified 
id wait until the investigation is completed before i flatly 
accepted the statement that it was descending cautioned the 
source who had been stationed in the persian gulf 
another unanswered question is why the aegis air defense system 
aboard the vincennes was unable to distinguish the airbus from the 
much smaller f14 fighter jet the navy repeated has described 
aegis as the worlds most sophisticated electronic defense system 
that could differentiate among different fighters 
also unclear is whether the planes transponder was working and 
if not why not 
transponders used routinely on all commercial flights 
continuously broadcast identification information about a plane 
according to a spokesman for the international civil aviation 
organization that information includes the name and number of the 
flight along with type of aircraft 
another open question is what the united states and iran will 
each do now 
reagan noted ive ordered an investigation and im going to 
wait until i hear the result of the investigation 
after the incident reagan said our sympathy and condolences 
go out to the passengers crew and their families 
but the united states has not yet formally apologized to iran 
the two nations have not had formal diplomatic relations since 
1980 when they were broken by the united states also unanswered 
is whether the united states will pay reparations 
however nbc nightly news reported monday that the united states 
had sent private messages to iran repeating what it had said 
publicly that the shooting down of the airliner was a mistake 
the network also said administration lawyers are looking into the 
issue of compensation for the families of the victims 
as for iran it has vowed revenge president ali kahmeini said 
we wish to warn that the american government will have to suffer 
the consequences of its recent crime in the persian gulf 
earlier tehran radio said the criminal united states should 
know that blood unlawfully shed in the disasterwill be avenged 
in the same bloodspattered sky over the persian gulf

the least effective thing to take to martha 
clarkes onehour miracolo damore is a logical mind 
miracolo damore with women tiptoeing around nude men in 
hunchback white costumes of commedia dellarte and dialogue in 
italian doesnt lend itself to being analyzed 
when it opened at the spoleto festival usa in charleston 
sc earlier this summer some walked out because of the nudity 
now its at the offbroadway newman theater in the public theater 
complex as part of the first new york international festival of 
the arts at the soldout weekend performance we attended nobody 
walked out until the end but some walked out bewildered 
the program credits clarke with the idea and direction adding 
created with the 15member company her most recent 
offbroadway theater piece was the garden of earthly delights 
an acting out with music and dance of a hieronymus bosch painting 
miracolo damore seems an acting out in many brief scenes 
with music of a number of paintings visual images many of them 
macabre stay in the mind more than observations about love 
four nude women hold hands and move in a circle like a delicate 
childs game they return to the stage clothed in white gowns as 
flowers a pansy covers the bodice of one daisy petals cover the 
head of another one wears a bikini of camellias 
light designed by paul gallo comes in faint diagonal streaks 
as carefully controlled as in paintings 
one stage wall is a building possibly a house of assignation 
with a door and window couples often disappear into this door the 
opposite wall has a high window there sits a woman with four arms 
one assumes theres somebody behind her at another time a woman 
sits there embracing a skeleton the skeleton is later carried 
around by other people 
a blind soprano walks in and out and sings a few sex acts are 
portrayed more of the time there are scenes like a man leaning 
against a wall as though being crucified a boy feeding him 
spaghetti then the man moving away from the wall cawing his arms 
behind him like a big bird there are bird noises as well as wild 
offstage laughter off and on throughout the hour 
one dreamlike scene near the end has the stage covered with 
steam and the women on the floor looking like mermaids in mist in 
another scene the men have shotguns and kill each other 
remarkable minds have thought of all these theater pictures and 
organized the complex comings and goings but they havent 
communicated to everybody much about intent or meaning

energy minister fernando santos blamed the 
united arab emirates on monday for the sharp drop in world oil 
prices saying its announcement of increased production had the 
impact of an atomic bomb on the market 
the drop in crude prices is the result of the lack of 
discipline by one of the members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries santos said in a televised interview 
he was referring to the emirates announcement it was increasing 
its crude production to 15 million barrels a day from its opecset 
quota of 948000 barrels 
santos said the announcement had a devastating effect on the 
world oil market 
the commitment to a production ceiling is based on the 
understanding that all the countries must respect it if a country 
does not respect its quota the other 12 member countries will 
consider themselves free to produce as much as they consider 
necessary he said 
ecuador and the united arab emirates are among opecs 13 member 
nations 
santos said the average price of ecuadors oil has dropped from 
1419 a barrel since june 1 to 1283 a barrel on june 29 
with an average daily production of 300000 barrels ecuador is 
one of the smallest producers in opec but oil exports supply more 
than 60 percent of the countrys dollar earnings 
the government had based this years budget on an expected price 
of 17 a barrel santos said 
in manama bahrain it was reported monday that the biggest oil 
producer in the emirates abu dhabi has posted low prices for june 
retroactive crude oil sales without indicating any substantial cuts 
in july 
the reported action by the abu dhabi national oil co prompted 
speculation that the emirates was unlikely to overshoot its 
production quota as fixed by opec at least in the short term 
oil industry executives said the company in telexes sent to its 
termcontract customers set prices for its june delivery at 
between 110 and 113 lower than mays retroactive levels 
the stateowned oil refining and marketing company moved to 
retroactive crudeoil pricing in march after world oil prices 
substantially weakened and the company was unable to maintain 
official prices decreed by opec 
the sources who cannot be identified under standing rules said 
that since there was no indication of any pricing policy change in 
the telex it could mean the company meant to market sufficient 
volumes of crude oil this month to substantially boost oil output 
as recently threatened by emirates officials 
emirates oil minister mana said al oteiba said his country was 
rightfully entitled to 15 million barrels a day instead of the 
opec quota 
abu dhabi is the major oil producer among the seven emirates 
federated in the united arab emirates whose central government 
later supported oteibas statements 
but it has remained unclear whether the emirates planned to 
increase production at once or were only jockeying for position 
months ahead of the december biannual meeting of opec where 
production levels will come up for consideration 
officials in abu dhabi oil companies who spoke on condition 
they not be identified challenged reports that the emirates will 
increase their output in the near future in the face of the 
emirates standing demand for a higher opec quota 
it is the huge surplus in the market and the vast oil reserves 
in japan the uaes major oil importer which determines the size 
of uaes production and not adherence to opecs quota one 
official told the associated press 
denying reports that orders were given by the abu dhabi 
government to increase the companies july output the source said 
we have not received any order to this effect the abu dhabi 
government realizes that it cannot market any oil quantity over its 
present quota with a reasonable price 
the sources said japan was pressing for discounts both in the 
united arab emirates as well as in other persian gulf oilproducing 
states japan depends for more than 60 percent of its oil needs on 
the gulf

iranian commercial planes often fly into battle 
areas in the persian gulf putting their passengers at risk because 
the aircraft are not easily identifiable by us ships and 
aircraft a naval officer said 
rear adm rg zeller commander of training for the us 
pacific fleet returned sunday after a sixmonth tour in the 
wartorn region where he says civilian aircraft often fly the same 
path as military planes 
an iranian f4 a usmade phantom fighter would take off 
from bandar abbas and right behind it is a commercial aircraft 
zeller said sunday they would both take roughly the same route 
for awhile 
initially its very difficult to distinguish between the two 
we had to be awfully careful for obvious reasons 
zeller commanded the warship force that launched retaliatory 
strikes against two militarymanned iranian sea platforms april 18 
four days after the us destroyer roberts was damaged seriously in 
a persian gulf mine attack 
the airbus shot down sunday departed from bandar abbas iran it 
is believed that all 290 people on board the commercial jet died in 
the attack by the san diegobased uss vincennes 
us officials said the plane was outside civilian aviation 
corridors a claim military and aviation officials in iran denied 
of the attack zeller said frankly i dont know what to 
think vincennes capt will rogers is close personal friend and 
has been for 20 years 
adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
rogers had sufficient reasons to believe the cruiser was in 
jeopardy and fired justifiably in selfdefense 
asked if the attack on a civilian airliner would make ships 
hesitant to fire on approaching planes in the future zeller a 
28year navy veteran said you know as well as i do it will 
the ranking officers of the uss frigate stark were reprimanded 
after 37 sailors died when the ship was hit by a missile fired from 
an iraqi warplane on may 17 1987 us rep bill lowery rcalif 
said it was doubtful rogers would face a similar fate 
this was a tragic tragic mistake but one that i believe the 
skipper followed proper procedures in protecting the ship and 
crew lowery said 
rogers called a senior navy chaplain in coronado on sunday night 
to assure wives and family members of the crews safety 
he said all hands are safe and to please put the word out to 
the families said capt theodore atwood of the pacific fleet 
surface force headquarters in coronado 
the wives are relieved that their husbands are safe the 
chaplain said now we have to look for another side of this the 
emotional side it can have a very sobering effect 
rogers whose wife sharon and son will rogers iv live in san 
diego is not related to the late american humorist will rogers 
according to the humorists son will rogers jr

police said at least 42 protesters were arrested 
and three police officers hurt monday in demonstrations following 
the us missile attack that downed an iranian passenger jet and 
killed all 290 people aboard 
eleven people were arrested outside the us consulate and 
another 31 protesters were arrested after demonstrators moved 
downtown 
police said three officers were treated at a hospital for minor 
injuries 
one person was arrested after a cup of red paint was tossed at 
the consulate building and splattered a fashionable private club 
next door protesters said they used paint because they didnt 
have time to get real blood 
demonstrators smeared themselves with paint chanted and carried 
a black coffin 
protests began in the morning with about 50 people in front of 
the ontario legislature 
demonstrators originally planned to simply march to the us 
consulate but by midafternoon the group swelled to about 150 
people as those from antinuclear organizations and others joined 
in 
police said eight people were charged after they lay down in the 
street tying up morning rushhour traffic 
us officials said the airliner was attacked sunday in the 
mistaken belief it was an iranian warplane as it closed on us 
navy ships operating near the strait of hormuz in the persian gulf 
and did not respond to warnings

michael dukakis on monday urged iran to reconsider its threats 
to avenge the us shooting down of an iranian jetliner with 290 
people aboard george bush expressed his regrets about the tragedy 
but said the incident should not change us policy in the persian 
gulf 
jesse jackson meanwhile urged president reagan to offer 
reparations to the families of victims of the downed iranian jet 
saying an immediate goodwill gesture was needed to save the lives 
of us hostages held in lebanon 
both dukakis and jackson later focused their attention on the 
democratic ticket meeting for dinner at the massachusetts 
governors brookline home and later attending bostons independence 
day celebrations 
aides to the likely democratic nominee described the evening as 
a social gathering but said dukakis search for a running mate 
would likely be discussed asked about that afterward jackson 
said no comment and dukakis said we were talking about 
lots of things 
jackson has said he has decided whether he would accept a vice 
presidential offer but refuses to disclose his decision he 
contends that he deserves to be offered the no 2 spot on the 
ticket 
dukakis has said jackson is being considered but says he owes no 
candidate an offer 
jackson arriving in boston declined to say what the two would 
talk about other than party unity 
its a private conversation its a private meeting he told 
reporters at logan international airport hes the host were 
the guests 
at the charlestown navy yard dukakis departed from the prepared 
text of a fourth of july speech to appeal to iran not to try to 
seek revenge through terrorism he renewed his call for an 
international effort to end the nearly 8yearold iraniraq war 
while we all deeply regret the tragedy this is no time for 
acts of terror or revenge in response to the incident dukakis 
said at the berth of the uss constitution so i urge the 
government of iran to reconsider its threats and to join us and the 
entire international community to ending a war that already has 
taken the lives of more than one million people 
mohammad jaafar mahallati iranian ambassador to the united 
nations said the downing of the iran air airbus was premeditated 
and he called it coldblooded murder 
by definition it was an act of terrorism that should be 
severely punished he said 
the uss vincennes shot down the commercial jetliner on sunday 
while engaged in battle with iranian gunboats the pentagon said 
the vincennes crew believed the widebodied airbus was a smaller 
f14 fighter about to attack the ship 
clearly we have the right to defend our forces against 
imminent threat and apparently the shooting down of the airliner 
occurred over what appears to have been an unprovoked attack 
against our forces dukakis said 
vice president bush campaigning in the midwest spoke out for 
the first time on the incident expressing deep regret 
obviously as we celebrate our great national holiday our 
hearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who were lost 
and also hearts go out to those kids those young americans who 
are defending freedom halfway around the world he said 
the allbutcertain republican nominee said he believed us 
policy in the gulf will remain the same life goes on our 
mission goes on and the world keeps turning bush said 
the vice president continued his campaign schedule saying 
there is nothing i can be doing about this matter in washington 
dc 
however bush planned to attend a white house briefing on the 
gulf incident on tuesday according to aides 
prior to leaving chicago for his meeting with dukakis jackson 
said the shooting incident complicates the situation in the gulf 
region at a time when there were indications that forces in iran 
favoring negotiations were gaining strength 
i am sincerely concerned that we make a gesture of goodwill 
immediately so as to protect the lives of americans who are in the 
region specifically the americans who are held hostage there he 
said 
jackson urged reagan to go on television to express genuine 
regrets about the planes downing and offer reparations to the 
families to ease some of the pain the president has already said 
he deeply regrets the loss of life 
jackson also called on the reagan administration to reevaluate 
its middle east policy but said the united states should maintain a 
presence in the wartorn gulf 
we should not move out unilaterally the fact is they are 
international waters we do have a right to be there jackson 
said

an international airline group urged governments 
monday to cooperate with an inquiry into the us downing of an 
iranian jetliner and at least two airlines announced route changes 
to avoid the area of the incident 
the international air transport association said the 
montrealbased international civil aviation organization would 
conduct a full and objective investigation into the shooting 
down of the iran air airbus 300 by a us navy ship in the persian 
gulf on sunday 
the airline association deplored the use of force against a 
civil aircraft and strongly urges all governments to take the 
necessary steps to prevent recurrence of such incidents 
the international civil aviation organization a un agency 
said later monday that ali akbar golruni irans representative to 
the organization filed a formal request for an emergency meeting 
of the agencys council to set up an inquiry into the crash 
but organization president assad kotaite said his agency needs 
more information particularly from the united states before 
granting the request 
we have not received preliminary reports regarding the 
circumstances from the parties involved except from iran 
kotaite said 
in tokyo japan air lines said its twiceweekly flight from 
tokyo to athens greece would alter its route over the gulf to 
avoid the area where the shooting took place 
the airline said it will begin flying over abu dhabi in the 
united arab emirates instead of over dubai also in the same 
country but closer to iran and the strait of hormuz the iran air 
plane was flying to dubai from iran 
in hong kong cathay pacific airways said the daily hong kong to 
london flight also would alter its route over the gulf spokeswoman 
rebecca chan said hong kong carriers planes do not fly over the 
area where the iranian jet was shot down but the slight route 
change to the south will take aircraft even further from the spot 
a jal official speaking on condition of anonymity said a jal 
dc10 with 156 passengers and 16 crew members left tokyo for athens 
on monday using the new route 
officials from both companies said the route change will add 
about five minutes to the trip 
the united states said its forces mistook the widebodied iran 
air plane for a f14 fighter and shot it down when it failed to 
heed seven warnings

democrat michael dukakis renewed his call monday 
for an international effort to end the iraniraq war and urged iran 
to reconsider its threats to respond with terrorism to the us 
navys downing of an iranian passenger jet 
as long as this senseless war between iran and iraq continues 
as long as we and the entire international community fail to 
use our combined efforts to stop it there will be more tragedies 
more heartaches and the everpresent risk of more accidents in the 
persian gulf dukakis said 
the democratic presidential nomineetobe hosted rival jesse 
jackson for dinner at his brookline mass home before the two 
candidates and their wives attended the traditional fourth of july 
boston pops concert alongside the charles river 
aides billed the evening as a social gathering but said dukakis 
search for a running mate was likely to come up in discussion 
jackson skirted questions about likely dinnertable conversation on 
his arrival at bostons logan airport 
its a private meeting hes the host and we are the guests 
he told reporters 
arriving at dukakis home where he was greeted by a crowd of 
about 200 onlookers jackson was asked if the subject of a running 
mate would be discussed 
dinner dinner dinner he replied 
the massachusetts governor has said jackson is being considered 
for the no 2 spot on the ticket but it is viewed as highly 
unlikely that dukakis would offer it to him 
after the dinner dukakis emerged and told reporters we were 
talking about lots of things 
jackson said then he had no comment later arriving at his 
boston hotel he told reporters our conversation is private and 
should remain private 
at a morning appearance at the uss constitution the navys 
oldest commissioned warship dukakis departed from the text of his 
speech monday to demand an end to the nearly 8yearold gulf war 
i believe that the united states must take the lead to 
stop this war permanently dukakis said 
and while we all deeply regret the tragedy this is no time 
for acts of terror or revenge in response to the incident so i 
urge the government of iran to reconsider its threats and to join 
us and the entire international community in ending a war that 
already has taken the lives of more than one million people he 
said 
the uss vincennes downed the iran air airbus sunday during 
fighting with iranian gunboats presumably killing all 290 people 
aboard the commercial jet the pentagon reported that the vincennes 
crew believed the widebodied airbus was an f14 fighter about to 
attack the ship 
iran vowed to avenge the premeditated coldblooded murder 
and iranian president ali khamenei said monday that iran is ready 
to fight american aggression 
dukakis said the united states clearly has the right to defend 
our forces against imminent threats and apparently the shooting 
down of the airliner occurred over what appears to have been an 
unprovoked attack against our forces 
dukakis speech to a small gathering at the charlestown navy 
yard was a variation on his standard stump talk peppered with 
references to his immigrant past central campaign theme of 
economic opportunity and attacks on the reagan administration 
respect for the constitution and for the rule of law is the 
most basic the most conservative the most important principle of 
our democratic society dukakis said and it must begin at the 
top in the white house in the defense department and in the 
office of the attorney general of the united states 
he also paid tribute to the colonists who fought the 
revolutionary war for american independence 
ours was not just a revolution against one government 
dukakis said in his holiday speech it was a revolution of the 
human spirit and it lives wherever men and women are taking into 
their own hands the responsibility to build a better world 
the dukakis campaign said the menu for the dinner with jackson 
was standard new england fare homemade clam chowder fish and 
vegetables and chocolate cake for dessert

the nations largest teachers union endorsed 
overwhelmingly monday a proposal that each state name name at least 
one school district a learning laboratory where teachers could 
experiment and take the lead in improving schools 
hot dog you did it said mary hatwood futrell president of 
the national education association after the delegates gathered 
for their annual convention passed her pet proposal by voice vote 
futrell called the idea our most ambitious reform effort to 
date 
in a 45minute keynote address before 8227 delegates gathered 
for the neas annual convention futrell had urged teachers to 
establish a national network of innovative school districts 
such districts she said might do away with academic tracking 
finance schools by means other than property taxes experiment with 
more flexible scheduling or anything else it wanted to try in the 
name of reform 
in san francisco 3000 teachers gathered for the rival american 
federation of teachers annual convention adopted a similar program 
of school experimentation the aft plan called for establishment of 
thousands of schools within schools where groups of six or more 
teachers could try innovative educational ideas free of 
bureaucratic meddling 
aft delegates heard monday from pulitzer prizewinning 
sociologist paul starr who warned that education vouchers that 
would allow parents to choose between public or private schools at 
taxpayer expense are a recipe for inflation that would destroy 
public education 
in many ways the educational voucher proposals resemble third 
party payments in health care vouchers would encourage private 
schools in part to keep themselves exclusive he said third 
party payment is a recipe for inflation in any sector to introduce 
it into education would be fiscally reckless 
starr an authority on the economics of medical care said 
vouchers were an illusory tonic that would make the whole 
educational system far more stratified and ethnically 
fragmented 
teachers generally applauded the nea learning laboratories 
initiative but some expressed mixed feelings 
im a little afraid that it may be just another experiment it 
could be limited to districts that are already innovating said 
kathleen conklin who teaches english at malcolm x shabazz high 
school in madison wis 
chester finn assistant us secretary of education for research 
and improvement called the aft and nea reform programs 10 
percent good 90 percent bad 
that they are willing to admit that things arent hunkydory 
in schools that much is good he said in a telephone interview 
but the bad part is that they seem to suggest that we need to 
have a vast experiment as if we didnt know or have the faintest 
idea of what works in schools 
the reason these things dont happen is because the teacher 
unions wont let them happen he said 
both futrell and aft president albert shanker have said 
repeatedly that the real enemies of reform are the reagan 
administration which has failed to support schools with leadership 
and funds and states which have mandated educational change from 
on high without teacher input 
presidential politics was the second major theme in futrells 
address last week the nea board backed michael dukakis for the 
democratic nomination and futrell heaped praise on him as someone 
who understands and embodies the link between education and the 
american dream 
the nation needs a president who will give us a fair deal 
instead of an arms deal a drug deal or an insider deal she 
said a president who will invest more to make every american 
child a star than he will to fill gods heaven with star wars 
neither teacher union plans to make a final presidential 
endorsement until after the major party conventions this summer 
the aft delegates monday night reelected shanker 59 who was 
unopposed for his eighth twoyear term as president of the 
677000member union the delegates also reelected longtime aft 
secretarytreasurer robert g porter and filled 38 vice presidents 
posts including four new ones

army corps of engineers dredges worked to finish deepening the 
channel near greenville miss and memphis tenn 
the channel was closed monday night at tamm bend north of 
memphis after operators of the dredge burgess became worried that 
a barge would run into them coast guard spokesman dave schuster

peacefully 
also monday president corazon aquino said she ordered immediate 
solutions to a string of unresolved political murders in the 
capital 
violence erupted outside the seaside us embassy near the end 
of the threehour protest as some demonstrators hurled rocks and 
sticks at outnumbered riot police 
then two homemade bombs exploded showering police with shrapnel 
but causing only minor injuries five policemen and a female 
bystander received burns and small cuts 
we thought it was all over police lt col robert barbers 
told reporters there was no warning we just heard two loud 
explosions and they started throwing stones at us 
barbers said at least three homemade bombs spiked with oneinch 
nails were thrown at the police lines but one did not explode 
the demonstrators included students peasants factory workers 
teachers and at least one member of the house of representatives 
bonifacio gillego 
protest leaders cut their fingers with razor blades and signed a 
manifesto of eviction in blood telling the us government to 
dismantle the bases by 1991 when their current lease expires 
an american official received the document through the embassys 
reinforced steel gates 
come 1991 we are going to remove the bases if the americans 
do not remove them voluntarily gillego said in a speech an hour 
before the violence

us imperialism labor leader crispin beltran told the crowd 
there is no need to negotiate with them

naval base and four smaller installations the united states 
maintains in the philippines

constabulary chief maj gen ramon montano that she had demanded 
action on the unsolved murders the constabulary is the countrys

nationwide 
i told him that we really have to come up with a speedy 
solution of these cases otherwise people will lose confidence in 
us the president told reporters she said she arranged a meeting 
with national bureau of investigation officials 
at least 130 politically motivated murders have been committed 
in the capital since mrs aquino came to power in 1986 most remain 
unsolved

personalities on rightist death squads while the killings of 
policemen soldiers suspected civilian informers and government 
officials have been attributed by military and police authorities 
to urbanbased communist guerrillas

long before their forces shot down an 
iranian civilian jet over the persian gulf us navy officers said 
their constant fear was making a mistake in a war zone bustling 
with civilian activity 
iran said all 290 people aboard the iran air jet were killed 
sunday when the us guided missile cruiser vincennes fired at it 
during a routine flight from iran to dubai in the united arab 
emirates 
while not officially at war us sailors are in a combat 
environment where ships remain at a high state of alert for weeks 
on end and weapons are tested every few days 
there are many threats out here and maybe the worst one is 
the possibility of somebody making a mistake one ships

lumber dealer frank millers sales one day 
totaled a box of nails the john deere dealer in steele isnt 
selling anything bigger than lawnmowers a farm supply store in 
wilton is giving employees an extra day off each week 
everywhere on main street north dakota businessmen and bankers 
are crossing their fingers as they watch the skies for an end to 
the lingering drought that analysts estimate could cost the states 
economy as much as 3 billion this year 
ive never seen anything like it before said miller the 
83yearold owner of wing lumber who says most of his patrons 
these days are just looking for a good conversation 
business at the cenex farm supply dealership in wilton 24 miles 
to the east is off a third said manager ken vetter hes making 
ends meet selling air conditioners the hottest item of this 
searing summer 
with crops wilting and cattle going to market farmers arent 
coming in for the fertilizer and pesticides they normally need in 
the spring and early summer baling twine is plentiful with hay 
hard to come by farmers are buying a fraction of the twine they 
usually do vetter said 
i dont know how slow its going to get he said 
economists and crop specialists at north dakota state university 
estimated last week that the drought had destroyed 530 million 
worth of wheat and other grains and had cost livestock producers 
225 million 
in addition north dakota farmers could lose as much as 473 
million this year in government crop payments because of soaring 
commodity prices the researchers said 
the price support payment for wheat which was 153 a bushel 
before the drought would drop to an estimated 38 cents 
even with crop insurance and the sale of stockpiled grain 
farmers would lose an estimated 867 million in income this year 
experts hold out hopes of good yields from row crops such as 
beans and sugar beets in eastern north dakota where the drought is 
less severe but grain crops have been destroyed in parts of 
western and northcentral north dakota and damaged seriously 
elsewhere 
without significant government help those losses would ripple 
through a state economy that has been crippled since the early 
1980s by low crop and oil prices 
in the long run its a people problem said arlen leholm 
an economist at north dakota state university were going to be 
translating these sort of losses in our agriculturally dependent 
areas into a lot of human suffering 
nowhere will the impact of the drought be felt more keenly than 
on the main streets of the states small towns where merchants 
depend almost exclusively on farm business 
they already were struggling to survive because of the states 
tight economy and the increasing trend by farm families to shop in 
the states bigger cities 
wilton population 950 has lost a drug store and hardware store 
in recent years little is left in wing for its 200 residents 
except for the cenex dealership and a general store bar and cafe 
any business that does business with farmers is going to see 
reduced profits said wilbur mcginnis president of first state 
bank of wilton 
the drought is going to have a real hard effect on main 
street said joseph lamb president of the stateowned bank of 
north dakota 
no matter what the farm subsidies are obviously farmers 
are not going to have that extra money to buy items that are sold 
on main street 
what could save main street this fall and winter is a 
combination of rain government help high grain prices and the 
tenacity that has kept them going through lean economic times 
before 
no question it will be tough on the small businesses but 
there are a lot of them out there who are survivors said 
mcginnis 
theyve learned to survive no matter what were hoping 
theyll get through this period 
many farmers could make up for some of the crop income they will 
lose this year by selling grain they have in storage even if they 
have to pay off government loans to secure the grain they could 
make a profit 
in the meantime the reagan administration is being pressed to 
plow savings from the governments price support programs back to 
farmers to make up for crop losses 
if farmers who lost their crops get the government deficiency 
payments they expected before the drought the state would gain 
400 million officials say 
while the wheels of government turn main street waits to see 
what the rest of the summer and fall will bring but optimism 
remains even as the drought hangs on 
implement dealers make do repairing tractors instead of selling 
new ones vetters cenex dealership puts employees to work 
installing the central air conditioning systems for which it has a 
waiting list of five customers 
miller keeps opening up his lumberyard each day as he has for 
the past 20 years 
its just tough and its going to be that way for a while

home equity loans enjoying a boom in 
popularity because of changes in the tax law now account for more 
than 75 billion of total consumer debt a government study has 
found 
the federal reserve conducting its first comprehensive look at 
the new consumer credit lines found that some 3 million homeowners 
have home equity loans and that threefourths of all existing loans 
were taken out in the past two years 
the home equity loans are replacing second mortgages in 
popularity because they offer greater flexibility to consumers 
while second mortgages are extended for a specified period of 
time and require repayment of principal and interest in equal 
monthly installments home equity accounts are ongoing 
arrangements that allow the borrower flexibility in the size and 
timing of drawdowns and payments 
banks have aggressively promoted the new home equity loans 
through extensive advertising campaigns and attractive interest 
rates that have been significantly lower than on other types of 
consumer credit the study said 
the fed survey found that the average interest charged on a home 
equity loan in 1987 was 102 percent that compared to an average 
of 179 percent interest on credit card debt 142 percent for a 
24month personal loan and 105 percent average interest on a 
48month new car loan 
the relatively attractive finance rates on home equity 
accounts have created an incentive for consumers to use them both 
for new borrowing and to repay debts carrying higher interest 
rates the study said 
in fact the fed found that the most prevalent use of the home 
equity loans reported by 53 percent of all borrowers surveyed was 
to pay off other debt mainly credit card debt or auto loans 
the second largest use for the loans reported by 25 percent of 
borrowers was to raise cash for home improvement projects 
the biggest boost for home equity loans came from the tax reform 
act of 1986 the massive overhaul of the tax system which lowered 
tax rates by eliminating a variety of deductions while phasing out 
deductions on most consumer credit the law allowed continued 
deductions for loans secured by real estate 
the fed report said that many lenders have prominently featured 
the tax advanges of home equity loans in their advertising large 
banks have been spending more of their advertising budget on home 
equity loans than on any other loan product the report said 
consumer groups have charged that many banks have engaged in 
deceptive practices by advertising superlow rates while failing to 
explain that those introductutory rates will be in effect for only 
a short time banks have also been attacked for failing to disclose 
to consumers important information about the terms and conditions 
of the loans and the fees charged in connection with taking out the 
loan 
the fed survey did not specifically address these problems but 
it did provide these details on common characteristics of home 
equity loans 
the interest rate on the loans is a variable rate which is 
determined by adding a fixed margin to a specified rate 
threefourths of banks use the prime rate now 9 percent at major 
us banks the average margin is 18 percentage points that would 
mean the average home equity loan now has an interest rate of 108 
percent the survey found that some banks werent asking for 
anything above the prime rate while at the other extreme some banks 
were charging 4 percentage points above the prime 
competition among lenders has prompted many of them to absorb 
some or all of the fees for opening home equity loans these 
charges include loan origination fees and closing costs for such 
items as a title search property appraisal credit report and 
title insurance in 1987 8 percent of large banks and savings and 
loans charged no fees and 68 percent waived some fees 
most lenders limit the maximum line of credit to between 70 
percent and 80 percent of the homeowners equity defined as the 
appraised value of the home less all mortgage indebtedness within 
those boundaries banks usually established a minimum amount for a 
home equity credit line of 5000 and a maximum of 100000 
most lenders a total of 90 percent allowed customers to draw 
down the credit line by check smaller percentages of lenders 
allowed access to the credit line by telephone automatic teller 
machines and credit cards the average minimum for each drawdown 
was 300

organizations of consumers and fire chiefs have 
asked the federal government to act on what they call an imminent 
fire hazard in 210000 ford vans and ambulances caused by 
inadequate repairs 
the center for auto safety and the international association of 
fire chiefs released statements sunday saying the national highway 
traffic safety administration has neglected the problems they sent 
separate letters friday to transportation secretary james burnley 
last year in response to reports of fuelsystem problems that 
caused fires ford recalled 193000 198387 e250 and e350 model 
econoline vans and 16000 198387 ambulances built on the e350 
econoline chassis 
ford spokesman chuck snearly said the automaker believes the 
modifications performed under the recalls are doing the job they 
were intended to do and we are making every effort to complete 
these recalls as quickly as possible 
but the center for auto safety a washingtonbased group often 
at odds with the auto industry and its regulators petitioned nhtsa 
on may 10 to order a new recall of the ambulances because of 
improperly installed hoses that may have caused coolant to leak and 
set fire to engines 
we have concerns that the nhtsa has not responded to our may 
10 defect petition and at the same time fires on ford ambulances 
are occurring better than one per week across the country cas 
spokesman robert dewey said from washington dc 
fewer than 10 percent of the ford vans were repaired within 
seven months of the initial recall and 21 ford ambulances 
including three that were repaired under the recall have caught 
fire since march 24 dewey said 
warren e isman president of the fire chiefs group criticized 
the lack of assertive action by nhtsa 
since fire and emergency services provide over 60 percent of 
the prehospital emergency medical care in this country we are in 
double jeopardy because we also respond to the vehicle fires 
isman said in the letter to brimley 
it is difficult to fully protect the public when emergency 
response personnel themselves are not safe isman said 
on june 24 the american ambulance association a

nearly a year after he began his 
firsthand study of the capitalist system soviet economist mikhail 
popov says hes ready to put his knowledge to work as part of the 
sweeping reform in his homeland 
i will use the ideas of american scholars said popov a 
regional economist for the siberian branch of the soviet unions 
academy of sciences many of them are new and uptodate and not 
available in the soviet union 
popov has studied such capitalist cornerstones as rents 
interest rates and prices since his arrival last september at west 
virginia universitys regional research institute under an 
international exchange program 
when i look at things in the united states i usually think 
how can i use them to restructure our economy popov said i 
also look at the history what worked and what didnt 
during an interview on the eve of his scheduled fourth of july 
departure the 35yearold expert on soviet industrial production 
said he was anxious to share his experience with colleagues who are 
intimately involved in perestroika soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs effort to overhaul the soviet system 
popov said his study of the decline of the steel industry in 
pittsbugh and of coal mining in appalachia could help ease the 
transition of the kuzbass region of siberia where much of the 
countrys heavy industry once was centered 
we have similar problems in some areas and wanted to look at 
the tremendous changes that have occurred in pittsburgh for 
example and study the optimal way to shift from basic industries 
to hightech popov said 
gorbachev began pressing for the restructuring of soviet society 
shortly after taking office three years ago 
last week during a national meeting of the communist party he 
called for democratization economic reform and changes in the 
soviet political system that he said would make perestroika 
irreversible 
perestroika really is an expression of our society popov 
said it just didnt happen with a change of leadership it was 
inevitable a natural evolution of the socialist system 
we couldnt have avoided it he concluded 
some commentators in the us have said gorbachevs attempts to 
introduce market mechanisms into the soviet system prove that 
communism is doomed others in the soviet union say gorbachev has 
gone too far too quickly 
popov an unabashed gorbachev supporter said he disagreed on 
both counts 
im not afraid that we will lose the main ideas of 
socialism said popov if someone is willing to produce much 
more than the other guy and works harder he deserves to be 
rewarded 
that doesnt threaten socialism at all 
during his stay popov also has presented several papers on the 
soviet economy visited penn state university and the massachusetts 
institute of technolgy and given dozens of lectures

solar energy and fuels made from crops can 
help combat the greenhouse effect that some scientists claim is 
partly responsible for this years drought say officials at the 
solar energy research institute 
but scientists at the institute caution that it will take 
several decades to reverse damage already done to the environment 
there is no quick fix thats one of the very scary things 
about global weather change said dr tom bathe manager of 
seris office of analysis and evaluation 
scientists say the greenhouse effect is caused by pollutants 
created by the burning of fossil fuels carbon dioxide represents 
about half of the pollutants other gasses such as nitrous oxide 
and methane comprise the rest 
the pollutants create an envelope around the earth that does not 
allow reflected heat to leave the atmosphere and causes 
temperatures to grow warmer 
james hansen climatologist at nasas goddard institute of space 
sciences told the senate energy committee recently that the 
greenhouse effect will make droughts like this years more 
likely 
he and other scientists have said that 1988 is likely to set a 
record for global average temperatures scientists have observed 
that the four hottest years to date globally all have occurred in 
the 1980s 
worstcase scenarios by scientists show average temperatures 
rising 3 to 9 degrees by the middle of the next century and seas 
rising about a foot as the polar icecaps melt 
even if we were able to shut off all the carbon dioxide and 
methane produced today we would still face significant change in 
the worlds weather because of the existing greenhouse bathe 
said 
congress created seri when oil prices shot up in the 1970s its 
mission was to find clean energy sources that would be alternatives 
to fossil fuels staff and budget cuts during the reagan 
administration have taken a toll on the agency but its scientists 
are continuing their research 
some seri proposals for curbing the greenhouse effect 
include 
widespread use of biomass liquid fuels from crops the crops 
would absorb as much carbon dioxide while they are being grown as 
they would produce when burned as transportation fuels 
use of photovoltaic cells manmade silicon chips that 
chemically convert natural light to electricity to replace fossil 
fuelfired power plants 
using thermal systems which convert heat captured directly 
from the sun to replace fossilfuel heat sources 
although coal is the biggest carbon dioxide producer among the 
fossil fuels everybody expects coal to be the most rapidly 
expanding component in the future bathe said

years in reviving troubled companies in the refining and chemical 
industries in april cain sold cain chemical co to occidental 
petroleum corp for 125 billion in cash and the assumption of 1 
billion in debt 
the times said the involvement of cain is likely to give the
