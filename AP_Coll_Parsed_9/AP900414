about 200 college students marched through 
this northern new jersey community friday hoping to defuse 
tensions that flared following the fatal shooting of a black 
teenager by a white policeman 
we sympathize with the death of phillip pannell said walter 
fields an official with the bergen county chapter of the naacp 
we dont condone the violence but we do thoroughly understand the 
anger 
pannell 16 of nearby river edge was shot and killed tuesday 
night by teaneck police officer gary spath who was responding to 
an anonymous telephone tip that a teenager had drawn a gun on 
another youth 
in another development the new york times reported in its 
saturday editions that phillips companions said he had been 
handling a bb pistol before officers confronted them 
the newspaper reported that several youths interviewed 
separately said that phillip was fooling around with the bb gun 
when police approached the group 
pannell put the gun in his coat pocket and took off running just 
before police intended to frisk him and the others the youths told 
the newspaper 
it was then that the officer shot killing pannell they said 
police have said they recovered a loaded 22 caliber gun from 
pannell another youth however told the times that another 
youngster carried the bb pistol away 
spath has since been suspended with pay and his partner wayne 
blanco has been temporarily relieved of his duties acting bergen 
county prosecutor john holl said 
a grand jury is scheduled to begin hearing testimony on the case 
on tuesday 
franklin wilks an attorney representing pannells mother 
thelma pannell held a news conference later friday to release 
details of an independent medical examiners report 
wilks said the report corroborates eyewitnesses who said pannell 
had his arms up in the air at the time he was shot in the back 
witnesses said pannell was running away from police when he was 
shot police said a loaded pistol was found on his body 
wilks said he had not seen a report by the bergen county medical 
examiner which found the boy had been killed by a single shot in 
the back 
a peaceful candlelight vigil wednesday night in remembrance of 
the slain youth turned violent as mostly black teenagers roamed 
local streets smashing store windows and overturning cars 
much of the damage remained visible friday plywood had replaced 
what used to be windows in many businesses along teaneck road 
the students who walked through teaneck were members of the 
union of african student organizations which represents 14 
colleges in northern new jersey they included blacks hispanics 
and whites 
the students set out from the teaneck campus of fairleigh 
dickinson university winding through the township and up teaneck 
road to tryon park close to where phillip was killed the event 
did not disrupt traffic and the group had no police escorts 
during the threehour march participants talked with residents 
and merchants fields said 
we tell them were here because were concerned fields 
said whats needed now is healing we need to come together as a 
community 
at tryon park a human chain was formed around the perimeter of 
a basketball court salaam ismial state coordinator of the union 
of african students organization and fields thanked the crowd for 
its support 
we have to some way somehow find a way to live with one 
another ismial said its unfortunate that it took the death 
of a young man to bring us all together 
fields said he has asked teenagers in teaneck to stay indoors 
during the weekend he said he was convinced that tensions were 
still high in the community which has prided itself on being one 
of the first to voluntarily desegregate it schools in the 1960s 
we havent really reached the emotional peak of this incident 
yet he said its going to be an emotional weekend

wolf creek nuclear power plant officials 
found a nickel in the watercooled atomic reactor and are trying to 
determine if someone treated the vessel as a wishing well 
the coin was discovered wednesday during routine refueling and 
maintenace work about 25 feet down inside the reactor vessel 
were not sure how it got there in the first place whether it 
was accidental or done on purpose ronn smith a spokesman for 
wolf creek nuclear operating corp said friday 
workers tried to retrieve the nickel by lowering down a piece of 
lead with tape on it they momentarily snagged it but it broke 
loose and fell deeper smith said 
smith said analysts believe the coin will not pose a hazard or 
affect the operation of the reactor the nuclear regulatory 
commission has been informed he said 
the reactor vessel lies in a refueling pool of water used to 
help shield workers from radioactivity and protect the fuel rods 
its top section has been removed for the replacement of fuel rods 
the coin had fallen through the 23footdeep water and about 25 
feet inside the vessel a craneoperated bridge spans the pool and 
is placed directly over the reactor vessel when work is being done 
someone might have dropped the coin from the bridge or from 
elsewhere in the reactor containment building smith said

relax worried parents the national 
aeronautics and space administration its face red over a memo that 
fell off the vine says its safe for your kids to grow tomatoes 
from outer space 
even eat them if they must 
ive never heard of a killer tomato and i dont think weve 
got a killer tomato plant here either said alvin young director 
of the agriculture departments biotechnology office thats 
hollywood script stuff 
the space agency suffered a public relations crisis friday over 
a memo raising the possibility that tomatoes grown from 
spaceradiated seeds might be poisoned some 120000 packets of the 
seeds were distributed to 58000 teachers to be grown by their 
students 
the project is a safe and valuable educational outreach 
program said nasa it said it was assured by the agriculture 
department there were no food safety risks associated with the 
tomato seeds and fruits they produced 
but the memo from nelson j ehrlich obtained by the los angeles 
times said there is a remote possibility that a mutation could 
occur causing the plants to produce toxic fruit 
ehrlich is associate director for aerospace services at oklahoma 
state university which oversees nasas school programs and his 
memo was addressed to other supervisors of the project 
tomatoes ehrlich explained belong to the nightshade family of 
plants notorious for the production of toxic substances such as 
scopolamine atropine belladonna nicotine and solanine 
moreover he said foliage of the entire family is toxic 
nasa reacted by calling a news conference to say all is well it 
produced a new letter from ehrlich saying i have no evidence to 
support my statement other than the fact that the mechanism for 
toxin generation is present in tomatoes 
and said ehrlich he in no way intended to infer project 
participants would risk their lives by eating tomato fruits 
kenneth s pederson an associate administrator of the space 
agency told reporters i will be happy to eat the tomatoes my 
daughter is a schoolteacher her school is growing the tomatoes 
our whole family is going to eat the tomatoes 
young said raising the tomatoes is safe but that hed prefer 
that schoolchildren replant the seeds to carry out the experiment 
rather than eat them 
the possibility of a child having an allergic reaction to 
tomatoes grown from the seeds is very remote he said 
i realize we are going to put 12 million seeds out there 
potentially but i really doubt that the number is going to be big 
enough for us to produce a toxic mutation young said he added 
theres no 100 percent assurance however 
there is no more danger from eating these tomatoes than from 
eating those you find in a grocery store said jim alston 
research director for park seed co of greenwood sc which 
supplied the seeds in 1984 there is no radiation inherent in the 
seeds 
alston said radiation counters showed absolutely nothing 
when the seeds were returned to earth in january 
i am a parent i have kids he said if my kid was 
participating i would have no hesitation for them handling 
them 
the seeds were in one of 57 experiment trays fastened to the 
outside of a 12sided frame that had been in orbit since 1984 when 
it was retrieved in january by space shuttle columbia 
the satellite named the long duration exposure facility was 
testing a number of different materials to determine how they 
withstood the rigors of space

a food and drug administration milk survey has 
found traces of sulfa drugs in most of samples tested but the 
agency says all were far below levels that would threaten public 
health 
the fda said friday that three of the 70 samples tested also 
were found to contain traces of sulfamethazine which is not 
approved for use in lactating cows because it may cause cancer at 
some levels 
the traces while not of safety concern nevertheless show 
that a few dairy farmers or veterinarians have improperly used the 
drug the agency said 
the study suggested milk from only a few animals that are 
being treated improperly is reaching the market 
fiftyeight of the 70 samples contained some traces of the sulfa 
drugs but at levels of only 1 part per billion to 3 ppb the agency 
considers 10 ppb the level of public health concern 
the three samples containing sulfamethazine also showed that 
chemical present at concentrations of 1 ppb to 3 ppb the agency 
said 
the fda said it held the dairy industry and veterinarians 
responsible for any illegal use of the specialized drugs 
fridays milk survey completes an fda study started in february 
after the center for science in the public interest a consumer 
advocacy group said it found milk samples in 14 metropolitan areas 
contaminated with antibiotics and sulfamethazine 
the agency said it planned to propose eliminating sulfamethazine 
use in other animals used for food because the drug is a suspected 
carcinogen 
rep ted weiss dny chairman of the human resources 
subcommittee of the house government operations committee said the 
fda intentionally in february when it said the sample contained no 
antibiotics weiss said the agency knew 58 were contaminated below 
10 ppb 
he said the subcommittee staff would investigate the agencys 
actions

in the israeli town of kfar chabad a 
tudorstyled anomoly rises amid the holy lands jumble of ancient 
and modern edifices 
it is a replica of another building 6000 miles away at 770 
eastern parkway in brooklyn the headquarters of menachem mendel 
schneerson the 88yearold leader of the lubavitcher hasidim 
it is also a symbol of the fealty of schneersons followers 
that loyalty some political observers say this week scuttled an 
attempt by the labor party to form an israeli government 
two members of the knesset refused to back labor citing 
schneersons opposition to trading land for peace a cornerstone of 
the labor platform 
schneerson has again obstructed the formation of a government 
in israel allan nadler who teaches jewish studies at mcgill 
university in montreal complained in a column in the new york 
times today 
once again the parliament finds itself in the stranglehold of 
an orthodox rabbi for whom the welfare of the state of israel is 
entirely subordinate to parochial theological considerations 
nadler wrote 
rabbi yehuda krinsky a spokesman for schneerson denied that 
schneerson had issued any dictum to the rebellious legislators the 
rebbe or grand rabbi had not talked to either he said and had 
taken no sides in israels political crisis 
schneerson did comment obliquely on the landforpeace issue 
in a speech several weeks ago and one of the two legislators 
rabbi avraham verdiger called the rebbes office to ask if 
schneerson had changed his position 
told he had not verdiger repudiated labor on his own 
initiative krinsky said lubavitch has not been involved in 
any of the political horsetrading thats going on 
schneersons name has come up in previous israeli controversies 
opponents claimed that he was behind efforts to amend the law so 
the converts of nonorthodox rabbis would not gain automatic 
citizenship in israel 
in the united states his followers have earned the enmity of 
other jewish groups by supporting moments of silent prayer in 
public schools and by pressing for the right to erect hanukkah 
menorahs in public places 
the man at the center of these disputes is a small figure 
distinguished by his black fedora white beard and penetrating blue 
eyes 
born in russia an immigrant in 1941 he has never been to 
israel in fact apart from twiceyearly visits to his 
fatherinlaws grave in queens he has not left brooklyn at all 
since he took office in 1950 
schneerson is the seventh in the line of lubavitcher rebbes 
going back to his greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather rabbi 
schneur zalman an acolyte of the founder of hasidism the baal 
shem tov 
the lubavitchers like other hasidim are pious folk the men 
wear black and are bearded the women cut their hair and wear wigs 
after marriage 
but unlike the others the lubavitchers are outwardlooking 
eager to persuade other jews to become more observant 
schneerson has presided over a rapid expansion of the 
lubavitcher universe more than 1000 chabad houses have been 
established around the world to spread the word the rebbes 
speeches sometimes extending six hours are sent by satellite to 
cable systems around the world recreational vans known as 
jewish tanks roam the country to promote jewish ritual 
lubavitcher officials claim a million followers around the 
world others dispute that figure but agree that the movement is 
influential 
lubavitch is the single most powerful movement in the jewish 
world said rabbi irving greenburg an orthodox rabbi and critic 
of the lubavitchers who heads the center for learning and 
leadership 
schneerson is the movements soul more than 125 volumes of his 
talks writings and correspondence have been published his 
pictures hang everywhere in israel his advice is sought on all 
matters whether a couple should marry the solution to a business 
question even says krinsky the answer to complex mathematical 
problems 
his followers recall seemingly miraculous consequences of 
schneersons suggestions lives that were saved babies that were 
born marriages that were made 
these stories have led some to ask whether the rebbe is actually 
the messiah come to earth to redeem the jews 
such talk outrages other jewish leaders schneerson has never 
claimed to be the messiah krinsky says only that if the messiah 
should come the rebbe said to be a descendent of king davids 
would be qualified 
krinsky says there can be no dispute about one thing theres 
no greater spiritual leader in the world jewish community

fire investigators have been able to 
pinpoint where a hotel fire that killed nine elderly people 
started but not how 
they have ruled out arson however in the april 6 fire at the 
residential fontana hotel 
we have sifted and gone through practically every foot of dirt 
and debris that was in the building it was not a set fire 
malcolm brady chief of the miami office of the us bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms said friday 
nearly 100 residents were left homeless by the deadliest fire 
ever in the oceanside city 
investigators are certain the fire started in a crawl space 
below the third floor of the 102room hotel where residents had 
reported a water leak and plumbers had been working less than 24 
hours earlier brady said 
however after more than 250 interviews expert analysis of burn 
patterns and a search by an accelerantsniffing dog state and 
federal fire investigators failed to pinpoint the cause of the 
blaze 
its tremendously frustrating for all of us to arrive on a 
scene thats taken nine lives and not to be able to come to you 
conclusively and say this is what caused it brady said 
the blaze was so intense that temperatures reached more than 
1200 degrees steel melted and and crucial evidence was destroyed 
brady said 
it probably smoldered in that crawl space for a number of 
hours literally consuming itself until it ignited brady said 
some of the evidence we needed is gone forever 
authorities have identified all nine bodies recovered from the 
threestory hotel located between the citys trendy art deco 
district and a strip of luxury highrise condominiums 
investigators dont expect the death toll to rise five other 
occupants reported as missing after the fire have since been 
located 
all nine victims ranging in age from 75 to 93 died of smoke 
inhalation said dr katherine berg of dade county medical 
examiners office 
more than 60 searchers including arson experts from the atf and 
city and state fire marshals offices took part in the 
investigation and workers continued to comb through the blackened 
shell of the building friday

the agriculture department says a 
billiondollar credit program that allows iraq to buy us farm 
commodities has been suspended until usda completes an 
investigation of possible financial irregularities 
undersecretary richard t crowder who oversees international 
affairs and commodity programs said in a brief statement friday 
that the department is continuing its administrative review 
begun several months ago into transactions relating to past 
credit programs with iraq 
crowder said iraqi authorities are cooperating in the 
investigation and that a us team will be in baghdad soon to 
continue the discussions 
meanwhile he said additional commitments of export credits 
will await the conclusion of this administrative review 
the action involves the export credit guarantee program which 
provides shortterm credit guarantees for up to three years the 
government does not lend any money but acts as a backup for 
exporters and commercial banks 
kelly shipp press secretary for agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said the departmental team plans to be in iraq next week 
she said the irregularities appear to involve pricing and shipping 
procedures she did not offer specifics 
for the current fiscal year that began last oct 1 iraq was 
allocated a credit line of 1 billion she said only 500 million 
has been used and the rest is being held up until the 
investigation is completed 
shipp said the investigation began last october and has nothing 
to do with another snarl of financial problems involving iraqs 
credit operation with banca nazionale del lavoro or bnl in rome 
in that case bnls branch in atlanta ga allegedly ran up a 
3 billion credit exposure with iraq italys treasury minister 
guido carli said last september the agriculture departments 
export credit program was said to have guaranteed part of that 
amount 
the justice department and others reportedly are investigating 
the bnl case

the white house is hoping a new 10day visa 
that wont require foreigners to reveal their aids status will end 
threats of a boycott of an upcoming international conference on the 
disease in san francisco 
but it was unclear whether the action will be enough to satisfy 
critics of us immigration restrictions 
i dont know whether theyll view this as sufficient said 
june osborn chairwoman of the national commission on aids but 
its something we can point to and say look were trying and in 
that i think it will be a reassuring signal to the rest of the 
world 
members of congress also said they were encouraged by the 
administrations action creating the new visa announced friday by 
the immigration and naturalization service but they also said the 
move was only a first step 
more needs to be done said rep j roy rowland dga 
sponsor of legislation that would clear the way for the 
administration to take aids off a list of diseases used to bar 
entry to the united states 
dozens of organizations worldwide have said they will boycott 
the san francisco aids conference in june in protest of us 
immigration policy that restricts entry of people infected with the 
human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids 
the world health organization an arm of the united nations is 
considering whether to withdraw its cosponsorship of the 
conference michael merson acting head of whos global program on 
aids said from geneva on friday night that he could not comment 
until he and other officials reviewed the administrations action 
rep henry waxman dcalif said that while the new visa was 
a first step he was troubled that it would be available only 
for those attending certain conferences deemed by the secretary of 
health and human services to be in the public interest 
will the administration be limiting visas to censor meetings 
they dont approve of he asked 
waxman a cosponsor of rowlands bill and chairman of a house 
health subcommittee said his panel will hold hearings on the 
legislation later this month 
administration sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said the white house has no plans to support the bill and 
supporters have said it has little chance to pass without such 
backing 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said it was premature for the 
administration to take a position on the bill 
rather than wait for what tends to be the molasseslike speed 
of congress to debate and vote on a piece of legislation we are 
taking actions that are immediate and effective she said 
the administration has said there is little it can do to ease 
immigration restrictions on people with aids because of an 
amendment offered by sen jesse helms rnc and passed by 
congress in 1987 the legislation put aids on the list of 
contagious diseases that can be used to exclude foreigners 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan who has 
authority to determine which conferences are in the public 
interest immediately certified two events under the new visa 
policy the sixth international conference on aids to be held june 
2024 in san francisco and the 19th international congress of the 
world federation of hemophilia to be held aug 1419 in washington 
dc 
it is important that we support the free exchange of 
scientific information across international boundaries sullivan 
said in particular when we confront a worldwide public health 
threat like aids researchers need to be able to share their 
findings quickly 
the current waiver policy ins adopted last year will remain in 
effect the agency said that allows people infected with hiv to 
visit the united states for up to 30 days to attend educational or 
medical conferences to receive medical treatment to visit close 
family members or to conduct temporary business activities as long 
as the person is otherwise admissible 
ins had been expediting that process for people who want to 
attend the san francisco and washington conferences

the drug situation in the nations capital is 
improving but city officials are not using all the available 
federal money says national drug chief william j bennett 
the situation remains far from acceptable to be sure but at 
the same time some things are moving in the right direction the 
national drug control policy director said at a news conference 
said friday 
i think its fair to say the record is mixed spotty 
incomplete not nearly as good as anyone would like but also not 
so bad as many people might imagine bennett said in assessing 
progress of a yearold federallocal antidrug effort in the 
district of columbia 
bennett said the citys record murder rate in 1989 was a 
bitter disappointment to all concerned but that the overall 
situation was not as negative as some had expected 
im not here to declare failure bennett said by a sober 
assessment of the merits i dont think thats warranted 
in 1989 438 persons were killed in the nations capital and 
police blamed a flourishing drug trade for more than 60 percent of 
the slayings 
bennett said signs of progress include decreases in the number 
of people arrested who test positive for drugs and of hospital 
emergency room patients who mention drug use 
but the drug policy coordinator said more progress might have 
been made if the city had taken better advantage of available 
federal money 
bennett said for example that the city failed to spend 85 
percent of 23 million in funding for special national guard 
anticrime assistance 
in all federal funding to city antidrug efforts has increased 
by 40 percent since last september and now is at a level 
twoandonehalf times the national average bennett said 
we chose dc for this effort because dc was on fire 
bennett said washington remains a federal priority in the war on 
drugs

poles tearfully accepted the soviet 
unions apology for the massacre of almost 15000 polish officers 
during world war ii but demanded reparations and more details of 
the killings 
its good that criminals admit their crimes solidarity 
leader lech walesa said in gdansk friday he called the soviet 
admission an act of moral justice which has been awaited for a 
long time 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev gave president wojciech 
jaruzelski documents showing that the secret police of soviet 
leader josef stalin killed the polish officers on soviet territory 
during world war ii 
jaruzelski on an official visit to moscow was to visit katyn 
today the area is in the smolensk forest in western russia where 
at least 4000 of the officers are buried in mass graves 
the soviet admission ended nearly 50 years of official soviet 
denials and had been almost a prerequisite for improved 
polishsoviet relations the soviet union had previously insisted 
that nazi germany was responsible for the massacre 
i awfully regret that my mother could not live until this 
day said wanda zadrozna crying as she recalled her fathers 
murder in the russian woods 
ms zadrozna said her father piotr was taken prisoner by the 
russians in 1939 when she was 12 years old she said her family 
received three letters from her father over the next year but 
never heard from him after 1940 
she said her mother helena krahelska kept a pair of shoes and 
a clean shirt ready for him for nine years despite growing 
evidence that he had been killed 
in 1943 nazis invading the soviet union unearthed mass graves 
in katyn filled with the bodies of the polish officers they had 
been shot in the back of the head and their bodies stacked one on 
top of the other 
this news was so horrible no one wanted to believe it we 
treated it as propaganda mrs zadrozna said 
but in 1948 mrs krahelska gave up hope that her husband would 
return home she died eight years ago never having been able to 
visit her husbands gravesite in the soviet union 
whatever happens now it is good that the truth will be 
finally written in history ms zadrozna said 
bozena lojek who helps lead an organization of victims 
relatives called the katyn family said she felt great joy now 
that after so many years the truth has been revealed her late 
husbands father was one of the officers who was killed 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said poland 
recognizes the significance of the official soviet statement but 
wanted more questions answerd 
we await an explanation of all the blank spots in our common 
history which the katyn crime symbolizes for us she said 
the bodies of more than 4200 officers interned by the soviets 
at kozielsk were uncovered in the forest but the remains of 
another 10000 officers who were captive at camps in starobielsk 
and ostashkow have never been found and their families still 
demand to know of their exact fate 
walesa said there must be punishment of those guilty of the 
genocide reparations for the officers families and access for 
poles to the victims graves 
in fridays government statement issued as gorbachev met with 
jaruzelski the soviet union clearly tied together the fates of the 
officers 
recently documents have been discovered which indirectly but 
convincingly testify that thousands of polish officers who died in 
the smolensk woods half a century ago became victims of stalins 
secret police chief lavrenti beria and his henchmen tass quoted 
gorbachev as saying at the meeting 
the officers were regarded as the cream of polands prewar 
society and many observers have said the soviets may have 
consdidered them a threat to the future communist leaders of poland

this quiet industrial town once had all 
its economic eggs in one basket brickmaking now part of its 
future is pinned to baskets of eggs 
not just any eggs easter eggs more specifically the colorful 
plastic grass that goes underneath them 
mount union in central pennsylvania is home to one of the 
nations leading producers of easter basket grass the plant where 
the crinkly grass is made helped revitalize the towns economy when 
it opened in 1979 a time when brickyard kilns were cooling from a 
downturn in building 
the 105 employees of the bleyer industries inc factory have a 
busy season from november to a couple of weeks before easter but 
the plant runs all year round branching into tinted plastic wrap 
at other times of the year with a reduced staff 
we made 18 million bags of grass this season said manager 
frank lukens weve been making about a million more bags each 
year 
liquid polypropylene arrives at the plant by rail and is 
converted to sheets of tinted plastic then stretched and run 
through 10 machines with slits spaced oneeighth inch apart lukens 
said the grass kinks when the tension is relaxed then handfuls 
are stuffed into 1 2 3 or 4ounce bags adorned with bunnies 
or the grass is rolled into 80pound bales 
the grass comes in pink yellow and green 
during the easter rush the plant runs 10 hours a day six days 
a week some large chocolate and gift makers such as russell 
stover candies in kansas city mo make their own grass to 
accompany their easter products 
more than 6000 people lived in mount union in the middle of the 
century turning clay from nearby mountains into bricks but the 
population steadily fell to the present level of 3000 as three 
large brick factories closed over the last 20 years the last in 
january 
the town went scrambling for replacement businesses and borough 
manager frank stasenko said it has succeeded in diversifying its 
economy in addition to the easter grass factory mount union is 
home to a plant that makes fiberglass tanks for gasoline stations 
and another that makes pipe fittings 
weve been as low as were going to get stasenko said 
lukens doesnt like to talk about the plant and no tours are 
allowed he wont say why the company prefers to keep a low profile 
one reason for the silence could be to discourage competitors 
from entering the easter grass market stasenko suggested another 
he said might be concern from environmentalists over what to do 
with the plastic grass when easter is over 
for that lukens has a solution 
save it my mother still has the easter grass from the basket 
i got when i was four years old he said

king birendra in his first reference to 
the bloody crackdown on prodemocracy protesters today expressed 
grief at the loss of life but he said politics in nepal had 
taken a new turn 
in a nationwide broadcast however the king made no reference 
to meeting friday with the principal opposition leader during the 
talks the king reportedly agreed to the formation of a new 
government led by the opposition 
the loss of life and destruction of property have saddened us 
we pray for the eternal peace of those who lost their lives in 
tragic circumstances birendra said in a television and radio 
broadcast on nepals new years day 
the government has said at least 10 people died and 107 were 
injured on april 6 when security forces fired on 200000 people 
protesting for a multiparty system witnesses said at least 200 
people were killed 
two days later birendra submitted to demands from the 
opposition alliance that led the 7weekold prodemocracy movement 
and lifted a 29yearold ban on political parties in his himalayan 
kingdom 
we have upheld the tradition of respecting the popular will 
and fulfilling the aspirations of the people birendra said 
politics in nepal has now taken a new turn 
but in his brief speech birenda did not mention his talks with 
ganesh man singh of the nepali congress party the hourlong meeting 
was the first between birendra and singh since the prodemocracy 
movement burgeoned in february 
in a statement the opposition said friday the king had agreed to 
allow the alliance to head a government until general elections are 
called it did not say when balloting would be held 
singh said the king agreed to discuss on sunday eight other 
conditions set by the alliance for participating in any interim 
government those include dissolution of the ational assembly and 
constitutional reforms 
birenda said a proposed commission on constitutional reform 
will consult elements of society professing different political 
views in the course of preparing its report 
the constitution gives the king absolute judicial executive and 
legislative powers the current government is largely a 
rubberstamp body controlled by the king and the national assembly 
is a partyless singlechamber body dominated by the kings nominees 
we are confident that proper understanding and respect for the 
norms of democracy by all nepalese will safeguard the values and 
ideals of democracy in nepal for all time to come birendra said 
may nepal and all nepalese live in security and be able to 
maintain their selfrespect said the 44yearold harvard 
educated monarch 
the nepali congress party president kp bhattarai said 
birendas speech was not complete we expected announcement 
agreeing to all the eight points and at least a mention of those in 
the speech 
we are not much disappointed because the liberal trend is 
there bhattarai said 
the nepali congress party formed nepals only westernstyle 
parliamentary government in may 1959 but was dismissed 20 months 
later by birendras father king mahendra on grounds of corruption 
and maladministration 
except for that brief period nepal has been ruled by the royal 
shah dynasty or the hereditary rana prime ministers since the 
mid18th century

through the colosseum in one of many good friday ceremonies 
worldwide marking jesus death on the cross 
the pope was to celebrate the easter vigil tonight and an 
openair mass on easter sunday in st peters square 
thousands holding candles in red paper cones watched friday 
night as the pontiff carried a 5foothigh cross from the colosseum

suffered as he walked to his crucifixion on calvary hill in 
jerusalem

indian ceremonial site in mexico was attended by hundreds of 
thousands thousands of pilgrims also retraced the traditional 
route of jesus death in jerusalems old city

to crosses for up to 10 minutes and others whipped themselves 
bloody the philippines is asias only predominantly christian 
nation 
all of us who belong to the priestly people of the new

andy valence will stand proud easter sunday 
as the jetty he fought so hard for protects his friends and 
neighbors on grand isle 
valence is mayor of the tiny island community of 2000 and the 
rock jetty that keeps the gulf of mexico at a distance is a rare 
victory over natural and manmade forces eating away at louisianas 
coastline 
at sunrise on easter services are planned for a spot that last 
summer was kneedeep in the waters of the gulf waters that later 
threatened an island motel 
valence was considered misguided at best when he proposed 
building a rock jetty to keep the gulf from destroying the island 
the experts shot him down but he persevered and after years of 
work recently completed much of the structure 
now valence said the rocks are doing exactly what they are 
supposed to be doing 
louisiana loses 30 to 50 square miles of coastline every year 
an acre every 15 minutes or an area the size of rhode island every 
30 years 
nowhere along the coast was the loss more apparent than about 50 
miles south of new orleans at grand isle the states only 
inhabited barrier island a strip of sand that served as 
headquarters for jean lafitte when the buccaneer was the scourge of 
english and spanish shipping almost 200 years ago 
grand isle along with the rest of louisianas coast once was 
replenished annually by sediment washing down the mississippi 
river but man built locks and dams for commerce and lined the 
lower river with levees to protect communities on its banks 
nature continues to send hurricanes against the island but the 
changes prevent silt from replenishing the sand that washes away 
experts said hard structures such as jetties and seawalls were 
selfdefeating that the waves would find the weak spots and wash 
away the sand there they pointed to failures in galveston texas 
around the florida peninsula and up the coast to fire island ny 
valence spent seven years in solitary study of winds and tides 
weather patterns and the different rates of scouring action on 
seashells he taught himself enough physics to answer the questions 
he asked himself and enough math and geometry to implement the 
answers 
while most people were sleeping or watching johnny carson i 
was out there walking a levee which has been under water since 
1985 he said id just sit there on the beach and study and 
think i guess i looked like a vagrant to some people 
eventually valence designed a t shaped jetty the arms 
intended to disrupt the relocation of wave energy he planned it to 
let 15 percent of the energy penetrate the barrier with a plastic 
mat under the jetty to prevent undercutting 
it took him a year to get a permit to build the jetty he raised 
135000 by charging 500 to put peoples names on rocks then he 
sent grand isle high school art students to a marble company to 
learn how to engrave names on rocks 
the state paid 250000 and the federal government put up 
100000 for the jetty 
so far the jetty has cost 456000 but the underpinning must 
be completed and there are other costs to be met valence plans a 
rock concert to raise more money 
if i had a horse and some dogs id do a dog and pony show 
he said 
critics fear the jetty is rebuilding the middle of the island at 
the expense of a state park at the eastern end robbing the park of 
drifting sand 
it wont cause erosion at the park but it will slow 
accretion valence said the park already extends out 200 feet 
they dont need another grain of sand 
the jetty has yet to face its most severe test a major 
hurricane

police appealed to the man who shot and killed a 
subway robber to come forward saying they know he was a victim 
this is not the bernhard goetz case brooklyn chief of 
detectives joseph demartino said friday this is an individual 
who is clearly being robbed has lost his property has been beaten 
and draws a weapon and shoots his assailant 
the man pulled a gun and opened fire on a group of attackers 
thursday night in the new york city borough of brooklyn killing 
one of them and scattering the others police said the man got off 
at the next stop and vanished 
detectives combed through trash cans and along subway tracks and 
gutters in downtown brooklyn searching for the gunmans wallet 
which was stolen during the struggle according to witnesses 
police also said a friend of the shot robber might have taken the 
wallet 
the shooting was being compared to the 1984 goetz subway 
shooting case as in the goetz case the shooter was white and the 
youths he confronted were black 
but police dont believe thursdays shooting was racially 
motivated and they noted that goetz had not been robbed he 
believed he was about to be while several witnesses thursday saw 
a gang of youths attack the gunman 
goetz now 42 made headlines when he shot four youths in a 
subway car on the morning of dec 22 1984 he claimed the group 
was about to mug him the youths claimed they were panhandling 
goetz fled but surrendered to police in new hampshire nine days 
later he eventually was acquitted of attempted murder but 
convicted of a weapons possession charge he wound up serving 8 
months in jail after losing a lengthy legal battle that reached the 
us supreme court 
police did not know yet whether the gunman in thursdays 
shooting was carrying his weapon legally 
the slain robber was identified as ricky pickett 25 a watch 
with a torn band believed to belong to the gunman was found in 
picketts pocket police capt stephen davis said 
pickett who also used five other names had served jail time 
for some of his halfdozen robbery convictions dating back to 1980 
according to police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the subway shooter was described as 45 to 55 years old 5 feet 
10 inches with gray hair wearing a beige raincoat and brown pants 
and carrying a canvas gym bag 
the shooting occurred in front of at least 20 people while 
pickett was among a group of 14 youths heading to a times square 
disco police said 
at least one of the two independent witnesses told police they 
saw members of the group passing a gun around davis said the gun 
was not used in the robbery police said but a witness said the 
robbers had a retractable razor 
the four or five robbers grabbed the man went through his 
pockets took his wallet and threw him back on the seat police 
said 
the male fought them off kicking out at them and witnesses 
state he drew a gun from his waistband and shot one of his 
assailants demartino said 
one bullet hit pickett in the chest police said the path of 
the other two shots was not known 
the mortally wounded pickett and the other men fled into the 
next car the gunman and most of the youths left at the next 
station leaving pickett dying on the train

loggers mill workers and their families 
fear they will be forgotten under an emerging national policy to 
limit logging of nevercut timber to protect spotted owls 
on friday 8000 to 10000 people rallied in pioneer square to 
protest the policy 
clad in yellow caps and ribbons the ralliers heard us sen 
bob packwood rore tell them the agenda of environmentalists 
could be condensed into two words no jobs 
environmentalists argue that oldgrowth timber in the northwest 
must be protected to save the northern spotted owl from extinction 
they say the forest owl cannot survive outside the complex 
ecosystem anchored by centuriesold trees 
but oregonians at the rally and some of their elected 
officials echoed packwoods economic fears 
we think this potentially could have the largest impact on the 
northwest since the depression economically douglas county 
commissioner doug robertson said 
its come to the point that if we dont stand up and be 
counted were going to suffer the consequences and the 
consequences are going to be severe 
a panel of scientists recommended to congress on april 4 that 
millions of acres of northwest oldgrowth forest be set aside as 
owl habitat the exact locations of the habitat are under study 
packwood wants congress to reduce the amount of recommended forest 
that would be set aside for the owl 
its up to congress to decide by this fall how much of the 
regions oldgrowth timber can be cut and how much owl habitat 
should be protected 
organizers of the rally said 350 businesses around the state 
closed so their employees could attend some schools gave students 
excused absences so they could join their parents 
officials of douglas county rated by the us forest service as 
the most timberdependent county in oregon gave 25 to 30 county 
workers the day off with pay so they could attend the rally in the 
linn county community of sweet home 105 businesses closed and 
about 500 people made the 85mile trip to portland 
bob and susan kasting owners of the busy bee restaurant in 
sweet home joined the caravan kasting said a shutdown of the 
timber industry would devastate his business 
if they cant work they cant eat he said 
police reported several scuffles between environmentalists and 
timber industry supporters on the edge of the crowd the odor of 
smoke bombs wafted across the square 
portland police spokesman dave simpson said officers took three 
people who appeared to be timber industry supporters into custody 
the three seemed to be intoxicated and were held until they could 
sober up but werent charged with any crimes simpson said 
during the rally dozens of log trucks circled downtown on the 
freeways occasionally blowing their horns 
evelyn badger of the oregon lands coalition a proindustry 
group that organized the rally said congress would be asked to set 
aside forest land specifically for timber harvests 
we are the dirtyhands people who feed clothe and shelter 
this nation she said

an indonesian communications 
satellite is back in space 5 years after shuttle astronauts pulled 
it from orbit and brought it back to earth 
i am very excited i pray to god everything continues to go 
well said makarim wibisono press consulate for the indonesian 
embassy in washington she witnessed fridays launch 
an unmanned delta 2 rocket blasted off on time at 628 pm with 
the 60 million satellite from cape canaveral air force station 
the satellite separated 26 minutes later and as expected settled 
into orbit about 115 miles away 
it looks like we have a normal vehicle on our hand said 
skip mackey a nasa test director 
an onboard kick motor was to boost the 1437pound satellite 
into its final geosynchronous orbit 22300 miles above the equator 
sunday 
the palapa b2r satellite was one of two rescued from a 
uselessly low orbit by the shuttle discovery in november 1984 the 
rescue came nine months after the satellites were launched by nasa 
aboard challenger astronauts joe allen and dale gardner manually 
placed the satellites in discoverys payload bay 
the second satellite originally built for western union was 
returned to space on a chinese long march 3 rocket on april 7 
the successful sendoff marked chinas debut into the international 
satellite launching business 
the refurbished indonesian satellite will join two other palapa 
satellites already in orbit electronically linking the 177 million 
people who live on the countrys 13677 islands it is expected to 
go into operation in six weeks 
the indonesian satellites also will be used for internal 
communications services in the philippines thailand malaysia 
singapore and papua new guinea 
hughes aircraft co which built the recovered palapa replaced 
its batteries onboard thrusters and motors used to boost the 
satellite into its proper orbit damage during its nine months in 
space was amazingly benign said dave braverman a vice 
president for hughes 
fridays launch cost 1375 million including 50 million for 
the mcdonnell douglas commercial rocket and 275 million for an 
insurance premium covering loss of the satellite 
the satellite originally was scheduled for launch april 9 the 
launch was pushed back three days when the national aeronautics and 
space administration moved up the date of discoverys launch with 
the hubble space telescope 
the palapas launch was delayed yet again to friday when 
discoverys mission was scrubbed tuesday the space agency later 
said the discovery mission would be delayed until april 25 
the palapa b2r is the fourth palapa satellite to be launched by 
mcdonnell douglas it is the huntington beach calif companys 
third commercial launch

agriculture officials declared a quarantine 
on commercially grown crops on 81 square miles in riverside county 
because a medfly was discovered in an orange tree 
the mediterranean fruit fly was found thursday in a commercial 
orange grove in woodcrest sparking concerns that the 
cropdestroying insect has established itself in the agricultural 
region state officials said friday 
the officials friday also announced the discovery of two other 
medflies one in an area of glendora already sprayed by the 
pesticide malathion in a controversial program aimed at protecting 
crops against the insect 
the other medfly was found in suburban walnut in an area which 
has not been sprayed 
the discoveries prompted the states science advisors to call a 
meeting for monday to decide how to respond 
the medflies were found less than a month after agricultural 
officials announced they would try to halt aerial malathion 
spraying in may and battle the pest with sterile flies 
the state department of agriculture has been spraying malathion 
over nearly 400 square miles of suburban los angeles and orange 
counties to battle an infestation that turned up last summer 
medflies lay eggs in more than 200 fruits and vegetables 
the discovery of the medfly in the riverside county orange tree 
was particularly unsettling 
the regions navel oranges have already been picked and the 
areas grapefruits and valencia oranges wont be picked until 
midsummer but officials worried about the economic impact of a 
serious infestation 
the quarantine is expected to let the fruit be sold within the 
united states but some foreign countries including japan may not 
accept fruit grown in an infested area officials said 
the exact boundaries of the quarantine were to be set monday 
it was not immediately known whether officials would order 
pesticide spraying in the area a medfly had been found in the same 
community on march 21 but no spraying was ordered 
since that is the second fly theyve found out there 
pesticide treatment is a possibility said medfly project 
spokeswoman natalie bosecker 
many residents have objected to having their homes sprayed at 
night with malathion from helicopters out of fear the pesticide was 
unhealthful and the helicopters could crash 
state officials have said the pesticide is sprayed in safe 
small amounts and have defended the safety record of the company 
contracted to fly the helicopters

rival christian troops battled with tank 
cannons in east beirut today and a newspaper reported that france 
was pressing renegade gen michel aoun to give up his struggle for 
power 
at least three people were wounded in the onehour flareup on 
the edge of ashrafiyeh a residential district controlled by samir 
geageas lebanese forces militia police said 
the thuds of exploding rounds and staccato bursts of machinegun 
fire echoed across beirut both sides blamed the other for the 
clash 
the morning flareup subsided into occasional exchanges of sniper 
fire an hour later although no ceasefire agreement was announced 
by police count the showdown between aoun and geagea for 
control of the 310squaremile christian enclave has killed 875 
people and wounded 2372 since it broke out jan 30 
sixteen ceasefire accords arranged by independent christian 
figures have silenced the intrachristian confrontation for periods 
ranging from a few hours to several days 
meanwhile annahar a respected independent newspaper said 
france was trying to persuade aoun to renounce any claims to the 
christian sector in favor of syrianbacked president elias hrawi 
the report quoting unidentified sources said french ambassador 
rene ala held a threehour meeting with aoun friday in which he 
relayed the french advice to step down 
france which ruled lebanon until the nations independence in 
1943 is the traditional patron of lebanons christian population 
the french effort the paper said was coordinated with saudi 
arabia morocco and algeria the three arab states that brokered a 
peace accord last october to end lebanons 15yearold civil war 
the accord worked out by lebanese legislators at the saudi 
resort of taif called for the equal distribution of power among 
moslems and christians 
aoun geagea and hrawi are maronite catholics the largest 
christian sect in lebanon the sect has dominated the nations 
political life since independence 
aoun the lebanese army commander at the time rejected the taif 
accord and the nov 24 election of hrawi as president aoun held 
out in the shellshattered presidential palace in suburban baabda 
in the christian enclave east of beirut 
hrawi was forced to set up temporary headquarters in 
syrianpoliced moslem west beirut hrawis government led by prime 
minister salim hoss a sunni moslem has repeatedly referred to 
aoun as a power usurper 
arab league envoy lakhdar ibrahimi currently in lebanon with 
new proposals to help hrawi remove obstacles blocking 
implementation of the taif accord said he will not meet with aoun 
geagea has recognized hrawi as head of state and invited his 
government to take over army camps and government offices in areas 
of his control in the christian enclave

mongolias ruling communist party has named a 
new smaller central committee and will remove 80 percent of old 
committee members from office chinas official xinhua news agency 
said today 
earlier at an extraordinary fourday congress of the mongolian 
peoples revolutionary party leaders adopted a new party 
constitution and platform that reflected the recent acceptance of 
democratic reforms and opposition parties 
the congress ended on friday 
xinhua said the partys central committee was trimmed to 91 
members from 146 delegates said younger more educated people 
would comprise much of the committee 
the 926 congress delegates also chose a new leadership body to 
be renamed the presidium instead of the current politburo but the 
presidium was to consist of the same five men appointed to the 
politburo less than a month ago after an opposition hunger strike 
forced out the old party leadership 
the chairman of the presidium gombojavyn ochirbat 61 was 
named party chief a month ago amid a leadership shakeup triggered 
by prodemocracy protests 
the communists have ruled this sovietallied pastoral nation 
with an iron grip since 1921 when the soviets helped mongolia gain 
independence from china protests for reform began in december 
inspired by soviet glasnost and the fall of communist parties in 
eastern europe 
on march 23 the parliament abolished the communist partys 
monopoly on power and approved free parliamentary elections 
tentatively scheduled for july 
earlier in the congress the party seeking to change its image 
and maintain control after the elections dropped the word 
communism from its constitution and set a new goal of building 
democratic human socialism 
the new party constitution adopted also cuts the number of party 
employees gives more financial and decisionmaking power to local 
party and guarantees their right to criticize the center 
xinhua said the congress also decided to set up a commission to 
investigate former highranking officials the opposition has 
charged former leaders with corruption and persecution of 
dissidents 
the report said the delegates agreed to postpone the partys 
next congress scheduled for november until next year

an anticholesterol crusader says hell continue 
his battle for the good diet despite mcdonalds corps claim that 
ads he placed in the nations newspapers are misleading and 
malicious 
we will continue to warn the american public about the dangers 
of high cholesterol phil sokolof an omaha industrialist out to 
change the nations eating habits said friday 
sokolof placed advertisements in newspapers nationwide april 4 
asking mcdonalds corp to lower the amount of saturated fat on its 
menu the ads headlined the poisoning of america included a 
plea to mcdonalds to cut the fat in their hamburgers by 10 percent 
but mcdonalds said friday the ad was inaccurate attorney 
joseph califano who represents mcdonalds said letters have been 
written to newspapers advising them not to publish it again 
we think the papers just didnt check the facts said 
califano secretary of health education and welfare in the carter 
administration 
now they know the facts now they are all on notice to 
publish anything like that ad would be a malicious act califano 
said 
mcdonalds said the ad was riddled with error 
just about everything in the ad except the spelling of 
mcdonalds was inaccurate said chuck ebeling a spokesman for 
the oak brook illbased company 
sokolof reached in omaha said mcdonalds was putting up a 
smokescreen and that the ad was a public service 
mcdonalds has chosen to try and intimidate the nations 
leading newspapers said sokolof who blames a bad diet for a 
heart attack he suffered years ago 
he would not rule out placing more ads in the future but would 
not reveal any specific plans 
ebeling said the ad blatantly overstated the saturated fat 
content of mcdonalds products including an assertion that 
mcdonalds precooked hamburger meat is 215 percent fat 
in reality the fat content before cooking is 17 to 20 percent 
fat and is typically 195 percent fat ebeling said 
an official of a washington dcbased consumer advocacy group 
the center for science in the public interest said either way the 
saturated fat levels in fast food are too high 
to me the important part is that the general thrust of the ad 
was correct said nutrition director bonnie liebman many of 
the foods served at mcdonalds are loaded with saturated fat and 
cholesterol and eating less would reduce heart disease the 
nations largest killer 
a 10 percent reduction would still leave us with pretty fatty 
sandwiches but its a start she said 
ebeling said mcdonalds has worked over the past several years 
to develop a more healthy menu that now includes salads 2 percent 
milk and bran muffins 
the company is also experimenting with using pure vegetable oil 
rather than the current beef shorteningvegetable oil mixture 
for frying its french fries and hash browns

boeing co three years behind competitors 
in developing a new midsize commercial jet plans to make a 
foldingwing plane with three japanese companies as suppliers 
the agreement announced friday lets the japanese aerospace firms 
make about onefifth of the planes components and share roughly 
the same proportion of risk without holding an equity position 
boeing officials said 
the 353seat jet would fill a size gap between the boeing 767 
and the boeing 747 jets company officials said it would be larger 
than the 767 and smaller than the 747 
that would put the new airplane the socalled 767x in 
competition with models made by mcdonnell douglas and the european 
consortium airbus industrie both have been developing planes of 
similar range and size for about three years 
the japanese companies would be contractors for not partners 
in the project but they will be able to capitalize their share 
of earnings from the new plane boeing officials said 
i think this is the first time weve gone this far but 
their participation would be limited a great degree over what it 
would have been if they had been an equity partner said lawrence 
w clarkson senior vice president for government and international 
affairs of boeing commercial airplane group 
a memorandum of understanding was signed thursday between boeing 
and mitsubishi heavy industries kawasaki heavy industries and fuji 
heavy industries a final agreement was expected this summer 
boeing hopes to announce orders for the new plane this year and 
begin deliveries in 1995 the plane is to be renamed the 777 once 
in production 
clarkson said the japanese companies would make 15 percent to 20 
percent of the new airframe 
he said an equity arrangement with the japanese is possible on 
future projects 
estimates that the initial investment to develop the plane would 
be about 3 billion were probably close within a billion or 
so clarkson said 
some trade experts have expressed fear that japan would use 
proprietary information as it tries to become an aerospace power 
clarkson said that fear is not valid 
were not afraid of the japanese he said the issue of 
technology transfer that has been so highly speculated about we 
believe is not a valid issue 
the initial model would have a 197foot wingspan would be 206 
feet long and carry passengers in two classes it would have a 
range of 4600 nautical miles said alan r mulally vice president 
for engineering of boeings new airplane division 
mulally said the plane is designed to replace the 687 mcdonnell 
douglas dc10s and lockheed l1011s that will be approaching 25 
years of age in the mid1990s 
the wings of the new jet would be able to fold upward about 23 
to 25 feet from the tips letting it use existing airport gates for 
older models which have shorter wings 
clarkson said the japanese would produce about the same 
components for the new plane as they now do for the 767 production 
of wings and other key technologically advanced parts will remain 
with boeing he said

a high school sophomore contends in a federal 
lawsuit that her freespeech rights were violated when she was 
suspended for allegedly writing menacing and obscene messages in a 
notebook circulated by students 
the notebook contained at least two death threats against 
teachers and included gruesome references to chopping an 
administrator into pieces and wishing to castrate a teacher 
officials said 
heather gilbertson one of four reno high school students 
suspended for two days last month filed the us district court 
lawsuit friday against the washoe county school district and 
officials on behalf of herself and other pupils 
she said students constitutional rights to free speech and free 
expression were abused by school officials in trying to control 
student writings in the notebook called the notsosacred note 
flow jr 
the notebook hasnt been made public 
the suspensions were intended to allow educators to exercise 
control over student expression and allow educators to police 
thought and restrict speech in this form said the lawsuit filed 
by attorney jack schroeder of reno 
this wasnt a publication it was a communications system 
just like notes being passed between students schroeder said 
some students may have said some strong things about teachers but 
to my knowledge there was never any follow up or intent to follow 
up 
the lawsuit seeks a court order to forbid the school district 
from continuing to limit student speech by punishing students for 
writings 
steve mulvenon spokesman for the school district said the 
students were disciplined because of the nature of the messages 
the circulation of that notebook had created a climate in the 
school that the principal thought was not conducive to a good 
education mulvenon said the notebook was violent threatening 
against teachers and staff and also used language that was 
offensive and personally invasive 
mulvenon said he wasnt surprised by the lawsuit and he welcomes 
the opportunity to see whether what the school district did was 
within our rights or not 
the spiral notebook was discovered when a student left it in a 
classroom and a teacher turned it into principal patrick rogan who 
decided the students punishment 
students have said they didnt mean any harm by the notebook 
which included a passage explaining what the purpose of the 
journal it says in part the flow is a place to voice 
feelings read what other people have to say get and give advice 
and communicate on a different level of life its a place to 
reveal your personal insights on anything and get feedback to what 
you say

hamilton county prosecutor arthur ney is 
trying to deflect criticism for dropping out of the obscenity case 
against an art gallery showing the late robert mapplethorpes 
sexually explicit photographs 
the contemporary art center and its director were indicted one 
week ago on misdemeanor obscenity charges for displaying seven 
photos that show naked children or homoerotic acts 
mayor charles luken said friday he thinks ney sent the case to 
city prosecutors because he doubted he could win but ney said 
thursday that his county office is barred by ohio law from 
prosecuting misdemeanor cases 
i think this is a politically hot potato and the reason mr 
ney is doing this is that he doesnt feel he can win luken said 
neys assistant chip gerhardt denied that the county 
prosecutor had withdrawn because he thought he would lose the 
law is clear on this and mr lukens a lawyer and he should 
understand the law gerhardt said 
city council members guy guckenberger and david mann both of 
whom are lawyers said the city should drop the case if the county 
refuses to pursue it 
i have no interest in paying hundreds of thousands of dollars 
for this litigation guckenberger said we have much more 
important priorities in the city 
a survey published friday by the cincinnati post found that 59 
percent of cincinnati residents support the arts center in 
displaying the photographs and 38 percent said the show should be 
prohibited 
these numbers shatter the myth that this is a heavily 
conservative community said al tuchfarber director of the 
university of cincinnatis institute for policy research which 
conducted the survey for the post 
the telephone poll of 561 adults in hamilton county on wednesday 
and thursday found that 96 percent of those surveyed had heard 
about or seen the mapplethorpe exhibit since it opened april 6 the 
polls margin of sampling error was 4 percent 
about 18000 people have viewed the 175photograph exhibit since 
it opened april 6 
a county grand jury indicted the arts center and its director 
dennis barrie last saturday on misdemeanor charges of pandering 
obscenity and using children in nudityrelated material 
barrie and the gallery are to be arraigned monday if convicted 
barrie could be sentenced to six months in jail on each of the two 
counts

a group of renegade soldiers told the 
british embassy today that it would attack alleged british 
mercenaries training president corazon aquinos security guard 
meanwhile another underground military group said that if the 
us government continues intervening in philippine affairs 
washington officials may face a fight they will never forget 
the revolutionary alliance for the massessoldiers of the 
filipino people distributed a statement with the us warning today 
outside the philippine constabulary jail where leaders of past 
coup attempts were held 
the us government will be solely responsible for whatever 
actions we might consider to take against them the statement 
said it referried to us air support for mrs aquinos forces 
during the dec 19 failed coup attempt that left more than 113 
people dead and over 600 wounded

one of several underground rightwing military groups plotting 
against mrs aquino came in an open letter copies were sent to 
news agencies 
the letter dated friday was signed by capt carlos maglalang 
military spokesmen said there was no officer in the armed forces by 
that name 
the soldiers union said it had identified the alleged british 
mercenaries and traced where they were staying it urged the 
british embassy to order them out of the philippines saying 
otherwise they would face drastic action

instructors joined troops from mrs aquinos presidential security 
guard in staging mock attacks on the palace the airport and the 
house of representatives building 
horacio paredes a spokesman for mrs aquino confirmed the 
presidential guard held military exercises on those days but 
declined comment on whether british nationals were involved 
it could not be determined whether the letter had reached the 
british embassy because its offices were closed for the fourday 
easter holiday telephone calls to the embassy went unanswered 
our forces in manila have closely monitored the activities of 
these mercenaries the letter said adding they represented a 
direct intervention in the countrys internal security affairs and 
a clear violation of philippine sovereignty

possibility of new attempts by renegade troops to topple the 
government

frances bullfight season opened today with both 
aficionados and critics intensifying lobbying campaigns in advance 
of expected moves to outlaw the increasingly popular spectacle 
the annual number of corridas programs of several 
bullfights has doubled in the past decade to more than 120 total 
attendance last year was 600000 and a national association of 
fans has been formed to defend bullfighting 
animal protection groups in turn have escalated their 
offensive against bullfighting they want first to stop its spread 
and eventually to ban it 
bullfighting was introduced in france in 1853 at the urging of 
empress eugenie the spanishborn wife of napoleon iii almost a 
century later in 1951 the government enshrined bullfighting in a 
law that authorizes its continuation in towns where it qualifies as 
a longstanding local tradition 
that effectively limited corridas to southern cities and towns 
such as nimes and arles where spanish immigrants have helped 
kindle a passion for bullfighting 
attendance at french bullfights stagnated in the 1970s but began 
increasing steadily in the mid1980s attendance in spain the 
worlds bullfighting capital also is rising 
a recent survey taken by the french fans association the 
national association for the defense of laficion indicated 
that the spectators include large numbers of young people many 
with whitecollar jobs 
promoters have succeeded in obtaining more media coverage for 
bullfighting the countrys increasing popular paytv network 
canal plus now shows highlights of bullfights and the trendy 
leftist parisian daily liberation devoted an entire page today to 
the opening of the season 
for rene berlandier president of the fans association the 
main problem facing bullfighting is excessively high ticket prices 
even with the influx of younger bettereducated fans he said 
the average ticket price of nearly 30 is a burden according to 
his groups polls 33 percent of the fans have less than 1700 in 
annual disposable income 
the growing popularity of bullfighting distresses frances 
society for the protection of animals 
they have created a need in an artificial way said the 
societys president jacqueline faucher of the bullfight promoters 
and they shouldnt talk to me about traditions in this area 
its the tradition of the cashregister above all 
she said the society objects to the idea that the agony and 
the death of an animal should become a spectacle 
in the short term we want to ensure that corridas are truly 
limited to towns where they are traditional according to the law 
in the long term we are battling for the prohibition pure and 
simple of this barbarity 
the biggest threat to bullfighting could come from the european 
parliament where deputies seeking to outlaw it may gain broader 
powers as european integration increases after 1992 
thus far french aficionados arent overly worried by the 
spectre of a ban according to the survey taken by berlandiers 
group their biggest worry for now is that the bulls are becoming 
too feeble

pope john paul ii met unexpectedly today 
with an aide to mikhail s gorbachev one day after the soviet 
president issued an ultimatum to the rebellious baltic republic of 
lithuania 
the pontiff also sent an easter message to lithuania saying he 
felt closer than ever to the aspirations of the soviet republics 
largely catholic people 
a vatican spokesman monsignor piero pennacchini said the 
private audience which lasted 30 minutes was requested by vadim 
zagladin a special adviser to the soviet president 
the visit to his holiness is part of the contacts that have 
been taken up again between the holy see and the soviet government 
to deal with problems related to the life of the church in the 
soviet union as well as the problems inherent to international 
collaboration pennacchini said 
he did not comment further on the meeting or say whether it 
touched on the crisis in lithuania which declared independence 
from moscow on march 11 the meeting was not announced until 
shortly before it took place 
a week ago the holy sees envoy to moscow archbishop francesco 
colasuonno said in an interview that the vatican might be willing 
to mediate in the dispute over lithuania if asked to do so 
lithuanias president vytautas landsbergis said his republic 
will not bend to gorbachevs threat to cut off crucial supplies 
such as oil if the republic does not rescind its strongest 
independence measures by sunday 
shortly before pennacchinis statement the vatican released a 
text of an easter telegram sent today by the polish pope to 
cardinal vincentas skadkevicius of lithuania 
in this hour of trepidation and hope i am particularly near 
to the lithuanian church he said 
my affectionate solicitude embraces likewise all your noble 
people to whose aspirations i have never been closer especially in 
this easter period the pope said adding that he prayed that 
may providence support individuals and the people as a whole the 
fates of your dear nation 
the telegram which ended with an apostolic blessing was sent 
in latin the vatican released an italian translation 
the pope has disclosed on two occasions that he had been barred 
from visiting lithuania gorbachev invited the pope to the soviet 
union when the soviet president was received by john paul at the 
vatican last year but the pope has announced no commitment to 
visit 
lithuania an independent nation before world war ii was 
occupied by the soviet union in 1940

romberg told west germanys die welt newspaper that he could 
foresee initially limiting the equal exchange to salaries and 
retirement pay and for savings accounts up to 7000 marks 
die welt quoted romberg as saying an equal exchange for larger 
amounts could be delayed until east germanys economy is in better 
shape 
at a 1to1 exchange 7000 east german marks would be worth 
4100 at the current exchange the amount is worth about 1370 
average salaries in east germany are about 1000 marks a month 
now worth 196 retirement pay is about onehalf that sum 
officials of west germanys central bank the bundesbank have 
proposed a 1to1 exchange rate for savings accounts up to 2000 
east german marks or 1175 the bundesbank would make the rate 
two east german marks for one west german mark in other cases 
in another development west germanys foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher called for a quick meeting with markus 
meckel east germanys new foreign minister to prepare a united 
position for international talks on unification 
the coming talks will include the two german states and the 
united states the soviet union britain and france the world war 
ii allies who defeated adolf hitlers nazi germany 
a government newspaper in east germany today quoted that 
countrys former defense minister theodor hoffman as saying the 
military in both germanys should set the pace to ease tensions 
with drastic disarmament 
he did not elaborate 
this would contribute to the peoples of europe having no 
grounds to fear german military might the newspaper neues 
deutschland quoted him as saying 
west germany has 400000 soldiers and east germany 180000

satanic verses for blasphemy will block an improvement in

to prosecute rushdie and publishers viking penguin for blasphemy

apply only to the christian religion 
more than 1 billion moslems are enraged with the publication 
of the blasphemous novel the iranian newspaper said the 
fascist government of britain is once again making faces at moslems

rushdie is no more than a moving corpse adding his fate is 
but certain death a fact that the british rulers have to accept

the anger and hope that burst forth when hu 
yaobang died a year ago are muted now stilled by a campaign of 
political repression that seems only to intensify 
security has been tightened to prevent demonstrations marking 
the april 15 1989 death of the former communist party chief a 
popular reformer whose passing inspired a campaign for democratic 
reform that ended in tragedy 
within hours of hus death posters went up at beijing 
university and other campuses praising the leader who was purged in 
1987 for not crushing student demonstrations 
one said sincere men have died while hypocrites live on is 
there any hope left for our country 
thousands of students soon were marching on tiananmen square 
ostensibly to mourn hu but also to decry with growing vehemence the 
arrogance and corruption of oneparty rule 
as the weeks went on factory workers teachers journalists and 
even party members and police joined the peaceful festive marches 
for a more democratic government 
on may 20 after chinese leaders were humiliated by the student 
occupation of tiananmen square during a visit by soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev martial law was declared in beijing 
chinas aging leadership intimidated by the masses they claimed 
to represent declared that a plot was afoot against the party and 
communism 
tens of thousands of beijing residents filled the streets to 
protect the students in the square 
soldiers of the peoples liberation army smashed through the 
barricades june 34 and shot their way to tiananmen hundreds of 
people perhaps thousands were killed 
a year after the movement began thousands of political 
activists languish in chinese jails uncharged and without access 
to legal advice 
numbing political indoctrination a throwback to the 196676 
cultural revolution continues unabated in schools and workplaces 
zhao ziyang purged as party chief in june for prostudent 
leanings remains under house arrest astrophysicist fang lizhi 
chinas bestknown dissident is a fugitive in the us embassy 
for the many chinese who still sympathize with the democracy 
movements goals and for the government they oppose the common 
denominator is fear 
students are frightened by threats of expulsion from school or 
arrest if they demonstrate one student said if something 
happens people say they will join in but no one is willing to 
take the first step 
authorities claim the social situation is stable but worry that 
reforms in eastern europe will come to haunt china 
they have told young people to stay away from tiananmen square 
police closed the square to the public april 1 and again on 
april 5 a festival day on which the chinese traditionally honor 
their dead overseas dissidents had urged people to stroll across 
tiananmen on those days to mourn the victims of the military 
crackdown 
martial law was lifted in january but more than 1000 soldiers 
are posted in the history museum on the east side of tiananmen 
they march across the square each day chanting praise to socialism 
a warning that protests will not be tolerated in the square 
chinas symbolic political center 
we absolutely wont allow any repetition of last years 
protests said chen xitong the hardline mayor of beijing 
although some western economic sanctions imposed after the 
crackdown have been lifted chinas relations with the outside 
world still are marked by suspicion and xenophobia 
premier li peng has begun a campaign to teach children about the 
1840 opium war between britain and china so as to heighten their 
vigilance against the imperialistic strategy of turning china 
into a capitalist state 
china insists its doors to the world remain open and welcomes 
foreign investment but the people are told not to talk to foreign 
journalists a students university told him that if he did not 
stop seeing his german girlfriend he would be sent to a job in the 
remote countryside 
ying ruocheng a wellknown actor and who is vice minister of 
culture admitted some in the hierarchy favor a return to isolation 
and link politically suspect art to the spread of western ideas 
but said we do not advocate this 
the democracy movement had a bright moment this month when chai 
ling a leader of the tiananmen protests turned up in france with 
her husband after 10 months on the run inside china both are 
wanted for counterrevolutionary crimes 
yan jiaqi a dissident political scientist who leads the 
federation for democracy in china based in paris said tight 
political controls make it unlikely any opposition to the 
government will be evident this spring 
police know the chinese fondness for anniversaries and will be 
especially vigilant april 27 the anniversary of one of the biggest 
demonstrations and may 4 when a historic student movement in 1919 
is observed 
then comes may 20 the day martial law was declared and finally 
june 34 when the army moved in 
for the many beijing residents who scorn the government but are 
uneasy about social unrest its a matter of enduring the 
propaganda and the police 
everyone tries to avoid talking about politics a young 
businessman said it can only get you in trouble

the sleepy 101st congress finally is 
threatening to pass some bills 
usually by now the congressional agenda is clogged with budget 
resolutions spending bills and bins of social legislation 
not this year the easter recess was stretched from one week to 
two as the congressional leadership took advantage of the paucity 
of pressing business 
when they return this wednesday the two chambers still have 
little planned the house has three minor bills scheduled for 
action before it adjourns thursday for another long weekend the 
senate schedule is less certain but equally light 
this is the easiest congress ive ever had said one top 
senate staffer whos spent more than two decades on capitol hill 
the democratic leadership has decided to focus its efforts on a 
couple of showpiece bills child care and clean air 
the house and senate have passed competing blueprints for how 
the government should subsidize child care and are working toward 
a compromise that can go to president bush the last time a 
democratic congress sent such legislation to a republican president 
was in 1971 and president nixon vetoed it 
its been nearly a decade and a half since the countrys clean 
air laws were significantly updated but the senate now has passed 
a bill with bipartisan support house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash has promised action in his chamber by early may and then 
another housesenate negotiation will ensue 
campaign finance reform is on the agenda in both chambers 
although partisan disagreements may doom enactment theres talk of 
compromise in the senate but talks in the house between foley and 
minority leader robert h michel rill have come to naught 
most of the remainder of the congressional agenda is bundled up 
in budget matters and so far its a bottleneck 
halfway through the spending year congress and the president 
are still tinkering with fiscal 1990 spending 
bush asked congress for an emergency increase of 870 million in 
foreign aid spending most of that would go toward rebuilding 
panama after the us invasion and to support nicaraguas new 
democratic government 
the house passed the bill before the easter recess but not 
before pumping the total up to 24 billion with money for food 
stamps forestfire fighting veterans programs and other domestic 
spending the senate appropriations committee is expected to 
consider its version late this week 
congress was supposed to have completed the fiscal 1991 budget 
by april 15 but budget resolutions still havent been voted out of 
the house or senate budget committees 
members of both panels have been meeting behind closed doors in 
recent weeks in attempts to hammer out 12 trillion budgets for 
the new fiscal year which begins oct 1 
majority democrats on each committee are looking for mixtures of 
minor tax increases and cuts in defense and domestic spending that 
will yield at least 37 billion in savings the minimum required by 
the grammrudman balancedbudget law republicans have been 
balking saying they will stand by the budget president bush 
requested in january 
congress faces difficult decisions that will include the depth 
and character of cuts to be made in military spending and how to 
squeeze billions of dollars worth of domestic initiatives into an 
already tight budget just like last year congress will also have 
to decide which taxes can be raised while still allowing president 
bush to claim adherence to his no new taxes pledge 
speaker foley has said that one thing sure to come out of the 
budget process this year is to move the social security trust fund 
offbudget although just a bookkeeping change this will give 
politicians a chance to reassure retired and soontobe retired 
voters that their checks will keep coming 
the democrats continue to blame the slow pace of congressional 
activity on last years traumatic removal of former house speaker 
jim wright who was accused of violating house ethics rules 
normally in a twoyear congress the first year is when the 
groundwork is laid for final passage of legislation in the second 
year but last year was restoring the civility leaving more of 
the groundwork for this year said jeff biggs foleys spokesman

armed assailants are still relatively rare in china

the selling and buying of illegal guns has become rampant in canton 
and that such crimes will be dealt with heavily and quickly 
the report carried in cantons yancheng evening news on friday 
and seen in beijing on saturday quoted deng as saying criminals 
were using guns to steal rape kill and commit highway robbery

the extreme he said 
on thursday a canton court sentenced 16 people for crimes 
involving the use of guns of those three were immediately 
executed and eight were given the death sentence the three 
condemned people were convicted of armed robbery and rape and the 
murder of a policeman who tried to arrest them

than 30 cases concerning the illegal selling and buying of guns and 
ammunition they confiscated about 100 militaryuse handguns or 
their copies

are successful executions are carried out with a bullet to the

a 22yearold man with no criminal 
record has been charged with the murders of six of seven black 
women found strangled in kansas city since september 
ray shawn jackson 22 described as a parttime laborer also 
was charged with the assault of another woman monday night whose 
attack was interrupted by a passerby authorities said 
jackson was arrested thursday afternoon at his grandmothers 
house three blocks east of gillham park where four of the six 
women were found he was charged friday with six counts of 
firstdegree murder hours after the funeral of the latest victim 
michelle mitchell 
police chief larry joiner said that the six victims had all been 
lured to areas in or near the park by the promise of obtaining 
crack cocaine 
the investigation has not produced evidence linking jackson to 
the death of a seventh woman brenda mccoy 33 who was found sept 
26 joiner said 
many blacks have said authorities and the media failed to give 
the case adequate attention because the victims were black 
prostitutes and drug addicts joiner said jackson who also is 
black had no history of violence or any prior arrest record but 
it was his understanding he had used drugs 
i dont think i can get into his motives the police chief 
said 
a woman who told the police she had been with miss mitchell and 
jackson hours before her body was found helped authorities draw a 
composite sketch of the suspect 
a 27yearold black woman assaulted on monday had identified 
jackson from a photograph as her assailant joiner said she said 
the assailant was scared away by a man out walking his dog 
homicide detectives found jackson while canvassing a 
neighborhood near the park looking for anyone who recognized the 
composite drawing witnesses pointed police to his grandmothers 
home and he was arrested when he came home later in the afternoon 
in addition to the killing of miss mitchell whose body was 
found in the park on april 5 jackson is charged with killing 
annette stewart 33 found dead on sept 16 kimberly creer 22

the soviet union has stepped up aid 
to afghanistans government while edging forward in talks for a 
political end to the 12yearold war a senior us diplomat said 
saturday 
moscow spends 500 million a month on arms and aid to its allies 
in kabul up from a previous high of 300 million said the 
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the regime is divided and weak and totally dependent on the 
soviet union just like us in vietnam the soviet union is sending 
5 billion a year in military and humanitarian aid to kabul he 
said 
the moslem guerrillas known as mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors get 600 million annually in military assistance from the 
united states they also receive aid from pakistan saudi arabia 
and other sympathetic arab states 
the moslem insurgents have been fighting for 12 years to unseat 
afghanistans communiststyle government and establish an islamic 
republic 
the kremlin sent red army troops into the central asian nation 
in 1979 to bolster the kabul government and to put down the 
burgeoning moslem insurgency 
the soviet union pulled out its troops in february 1989 but the 
us diplomat said 500 soviet military intelligence officers were 
operating in the afghan capital up from 300 last year 
moscow beefed up its weapons and food supplies to kabul in 
december after president najib uncovered a coup plot the diplomat 
said 
but less then three months later najibs renegade defense 
minister shah nawaz tanai launched the bloodiest and most serious 
challenge yet 
western diplomats said the march 6 coup weakened najib and the 
diplomat predicted it would push moscow toward a more flexible 
bargaining position 
were making progress with the soviets there is movement 
and there will be more in the months ahead he said referring 
to next months summit meeting between president bush and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
so far moscow has refused to open talks on what washington 
insists is the key to a settlement the removal of najib 
soviets are still insisting on najib the diplomat said 
the key is the transfer of power of police intelligence and 
military to some neutral body there wont be a political solution 
as long as najib and his cohorts are there

rival christian forces battled with tank 
cannon mortars and machine guns in east beirut saturday as france 
was reported to be trying to persuade gen michel aoun to step down 
at least seven people were wounded in a onehour battle along 
the edges of the hilltop residential district of ashrafiyeh a 
stronghold of samir geageas lebanese forces militia 
aouns 19000 troops and geageas militia have fought each other 
to a standstill since jan 30 killing 875 people and wounding 
2376 in a battle for dominance of the 310squaremile christian 
enclave 
the inconclusive showdown has inflicted property damage 
estimated at 1 billion and forced about 400000 of the enclaves 1 
million people to flee to safer areas in lebanon and neighboring 
states 
the two sides blamed each other for saturday mornings flareup 
which coincided with talks in lebanon by arab league envoy lakhdar 
ibrahimi in an effort to salvage a peace pact reached more than 
five months ago 
the accord aimed at ending the 15yearold civil war was worked 
out by lebanese legislators at the saudi resort of taif last 
october 
aoun has rejected the taif accord and the election of 
syrianbacked president elias hrawi a month later he has 
criticized the accord for failing to provide a timetable for the 
withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon 
the taif accord has stumbled in the first steps but there is 
a real chance to put it on the proper track once again ibrahimi 
told reporters after a onehour meeting with maronite catholic 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir 
aoun geagea and hrawi are maronites the largest christian 
sect which has dominated lebanons politics since independence 
from france in 1943

aoun to resign in favor of hrawi

hours after a sniper opened fire on a 
greyhound bus in florida last month company chairman fred currey 
was on the scene boarding a bus to ride under the very overpass 
where the gunman had hidden 
curreys visit was part of what a company spokesman termed a 
florida blitz designed to gain greyhound favorable statewide 
news coverage in the early days of the strike by its drivers union 
every news person in northern florida was there said 
greyhound spokesman george gravley whose company dispatched currey 
to three florida cities that day to meet publicly with riders and 
replacement drivers 
greyhounds public relations gambit was just one battle in the 
war to court public favor in the sixweekold drivers strike but 
analysts say it reflects a growing trend toward sophisticated 
publicity contests in labormanagement disputes 
a public relation agent is a participant now either at the 
bargaining table or right outside the room said don blohowiak a 
new york media analyst who studies businessmedia relations 
the court of public opinion is very important to success in 
the marketplace in something like a labor dispute our impressions 
stay with us for a very long time blohowiak said 
he said most consumers want to do business with companies we 
like or feel good about companies we think conduct business with 
their employees in a reasonable and ethical way 
greyhound is not alone in seeking public favor in the strike 
the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions without an 
inhouse public relations department hired a washington company 
six days before the strike to dramatize the economic issues such 
as the decline in drivers average pay from 31000 to 21000 
since 1983 
still some labor leaders complain privately that the union 
hasnt been as aggressive as greyhound in seeking to mold public 
opinion 
the union hasnt awakened to the fact that it needs to sell 
its message to win said one labor analyst speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
but the unions public relations agent nick nichols said 
striking drivers cant compete with the companys money 
clearly its a david and goliath thing the greyhound drivers 
simply dont have the resources nichols said 
neither side in the bus strike will say what its spending for 
public relations advice since march 2 when 6300 drivers and 
3000 maintenance and other workers walked out the strike has been 
marred by vandalism and violence the company has refused to return 
to the bargaining table until a week goes by without a violent 
incident 
analysts point to the ongoing eastern air lines walkout and last 
years pittston coal strike as recent labor disputes where unions 
waged successful campaigns to win public support 
although machinists at eastern are still on strike their 
publicity campaign against frank lorenzo head of the carriers 
parent company made him out to be the darth vader of the 
corporate world in the publics mind one labor official said 
blohowiak said companies are more mediaconscious now than they 
were 10 years ago because increased competition has prompted 
consumers to consider a companys attitude toward its workers when 
making purchasing decisions 
after seeing the drubbing that exxon took over one accident 
or a frank lorenzo took you cant hide and pretend you dont have 
problems that no ones interested he said 
greyhounds efforts to win public opinion have been persistent 
twice in two weeks dallasbased greyhound executives flew to 
washington for news conferences to complain about strikerelated 
violence neither event had a washington focus and in fact the 
latest one was to announce the filing of a lawsuit in florida 
against union officials 
gravley the greyhound spokesman said the event was held in 
washington because thats where the national press corps is based 
if you want to be heard nationally you have to go where the 
national media is said media analyst don kellermann 
greyhound used a wellknown new york public relations firm 
ruder finn for advice and help in setting up the washington news 
conferences it also has taken out several fullpage newspaper ads 
on the strike 
labor officials contend the companys washington announcements 
are part of a strategy to distort public perception of the strike 
its a great tack for diverting attention from what the real 
issues are said denise mitchell a washington public relations 
agent who helped pittston miners win widespread community support 
during last years coal strike 
sophisticated publicity efforts by management have forced unions 
to try to keep up she said 
we increasingly counsel people that they have to get out front 
in the contest to win public support mitchell said being 
prepared at the bargaining table doing your homework on the 
economic issues just isnt enough anymore

president bush is telling soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev that his threatened use of economic 
sanctions against the independence movement in lithuania is not 
the way to go 
bush said today that he had no further information on the 
situation in lithuania or gorbachevs ultimatum 
i havent heard anything about anything this morning he 
said as he prepared to tee off for golf i havent seen the 
intelligence yet i will when i get in 
he told reporters that he wanted to get a clarification friday 
night but it was midnight over there early morning 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the administration 
was taking a wait and see attitude as it weighed its options in 
the event of a soviet economic crackdown 
its not entirely easy to know what the next moves are going 
to be baker said in an interview on cable news network he said 
the sanctions would have an adverse impact on ussoviet 
relations 
he would not speculate on what the united states response would 
be to sanctions 
bush and prime minister margaret thatcher meeting friday on 
this atlantic resort island had issued a joint plea to gorbachev 
to settle the baltic dispute through negotiation rather than 
coercion 
asked about his daylong meeting with the prime minister bush 
said today its very important to stay on the same wavelength 
with mrs thatcher there are slight nuances on one or two things 
but were very close together he refused to elaborate 
high winds and a steady rain did not deter bush from a morning 
golf game with top aides as well as thatchers husband denis 
asked why he was playing in such weather bush said we wanted 
the press to walk around and get into shape 
he said golf refurbishes the spirit youve got to have a 
mix of work and recreation the weather cleared by midmorning 
and when bush completed his tour of the course at the mid ocean 
golf club he was plainly pleased it was just heaven he said 
of his game 
the soviet news agency tass reported friday that gorbachev had 
given lithuania 24 hours to end its anticonstitutional 
acitivities the issue dominated the joint news conference 
between bush and mrs thatcher 
now is no time for escalation bush said friday at a joint 
news conference with mrs thatcher 
he said the united states has made it clear to gorbachev both 
publicly and privately that coercion escalation is not the way 
to go the way to go is dialogue and he called on the soviet 
leader to heed his words 
similarly mrs thatcher said the confrontation must be solved 
by discussion 
the president was notified about gorbachevs ultimatum toward 
the end of his daylong meeting with mrs thatcher 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said later that the 
united states was still trying to sort out what had happened and 
what it means 
mrs thatcher invited bush to this british colony as a prelude 
to his washington summit with gorbachev late next month the 
president met tuesday with canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
in toronto and will confer with french president francois 
mitterrand in key largo fla next week 
fridays talks centered on the prospects of a unified germany 
the future of the nato alliance and the unrest in the soviet union 
both leaders reported a broad measure of agreement on the issues 
before them 
they took time off from their four hours of talks to watch 20 
children fly colorful handmade kites in a traditional good friday 
celebration they also planted palm trees in a grove where two of 
their predecessors had done the same 
the two leaders and their top aides later mingled at a blacktie 
reception aboard a british warship hms arrow and at a dinner 
asked if he would telephone gorbachev with his concerns about 
lithuania bush said i might and i might not but certainly its 
time to stay in close contact and we have many ways of doing 
that 
he noted that 24 hours earlier the tone coming from the soviet 
union was quite different 
bush welcomed as a positive statement gorbachevs remark to 
a delegation of us senators that an arms control agreement might 
be ready in time for their fiveday summit beginning may 30 he 
said that was a different slant than the one that emerged from 
his meeting last week with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze 
bush said he and mrs thatcher agreed that a unified germany 
must remain a full member of the north atlantic treaty 
organization including its military structures he said this was 
in the genuine security interest of all european states 
among the western allies mrs thatcher has been portrayed as 
the one most reluctant to see german unification and favoring a 
goslow approach 
the prime minister said she and bush agreed that nato will 
continue to need a mix of conventional and nuclear forces and that 
they must be kept up to date whether we can make further 
reductions in the overall number of nato warheads in europe is 
something which will need to be considered as a whole she said 
on other issues 
bush said he would cooperate with any attempts to totally ban 
the shipment of weapons to terrorist nations mrs thatcher said 
british experts were still trying to determine wether a piece of 
steel piping confiscated before shipment to iraq was part of an 
artillery cannon 
both leaders reiterated their commitment to bring to justice 
the terrorists who bombed pan am flight 103 over lockerbie 
scotland in december 1988 all 259 people on the plane and 11 on 
the ground were killed 
their statement came in response to a plea from relatives of two 
victims that the leaders reaffirm their commitment to combat 
terrorism 
earlier bush told reporters aboard air force one that he is 
personally inclined to grant east germanys request for forgiveness 
over its rol in the nazi holocaust that killed millions of jews and 
others 
im a christian he said and i think that forgiveness is 
something that i feel very strongly about 
but he added that the world should not forget the holocaust 
you learn from history what not to do wrong how to conduct 
oneself he said

top army officials pressured to meet demands 
for sharp reductions in pentagon spending have agreed to a 
proposal that would cut about one soldier in four from the service 
by 1997 senior pentagon sources say 
army secretary michael stone and army chief of staff gen carl 
vuono gave their final approval to the proposal on wednesday said 
the sources who spoke on condition of not being identified by name 
under the proposal active duty forces would plummet from the 
current 764000 to 580000 by the beginning of fiscal year 1997 
the number of national guard and reserve forces would be slashed 
as well although not as precipitously dropping from the present 
776000 to 645000 slots over the same time period the sources 
said 
even though the move cuts tens of thousands of soldiers from 
army rolls beyond what the service projected it would do in the 
last pentagon budget the proposal may not placate demands on 
capitol hill for even more severe layoffs 
in hot pursuit of a socalled peace dividend amid lessened 
superpower tension some lawmakers have called for cutbacks or even 
outright cancellation of highcost weapons programs such as the 
530 million b2 stealth bomber but savings cant be gleaned as 
quickly from longterm weapons programs as they can from personnel 
accounts because weaponry costs are stretched over a period of many 
years 
so that leaves the manpowerintensive army with the largest 
segment of the nations 21 millionmember military force as the 
biggest target for possible budget savings 
its painful said one senior pentagon planner who is 
knowledgeable about the armys proposal it took some 
gutwrenching decisions but at least we have a plan 
another source who also spoke privately said the proposal was 
forced upon the service by fiscal reality even as he expressed 
concerns about pressures to go beyond the 580000 level 
that would bring us pretty close to a dysfunctional army he 
said given the national security requirement for a trained and 
ready force 
the senior official did not say how much savings were being 
projected from the manpower cut it is difficult to project 
nearterm savings from force reductions because of the possibility 
that severance pay may be allocated to more senior servicemen and 
women 
the new proposal is contained in the armys longterm budget 
proposal formally known in pentagon jargon as the pom or 
program objective memorandum it contains the services spending 
desires through the years 1992 to 1997 in line with topline 
budget numbers handed down by the civilian pentagon leadership 
the washington post reported in saturdays editions that a 
fiscal guidance memorandum issued by deputy defense secretary 
donald j atwood to military and civilian leaders in february calls 
for the army budget to increase slightly from 746 billion in 
fiscal 1992 to 765 billion in fiscal 1997 a level that would 
not keep pace with the expected rate of inflation 
in the fiscal 1991 budget defense secretary dick cheney sent to 
capitol hill in january he sought 2951 billion in spending 
authority but given the recent changes that have swept eastern 
europe and prospects of arms control agreements with the soviet 
union lawmakers have called cheneys proposals bloated and 
outdated 
at a recent hearing before the house armed services committee 
vuono warned that making precipitous cuts in personnel would lead 
to serious morale and readiness problems 
the general asked about a proposal to take 65000 soldiers from 
the force in 1991 alone said such a cut would result in a 
devastating act on the army 
while vuono has widely acknowledged that the army will be 
smaller in the future he has argued for planned reductions over a 
period of years in order to avoid leaving gaps in certain ranks of 
experienced personnel which would harm the armys ability to fight 
when called upon 
in my view more rapid reductions threaten to fracture the 
army vuono said 
that didnt satisfy armed services chairman rep les aspin 
dwis who warned that some proposed cuts of 35000 a year didnt 
nearly go far enough 
people are thinking we are going to get a very significant 
contribution from defense for the deficit reduction aspin said 
it is not going to be demobilization but it certainly is more 
accelerated than the type of gradual thing you are looking at 
vuono replied that the nations military leaders are well aware 
of the pressures but he hoped the nation and congress are 
prepared for the consequences

the growing number of law firms that offer 
investment advice public relations help and other services has 
prompted the nations largest lawyer group to consider restrictions 
the issue has become even more urgent since the previously 
unthinkable is about to happen nonlawyers will wield much the 
same clout within some law firms as lawyers 
its a pretty explosive issue said dick collins an 
american bar association spokesman to the oldtime definition of 
professionalism this is anathema nevertheless this sort of thing 
is out there and we will have to deal with it 
the abas policymaking house of delegates will be presented at 
its convention in august with recommendations to limit lawyers 
providing nonlegal services and to ban nonlawyers from becoming 
law firm partners 
if adopted as official aba policy the recommendations will 
serve as models for legal ethics rules enforced by each state 
law firms and the rules that govern them may be headed in the 
opposite direction however 
in the district of columbia where law firm diversification got 
its first foothold local rules underwent a revolutionary 
firstinthenation revision last month to allow nonlawyers to 
become partners 
the changes which take effect in january are an attempt to 
help law firms attract and retain skills not traditionally found 
among lawyers said robert e jordan iii a prime backer of the 
new rules 
jordans prestigious law firm of steptoe amp johnson along with 
several others in the nations capital have for years provided 
investment advice lobbying and international trade consulting 
through subsidiaries run by nonlawyers 
nationwide about 80 law firms are affiliated with businesses 
that provide nonlegal services 
from a status standpoint these executivedirector types have 
been secondclass citizens even though they can be making more 
money than some of the law firms partners jordan said the 
rule change though quite severely restrained may make it easier 
to hold on to such people 
lawyers should not reject all outside or even inhouse 
consulting by nonlawyers he says 
for years consulting businesses that specialize in jury 
selection have helped lawyers pick juries for certain kinds of 
cases jordan noted adding that some day these businesses may be 
brought into the law firms 
consulting is not adverse to a legal client he said some 
law firms have hired english professors for clearwriting programs 
i think any thoughtful lawyer realizes that anything you can do to 
make your case more persuasive you should do it even if that 
means hiring a nonlawyer to help 
but the concepts of diversification and nonlawyer partners have 
their outspoken critics 
this whole idea of onestop shopping is highly dangerous 
said l harold levinson a legal ethics professor at the vanderbilt 
university law school in nashville 
inevitably these nonlawyers will exert some influence on 
culture of the law firm and on the culture of the legal 
profession levinson said there is a need to improve but we 
should improve ourselves rather than sharing with others the 
responsibility to improve 
one potential ethical problem he said stems from the common 
law privilege lawyers enjoy against testifying against their 
clients would the same privilege exist for nonlawyers 
levinson also said the seemingly tempting economics of letting 
nonlawyers play larger roles in law firms may backfire 
lawyers untrained in the specialized services offered by the 
nonlawyer partner will have no way of knowing whether the 
nonlawyer partner is rendering highquality service or not he 
said 
however real the potential pitfalls a number of district of 
columbia law firms appear ready even eager to take let 
nonlawyers in as partners

the man leading lithuanias peaceful drive to win 
its independence from the soviet union is a softspoken 
57yearold music professor 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis lacks the charisma of 
polands lech walesa or czechoslovakias vaclav havel his efforts 
are more likely to evoke comparisons to mohandas k gandhis 
strategy of unarmed resistance 
yet in just two years landsbergis and other leaders of the 
sajudis peoples front have organized the staid lithuanians into an 
unswerving mass determined to be free of the soviet union 
some call him unflinching others say he is obstinate risking 
revival of the superpowers cold war for the sake of his small 
nation that declared independence a month ago 
gandhi won indias independence by trading on the british sense 
of fair play landsbergis is gambling that soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev has rejected the ruthless violence of his 
predecessors he hopes gorbachev will admit that lithuania was 
unjustly forcibly annexed into the soviet union in 1940 and that 
this wrong should be righted 
he says that only by letting lithuania go will gorbachev succeed 
in forging a soviet union held together by its inhabitants will 
instead of the armys force 
but there are indications that gorbachev is focusing his anger 
at lithuania on landsbergis and wants him removed before he will 
sit down and talk 
the president of the ussr does not intend to sit at a 
table of negotiations with landsbergis leonid mikhailov said in 
the journal new times a soviet political magazine 
there is no guarantee that the ouster of landsbergis alone will 
be enough to bring gorbachev to compromise not when he insists 
that lithuanian success would spark more separatism across the 
soviet union leading to bloody ethnic violence 
mikhailovs analysis of the tense standoff was remarkably 
evenhanded compared with the antilithuanian articles filling the 
soviet press in the past month he concluded that the soviet 
campaign of intimidating military maneuvers occupation of key 
buildings by soldiers and attempts to block implementation of 
lithuanian laws is designed to destroy the credibility of the 
landsbergis government in the eyes of lithuanians 
every day proof of the impossibility of fulfilling their 
promises brings landsbergis closer to defeat mikhailov wrote 
so far however that is not happening 
instead the lithuanian people are standing by landsbergis and 
the government that declared independence march 11 
when moscow installed its own chief prosecutor the staff 
ignored him and continued to work for the lithuanianappointed 
prosecutor 
when the communists loyal to moscow sent 15 soldiers into the 
republics only newspaper printing plant and demanded that only 
their newspaper be published the 1000strong staff of printers 
ignored them and continued to produce independenceoriented news 
but landsbergis had to suspend plans for a lithuanian border 
guard for fear that the force would run into violent resistance 
from soviet kgb border troops 
and despite a month of such psychological war with tank tracks 
carving up the wellkept streets of vilnius landsbergis has 
remained calm and he has kept his people quiet too 
moscow has reported only a handful of incidents of minor 
violence which are being investigated independent confirmation 
has been more difficult since moscow expelled foreigners from the 
republic 
when gorbachev demanded lithuanians surrender their 30000 
hunting guns and landsbergis refused to honor the order of a 
foreign government only 1500 were volunteered to local police 
when threatened with the prospect of soviet soldiers breaking 
into homes to confiscate hunting guns landsbergis stuck to his 
gandhistyle strategy of peaceful resistance 
those uninvited guests should be treated as guests he 
advised citizens people should be polite and should explain to 
the intruders about their actions 
landsbergis is following his forefathers footsteps as a freedom 
fighter his grandfather was imprisoned and deported for 
nationalism and his father fought in the underground against the 
nazis 
yet he had never played a role in politics until taking the lead 
at the sajudis prodemocracy proindependence movement at its 
first congress 18 months ago 
sajudis whose members come from a variety of political parties 
swept to power in the first free parliamentary elections in 50 
years in the irelandsized baltic republic in february and march 
landsbergis refuses to hold a referendum on independence 
lithuanians could vote on joining the soviet union but not leaving 
it he says because they were not legally annexed 
landsbergis is furious at the west particularly the united 
states and 27 other countries that said lithuania was not part of 
the soviet union for 50 years then failed to give formal 
recognition of independence when the crisis came 
are they willing to sell lithuania again to the soviet 
union he asked in a deadly calm voice in clear reference to the 
events of world war ii when the west concentrated on nazi germany 
and ignored the soviet occupation and annexation of the baltics 
repeatedly landsbergis telegrams gorbachev asking for dialogue 
holding out wide possibilities for compromise on specifics from 
allowing soviet military bases to remain on lithuanian territory to 
gradual transfer of trade to world prices 
there are no questions that cannot be discussed except 
independence landsbergis said 
but gorbachev has not budged from his insistence that 
independence must be canceled before he will negotiate 
its difficult to establish contact with a brick wall 
landsbergis sighs

peace activists from both germanys protested 
together for the first time during traditional easter marches 
saturday while guards waved tens of thousands of cars through the 
border to prevent traffic jams 
the custom of easter marches for peace dates back to the 1950s 
but protests were held separately in east and west germany for 
decades until the border opened during east germanys revolution 
last fall 
east germans were among nearly 1000 marchers who began a 
threeday march in the west german city of duisburg under the 
slogan to live without armaments the demonstrators plan to 
march from town to town through the industrialized ruhr region 
more than 1000 protesters set out from the east german baltic 
port of rostock for the west german port of luebeck demanding that 
a unified germany contribute to making peace more secure in europe 
some 5000 residents of the east german districts of rathenow 
and havelberg about 37 miles west of berlin marched to a military 
training field near the elbe river demanding that trees be planted 
and the land recultivated 
similar marches and rallies took place in about a dozen cities 
and towns throughout the two germanys but most of the easter 
marches were scheduled for sunday 
tens of thousands of germans from east and west poured through 
the border for the second day in a row for easter weekend holiday 
trips with family and friends 
a decision by newly elected prime minister lothar de maiziere to 
ease passport checks appeared to speed up the process of crossing 
the border 
we only waited five minutes on the border at christmas it was 
awful and now it goes so smoothly said political scientist 
roland freudentstein who drove by car to west berlin from his home 
in cologne 
the central traffic information service in the west german city 
of duesseldorf reported that traffic was relaxed and calm west 
german highways are routinely the site of major traffic jams during 
holidays 
lastminute shoppers and thousands of visitors strolled through 
dozens of crossings leading into both sides of berlin as uniformed 
guards simply raised their arms to wave by the crowds 
while the holidays pushed politics briefly to the back burner 
debate continued over the exchange rate of the two nations 
currency union 
wolf von amerongen head of the east europe committee of german 
entepreneurs told a west german radio station he supported the 
west german central banks position opposing a onetoone exchange 
of east german marks into west german marks 
east germanys new finance minister walter romberg said friday 
the east germans need a onetoone exchange 
the west german central bank favors a twotoone exchange rate 
for all but small savings accounts saying that parity would be 
inflationary and harmful to economic reconstruction 
talks on the currency union are likely to begin shortly after 
the easter holiday 
in another development east germanys former defense minister 
said saturday that the military in both germanys should set the 
pace in disarmament to build trust and erase fears in europe a 
major newspaper reported 
theodor hoffmann proposed that the military of both germanys be 
brought closer together in the unification process building a 
cooperative security structure to develop more trust between 
eastern and western europe 
both german armies should set the pace to ease tensions with 
drastic disarmament as a part of bringing europeans closer 
together neues deutschland quoted hoffmann as saying this would 
contribute to the peoples of europe having no grounds to fear 
german military might

betty ann kirk wanted everyone to know 
about her new baby she called the restaurant where her husband 
works she passed out photographs of herself and the infant girl to 
members of her clown club 
police were sending out their own pictures a composite sketch 
of the woman they believed shot a 33yearold mother in the back of 
the head and fled with her newborn daughter 
this week state prosecutors are expected to seek a firstdegree 
murder and kidnapping indictment against ms kirk known as 
sweetheart the clown who concealed her latest miscarriage for 
months and may have combed birth announcements looking for a baby 
to snatch 
in my right mind i would have never expected anything like 
this said ms kirks husband craig who has not been charged 
i feel like its the crime of the century 
ms kirk 31 who has two children at home is just the latest 
of dozens of women who suffered miscarriages then were arrested on 
charges of kidnapping a baby 
a bloodhound was used in february to track down a new york city 
woman who police say was depressed over a miscarriage and took a 
3dayold boy from a hospital maternity ward in may 1988 a 
maryland jury convicted a woman of smuggling a 3weekold boy from 
a hospital in a canvas bag she kept the baby four months 
the facts of this case do not surprise me said dr lester 
grinspoon editor of harvards mental health newsletter in 
cambridge mass we know that after losing a fetus some women 
experience severe symptoms ranging from depression to delusions 
ms kirk lives in north fort myers a 20mile drive from sharon 
lynn parkers ranchstyle home on a deadend street in lehigh acres 
ms parker gave birth to the 7pound girl march 19 and took out 
an announcement in local newspapers several months earlier she 
and ms kirk first met at a shopping mall where ms kirk appeared 
as a clown and painted circus faces on ms parkers 5yearold 
twins both women were pregnant at the time 
a neighbor walking her dog march 29 noticed a darkhaired woman 
pull into the parkers driveway and knock on the front door shortly 
before 10 am according to a police affidavit the neighbor kept 
walking 
about six hours later ms parkers three older children 
returned home from school and found their mothers body slumped 
into a reclining chair their infant sister julie lynn was 
missing but her bottles and baby clothes were left behind 
soon lee county sheriff deputies were receiving reports from 
people who were suspicious of the sudden appearance of ms kirks 
baby even though for months she had boasted of her pregnancy ms 
kirk even shaved the babys dark hair to affect the look of a 
newborn 
the day after the slaying police questioned ms kirk who 
insisted she had given birth at a fort myers clinic and went home 
several hours later her husband appeared bewildered by the 
suddenness of the delivery but said he believed his wifes story 
and thought the baby was his according to police reports 
the clinic had no record of a baby girl being born that day 
police said 
later that night ms kirk was stopped driving away from her 
home a worn trailer her husband asleep ms kirk had sneaked out 
leaving behind the baby and a note to her husband 
i left you some signed checks it read in part im 
leaving you because i love you too much 
less than 48 hours after the shooting the baby girl was returned 
to her father gary who wept at a news conference 
were just happy to have her back he said 
it was a wellthoughtout wellcalculated murder and 
kidnapping said lee county sheriff john mcdougall 
in addition to firstdegree murder ms kirk was charged with 
kidnapping and a felony weapons count she could receive the death 
penalty if convicted 
ms kirks husband believes frustration was building over their 
inability to have children since their 1983 marriage 
he said his wife had four miscarriages including the one in 
december but this time she retained a large belly and told no one 
she lost the fetus including him he said 
she was knitting booties and sweaters and hats and all kinds 
of stuff said kirk 
ms kirk had two children from a former marriage who lived with 
the kirks she had a third child taken away by state welfare 
workers and given up for adoption after her first husband was 
convicted of aggravated child abuse 
ms kirk had helped her daughter sell girl scout cookies and 
once crafted a handmade halloween costume for a neighbors girl 
she always wanted to be around children said kirk

cape verde will hold its first direct 
presidential election and its first multiparty legislative 
balloting later this year political leaders in the west african 
nation said 
the announcement came late friday at the end of a fourday 
meeting by leaders of the only political party now allowed in the 
10island archipelago the ruling the african party for the 
indpendence of cape verde 
olivio pires a party spokesman told the portuguese news 
agency lusa that the presidential election will be held on a 
nonparty basis this year on a date to be announced later 
pires said president aristides pereira who has ruled cape verde 
since it gained independence from portugal in 1975 will have to 
step down from his post as the partys general secretary if he 
chooses to run for reelection 
pires said the legislative election will be held in december 
after the presidential balloting lusa reported from the cape 
verdian capital praia 
currently citizens elect members of the peoples national 
assembly from lists of candidates put forward by the ruling party 
the president is then elected by the assembly the only 
legislative body 
the new political structure was developed with the help of 
attorneys in portugal and is modeled after the election plan in 
portugal which also chooses its president on a nonparty basis 
the reforms further advance cape verdes evolution from the 
singleparty marxistinspired system it embraced after 
independence to a democratic system 
the country has gradually opened up its economy to private 
enterprise and recently introduced legislation that would result in 
greater freedom for the press some criticism of the ruling party 
is already allowed 
pereira also has won praise from western governments human 
rights groups and aid agencies for his pragmatism and tolerance of 
political dissent 
cape verde 385 miles off the senegalese coast is the second of 
portugals former african colonies to implement democratic reforms

chancellor helmut kohl hoping to 
be the first leader of a unified germany is far less popular in 
the east than his top opponent in west germanys upcoming election 
a poll indicates 
the bild am sonntag newspaper said oskar lafontaine the 
leftleaning social democratic candidate chosen to run against kohl 
in december far outstripped the chancellor in a recent poll of 
1000 east german voters 
lafontaine the outspoken governor of west germanys southern 
saarland state was favored by 46 percent for chancellor of a 
unified germany the newspaper said it said kohl was chosen by 
only 24 percent of a crosssection of voters from east germanys 
major parties that formed the countrys newly elected coalition 
government on thursday 
the report which was furnished early to other news media and 
will appear in the newspapers sunday editions said 30 percent of 
those polled were undecided it gave no margin for error 
the poll comes just four weeks after east germanys first free 
elections on march 18 a conservative alliance headed by east 
germanys new prime minister lothar de maiziere strongly backed 
by kohl and promises of speedy monetary and economic union easily 
won with 48 percent of the vote 
observers at the time said that kohls frequent trips into east 
germany to campaign for the conservatives was a major factor in the 
election results 
lafontaine who easily won reelection as saarland state 
governor in january with more than 54 percent of the vote has been 
openly critical of kohls hurry to unify the two countries 
kohl favors quick monetary union and massive financial backing 
to restart east germanys stuttering economy lafontaine wants a 
slower pace of unification to guarantee social benefits and jobs 
for the east germans

questions haunt the relatives of 47 sailors 
killed last april in the fiery blast aboard the uss iowa and 
although the world war iiera warship may retire the families 
nightmares may not end 
with most accidents you have the accident and then its over 
with all the press and the problems related to the investigation 
this just doesnt go away said dale schelin whose son 
geoffrey was one of those killed 
on april 19 1989 seconds before the iowa was to fire test 
shots from its threegun no 2 turret an explosion in the center 
gun killed all 47 men in the upper turret thirteen sailors in the 
turrets bottom compartment escaped 
the navy which plans to mothball the battleship concluded the 
most likely cause of the blast was sabotage by gunners mate 
clayton hartwig who died in the blast the navy said hartwig was 
suicidally despondent over a broken friendship with another sailor 
the families however doubt the navys conclusion they want to 
know more about the age of gunpowder that ignited in the blast off 
puerto rico and about possible malfunctions within the huge gun 
turret 
the gunpowder in the turret was stored in the summer of 1988 
on barges for 60 days when the temperature exceeded 100 degrees 
said hartwigs sister kathy kubicina it is supposed to be 
stored at 70 degrees the high temperatures cause it to 
destabilize 
autopsy reports indicate the dead sailors were wearing jewelry 
and watches in the turret that could have caused a spark ms 
kubicina said 
i have evidence that indicates the gunpowder was starting to 
turn green ms kubicina said when it turns green that means 
it is starting to destabilize in my brothers autopsy and 
other ones it says there were green foreign materials in their 
bodies 
ms kubicina said she has asked the navy for a chemical analysis 
of the propellants removed from the bodies but but ive been 
told no chemical analysis was don 
sharon zieglers husband chief gunners mate reginald owen 
ziegler 39 was the senior enlisted man in the iowa turret he was 
killed less than four months before he was to retire 
its so hard to believe that men working sidebyside with 
each other depending on each other that the navy would pinpoint 
one man she said if they had picked on my husband i would 
have fought them just like the hartwig family 
my husband always said there were many things that could go 
wrong he always said it all depended on his kids pushing the right 
buttons their lives depended on that 
tests by navy experts found residue in the center gun of 
material the navy concluded was a detonating device those findings 
were not duplicated by fbi experts 
the navys report also was criticized by members of congress and 
outside experts who argue the navy was looking for a scapegoat and 
ignored other possible causes 
a subcommittee of the house armed services committee said the 
navys conclusion were not supported by the facts 
krieg brusnahan a lawyer for the hartwigs said any legal 
action will be announced on the anniversary of the blast thursday 
the navy is not going to get away with trashing of the hartwig 
family name with its uncorroborated accusations he said 
the future of the iowa is uncertain one of four iowaclass 
battleships the secondlargest such ships ever built the iowa has 
nine 16inch guns that can hurl projectiles as heavy as volkswagen 
beetles as far as 23 miles 
launched in august 1942 it is the only warship with a bathtub 
which was installed for president franklin d roosevelt the iowa 
won nine battle stars in world war ii and two battle stars in korea 
changes in eastern europe have navy officials reconsidering its 
usefulness but former navy secretary john f lehman jr who 
brought the iowa out of retirement in 1983 said mothballing the 
ship is a mistake 
we still need naval power to deter and contain statesponsored 
terrorism lehman said the battleship next to the carrier is 
the most effective and important means of deterrent 
three months after the explosion the battleship left on a 
deployment to the mediterranean with the damaged gun turret sealed 
then returned to its norfolk base in december 
today the iowa is at the norfolk naval shipyard undergoing 13 
million in preparations for mothballing 
we will hold a private memorial service april 19 for the 
ships crew and the families of men killed its really something 
very private the best way for us to remember our shipmates 
said lt cmdr brad goforth 
a plaque listing the 47 sailors who died including hartwig 
will be dedicated the iowas commander capt fred moosally 
called hartwig a good sailor and a good shipmate 
the families dont want to see the warship in mothballs 
she belongs at sea mrs ziegler said there is the pride 
of all the guys who went to sea on her who fought on her thats 
how she needs to be remembered proudly riding the waves that 
ship carries the ghosts of 47 men in her turret

a us congressional delegation was 
barred from a former american base in vietnam but assured that 
soviet forces at the facility will leave by 1992 the head of the 
group said saturday 
rep patricia schroeder also said she was told by vietnamese 
officials in hanoi on friday that a reported offer to allow us 
forces to use the base at cam ranh bay in the future was taken out 
of context 
the colorado democrat is leading a sevenmember delegation from 
the house of representatives armed services committee on a tour of 
southeast asia 
schroeder said in an interview in bangkok that the delegation 
wanted to see facilities at cam ranh bay and the level of soviet 
presence there but foreign minister nguyen co thach of vietnam 
said he could not authorize the visit 
thach said the soviet union would definitely be out by 1992 
we thought it interesting that they said that so emphatically 
schroeder said no one had even heard that specific date before 
she quoted the vietnamese officials as saying the pullout was 
not tied to negotiations that could lead to a us departure from 
the philippines 
the delegation is assessing the military balance in the region 
and seeking possible new sites for us military bases in the event 
of a pullout from the philippines 
officials also said remarks they reportedly had made to us 
congressmen about the possibility of american warships being 
allowed to use the base again were taken out of context schroeder 
said rep thomas ridge rpa recently said senior vietnamese 
officials told him in indonesia they could foresee a day when us 
warships would allowed back 
a us state department official said last week it had received 
no offer from hanoi about cam ranh bay 
the soviet union took over the usbuilt base at the end of the 
vietnam war in 1975 moscow says it maintains only a token presence 
there now 
us leases at its two largest overseas military bases clark 
air base and subic naval base in the philippines as well as on 
four smaller ones expire next year negotiations to renew the 
leases begin may 14 the talks are likely to be difficult because 
of rising antiamerican sentiment in the philippines 
although washington has said it would like to retain the bases 
it says it is prepared to abandon them if the opposition is 
overwhelming or the price for new leases too high 
before visiting vietnam schroeder traveled to singapore in 
response to prime minister lee kwan yews offer to allow the us 
to expand its facilities there on sunday the delegation is to 
travel to indonesia 
on friday it also visited phnom penh for talks with hun sen 
premier of the cambodias hanoiinstalled government 
in addition to schroeder the members of the delegation are rep 
david martin rny ben blaz rguam rep james courter rnj

india will be prepared for any 
eventuality with pakistan if border tensions between the two 
nations escalate prime minister vp singh warned saturday 
pakistan has deployed radars and armored regiments close to the 
indian border and is readying its airfields for war singh told 
reporters 
india and pakistan have fought three wars since their 
independence from britain in 1947 relations between the two south 
asian neighbors have become increasingly strained in recent weeks 
over the northern region of kashmir along their border 
pakistan had already sounded a red alert which is the last 
word on war preparations singh said 
in islamabad a pakistani foreign ministry official labeled 
singhs allegations as a figment of his imagination 
singhs statements proved that india was trying to provoke a 
war said the official who by practice cannot be named 
in indias far north moslem militants on saturday freed a former 
member of the state legislature a day after he was abducted the 
united news of india reported 
amirullah khan 75 was abducted from his home in shopian near 
srinagar 425 miles northeast of new delhi khan is a member of 
former prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party 
khan was set free because of mounting pressure by security 
forces the news agency said without elaborating 
violence mounted in northern jammukashmir state the center of 
the tensions between india and pakistan as a grenade thrown by 
militants exploded near an army truck wounding three soldiers 
police said 
a roundtheclock curfew entered its eighth day in srinagar the 
capital of jammukashmir as police arrested 100 people in their 
search for the killers of three kidnapping victims 
prominent industrialist lm khera and kashmir university vice 
chancellor mushir ulhaq and his secretary were found shot to death 
last week moslem separatists had demanded the release of three 
rebels in exchange for the men but the government refused 
in the past week police have detained more than 1000 people in 
their search security officials said 
kashmir is disputed by india and pakistan and two of their 
three wars were focused on the region now divided by a ceasefire 
line monitored by the united nations 
moslem separatists in kashmir say they want an independent 
country attached neither to moslem pakistan or india whose 
population is 82 percent hindu

florida democrats sensing 
vulnerability in the states firstterm republican governor had 
been committed this year to avoiding their traditional intraparty 
blood bath 
but the democratic plan to unify early behind one candidate to 
unseat gov bob martinez underwent an unexpected shakeup thursday 
when former us sen lawton chiles decided to attempt a political 
comeback and seek his partys nomination 
some democrats welcomed the surprise candidacy of chiles who 
was one of floridas most popular politicians and saw a dream 
ticket in his selection of former us rep kenneth buddy 
mackay as a running mate 
but supporters of the democrats early frontrunner us rep 
bill nelson screamed foul while martinez and the republicans 
predicted the democrats would again selfdestruct 
its just part of their struggle to figure out how theyre 
going to stay in power in the state of florida when the tide is 
going against them said martinez they just dont have the 
leadership for the future 
despite a giant fundraising effort by republicans that already 
has put more than 6 million in a reelection war chest martinez 
is hardly a lock for a second term polls consistently show more 
than a third of floridas voters disapprove of his performance in 
office 
martinezs popularity plummeted shortly after he took office in 
1987 when he reversed himself on the states illfated services 
tax leading to a repeal of the tax after it had been in place for 
just six months 
anxious to take advantage of martinezs poor standing even 
among many republicans the democrats turned to nelson best known 
after two decades in public life for a 1986 trip into space aboard 
the shuttle columbia 
the telegenic nelson was considered safe in growing diversified 
florida where most voters get to know their politicians through 
television ads 
nelson whose campaign has suffered a number of embarrassing 
reversals in recent months tried unsuccessfully to keep chiles out 
of the race and then sought to paint his new rival as a tired 
retread who wants back into the limelight at the expense of his 
partys future 
nelson 47 reminded voters that the 60yearold chiles retired 
from the us senate in january 1989 after saying he was burned 
out from nearly two decades in the nations capital 
we democrats lost an important us senate seat two years ago 
when lawton chiles decided he was suddenly burned out with public 
service said nelson 
florida needs a vigorous new leader with a high energy 
level he said and i can assure you that im not burned out 
im ready to govern this state 
chiles meanwhile said he wanted to return to politics to keep 
florida from heading down the same path of slowmoving bureaucracy 
and bigmoney politics that frustrated him on the national level 
he spent his first full day as a candidate answering questions 
about his use of medication for depression a development 
carefully fanned by some of his political opponents republicans 
however denied newspaper reports they had leaked the medical 
history on chiles 
i think i was depressed about what was going on in the 
state chiles said now im going to do something about it 
chiles went from a littleknown state legislator in 1970 to an 
upset victory in a runoff for the democratic senate nomination 
after walking more than 1000 miles from the alabama border to the 
florida keys during a threemonth span 
from there chiles went on to defeat william c cramer in the 
general election and won reelection bids in 1976 and 1982 by 
landslide margins 
former democratic party chairman charles whitehead who resigned 
his position a year ago to support nelson acknowledged chiles was 
likely to lead nelson in early polls due to the former senators 
high name recognition 
but whitehead said nelson has 25 million in the bank that he 
can use to close the gap on chiles who plans to limit individual 
contributions to 100 as he did in his last us senate race in 
1982 
some florida democrats would rather nelson and a third candidate 
for the nomination state sen george stuart remain in their 
current jobs republicans already hold an 118 advantage among 
members of the us house and are threatening to take control of 
the florida senate where they presently are outnumbered 2317 
with reapportionment coming up next year democrats are anxious 
to hang onto control when it comes time to add the states three or 
four new congressional districts and redraw state legislative lines

a little bluecollar is showing 
through the allwhite outfits worn during croquet matches 
a us croquet association survey of its 5000 members shows 
that one in four is a millionaire and one in four drives a 
mercedes jaguar cadillac or bmw but 5 percent drive volkswagens 
a canadian machinist reid fleming was last years topranked 
player 
its just in the last couple of years that croquet has been 
available to people who dont belong to country clubs or have 
private courts said peyton ballenger a top us player 
now its played a great deal by people at all levels some of 
our best people are not your socially elite types 
ballenger one of croquets few club pros in the united states 
works at the pga sheraton resort here headquarters of the usca 
the resorts five courts will be the site this week of the usca 
national instructional school some of the worlds best players 
will teach 50 students at all ability levels in an effort by the 
usca to increase participation 
lessons normally are 35 to 45 for a 1hour session the 
fourday school costs 450 per person or 800 a couple 
hundreds of thousands of people play backyard croquet who 
dont know about this game yet said anne frost administrative 
director of the usca as they learn about it we see great 
potential 
the backyard game is a distant relative of the croquet played at 
the pga sheraton here the wickets are narrower only one32nd of 
an inch wider than the ball the mallets are heavier the rulebook 
thicker and tempers shorter 
youll occasionally see a mallet fly through the air 
ballenger said 
a novice could get frustrated just learning the names of the 
various shots theres the roquet the bisque the halfbisque the 
jump shot the cannon shot the crush shot and the continuation 
shot 
in serious croquet tactics are as important as takeoffs 
another kind of shot the game is part chess and part billiards 
they say it doesnt take a lot of coordination or stamina 
said marilyn watkins an occasional player and the public relations 
director at the resort but it takes an awful lot of skill and 
strategy 
the playing field covered with grass that resembles a golf 
green is slightly larger than a basketball court a firm stroke 
helps keep shots on line and top players are capable of hitting 
the ball 200 yards 
golfers often cross over to croquet ballenger said tennis 
players usually dont 
it tends to be a little slow for their taste she said 
croquet is growing anyway usca membership has increased from 
five clubs in 1977 to more than 300 this year 
the hall of fame includes the late statesman averell harriman 
the late movie mogul darryl zanuck and william rehnquist chief 
justice of the united states 
a sport where spectators sip champagne at tournaments likely 
always will be one that puts on the ritz 
but croquet clubs are on the upswing they now can be found in 
arkadelphia ark rockford ill lewisburg wva and keokuk 
iowa 
it has an image of being a rich persons game and an old 
persons game watkins said but the yuppie movement did a lot 
for croquet it was the new novelty sport and they started taking 
it up kind of like the food processor and espresso coffee

since taking over as coordinator of the state 
departments new office of usmexico border affairs last month 
irwin rubenstein has been asked to investigate cattle rustling on a 
ranchers border spread and gridlock in laredo 
as sympathetic as he is to the ranchers concerns the career 
diplomat says hes not going to be a personal problem solver for 
everybody whos got something cooking on the border 
instead says rubenstein he intends to do just what his title 
says be a coordinator among the many us agencies that deal with 
issues on the 2000mile border 
you have to deal with not only our own national interests but 
the concerns and sensitivities of another sovereign state 
rubenstein said in an interview at the state department last week 
rubenstein who has spent some 30 years in latin america with 
the foreign service including the past eight in mexico points to 
the creation of his job within the state departments office of 
mexican affairs as one example of an increasing awareness in the 
bush administration of the borders role 
the usmexico border is the only place in the world where a 
major industrialized country shares a boundary with a developing 
nation says democratic sen lloyd bentsen of texas who a year ago 
asked the state department to create the position rubenstein now 
holds 
the unique strip of boundary separating the two countries has 
its share of special problems high unemployment low income poor 
environmental conditions including pollution in stretches of the 
rio grande that make the river unsafe to even touch too little 
health care and diseases more common to the third world than the 
rest of the united states 
at the same time trade population and jobs continue to grow on 
the border according to the texas comptrollers office the border 
region was the states fastest growing in 1988 and 1989 spurred in 
part by plant expansions in mexico and high birth and immigration 
rates 
rubenstein said the negative has been accentuated in the 
past in the united states dealings with mexico on the border 
particularly drug smuggling and illegal immigration 
now were going to try to accentuate some of the positives 
he said mentioning trade and development public works pollution 
and sanitation

three europeans who were arrested on 
suspicion of stirring up trouble between moslems and christians in 
cairo were ordered deported saturday three days after their 
arrest a newspaper said 
the alahram newspaper said in its early sunday edition that a 
prosecutor decided to release and deport the three men after 
questioning them and finding no evidence they were doing anything 
more than spreading obscure ideas 
the men two swiss and a west german were arrested wednesday 
and interrogated on saturday 
recurrent violence in recent years by moslem activists seeking 
implementation of sharia or islamic law has made the government 
sensitive toward any activity that could cause religious trouble 
earlier saturday ali yassin top prosecutor for cairos 
elagouza district where the suspects lived said police reports 
showed they were engaged in proselytizing but we have no 
evidence yet that they were trying to create religious strife 
he denied news reports that documents were confiscated 
one report had said that germanlanguage leaflets 
misinterpreted verses of the koran islams holy book 
yassin said proselytizing is not an offense under egyptian law 
unless it is coupled with action to stir up trouble between 
religious communities the crime is punishable by up to five 
years imprisonment he said 
in practice proselytizing by christians is frowned upon 
yassin identified the three europeans as stefan walter and 
roland grysyr of switzerland and michael joseph of west germany 
all in their late 20s he did not give their hometowns 
reports had appeared on the governments middle east news agency 
and in stateowned and opposition newspapers that leaflets and 
other literature inciting sectarian strife were seized at the mens 
apartment 
yassin denied it the men preached in meetings and gatherings 
with various people he said without giving details 
he said the three men came to egypt about 18 months ago to study 
arabic they lived together in an apartment in elagouza district 
a middleclass neighborhood favored by foreigners 
last month in the southern elminya province moslem militants 
stoned and set fire to two christian coptic churches a youth club 
and copticowned shops fifteen people were wounded and nearly 300 
detained

nelson mandela admitted 
saturday that his african national congress had tortured dissident 
guerrillas but said the officials involved were punished and any 
further torture had been banned 
mandela made the surprising admission in a brief airport 
statement he said the claims of some anc guerrillas that they had 
been tortured were true that he deplored the action and promised 
it would not happen again 
unfortunately it is true that some of these people who have 
complained were in fact tortured but once the anc became aware 
immediate steps were taken to discipline those who were quilty of 
torturing other people he said 
mandela did not specify the punishment inflicted on those 
responsible for the torture but he said the commanders of the 
camps where the torture took place had been dismissed 
the anc is against torture or any form of coercion in order to 
extract information from those who are suspected of having broken 
the laws and the regulations which they are required to obey he 
said 
in nairobi kenya saturday seven former south african 
guerrillas said they had been tortured by anc commanders as 
mutineers 
the guerrillas said they were tortured at two punishment camps 
in angola called pango and quatro they said they were tied to 
trees and flogged with whips locked into metal transport 
containers that were left out in the searing african sun and were 
beaten and kicked by anc commanders and their jailers 
the seven were attached to the ancs military wing umkhonto we 
sizwe spear of the nation in angola after training in east 
germany and the soviet union in the early 1980s 
they said they mutinied against their leaders in 1984 were held 
in detention centers and angolan prisons for four years and then 
moved to a dakawa camp in tanzania after being freed on 
humanitarian grounds 
they quit the military wing in tanzania last december and fled 
to nairobi they said they added that they were eager to return to 
south africa after seeking sanctuary in kenya early this year 
were still waiting for word when we can go luvo mbengo 
28 one of the anc recruits told the associated press but we 
still dont know what our future is 
mandela attempted to downplay the incident saturday by saying 
that south africas whiteminority government routinely tortured 
and killed opponents he said the anc did not tolerate torture and 
stopped it immediately when the incidents were exposed 
large numbers of our people have been tortured and killed by 
the government they are still being tortured today despite all our 
protests he said 
a government commission has uncovered widespread evidence that 
south african police and military units systematically killed 
dissidents the commission is still in progress and the government 
has not taken any official action on the charges 
mandela also said the dissidents were not complaining against 
the anc as a whole or against him but against the security wing of 
the black nationalist organization 
the anc has responded as any responsible organization will do 
when they discover such malpractices he said 
mandela made the statement after a brief airport meeting with 
european community officials who visited south africa to assess 
political conditions 
he said he urged them to continue economic sanctions against the 
government because there had been no improvement in the rights 
granted black people 
he also said credit for upcoming talks on dismantling 
whiteminority rule belonged to the anc because the government has 
been avoiding such talks for the past three years 
the anc is to meet with the government may 24 in cape town to 
try to clear the way to fullscale talks on sharing political power 
with blacks 
south african president fw de klerk legalized the anc and 
released mandela in february in a bid to start constitutional talks

norman mailer says 
among his observations during a wideranging talk friday night 
at the university of iowa liberals are tiresome and the 
soviet union is no evil empire 
they cant even make soap how can they make a missile that 
can hit me said mailer who visited the soviet union before 
mikhail gorbachev came into power 
russians have kept alive their love of literature russians 
have literature that kept them alive free and independent he 
said it dealt with why am i here is there a god am i 
evil am i good 
the most difficult thing about being a writer is there are no 
answers there are only questions said the 67yearold author of 
the naked and the dead and the executioners song 
bestsellers are usually written by people who know very 
little about people he said they get away with it because

lithuanian officials acknowledged saturday that an 
economic blockade threatened by mikhail s gorbachev could cause 
huge layoffs but hoped that sympathetic soviet republics would 
balk at the presidents order 
in leningrad 5000 people gathered at the winter palace for a 
protest rally that included appeals to strike in support of 
lithuania if gorbachev pursues a blockade according to leningrad 
journalist maxim korzhov 
gorbachev gave lithuania until sunday to back away from its 
declaration of independence or face a halt in deliveries of 
exportable goods that could include all the oil and gas used in 
the small baltic republic as well as metal machinery chemicals 
cotton and automobiles 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis has said the march 11 
declaration of independence will not be revoked 
landsbergis speaking at a news conference shown on the soviet 
evening tv news said gorbachevs ultimatum would not even be 
discussed until tuesday since predominantly roman catholic 
lithuania will still be celebrating the easter holiday monday 
it is impossible to give the answer in two days this is a 
way to delay negotiations and try to present it as if lithuania 
doesnt want negotiations he said 
he said it was unclear whether the soviets planned a full or 
partial blockade or some other sort of limitation on lithuanias 
economic activities 
lithuanian economist and legislator kazimieras antanavicius said 
a soviet blockade would close factories and laidoff workers may 
not be able to handle losing their paychecks indefinitely many 
workers live only from paycheck to paycheck without savings he 
said 
that hardship could cause the republics government to consider 
a temporary suspension of the independence declaration if necessary 
to persuade gorbachev to negotiate antanavicius said 
western advisers to the lithuanian government have said the 
republics economic survival is tied to its ability to maintain its 
trade with the soviet union 
but with at least four other soviet republics and numerous 
localities now controlled by progressives who support lithuanias 
bid for independence lithuania is hoping for gaping holes in 
gorbachevs blockade 
lithuanian leaders said they expected some republics with their 
own independence movements to resist gorbachevs order 
we dont think individual republics will go along with this 
especially republics like azerbaijan and georgia which want 
independence said aidas palubinskas a spokesman for the 
lithuanian parliament they understand they are going to be in 
the same boat 
latvia and estonia the other two baltic republics are also 
pressing for independence though more cautiously than lithuania 
on friday they signed an economic cooperation agreement with 
lithuania that promises mutual aid in emergencies 
landsbergis told reporters saturday night that lithuania is 
trying to contract directly with soviet enterprises for its 
supplies according to edward tuskenis another parliament 
spokesman the soviet system still requires most deals to go 
through moscow ministries 
several weeks ago a representative from the largest soviet oil 
fields located in tyumen appeared in vilnius to ask if lithuania 
would buy directly from his enterprise 
reacting to gorbachevs threat landsbergis expressed relief 
that gorbachev chose economic pressure rather than military force 
we expected worse he said 
in the month since lithuania declared its independence the 
kremlin has alternated between making threats and conciliatory 
offers soviet troops have occupied some buildings in vilnius the 
capital and conscripts who refused to serve in the red army have 
been detained 
speaking of the latest threat landsbergis was quoted by the 
independent newsletter glasnost as saying the government of 
lithuania foresaw this and was ready for it immediately after the 
declaration of independence he said the republic can continue 
one or two months but even then it is not a death blow for us 
most important lithuania cannot starve palubinskas said 
it produces more meat and milk than it consumes so customers in 
moscow and leningrad would see their already meager food supplies 
shrink he said 
however weeks before the declaration of independence a 
parliamentary commission reported that oil and gas supplies would 
be critical in the drive for freedom buying them on the open 
market would be vastly more expensive than paying subsidized soviet 
prices 
at world market prices we would be running a deficit of 700 
million for oil alone concluded a summary of the parliamentary 
report printed in the newspaper lithuanian review 
the same report said lithuania produces 60 percent of certain 
soviet television parts and 30 percent of key tractor components 
the soviet economy is already tottering from inefficiency and 
political strikes 
in addition lithuania might retaliate by demanding world prices 
for exporting soviet oil gas and other products through its baltic 
sea ports particularly klaipeda 
officials of the republic hope western countries will come to 
their aid particularly with oil so far though there have been 
no public promises 
on saturday president bush and prime minister margaret thatcher 
of britain urged gorbachev to drop his threat and open talks with 
lithuania 
now is no time for escalation bush said after he and mrs 
thatcher met for talks in hamilton bermuda 
britains foreign secretary douglas hurd said saturday that if 
moscow uses coercion instead of dialogue to keep lithuania in its 
fold there will be a penalty to pay in terms of russias 
dealings with the west 
hurd who spoke in an interview with press association 
britains domestic news agency did not elaborate 
pope john paul ii on saturday met with gorbachev aide vadim 
zagladin but vatican officials declined to say what was discussed 
the pontiff sent an easter telegram to cardinal vincentas 
skadkevicius of lithuania which is predominantly roman catholic

two newspaper editors fired for refusing 
to quit as leaders of an antiabortion group will file a 
discrimination complaint with the help of a religious defense group 
the rutherford institute said friday its staff attorneys would 
help john kennedy and terri lambertsen pursue the religious 
discrimination complaint with the federal equal employment 
opportunity commission 
the announcement of assistance came as dozens of protesters 
some carrying pictures of aborted fetuses picketed the offices of 
the fairfield ledger where kennedy was news editor and ms 
lambertson was people page editor 
the journalists were fired monday because they refused to give 
up their posts with the newly formed southeast iowa prolifers ms 
lambertsen is president and kennedy is secretary 
the paper said they were violating a policy against being active 
in groups that receive news coverage 
kennedy and ms lambertsen have complained that their 
constitutional rights to free speech and religious freedom were 
violated 
john whitehead the institutes president said he respected the 
newspapers desire to guard its reputation 
but he added in a statement no employer in the news 
industry or elsewhere can claim a veto power over the freespeech 
freeassociation and religiousfreedom rights of its employees to 
hold otherwise would be unconstitutional unamerican and dangerous 
to democracy 
jan nierling the editor of the sixdayaweek afternoon 
newspaper declined to comment on the institutes announcement 
friday saying she had not studied the statement on saturday a 
person answering the telephone at the paper said nierling was out 
of town and that the paper still had no comment 
nierling said earlier that the paper had no choice but to fire 
the editors to protect its credibility 
whitehead said he expected the complaint to be filed within 
several weeks he said a decision had yet to be reached on whether 
the complaint would seek reinstatement with back pay or damages or 
both 
the newspaper with a circulation of about 5000 lost 30 
subscribers as a result of the dismissals and three small 
businesses had canceled advertising nierling said earlier but the 
paper was getting incredible support from the community she 
said 
since it was founded by whitehead in his basement in manassas 
va in 1982 the institute has grown to 25 state chapters and has 
an annual budget of about 800000 said michael patrick the 
executive director the institute now makes its home at 
charlottesville va 
last year the institute defended a milwaukee journal 
receptionist who was fired over antiabortion activities the paper 
later said that the decision to apply its ethics code to a 
receptionist was an error 
the nonprofit organizations 40 staff attorneys handled more 
than 100 cases last year involving more than 700 clients and is 
supported by public donations he said most of the cases were on 
religious freedom issues

police on saturday completed their 
search for victims of a fire that swept through a ferry last 
weekend and an inquiry heard testimony from an engineer who cited 
tense relations among crewmembers 
the search has ended for victims on board the gutted hulk of the 
10500ton scandinavian star ferry moored in a swedish port and 
officials estimated 160 dead and one person unaccounted for said 
police in oslo norway 
a list of the victims names will be issued monday police said 
fire broke out on the danishowned ferry on april 7 during an 
overnight run between oslo and frederikshavn denmark it was towed 
to lysekil sweden 
norwegian police have estimated that 534 people were aboard the 
scandinavian star including 97 crew members the exact number may 
never be known because passenger lists did not include young 
children who traveled free and people who boarded in cars 
american entertainer ruth e rome 27 of east lansing mich 
was missing and presumed killed 
police believe that the fire which started in at least three 
places was deliberately set and they are investigating reports 
that the arsonist could be a disgruntled crewmember 
manuel martins the second engineer told the fourth day of an 
inquiry in copenhagen that the atmosphere between the 16 men in the 
engine room was tense during the week before the fire 
he along with his portuguese colleagues had language 
difficulties with the filipino machinists martins said the chief 
engineer was a west german 
police officers on the inquiry panel which includes lawyers and 
marine officials have asked each of the 12 witnesses called so far 
whether theyd heard of any trouble among the crew 
martins and the other portuguese were irritated because the 
filipinos had the only keys to the engine room tool chests martins 
said hed been unable to get access to the tools he needed during 
the entire week before the disaster 
the motors in several of the scandinavian stars lifeboats were 
out of order and the motors of two of them were removed martins 
said 
earlier witnesses spoke of malfunctioning fire doors and 
defective fire equipment none of the witnesses knew the ships 
emergency plan or what their own task was in case of fire

government and plo officials are 
considering the formation of a jordanianpalestinian federation 
that would follow a middle east peace accord a senior plo 
representative said saturday 
mahmoud abbas an executive committee member of the palestine 
liberation organization made the report after a twohour meeting 
with prime minister mudar badran to prepare for a visit by plo 
chief yasser arafat 
the confederation is an issue which was proposed some time 
ago and it is accepted to both sides abbas said 
and i believe it would not probably be implemented now but it 
is in our minds it exists it is desired and it is the ideal 
solution for both of us 
he said the confederation idea would be a main topic of 
discussion between king hussein and arafat who is scheduled to 
visit amman later in the week 
there was no immediate comment saturday from jordanian 
officials however the jordanians lately have said the idea of 
confederation should be discussed after a palestinian state is 
established 
the plo and jordan agreed in february 1985 to work for a peace 
settlement with israel that would lead to a palestinian state 
confederated with jordan 
such a status was intended to help overcome us resistance to a 
purely independent palestinian state and backers argued 
confederation would benefit both countries economically and 
socially 
despite the collapse of the 1985 plan a year later the plo has 
continued to advocate confederation 
the plo declared its own palestinian state in november 1988 
three months after king hussein renounced sovereignty over the 
israelioccupied west bank in favor of the plo 
although it did not define the borders of its state the plo 
said it would roughly encompass the west bank and gaza strip which 
are occupied by israel 
about half of jordans 31 million people come from palestinian 
families who fled their homes during wars with israel jordan ruled 
the west bank from 1949 until it was captured by israel in 1967 
abbas said arafat also would discuss the perceived threat of 
heavy soviet jewish emigration to israel and the occupied 
territories due to relaxed soviet immigration rules 
he said the plo was negotiating with the soviet union the 
united states and europe to halt the influx of soviet jews to the 
occupied territories 
abbas welcomed a statement friday by us senate republican 
leader robert dole that he would try to reverse a recent senate 
resolution recognizing undivided jerusalem as the capital of israel 
the israelis captured parts of jerusalem during the 1967 middle 
east war and later annexed them they have declared the city their 
capital 
the senate resolution is not binding on the us administration 
which considers east jerusalem to be occupied territory whose 
status should be decided by peace talks

the fontana hotel blaze that killed 
nine people proved once again how vulnerable the elderly are in 
fires experts say though the building housed young adults and 
children as well as old people the youngest victim was 75 
i believe they couldnt hear said max goldstein 84 who 
got out with his wife gertrude after hearing the managers 
warning and the fire alarm april 6 at the miami beach hotel 
no its because they couldnt get out said his neighbor 
sylvia pollen noting one woman who used a walker died in the 
elevator and another victim had difficulty walking 
a mixture of both goldstein concluded as he waited in line 
last week for a chance to return to his topfloor room in the 
threestory hotel destroyed in the predawn fire 
the 102room hotel built in 1951 met fire codes and 
investigators are dealing with a devastating death toll in a sound 
structure the ages of the victims ranged from 75 to 93 
investigators have not determined the cause but on friday ruled 
out arson and placed the starting point in a crawl space next to an 
elevator shaft 
fire chief braniard dorris said the investigation must determine 
why the fire cut the victims off from the fire exits 
although many miami beach hotels are retirement homes the 
fontanas 100 residents ranged from babies to frail seniors 
it wasnt a building that housed only the old elderly or that 
housed the disabled elderly said police detective jim hyde it 
had a very big mix among the tenants 
fires kill people age 75 and older at three times the national 
average and almost onefifth of fire victims age 65 and older are 
bedridden or physically handicapped according to the national fire 
protection association 
the elderly are more likely to die because smoke aggravates any 
respiratory problems and they tend to walk upright rather than 
crouch or crawl to avoid smoke said leeann steinberg of the 
american association of retired persons 
the fontana fire had other aspects that made it typical of fatal 
fires the fire began about 3 am the us fire administration 
reports fatal fires are most common between 1 and 3 am and all 
but 14 percent of deaths are recorded in buildings like the 
fontana without sprinkler systems 
there has never been a multiple fatality in a properly 
sprinklered building said tim butters spokesman for the 
10000member international association of fire chiefs in 
washington 
existing hotels and motels in florida will be required to 
install sprinklers by october 1991 and dorris estimates 25 to 30 
hotels along the highrise studded beach already have complied or 
are installing systems now 
fontana residents commended a romanian immigrant family who 
bought the hotel for 16 million last june for making major 
improvements but a 150000 sprinkler system was still ahead 
asked if sprinklers would have saved lives hyde said the 
people in the fire marshals office think definitely 
goldstein who has alternated six months at the fontana and six 
months in new york city isnt sure what his plans are now 
when his wife wanders into the hotel parking lot where debris 
is stacked 10 feet high beside the building goldstein shakes his 
head and says she thinks shes still at the hotel shes in bad 
shape 
believe me im not right he says stressing he is still 
absorbing the fire losses ill be 110 when i get through with 
this

communist party general secretary 
gombogavyn ochirbat has reaffirmed his willingness to work with new 
opposition parties in introducing democratic reform 
a new party central committee on friday reelected ochirbat to 
the post he first was given one month ago after opposition protests 
forced out the old party leadership 
we shall take a position of mutual understanding cooperate 
with the opposition and hold political dialogue ochirbat told 
a television interviewer friday night at the conclusion of an 
extraordinary party congress 
the opposition inspired by the fall of communism elsewhere in 
the soviet bloc has emerged since december to demand a share of 
power the nation has been ruled for nearly seven decades by the 
communists formally known as the mongolian peoples revolutionary 
party 
in a session that ended just before dawn friday the 
extraordinary congress elected the new central committee paring it 
down from 146 members to 91 it also rewrote the party constitution 
to make it more democratic 
the new central committee met immediately to confirm ochirbat in 
his post it also reappointed four other members of the partys top 
decisionmaking body the politburo and added a sixth member 
sumya who was culture minister until midweek 
the central committee gave the politburo a new name the 
presidium but did not change its basic function or powers 
the new party constitution however abolishes the formal 
requirement of absolute obedience to the center and allows local 
party bodies to raise objections to orders from the top it also 
gives them a small degree of financial independence 
ochirbat also promised that people being laid off in a 
reorganization of the government will be given new jobs last week 
the government disbanded two ministries or ministrylevel 
committees and merged two with other ministries news reports said 
about 2000 people would be laid off 
meanwhile the new challenge to authority in the political 
sphere spread to the alreadystagnant economy as workers at two 
soviet joint ventures went on strike 
about 150 truck drivers at a soviet construction company in the 
city of darhan walked off saturday morning to protest plans to lay 
them off said javkhlant a member of the opposition mongolian 
democratic association 
he said about 34 workers at a soviet joint venture coal mine in 
baganuur struck earlier in the week for better working conditions 
but agreed to return to work at least temporarily saturday while 
awaiting a response from the company 
he said mongolian democratic association members were on the 
strike committees but had not started the strikes 
the government already has warned that national industrial 
output in the first quarter fell from last year and it has blamed 
the growing mood of lax discipline

a fashionable north side neighborhood is featuring art by children 
from cabrinigreen one of the nations most notorious housing 
projects 
i think the kids will be proud of themselves said gallery 
owner mickey quinlan who mounted the show to help celebrate the 
25th anniversary of a tutoring program at cabrini 
the exhibit titled cabrinis creations will feature the

two pieces in a show 
i felt like i was special because i never had my pictures 
hung up in a gallery before said isaiah a sixthgrader who 
wears clearframed eyeglasses that slip down his nose 
this year quinlan was motivated to extend the opportunity to 
other children from cabrini and the result is the exhibit that 
opens monday 
isaiahs contribution to the current show is a crayon drawing 
showing favorite childhood pastimes bowling playing video games 
shooting basketball hoops and getting pop from a soda machine but 
instead of depicting each activity in a wide long shot isaiah does 
closeups of hands hands with balls hands with video games a hand 
on a pop machine 
one of the other works in the show has the words art is 
free written on it quinlan said it just makes you feel real 
good it almost makes you want to weep she said 
one mile to the south of the gallery cabrinigreen is a zone of 
78 battered apartment buildings operated by the chicago housing 
authority home to about 13800 people about threefourths of them 
are children 
seventyfive percent of cha residents are unemployed and 85 
percent of families are headed by single women cha spokeswoman 
lucille wallace said 
to children from cabrinigreen the quinlan gallery neighborhood 
is another world said geraldine mansueto who tutors isaiah 
these kids dont get a lot of recognition she said for 
them to be in a gallery on halsted street in lincoln park thats 
something thats out of their ken 
even with tighter security measures in some buildings violent 
crimes including murder rape and arson are being reported at a 
rate of more than one a day at cabrini 1989 cha statistics show 
isaiahs mother 33yearold clara brooms described entering 
her sons bedroom after a night of gunfire about three years ago 
and discovering a bullet hole in the wall above his pillow 
when i woke up i said god all this shooting i said let 
me go in my baby could be dead i got in there and the first 
thing i saw was the hole right over his head 
then i went to the window and said oh my god 
the security measures have helped improve the picture somewhat 
since then she and isaiah said 
derek ellis another exhibit participant from cabrinigreen 
draws in pencil producing likenesses of figures in magazines and 
pictures derek 14 shares a bedroom with his 12yearold sister 
and 8yearold twin brothers the boys sleep in one bed their 
sister in another 
derek says he thinks about becoming an artist or a pro 
basketball player some day isaiah says he wants to be either a

nasa opened discoverys payload bay 
doors saturday to remove the hubble space telescopes batteries for 
recharging and to replace a faulty part in preparation for an april 
25 launch 
technicians took out a faulty auxiliary power unit responsible 
for grounding the shuttle last week a new unit was being installed 
to be tested sunday and fired up briefly later this week 
we havent run into any problem said lisa malone a 
spokeswoman for the national aeronautics and space administration 
were looking good for the 25th 
hubbles six nickelhydrogen batteries will be recharged for 5 
days in a laboratory at the vehicle assembly building nasa decided 
to take the batteries there because they can be recharged at a 
cooler temperature and thus retain more power 
we will have a higher capacity in them than we would have had 
we been recharging at the pad said fred wojtalik a nasa project 
manager this will make the opportunities for additional launch 
days a lot easier for us 
the batteries will power hubble from the time it is disconnected 
from the shuttles power system during deployment until its 
energycollecting solar panels are unfurled 
discovery was poised for launch tuesday but the mission was 
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff when the auxiliary power unit 
failed 
nasa was not sure how long it would take to replace the 88pound 
unit because the procedure had never been performed before at the 
launch pad the work went smoothly malone said 
the defective power unit was returned to the manufacturer 
sunstrand corp of rockford ill for testing 
the shuttles three auxiliary power units pressurize the 
hydraulic system which is used to move wing and rudder surfaces 
and in the ships braking and steering systems 
nasa planned to close discoverys payload bay doors sunday as 
soon as the lengthy process of removing the batteries was 
completed the chamber will remain sealed to reduce the risk of 
getting too much dust on the telescopes 94inch mirror the finest 
ever made until the batteries are returned next weekend 
the 15 billion telescope is nasas most expensive and complex 
payload once it is in orbit above earths distorting atmosphere 
it will be able to detect objects 50 times fainter and with 10 
times greater clarity than the best observatory on the ground 
astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant that 
their light has been traveling toward earth for 14 billion years 
close to the beginning of the universe

the first swarm of africanized honey bees 
will buzz north across the rio grande any day now but scientists 
say the worst sting of the killer bees may be economic 
researchers predict the bees probably will enter the united 
states near the border city of brownsville in november they were 
spotted 150 miles south of the border at soto la marina mexico 
near the gulf coast 
none has been found near the border since but their advance 
accelerates with as spring flowers provide food said anita 
collins head researcher at the us department of agricultures 
honey bee research lab at weslaco 
these bees descended from a tough african strain have been 
spreading across south and central america and mexico since they 
escaped from a nowinfamous brazilian research program in 1957 
along the way theyve killed an estimated 600 people mostly in 
tropical south america to earn their ominous nickname 
an africanized bees sting is no worse than a european bees 
but they were tagged killers because they tend to protect their 
colonies at the slightest disturbance sending hundreds or 
thousands of defenders against intruders 
africanized bees abscond from hives to form new colonies more 
regularly than the european honey bees commonly used in the 
americas for pollinating crops and producing honey 
the difficulty of managing africanized bees eventually will cost 
us beekeepers 29 million to 58 million a year the usda 
estimates 
africanized bees also are expected to reduce beepollinated crop 
production by 5 percent to 10 percent costing farmers more than 
40 million a year bee pollination adds nearly 800 million in 
value it is estimated to us crops each year 
us residents along the border arent likely to notice much 
change beyond seeing more wild colonies and swarms of bees looking 
for nest sites said ms collins who has studied the africanized 
bees for 14 years 
theyll see bees much more frequently than theyre used 
to she said some danger remains she said noting that in 
venezuela a swarm chased her and other scientists to a truck about 
100 yards away 
researchers are monitoring 318 bee traps in southern texas as 
far west as del rio and as far north as the aransas national 
wildlife refuge north of corpus christi to track the bees 
movement there are 60000 traps in mexico 
scientists will keep an eye on southern texas and northern 
mexico and destroy as many africanized swarms as possible to slow 
their progress and buy time for research ms collins said 
were not going to try and sit on the border and destroy every 
swarm that comes across she said this is an attempt to reduce 
these first pioneer swarms but at some point were going to be 
overwhelmed 
no one knows how far north the bees will spread before the cold 
stops their expansion in the southern hemisphere they have not 
moved south of 32 degrees latitude which north of the equator 
would mean central texas the bees travel 250 to 350 miles a year 
ms collins said 
the first confirmed trapping in texas will trigger an emergency 
plan although the interagency texas honey bee management plan is 
still being designed and has yet to get state funds 
the first step in the plan is a quarantine keeping anyone from 
moving bees out of the states eight southernmost counties said 
john fick one of the states two apiary inspectors with the texas 
agricultural experiment station 
beekeepers will be called on to ensure their queens remain 
european since researchers believe european bees moderate the 
africanized bees behavior through interbreeding 
scientists and beekeepers shun the killer bee appellation 
and the texas beekeepers association has launched a public 
relations campaign to tell people the africanized bee wont be out 
searching for victims 
fifteen to 20 people already die in the united states each year 
from allergic reactions to bee stings the association points out 
marilee mace who runs a crop pollination business with her 
husband glenn president of the beekeepers association believes 
beekeepers will remain the strongest line of defense 
its very important that we keep a healthy beekeeping 
industry because if we lose those bees then we have to live with 
whatever has moved into that void she said and we dont want 
to do that

president bush sought more detailed 
information saturday on moscows threat of economic retaliation 
against lithuania while senate democrats condemned soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev for taking precisely the wrong 
approach to the latest crisis 
during a rainsoaked game of golf bush told reporters he wanted 
to withhold further comment on the situation until he received a 
clarification on gorbachevs ultimatum to the 
independenceseeking baltic republic 
secretary of state james a baker iii meanwhile said the 
administration was taking a wait and see attitude 
its not entirely easy to know what the next moves are going 
to be baker said in an interview on cable news network 
imposition of sanctions he added would have an adverse impact 
on ussoviet relations 
baker would not speculate on what form a us response to 
sanctions would take 
bush and british prime minister margaret thatcher said friday 
they were deeply disturbed by gorbachevs threat to cut off 
supplies to lithuania if it did not rescind laws passed since it 
asserted independence on march 11 
a senior administration official said that the soviet ultimatum 
caught us strategists off guard and that gorbachevs move was 
undergoing close analysis and scrutiny in the united states 
the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that 
there would probably be a further us response to the action 
before the end of the weekend 
the official said however the range of options was very 
limited adding to the frustration felt by the administration as 
the war of nerves between the baltic state and the kremlin 
continues to intensify 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and six 
democratic colleagues just returned to washington from a visit 
with gorbachev in moscow condemned the economic ultimatum as 
precisely the wrong approach in such a delicate and dangerous 
situation 
at a news conference at andrews air force base md mitchell 
noted that on thursday gorbachev had expressed to the senate 
delegation his intention to resolve the situation in lithuania by 
peaceful nonviolent means 
mitchell and sens bill bradley of new jersey john glenn of 
ohio wyche fowler of georgia jim sasser of tennessee paul 
sarbanes of maryland and tom daschle of south dakota all expressed 
dismay that gorbachev had leveled the economic threat just a day 
later 
an act need not involve direct violence to be wrong said 
mitchell the action taken yesterday was wrong we condemn it 
mitchell said he and the other senators likely would meet with 
bush early in the week to report on their trip which included 
visits to berlin and leningrad as well as the twohour session with 
gorbachev 
daschle said gorbachev had told the group that he felt like he 
had led three lives since 1975 and that this year was the most 
difficult of all and he quoted gorbachev as saying that 
lithuanias political uprising was a gift to my hardliners 
the domestic soviet upheaval was casting a pall over bushs may 
30june 3 superpower session with gorbachev where both leaders 
have suggested they hope to be able to initial a new agreement to 
limit longrange nuclear weapons 
a persistent winddriven rain did little to discourage the 
president from playing 18 holes of golf on this british island 
colony before heading back to the united states he returned to 
andrews air force base md near washington late saturday 
afternoon and boarded a helicopter for the presidential retreat at 
camp david md where he was to spend the rest of the weekend 
reflecting on fridays meetings with british prime minister 
margaret thatcher bush said its very important that we stay on 
the same wave length 
he said his administration and thatchers government feel very 
comfortable about our positions on eastwest issues 
despite slight nuances on a few things differences the two 
allies are very close together bush said 
mrs thatchers husband denis joined bush for the soggy golf 
outing also in the presidential party were secretary of state 
james a baker iii chief of staff john sununu national security 
adviser brent scowcroft and white house physician burton lee 
asked about the latest gorbachev threat bush said i havent 
heard anything about anything yet i havent seen the intelligence 
report yet i will when i get in 
he said that after his joint news confernce with thatcher on 
friday afternoon i wanted a clarification from moscow on 
gorbachevs warning to lithuania but bush said it was midnight 
over there 
bush was to complete a trio of presuperpowersummit meetings 
with allied leaders next thursday when he meets with french 
president francois mitterrand in key largo florida 
he conferred with canadian prime minister brian mulroney last

church leaders on saturday criticized 
plans for a oneparty state and said steps to create it will 
infringe on fundamental human rights in one of africas few 
westernstyle democracies 
the roman catholic commission for justice and peace urged 
president robert mugabes governing party to abandon its commitment 
to oneparty rule 
the statement comes four days before safeguards for political 
opposition guaranteed for 10 years in the 1980 britishbrokered 
constitution expire 
we believe that a constitutionalized oneparty state is 
contrary to basic human rights the 35member commission said at 
the end of a twoday meeting 
a oneparty system of government as envisaged by mugabes 
governing zimbabwe african national union patriotic front ends 
up benefiting chiefly the people already entrenched in powerful 
positions the church commission said 
no generation has the right to make immutable decisions for 
future generations it said 
in one of its strongest attacks on mugabes policies the 
commission said the freedom to vote for a political party of choice 
was a fundamental right along with the freedoms of association 
assembly and speech enshrined in constitutional law 
it urged the governing party to rule with a mandate based on 
freedom of choice and its own efficiency and credibility of 
performance 
after the governing party won 116 of 119 seats contested by five 
parties in parliamentary elections last month mugabe said the 
victory at the polls gave him the backing he needed to establish a 
oneparty system along marxist lines 
he has repeatedly argued that a plural system creates division 
that hinders development 
since zimbabwes independence in 1980 the governing party has 
abided by the britishmediated constitution containing safeguards 
for political opposition 
those safeguards expire when zimbabwe celebrates its 10th 
anniversary of independence from white minority rule on wednesday 
but mugabe has said he will not immediately outlaw opposition 
parties

some of the writing that emanated from last 
springs pro democracy demonstrations in beijings tiananmen 
square has been saved for historians in the new york public library 
about 700 items declarations poetry newsletters and the like 
were gathered in china by robin munro a researcher for the human 
rights group asia watch the material has been donated to archives 
about the prodemocracy movement around the world including one at 
the library in manhattan 
munro said he started collecting as soon as he arrived in 
beijing in may on the second day of the students hunger strike he 
left two weeks after the army moved in and suppressed the 
demonstrations on june 34 when hundreds perhaps thousands of 
people were killed 
munros collection is the heart of primary source material in 
the new york archive which is made up of several thousand items 
stored in a small metal filing cabinet and on a few bookshelves 
the archive is not imposing but large enough to give scholars 
material for analyzing the movement from many angles 
politically we want to be impartial so not only do we get 
lots of antigovernment material but we also give the chinese 
government a chance to have their material included said 
librarian john t ma in charge of chinese materials in the 
librarys oriental division 
the chinese consul general in new york responded to a request 
from ma by donating books and cassette tapes about what the 
government called counterrevolutionary turmoil last spring 
ma said the library also obtained correspondence and other 
papers from the us office of the front for a democratic china an 
umbrella organization that includes movement leaders in exile that 
material includes personal papers of student leader wuer kaixi and 
the offices director jin yanshi ma said 
the archive also includes local material about the movement from 
new yorks large chinese community said lucy kung of the librarys 
economic and public affairs division ms kung like ma is 
volunteering time to solicit and organize the materials since the 
library has no money budgeted for the archive ma said 
john m lundquist chief librarian of the oriental division 
said material continues to arrive partly thanks to ma and ms 
kungs extensive contacts 
ma said many people with materials about the movement have been 
eager to donate them because of their historical value 
chinese usually are very mindful of historical mission he 
said chinese follow history as a guidepost not the bible 
american universities with major chinese studies divisions also 
are developing collections about the democracy movement lundquist 
said the new york library is working on its archive in cooperation 
with such schools as harvard yale and columbia 
munro said he also gave copies of his collection to archives at 
harvard and the british library as well as others in hong kong 
chicago and liden the netherlands 
the new york collection also includes a tape of music composed 
by taiwanese musicians that was played during tiananmen square 
demonstrations a videotape of a news conference by chinese 
officials and video footage of televised news reports from around 
the world showing how the story was reported

adolph archie died messily after 13 hours 
in the custody of police who arrested him for the fatal shooting of 
a police officer 
he had a cracked skull a crushed larynx a shattered face and 
too many bloody bruises to count according to the autopsy his 
family commissioned 
there is no question this man was beaten to death the 
familys attorney mary howell said last week at a news 
conference if i may be more specific he was stomped to death 
the allegations have led to investigations by police orleans 
parish district attorney harry connick and us attorney john volz 
civil rights leaders meanwhile accuse orleans parish coroner 
frank minyard of releasing an incomplete autopsy report and of 
trying to cover up a homicide to protect the police they demand 
that he resign 
no one disputes that archie a black man was a career criminal 
or that he killed police officer earl hauck a white man 
he should have been arrested tried and executed for killing 
that policeman said the rev marie galatas head of the citys 
grass roots organization for women but he should have gone 
through a court system 
grow and southern christian leadership conference officials say 
police officers have told them confidentially that four officers 
three white and one black were involved in beating archie 
the civil rights groups have declined to release details on 
those allegations saying the officers fear for their jobs and 
wont go public 
archie 40 had nine criminal convictions behind him when he ran 
away from a parish prison work detail on march 8 
on march 22 police said a security guard surprised him while 
he was breaking into a parked car at the louisiana superdome 
archie punched the guard stole her gun and ran 
hauck directing traffic downtown joined the chase and was 
fatally shot after cornering archie near an office building loading 
dock archie hid under a parked car police pulled him out 
then the story becomes cloudy 
archie shot in the forearm and slightly injured during the 
chase apparently also suffered some injuries while being pulled 
from under the car but the extent of his injuries isnt clear 
he was taken to charity hospital but wasnt admitted 
hauck too was taken to charity where he was pronounced dead 
police chief warren woodfork said police decided to take archie 
from charity to the 1st district police station where hauck had 
worked because haucks fellow officers were at charity and archie 
might be in danger there 
at the police station police said archie tried to grab a gun 
and was knocked backward hitting his head on the floor there were 
no reports that might account for the numerous other injuries 
archie suffered 
archie was held for about 45 minutes before police decided to 
take him back to charity where he was admitted 
the next morning archie was lying on a table awaiting a cat 
scan when he became agitated ripped a tracheal tube from his 
throat and died before the tube could be reinserted according to 
hospital reports and minyard the coroner 
the direct cause of death said minyard was the removal of the 
tracheal tube im saying that the man received a trauma in 
police custody but that did not cause his death the coroner 
said 
thats not entirely true says a report by dr kris sperry a 
fulton county ga forensic pathologist hired by the family 
attorney to do an independent autopsy 
archie needed the tracheal tube because of severe injuries 
inflicted in a fight with one or more people sperry said in his 
report which concludes that the manner of death is homicide 
minyards staff autopsy lists many of the injuries sperry found 
but makes no specific references to injuries of archies chest 
abdomen and testicles sperry said 
and while minyard reported a single fracture to the skull 
sperrys report lists two fractures beginning on opposite sides of 
archies head and extending to the back of the skull 
woodfork said last month that he saw no evidence of wrongdoing 
but police have had no comment since then saying their 
investigation is under way since sperrys report came out last 
week minyard has declined comment on the case 
at an april 4 news conference minyard said his staffs autopsy 
was as thorough as it could be given the limited time available 
about two hours in an office that deals with at least one murder 
almost every day 
minyard wouldnt speculate on when archie suffered the fractured 
skull or broken facial bones listed in his and other autopsies 
the coroner said he believes police accounts of archies 
handling he also admitted to a bias in favor of the police 
i mean we had two murders this morning he said every 
day i work with homicide and if i dont believe them i mean the 
whole system breaks down i have to believe what they tell me

polish president wojciech jaruzelski went to the 
katyn forest on saturday and paid tribute to the thousands of 
polish army officers killed and buried there by the soviet unions 
secret police during world war ii 
his visit came one day after the soviet government reversed 
nearly 50 years of official denial and admitted committing the 
massacre the soviet union had long blamed nazi germany 
the truth was said about katyn and the truth is healing the 
wounds jaruzelski said in russian his voice soft and wavering 
with emotion 
now it will be easier for us to understand each other he 
told soviet reporters the katyn massacre has long been a strain on 
relations between the soviet union and poland 
jaruzelski was accompanied by an honor guard of the polish army 
at the memorial site in the forest near the western town of 
smolensk as he honored the more than 4000 officers killed in 1940 
by stalins secret police the polish pap news agency reported 
a roll call of the dead was intoned a ceremony in which 
the names of victims are read pap said 
in footage broadcast on soviet tvs evening newscast vremya 
jaruzelski wearing a green army overcoat green scarf and military 
cap stood ramrod straight as two soldiers carried a large wreath 
of red and white carnations and laid it in front of a memorial to 
the dead 
the monument reads in russian to the polish officers fallen 
in katyn 
polish radio reported saturday night that the wording on the 
monument was changed three days ago removing the words that blamed 
nazi germany the soviets had long said the nazis were responsible 
for the massacre in which the polish officers were shot in the 
back of the head and stacked on top of each other in mass graves 
the honor guard fired a rifle salute polish radio said 
pap added that jaruzelski wrote in the visitors book 
they fought for an independent poland they died innocently 
farremoved from their families and homeland they were faithful to 
poland and to military honor until they breathed their last in 
tribute and in lasting memory to polish officers victims of the 
cruel stalinist crime 
jaruzelski also went to the town of lenino in the nearby 
republic of byelorussia and laid wreaths on the graves of soviet 
and polish soldiers at a memorial there the soviet news agency 
tass reported 
the soviet union on friday admitted that the nkvd stalins 
feared secret police was responsible for the murders 49 years ago 
of the polish officers who had been captured at the start of world 
war ii 
the soviet statement friday said archive material discovered 
recently showed that the murders were the work of stalins secret 
police chief lavrenti beria his protege vn merkulov and others 
the soviet side expressing its deep regret in connection with 
the katyn tragedy states that it is one of the most horrifying 
stalinist crimes said the statement carried by tass 
more than 10000 other polish officers were killed in camps 
elsewhere their bodies never have been found but in its 
statement the soviet union clearly tied together the fates of all 
15000 officers 
jaruzelskis trip to katyn capped an official visit to the 
soviet union he returned to warsaw later saturday 
at a dinner friday night soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
called the katyn tragedy one of the historical knots that cast 
a shadow on polishsoviet relations but he added that many of 
them have already been undone 
in remarks carried by tass gorbachev said genuine renewal and 
genuine mutual understanding lies only through telling the truth 
jaruzelski told the soviet leader that the soviet admission on 
katyn was particularly important and valuable to the polish 
people from the moral point of view and he said poles would not 
blame the massacre on the soviet people who themselves suffered 
under stalin

with public sentiment now behind an art 
gallery exhibiting controversial photographs city and county 
prosecutors are arguing over who should handle obscenity charges 
against its director 
and city council members are suggesting the widely publicized 
case involving a collection of photographs by the late robert 
mapplethorpe is a losing cause 
sentiment against a city prosecution appeared to grow following 
the release of a poll friday indicating strong public support for 
the gallery fiftynine percent of those who responded to a poll 
conducted for the cincinnati post said they believe the photographs 
should be displayed 
councilman david mann said the poll confirms my belief that a 
conviction is virtually impossible 
the citys solicitor and hamilton county prosecutor arthur ney 
plan to meet again monday to resolve the dispute over prosecution 
of the contemporary arts center and director dennis barrie who is 
to be arraigned monday 
a county grand jury indicted the gallery and barrie last 
saturday on two misdemeanor counts each of pandering obscenity and 
use of a minor in nudityoriented matter for seven photos in the 
175picture exhibit two of the photos show nude children and five 
depict homosexual acts 
prosecutors will have to convince a jury that the photos violate 
community standards in order to get an obscenity conviction 
several council members have called for the city to consider 
dropping the charges if it ends up with the case 
we cant dictate to the city solicitor whether or not to 
proceed with the case but we can certainly make our views known 
said another councilman peter strauss i personally think they 
are going to have a hard time making a case that the show in its 
entirety lacks artistic value 
ney turned the prosecution over to the city thursday citing 
state law that requires cities to prosecute misdemeanors committed 
within their boundaries however the law permits a city and a 
county prosecutor to enter into an agreement to have the county 
prosecute the citys misdemeanor offenses 
ney and city solicitor richard castellini met friday but failed 
to reach agreement on which will handle the mapplethorpe case they 
plan to meet again monday morning when barrie is arraigned in 
hamilton county municipal court barrie has said he will plead 
innocent 
mayor charles luken said he thinks ney gave the case to the city 
because he doubted he could win 
i think this is a politically hot potato and the reason mr 
ney is doing this is that he doesnt feel he can win luken said 
the county prosecutors office rejected the suggestion saying 
ney handed the case off solely because he felt he was required to 
do so under state law

jewish nationalists into the building complex in the christian 
section of the walled old city municipal spokeswoman bonnie boxer 
said she quoted him as characterizing the settlers as extremists 
who concentrate only on themselves and their religious fervor 
once again jerusalem will be portrayed as a violent city and 
this will harm tourism scare away potential investors and dissuade 
soviet immigrants from choosing jerusalem as their home she also 
quoted him as saying 
on saturday about 50 christian and moslem palestinians 
demonstrated outside the 72room complex settled by the jews 
on thursday israeli police fired tear gas to disperse christian 
clergymen and stonethrowing palestinians protesting the 
settlement while foreign tourists visiting for easter week tried 
to steer clear of the violence 
in amman jordan king hussein on saturday said in a written 
statement to the associated press that the israeli police action 
against the greek orthodox patriarch and other protesting clerics 
in jerusalem was a vicious and inhuman crime the patriarch 
diodoros was overcome by tear gas during the protest

liberation organization 
jerusalems old city is divided into jealously guarded ethnic 
quarters that are home to 50000 moslems about 7000 christians

christian but the greek orthodox church said the complex was sold 
illegally

collaborating with israeli authorities died overnight of beating 
injuries suffered earlier in the week hospital officials said 
his death brought to 207 the number of palestinians killed by

traffic at border crossings returned to 
normal saturday after a moderately strong earthquake shifted the 
walls of a canada customs office shutting it down temporarily 
authorities said 
us customs inspector john nolte said the crossing between 
blaine and douglas british columbia was closed to northbound 
trucks after the quake which registered 51 on the richter scale 
at 1033 pm pdt friday 
the quake was followed by about a dozen aftershocks the 
strongest registering 41 on the richter scale said scientists at 
the university of washington geophysics center 
unloaded trucks were diverted to the peace arch crossing and 
loaded trucks to the crossing between sumas and huntington british 
columbia about 20 miles to the east 
a few trucks were allowed to pass after about 9 am and 
traffic was back to normal by noon without major delays or backups 
nolte said 
geophysicist steve malone said the quake occurred about three 
miles underground and three miles northeast of deming a town about 
10 miles east of bellingham 
walls at the canada customs office in surrey south of 
vancouver were moved about a quarter of an inch said 
superintendent glenn bonnett 
the building was closed overnight but was reopened after a 
structural inspection and operations appeared to be normal by 
midday said us customs agent randy reed 
earthquake monitors at the university said there were reports of 
minor damage in three washington counties including broken glass 
and items jolted from shelves a canopy at the blaine 
bordercrossing also was cracked they said 
county officials said callers who said they felt the quake 
reported no damage was reported other than pictures falling off a 
wall 
linda twitchell a bellingham herald copy editor said she was 
in her recreation room when the quake hit and wondered briefly 
whether it would ruin the new addition to her home 
it actually looked like the walls were moving in different 
directions she said 
i couldnt believe it said wally beketa of nearby custer 
the bed shook the mirrors danced on the walls 
there were no reports of damage in british columbia 
the richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake measuring 4 is capable of causing moderate damage 
5 considerable damage and 6 can be severe

the us international trade commission says 
american business still worries that greater unity among western 
europeans will lead to a fortress europe designed to protect 
their businesses against american goods and services 
it lists a long series of measures being taken by the 12 
governments in the european economic community to bring freer trade 
with one another by 1992 the us interests that could be hurt 
range from the sale of insurance to the showing of american 
television shows 
in a thick report on developments in the community also known 
as the common market the commission recently made a point of 
american objections to european proposals for reciprocity the idea 
that european firms should get the same treatment in america that 
american firms get in europe 
american firms prefer a different interpretation that they get 
the same treatment in europe as european firms give themselves 
of a proposal about mergers in the european insurance business 
offered by france the report said another reciprocity clause 
albeit seemingly innocuous will not assist in putting to rest the 
idea of fortress europe 
president bushs administration has been asking for more 
influence on the europeans decisions as a result leaders from 
the european commission will come here april 23 headed by its 
chairman jacques delors it will be the first of a regular series 
of such meetings to take place twice a year 
they will talk with secretary of state james m baker iii and 
other us cabinet members delors also will meet with bush 
the europeans are expected to spend much of their visit as 
other visitors have done arguing that removal of barriers to trade 
among themselves poses no danger to american interests the 
american commission an independent body appointed by successive 
presidents is less sure 
since the united states is outside the ec european 
community measures that reduce internal barriers but leave 
external barriers unchanged cause trade diversion that is 
increased trade among ec member states at the expense of trade 
between the united states and the ec it said 
its study is called the effects of greater economic 
integration within the european community on the united states 
first followup report dated for march it was distributed to 
reporters this week 
on the television issue american pressure helped soften a 
european proposal to require that 60 percent of all broadcasts in 
the 12 countries originate in one of them a european directive 
adopted last october asked some preferential treatment for programs 
originating in europe but it set no binding limits leaving each 
of the member governments to set them if they choose 
the us government and the us industry have continued to 
object to the local content provisions of the directive both on the 
grounds that they are protectionist and that they interfere with 
freedom of expression the us commission said 
it also saw possible benefits to us business from greater 
unity in western europe american industry that competes with 
european exports will benefit as european products go more to 
european countries rather than overseas it said and added that 
any measures to reduce european barriers against imports will lower 
the price of american goods to european buyers

that strikers were responsible for the latest violence and said he 
had doubts about the texas report 
the word i got was it was just a little indentation on the 
side of the san antoniobound bus said atu representative donald 
hardin i have very serious doubts about that one if it was a 
bullet it wasnt from any of our guys we have been very peaceful 
here 
the texas bus had no passengers aboard at the time of the 
shooting said fry the bullet struck the bus about 5 feet 10 
inches off the ground near an american flag painted on its right 
side 
the bus which continued on to san antonio after the driver 
discovered the damage was met by police and us bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms agents 
the investigators determined it was a small to midcaliber 
bullet fired from a handgun fired from behind the bus and it 
ricocheted off the bus never penetrating the skin fry said 
the second shooting occurred on a nashvillebound bus with six 
passengers aboard said fry its driver was at an undetermined 
location on interstate 65 when gunfire hit the eastbound bus about

the steel tube sections seized en route to iraq 
and suspected by customs officials to be parts of a huge gun could 
be connected with a space satellite launch system government 
sources were quoted as saying saturday 
press association the british domestic news agency quoted 
unidentified reliable government sources as saying they had 
correspondence linking british industry with the brussels company 
space research projects described as dealing in international arms 
sales 
the correspondence refers to orders for the manufacture of 
smoothbore pipes that experts believe match the specification 
detailed in the belgian companys design for a space satellite 
launch system the sources were quoted as saying 
it was not clear from the report whether the link consisted of 
more than a match in specifications the report did not name the 
british manufacturer allegedly involved 
in december iraq surprised other nations by launching a rocket 
it said could be used to put a satellite into space 
press association said the british sources made known the 
correspondence to explain the interest of the customs and excise 
department in the steel tubes being held for investigation at 
middlesbrough on the northeast coast of england 
engineering experts stressed that the orders could be placed in 
such a way that the manufacturers would believe they were providing 
pipe work for the petroleum industry 
press association did not name the government department of the 
sources but the sunday telegraph the sunday times and the 
observer all carried articles quoting customs sources on the same 
subject 
the consignment being held at middlesbrough was to have been 
loaded on a ship bound for iraq when customs officers seized it 
tuesday 
in the days since iraq has claimed the metal tubes were pipes 
for a petrochemical plant the british manufacturer sheffield 
forgemasters said their work was not intended for armaments and 
was known to the government 
customs however said the eight pieces of steel tube could 
unquestionably be used as a huge gun barrel 
arms experts have given conflicting opinions about whether the 
steel sections could be used as a weapon 
the belgian company mentioned in the press association report 
space research was owned by dr gerald bull an american 
ballistics expert 
bull 62 a canadianborn american citizen was slain march 22 
belgian police said he was shot twice in the head they said the 
gunman used a silencer and the motive was not robbery because 
20000 was found in the victims pockets 
janes defense weekly said bull had been a principal designer of 
south africas g5 howitzers which have been sold to iraq 
britain banned all arms sales to iraq and its enemy iran 
following the outbreak of the 8yearold persian gulf war there 
has been a ceasefire since august 1988 but iran and iraq are 
still not officially at peace and the british embargo remains

worries about californias fourth 
straight year of drought seem far away on the lush oasislike 
fairways of the coachella valley billed as the golf capital of the 
world 
because palm springs has its own underground supply water is 
plentiful in this desert resort which boasts 80 golf courses each 
soaking up roughly a million gallons of water a day perhaps 
nowhere else in california is the metaphor cadillac desert more 
apt than here where plush turf spreads like rich green velvet 
across desert sands 
in contrast even a modest front lawn will go thirsty by law 
this year in the coastal resort of santa barbara which is forced 
to rely on local runoff in the fertile central valley water 
supplies to farmers are being reduced by 50 percent los angeles 
residents face a 10 percent cut in their water consumption and in 
san francisco officials are considering rationing water 
such are the incongruities of the states worst drought in more 
than a decade as the prolonged dry spell separates the water haves 
from the have nots 
the area also faces its worst fire threat since there was a 
sevenyear drought in the late 1940s according to the los angeles 
fire department residents of the citys hills and canyons 
fireprone even in the best of years have until may 1 to clear 
brush from around their homes or the city will do it for them and 
send them the bill 
until this year los angeles and its environs have had 
sufficient water delivered hundreds of miles by aqueducts but 
their allotment has been cut and water agency officials say that 
even when the rains come supplies may never return to normal 
even without a drought studies have shown the regions 
everincreasing water demand will outstrip supplies by the year 
2000 
were looking at real honesttogod bona fide shortages 
said timothy quinn director of conservation at the powerful 
metropolitan water district of southern california which serves a 
sixcounty region with 145 million people the district is holding 
two days of hearings on the shortage beginning monday 
for the first time since californias postworld war ii growth 
boom the district has been unable to take all the water it wants 
from the colorado river 
the agencys usual allotment of 12 million acrefeet was 
trimmed by the federal government this year by 300000 acrefeet 
and as neighboring arizona draws more of its share the mwds 
allotment could be cut by almost 700000 acrefeet 
each acrefoot enough water to cover an acre of land one foot 
deep or about 326000 gallons supplies two average families for a 
year 
many communities throughout southern california are enacting 
conservation measures 
santa monica for example is requiring that ultralow flow 
toilets which flush just 1 gallons be installed in all new 
construction and remodeling projects 
los angeles years ago enacted a fivephase drought ordinance 
whose first phase can be activated any year by the mayor phase 1 
which bans routine serving of water in restaurants and hosing of 
driveways already is in effect although such measures are not 
widely observed or enforced 
mayor tom bradley urged residents last month to cut back water 
use by 10 percent and officials warned that more stringent 
measures will be needed if voluntary conservation doesnt work 
los angeles usually gets about 15 percent of its supply from the 
mwd but this year the city has asked the agency to meet about 60 
percent of its 700000 acrefeet demand because of cutbacks in its 
own supplies 
whatever can go wrong has gone wrong quinn said 
santa barbara faces the droughts worst impact along with 
other communities on californias central coast said bob fingado 
of the state department of water resources 
the region which encompasses nearly 1 million people from 
ventura to santa cruz doesnt have links to state and federal 
aqueducts 
they live on what they get locally fingado said of the 
central coast 
in santa barbara for example local runoff has been 20 percent 
of normal for each of the past three years fingado said this 
year it has been just 10 percent of normal 
city officials are attempting to cut water use by 45 percent in 
the city of 82000 said pete ramsdell a city spokesman 
santa barbara officials announced recently they are considering 
a number of options to increase water supplies ranging from a 
seawater desalination plant to the importing of fresh water from 
canada on barges 
some of the alternatives could cost nearly 100 times more than 
current rates water officials said 
in san francisco the city water departments acting manager 
john mullane said friday that officials are looking at 
rationing for the departments 22 million customers he 
projected a possible 25 percent cutback the same amount that was 
cut the last time there was rationing in 198889 
even in palm springs there is concern the valley sits atop a 
geological bathtub that holds an estimated 39 million acrefeet of 
water more than 10 times the states biggest reservoir 
according to officials at the coachella valley water district 
were simply not recharging this basin to the extent were 
using it said allan muth of the university of californias 
desert research center in deep canyon no matter what they say 
eventually were going to run out of water

beachcleaning teams at prince william 
sound have found 40 dead otters in the past five weeks stirring 
renewed debate between government agencies and exxon corp over the 
effect of last years oil spill 
it remains unclear however what killed the otters that 
problem and the carcasses have been handed over to the us fish 
and wildlife service which has legal responsibility for marine 
mammal management 
fish and wildlife authorities told the anchorage daily news 
recently that otter body parts are being tested to see if chronic 
exposure to oil killed the animals during the months since cleanup 
and animalcollection work stopped work last september 
nancy lethcoe coordinator of the states winter cleanup effort 
at valdez said friday she thinks oil that was not cleaned up after 
the march 1989 exxon valdez tanker spill ended up killing more 
otters than would die ordinarily over a winter 
bob mostracchio chief of exxons spilldamage assessment team 
disagreed 
weve done a lot of winter beach monitoring weve seen no 
basis for concern about oil harming wildlife this winter he said 
exxon cleanup teams will not collect dead animals this year 
unless they obviously have been oiled mostracchio said 
the company presumes animals killed during the winter died of 
natural causes he said and their carcasses are part of the food 
chain and ought to be left where they lie 
lethcoe said the valdez teams found 28 otter carcasses during 
the past eight days they found 12 others in the preceding weeks 
those found on specially marked oilspill study beaches were left 
alone lethcoe said the 40 carcasses are more than she has seen in 
five winters 
so far there are no answers according to tony degange otter 
project director for fish and wildlife services oilspill damage 
office in anchorage 
but there may be some clues 
for instance degange said previous research in the sound has 
shown that most winterkill otters are either very young or very 
old 
the young are still learning how to survive and the old are 
in poor condition he said 
scientists can tell the age of the dead by inspecting their 
teeth so if more than a few middleaged otter carcasses are 
collected this spring it will indicate some unnatural cause such 
as eating oiled clams or mussels may be killing otters 
studies last summer found that spilled crude had poisoned 
otters which suffered liver and lung damage the wildlife agency 
is ordering autopsies for some of this springs carcasses it also 
is analyzing tissue samples from others to check for oil poisoning 
putting the information together could take months degange said 
one obstacle is the lack of benchmark data there has never been 
a comprehensive otter winterkill survey in the sound to compare 
with this years carcass count 
but biologists do have baseline information on some individual 
otters those rescued cleaned and released last summer lethcoes 
group found one of those tagged otters dead though the cause was 
not apparent it will be shipped to anchorage with the rest

nine colombians arrested on a ship carrying a 
record six tons of cocaine have been convicted of possessing the 
drug with intent to distribute it 
the ships master seven crewmen and the 26yearold cook who 
is 8 months pregnant could be sentenced to life in prison they 
were convicted thursday by a federal court jury 
all nine were arrested oct 2 by the coast guard which said the 
12000 pounds of cocaine was a record confiscation from a ship 
boarded at sea 
jurors in us district judge charles schwartzs court returned 
the verdict after a sevenday trial 
the defendants said they did not know there was cocaine in the 
locked containers loaded onto the zedom sea before it left 
barranquilla colombia on sept 23 
prosecutors said it is doubtful the owner of 600 million worth 
of cocaine would have entrusted it to a crew he did not know they 
said the cocaine was to have been transferred to another ship 
before the zedom sea reached mexico 
the colombianowned ship was flying the panamanian flag when it 
was seized in the gulf of mexico several miles off the mexican 
coast 
before the trial schwartz rejected defense claims that us 
officials did not have the required permission of panamanian 
authorities to board the zedom sea confiscate the cocaine and 
arrest the crew 
prosecutors said former panamanian president eric delvalle gave 
blanket authorization before his term expired sept 1 for us 
ships to search suspicious panamanian vessels 
no sentencing date has been set for the ships master arsenio 
marin pineda of calarcaquindi the crewmen and cook leovigilda 
calderon of giron santador 
roma kent calderons attorney said her clients baby probably 
will be turned over to state welfare authorities to be put in a 
foster home because the father a smalltown butcher has no money 
to come get the child 
he and calderon also have a 7yearold son who lives with the 
butcher and his parents kent said

a sequel to edward r murrows famous harvest of 
shame documentary showing the deplorable conditions of migrant 
farm workers in 1960 found little has changed in 30 years 
three decades ago cbs cameras panned over a long line of tired 
hungry farm workers waiting for bags of food they had just lost 
their jobs to a killing freeze 
public broadcasting service shot the same scene this time 
outside the national guard armory in homestead fla following a 
deadly christmas freeze that dropped temperatures to 22 degrees in 
the everglades 
the only notable difference is that one scene was filmed in 
black and white and the other taped in color 
murrows report shocked the nation by showing that many 
americans ate because of people who earned miserable wages and had 
no sick pay vacations and unemployment benefits or disability pay 
on top of that the migrant workers for the most part lived in 
squalid housing 
tuesday night pbs will air new harvest old shame the 
story of pedro silvas family on the roads and in the fields of 
rural america as it moves from an indiana bunkhouse to a trailer at 
the everglades labor camp 
even nature is against them said the producer hector 
galan this year they faced heavy rains in indiana that cut crop 
yields in half hurricane hugo in south carolina which left them 
with no work and the freeze in florida 
galan located pedro silva and his wife reina in late november 
and followed him with an assistant and a photographer as the 
extended familys sixvehicle convoy headed south stopping at 
highway rest areas to eat wash and sleep 
what would have been a twoday trip turned into a sixday 
trip galan said pedros truck broke down twice finally he 
had to leave it behind because he couldnt afford to get it fixed 
reinas nephew became ill it was one hardship after another 
mrs silvas sister maria martinez said she wanted to be 
filmed to give farmers a hard look at the way their workers live 
if all the farm workers in this country stopped working the 
farmers would have to let their fruits and vegetables rot in the 
fields she said they have to realize that when we make money 
they make money when we eat they eat

five million american children under the age of 
6 almost one out of every four in the nation recently have been 
in families living below the poverty line according to a new 
national study 
this makes young children the poorest of any age group in 
american society with 23 percent more than double the percentage 
of adults living in poverty said the report by columbia 
universitys national center for children in poverty 
the report released for publication sunday used us census 
bureau figures and other criteria mainly from 1987 the most 
recent year for which comprehensive data was said to be available 
the center was set up last year at the school of public health 
the issue of child poverty in the united states has received 
growing attention in recent years but available data do not 
describe the depth and breadth of the problem the report said 
we need a firmer grasp of who these children are what kinds 
of risks they face and how adequately current policies and 
programs serve them it said 
the report said comprehensive approaches must be devised to 
assist poor young children and families over the early years of 
family formation 
it recommended universal health insurance coverage expanded 
health and child care unemployment insurance safe and 
affordable housing education and job preparation reforms and 
programs to prevent teenage pregnancy 
statistically the study found that while 42 percent of all us 
children living in poverty were white the percentage of poor among 
whites overall was 13 percent far below the rates among minorities 
48 percent for blacks 42 percent for hispanics and 29 percent 
for others 
the poverty line is a us government definition of a minimum 
standard based on pretax income and adjusted for family size and 
changes in the cost of living in 1989 it was 9890 for a family 
of three and 12675 for a fourmember family 
the report said that in 1987 325 million americans were living 
below the line of which 13 million were less than 18 years old and 
five million were under 6 another 27 million in the youngest 
category were in nearpoor families whose incomes ranged from 
the poverty level to 50 percent above it 
it said the latter were often indistinguishable from children 
living in poverty because their families had as much difficulty 
making ends meet or even more if they did not receive public 
assistance 
the report also cited what it said were myths about the poor 
and programs to aid them 
it said for example that 54 percent of the under6 poor lived 
outside urban areas 53 percent had at least one working parent 
and 28 percent were in families entirely dependent on public 
assistance 
neither benefits from aid to dependent children nor fulltime 
minimum wage income would alone put families over the poverty 
line it said typical aid to dependent children in 1988 was 
4320 a year less than half the poverty line and minimum wage 
jobs in 1987 paid 6968 about threefourths of the total for a 
family of three

mayor marion barry said saturday he has missed 
some of the counseling sessions and other meetings that were 
prescribed for him as part of his recovery from alcohol and 
substance abuse according to a published report 
barry in an interview in sunday editions of the washington 
post said that until last week he mistakenly believed he could 
substitute attendance at church services for the counseling 
sessions and alcoholics anonymous meetings 
the mayor added he would no longer do that 
since returning to the district of columbia last month after 
seven weeks of treatment in florida and south carolina for 
substance abuse barry has said he was actively moving toward 
recovery by attending counseling sessions three times a week and 
alcoholics anonymous meetings on other days 
however barry told the newspaper that he has missed a number of 
those sessions and meetings ive missed several days 
absolutely barry said adding later marion barry just screwed 
up a bit from time to time 
the paper said barrys erratic attendance at counseling sessions 
became evident during a post review of his activities in a recent 
sevenday period from april 5 to last thursday 
reporters checked barrys activities from the early morning when 
he left his house through a busy daily schedule of official 
business and other appointments to the evening hours which 
included several media interviews next step counseling meetings

a secret torture pit drug manufacturing 
equipment and poison were found in the homes of a man accused of 
the 1988 poisoning of his nextdoor neighbors leaving one dead and 
two paralyzed authorities said 
prosecutors presented the evidence during hearings friday in 
polk county circuit court where bail was denied for george james 
trepal he was arrested a week ago on murder attempted murder and 
producttampering charges 
circuit judge dennis p maloney denied the request for bail 
saying trepal had motive opportunity and the peculiar ability to 
commit this crime 
the prosecution believes the evidence will prove trepal 41 
spiked bottles of cocacola to kill peggy carr and poison her 
husband and five others 
but trepals attorney jonathan stidham said the evidence was 
circumstantial and failed to prove that trepal a member of the 
mensa highiq club was involved in illicit activities 
all theyre offering here is evidence that my client is a bit 
of a different person and that he lived next door stidham said 
that isnt enough to convict him and its certainly not enough to 
keep him in jail now 
polk county sheriffs deputies executing search warrants after a 
15month investigation said they found 
thallium nitrate the obscure chemical used in the carr 
poisoning in the garage of trepals home in alturas 
a homemade journal on poisoning in trepals home in sebring 
where he moved after mrs carrs death including literature about 
thallium nitrate and medical examination procedures 
laboratory equipment at the sebring home chemicals and a small 
amount of what authorities believe is the illegal drug crank 
a secret soundproof room and equipment for apparent use in 
torture and bondage in the basement of the sebring home 
investigator ernest mincey said he has detailed several 
confrontations between trepal and the carr family mincey said 
investigators believe trepal may have used the same poison to kill 
the carr family dogs several years ago 
peggy carr 41 became sick in october 1988 after drinking from 
16ounce soda bottles at her home she eventually was placed on 
lifesupport equipment and died march 3 1989 
her son duane dubberly 17 and stepson travis carr 18 were 
left paralyzed tests of mrs carrs husband parearlyn carr and 
three other people showed traces of the chemical but they were not 
hospitalized 
fbi analysis showed the bottles had been laced with thallium 
nitrate a colorless tasteless chemical that is highly toxic 
prosecutors said trepal is a chemist who had been sentenced to 
federal prison in the mid1970s for helping run a methamphetamine 
manufacturing operation in north carolina 
part of the production of methamphetamine mincey said requires 
an elaborate chemical process in which thallium nitrate is used 
mincey said investigators also determined no member of the carr 
family purchased the soft drink suggesting that someone familiar 
with the familys comings and goings entered the house and left the 
bottles when no one was home 
we have evidence that mr trepal often watched the carr 
residence through binoculars mincey said 
friends have said trepal and his wife orthopedic specialist 
diana carr no relation to the neighboring carr family would 
stage annual mystery murder weekends in which the fictional 
murders were poisoninduced

the subway gunman who fatally shot a mugger two 
days ago ignored pleas to surrender on saturday but police charged 
a 17yearold with being one of four men who attacked him 
the gunmans whereabouts remained a mystery as officers 
continued searching garbage cans and subway stations for a clue to 
his identity 
the arrested youth melvin kirkland of brooklyn was charged 
late friday with second degree robbery and second degree assault in 
connection with the subway incident said sgt nick vreeland a 
police spokesman 
kirkland allegedly was one of four men who attacked the subway 
rider thursday night the victim retaliated by pulling a gun from 
his waist and firing three times hitting and killing one of the 
assailants 
vreeland said he had no details on how police tracked down 
kirkland 
a chrome 25caliber automatic believed to have been used by one 
of the attackers was found by police the attackers were also armed 
with a retractable razor they were among a group of more than a 
dozen men who were smoking marijuana and drinking brandy inside the 
subway before the assault 
after the man was beaten and robbed he pulled a handgun from 
his waistband and fired three shots at his assailants a 
25yearold man with a halfdozen robbery convictions was fatally 
wounded by one of the bullets while six other passengers looked on 
the shooter walked off the train at the next stop and 
disappeared as did the three surviving muggers police on friday 
issued a public appeal for the man to turn himself in emphasizing 
that he was considered a victim 
this is not the bernhard goetz case said brooklyn chief of 
detectives joseph demartino 
goetz received national attention after shooting four youths on 
a subway train on dec 22 1984 police said the shootings were 
different because goetz was not attacked before he fired the 
thursday night shooter had been assaulted before he pulled a gun 
one of goetzs attorneys recommended the gunman keep his 
anonymity goetz surrendered to police in new hampshire nine days 
after his incident 
if he calls well tell him to sit tight and lay low until and 
unless the police determine his name said lawyer mark baker 
a search of trash cans subway tracks and gutters in downtown 
brooklyn failed to turn up the gunmans wallet which one witness 
told police had been stolen by the assailants said police 
spokesman sgt norris hollomon 
the slaying was the ninth this year in the subways there were 
20 in all of 1989 
the shooter is not the only man still at large after killing a 
mugger on a train the subway samaritan disappeared and was 
never identified after fatally stabbing a man who was robbing 
another subway rider last dec 9

an investigation by the department of housing 
and urban developments inspector general concluded federal 
regulations were not intentionally violated in nobid contracts 
awarded to three former reagan administration officials a hud 
spokesman said saturday 
all i understand is that there was no willful disregard of 
federal procurement regulations said robert nipp hud spokesman 
the new york times reported in its sunday editions that 
officials not identified by the newspaper said the inspector 
general determined there may be an appearance of favoritism in the 
contract awards and that they should have been awarded through 
competitive bidding 
i cant confirm or deny the story said nipp 
however he said the igs report makes seven or eight 
recommendations that this new federal agency should follow in the 
future 
the investigation concerned nearly 200000 in consultant 
contracts granted by mary k bush acting director of the federal 
housing finance board to wendell gunn a former top aide to 
housing secretary jack kemp and two former treasury department 
officials margery waxman and kevin coyne 
we are informed that the audit report does not find any 
statutory or regulatory violation in the manner in which these 
contracts were let francis a keating hud general counsel told 
the times 
the white house earlier this month rejected kemps nomination of 
ms bush who is not related to president bush to head the agency 
which was created as a part of the savings and loan bailout 
keating refused to discuss details of the investigative report 
with the newspaper but said it puts to rest any suggestion that 
inappropriate conduct occurred 
kemp however is anxious in the future that there not even be 
the appearance of inappropriate conduct keating said 
nipp said the report will be made public in two or three days 
hud was rocked last year by congressional investigations 
uncovering widespread political favoritism in several federal 
housing programs 
a congressional panel also has said it will investigate the 
finance board matter

million the price jackson paid he said ono thought the price was 
too steep

federal prosecutors have concluded that the 
price mayor david dinkins set for stock he transferred to his son 
was fair and expect to close their probe without filing taxevasion 
charges a newspaper reported 
citing unidentified sources the daily news said the office of 
brooklyn us attorney andrew j maloney believes the 58000 at 
which dinkins valued the stock is probably a good ballpark 
figure 
maloney declined comment the news said 
dinkins holdings in the inner city broadcasting corp and their 
value became a major issue during his successful campaign to be 
elected mayor 
dinkins had said he sold the stock to his son david jr in 
1985 to avoid conflicts with his duties on the board of estimate 
the board on which dinkins sat as manhattan borough president 
regulates cable television in the city 
dinkins produced a handwritten letter in which his son promised 
to pay him 58000 and interest for the stock david jr has until 
the end of this year to pay 
it was later disclosed that in 1983 dinkins had valued the same 
stock at more than 1 million on one financial disclosure form 
dinkins said his longtime friend inner city president percy 
sutton had advised him to use that figure in 1983 sutton said the 
stock would have been worth 1 million had the privately held 
company been sold 
defending the price he charged his son dinkins said inner city 
had bought stock from shareholders at about that price around the 
same time 
the federal investigators agreed saying other shares were sold 
for about the same in 1986 the news said 
investigators continue to examine whether dinkins may have 
parked the stock with his son or concocted a fake sale during 
the campaign the news said fbi tests on the handwritten letter 
were unable to pinpoint its age 
investigators probably will complete their probe into dinkins 
within a month the news said 
a special city investigation is still pending on whether 
dinkins failure to report the stock sale meant that he violated 
financial disclosure laws or an ethics ruling by having voted on 
matters affecting inner city when he was borough president
