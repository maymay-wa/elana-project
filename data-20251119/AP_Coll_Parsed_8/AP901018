mobil oil corp agreed thursday to a 
sevenyear phaseout of deadly hydrogen flouride at a refinery and a 
review by an independent safety advisor 
the agreement settles a lawsuit by the city that contended use 
of the toxic cloudforming acid endangered thousands of nearby 
residents 
the case was scheduled to go to trial nov 5 
a trial would have shown the world how dangerous hydrogen 
flouride is and how poorly managed the plant was operated said 
city councilman dan walker i think were going to have to fight 
every inch of the way to meet the goals of the settlement 
the lawsuit filed early this year stems from a november 1987 
explosion and fire that ignited when hydrogen flouride overflowed 
into a tank and mixed with another chemical 
the blast caused about 17 million in damage and left four 
workers and six bystanders injured 
used to manufacture highoctane gasolines hydrogen flouride 
forms a heavy cloud when exposed to open air city officials feared 
an accident or leak at the refinery could send such a cloud 
drifting into residential neighborhoods in this los angeles coastal 
suburb 
under the agreement mobil would be allowed to develop and use a 
derivative of hydrogen flouride that would not form a cloud 
refinery manager joel maness said he expected the settlement to 
end several years of acrimony between the city and mobil he said 
he had no concern about permitting an outside inspector to review 
the plants operations 
we feel strongly that we have a safe operation maness said 
but i never mind having another set of eyes take a look at our 
operations and our procedures 
the inspector who will advise the plant on safety 
considerations will be chosen by joint agreement between mobil and 
the city and bill be paid by the company court documents said 
the advisor will report to retired superior court judge harry v 
peetris who will act as an arbitrator of future disputes over the 
phaseout program peetris will be paid by mobil

soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
emissary to iraq on thursday ruled out any deal with saddam hussein 
that would reward the iraqi leader for pulling troops out of 
kuwait 
yevgeny primakov spoke to reporters after reviewing prospects 
for a settlement in the persian gulf with secretary of state james 
a baker iii for a halfhour and then more extensively with 
dennis b ross head of the state departments policy planning 
staff 
we should look for some possibilities to avoid from my point 
of view the military clashes but not reward iraq of course with 
its actions primakov said in halting english before climbing 
into a waiting black limousine 
he turned aside a question on reports he had brought a proposal 
from the iraqi leader for negotiations based on something short of 
total withdrawal from kuwait which saddam seized aug 2 and then 
annexed 
let me not comment on your very wise question he said 
however a us official said later that primakov had not 
presented anything new nothing they had not heard before 
baker reiterated the bush administrations position that a 
partial solution was unacceptable and that iraq had to withdraw 
completely from kuwait said the official who insisted on 
anoymity 
national security adviser brent scowcroft gave a similar 
assessment of what primakov had to say wbout his talks with saddam 
asked by reporters at the state dinner for hungarian prime minister 
jozsef antall whether primakov reported showed any signs of saddam 
softening his position scowcroft said there wasnt really 
anything new in what primakov had to say 
baker who broke away from the session with primakov to fulfill 
a scheduled appearance before the house foreign affairs committee 
made no remarks as he posed for pictures with primakov the state 
department provided no comments on the meeting 
we had very interesting talks primakov said it was a 
real exchange of views we do care about the situation the united 
states the soviet union and the world 
the soviet official who was accompanied by deputy foreign 
minister viktor p karpov then met for a halfhour with scowcroft 
a white house official declining to be identified said the 
meeting was in preparation for talks primakov will hold with bush 
on friday 
the unannounced visit to the state department revived interest 
in hints that the iraqi leader might withdraw his troops from the 
oilrich monarchy of kuwait in exchange for a strategic island that 
controls access to iraqs only military port in the persian gulf or 
for free elections in the emirate and compensation for iraqi oil 
claims 
the two superpowers are cooperating in efforts to force iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait through economic pressures but as war talk 
mounted gorbachev sent primakov to baghdad two weeks ago in search 
of a political settlement 
baker reiterated at a news conference tuesday the bush 
administrations interest in a peaceful way out of the crisis that 
began with iraqs invasion of kuwait but baker also ruled out any 
partial solution saying saddam should not be enabled to claim 
benefits from the takeover of its neighbor 
on wednesday testifying before the senate foreign relations 
committee baker encountered growing concern that us troops would 
be sent into action against iraq if the freeze in virtually all 
trade authorized two months ago by the united nations failed to 
force an iraqi pullout from kuwait 
a report in the washington times meanwhile said gorbachev had 
sent a peace plan with primakov for bush the newspaper quoting 
unnamed us officials in moscow said the plan calls for free 
elections in kuwait and cash compensation for oil sales iraq claims 
to have lost as a result of overproduction 
in return saddam reportedly is willing to reverse iraqs 
military occupation 
bush and baker have insisted from the outset on unconditional 
withdrawal which would seem to rule out any deal that rewarded the 
iraqi leader 
while primakov visited washington the us defense secretary 
dick cheney was in moscow paying calls on the kremlins top 
military and foreign policy officials cheney has met with 
gorbachev foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and defense 
minister dimitri yazov 
baker cautioned tuesday that the soviets may not be supporting 
the reported compromises while stressing that moscows support for 
the economic squeeze on iraq is solid 
the coalition organized by the united states to oppose iraq also 
includes a majority of arab and european countries

there is a brief image in the 1963 comedy its 
a mad mad mad mad world that endures long after the movie has 
faded from memory 
an airplane in distress approaches a remote airstrip panicky 
sirens blare and the camera cuts to a slow pan of the emergency 
crew three men motionless deadpan wait to spring into action 
the three stooges 
even standing still expressionless years past their prime the 
potential havoc those men could wreak was enough to make audiences 
laugh helplessly 
thats why disorder in the court a 60th anniversary tribute 
to the stooges is overdue if not for the brothers howard 
curly moe and shemp and larry fine the tv generation would not 
know what vaudeville was 
i dont think theres anyone whos done physical comedy in the 
past 40 years who hasnt been influenced to some extent by the 
stooges said gary owens a lifelong fan 
owens the famed announcer of tvs breakthrough comedy 
laughin is the announcer for the twohour tribute syndicated 
in 126 markets oct 25 through nov 11 
owens also helped lead the letterwriting campaign that got the 
stooges their sidewalk star on hollywoods walk of fame in 1983 
we always thought the star should have been tilted then 
everybody passing by paying homage to the stooges would then trip 
and fall down and plotz a lot owens said but the chamber of 
commerce wouldnt go along 
the three stooges began in vaudeville the touring song dance 
novelty and comedy acts that were the bedrock of american showbiz 
shemp was second banana stooge to comedian ted healy and 
enlisted his brother moe and violinist larry fine into the act 
their film debut was in 1930 
shemp quit the act for a solo film career in 1932 and was 
replaced by moes younger brother jerome nicknamed curly in 
1934 healy was a rising film star his stooges went out on their 
own and signed with columbia pictures 
for 12 years they made classic tworeel comedies until illness 
forced curly to retire shemp rejoined the act and they continued 
making short features for nearly 10 years 
curly the most popular stooge died in 1952 shemp died in 1955 
and was replaced by joe besser a longtime bit player with abbott 
and costello 
in 1958 columbia fired the stooges but released their 190 
tworeelers to television where they were discovered by the 
current generation of television writers 
joe derita replaced besser for a series of forgettable 
featurelength comedies the last of them the outlaws is 
coming was released in 1965 
moe and larry died in 1975 and derita is the sole surviving 
stooge 
disorder in the court does a fine job at presenting the 
trivial factoids that will delight the serious stoogeophile 
stoogist stoogian 
in addition to clips of classic stooge shtick it has home 
movies old kinescope footage of early television appearances and a 
television pilot never before broadcast 
theres also thorough discussion of the stooges slapstick sound 
effects crushing walnuts make a nosewrench a ukelele pluck makes 
a nosetweak while a poke in the eye requires a violin pluck 
the mechanics of the eye poke you aim for the forehead and the 
slap keep the fingers loose are thoroughly demystified with 
slowmotion photography 
and theres a nice bit with emil sitka the dyspeptic looking 
quaveryvoiced character actor who made 28 comedy shorts with the 
stooges 
unfortunately the producers took what would have been a tight 
entertaining hour and padded it to two hours 
there are several pointless appearances by comedians who add 
nothing to the program including the otherwise funny wil shriner 
who drives around hollywood indicating where once stood the 
vanished landmarks of the stooges 
serious stooge fans will be irritated by the inclusion of the 
curly shuffle a 1984 music video of old footage and a mediocre 
song 
purists will be horrified by the programs finale the first 
colorized stooges short 1949s malice in the palace it is far 
from their best work cut down to 15 minutes and interrupted twice 
by commercials this is shabby treatment of the stooges and their 
director jules white a master of monochrome 
this tribute to the stooges is strongest where it shows us 
stoogery that we havent seen before where the writers let their 
admiration for the stooges shine through 
it is weakest painfully lame in fact where it tries to be 
funny without its subject 
nobody will ever confuse the stooges work with high art it is 
broad violent lowbrow physical comedy of incompetence 
but they did it soooooooo well 
 
elsewhere in television 
bogosian comes to cable vh1 cable tvs music video channel 
for adults of a certain age continues its distinguished 
documentary series vh1 to one on sunday with a program on eric 
bogosian 
the program features excerpts from bogosians oneman show 
sex drugs and rock n roll and interview segments with the 
gifted actor and comedian who calls himself a performance artist 
vh1 to one is always worth watching its distinctive visual 
style lets its subjects speak for themselves it gives rock

filmmaker philip kaufman met henry miller only 
once when he and his wife showed up unannounced at millers 
hideaway in big sur 30 years ago and spent the day with the author 
but that brief encounter fueled a lifetime of fascination with 
miller that has culminated in a new movie about his years as a 
struggling writer and his relationship with anais nin 
kaufmans obsession with miller was so great that he even 
credits miller with his decision to drop out of harvard law school 
after a year and become a filmmaker 
he filled me with a sense of adventure said kaufman 53 a 
slender softspoken youthfullooking man during a recent 
interview in his new york hotel room he was writing about 
selfliberation and he liberated me 
kaufmans film henry and june seeks to liberate audiences 
as well the movie details millers early years in paris with his 
wife june and the relationship the couple developed with nin who 
was also married at the time the film replete with fairly 
explicit sex scenes explores both the affair between miller and 
nin and their mutual attraction to june 
in an ironic twist given that millers books were banned in 
englishspeaking countries for 27 years henry and june led to 
the eradication of the x rating in the united states the new nc17 
rating meaning no children under 17 will be admitted will be 
assigned to certain adult films instead including henry and 
june 
it came as a great relief to kaufman the critically acclaimed 
director of the right stuff and the unbearable lightness of 
being who was prepared for a lengthy fight to avoid an x rating 
and keep certain scenes intact 
the movie took three years to make kaufman collaborated with 
his wife of 31 years rose in writing the screenplay based on 
nins longsuppressed diaries and millers novels their only 
child peter 30 produced the film 
fred ward and maria de medeiros play miller and nin uma thurman 
portrays henrys wife june described by nin as the most 
beautiful woman on earth she served as muse for both of them 
though she never thought either writer would be successful 
just as kaufman saw millers writing as an act of rebellion 
against the stultifying america of the 1930s he sees his own 
film as an antidote to the inhibited sexuality of todays society 
i still see people motivated by greed and avarice said 
kaufman aids has scared people about sex its repressed them 
miller was just the opposite kaufman said he combined 
sexuality with his love of literature to him it was all part of 
the positive life force he seemed to live life to its fullest he 
was aware of all its sensations and its power 
that philosophy was one shared by anais nin at least during her 
affair with miller to kaufman henry and june is about three 
people who act out universal impulses 
in fact as in real life most people want everything he 
said all forms of sexuality are complex junes relationship 
with anais is very complex were never clear about just what 
junes sexuality is the mystery of women is a mystery even to men 
its easily thrown into an area called lesbianism but its more 
complicated 
kaufman deliberately did not make his film a morality play 
though miller nin and june pushed the envelope of relationships 
with their bizarre triangle it did not end in tragedy 
its a question play he said it ends in questions each 
scene is meant to be another part of the puzzle 
though kaufman clearly admires miller and nin his own life is 
anything but similar he has enjoyed a long and happy marriage with 
his wife they live a quiet life in san francisco 
kaufman said he has been haunted by miller all his life in 
1958 while exploring a cave with other tourists in south dakota 
he met a man who told him he knew where miller lived kaufman and a 
friend eventually made their way to big sur but decided not to 
bother miller when they saw a sign up near his big sur home 
pleading for privacy 
two years later kaufman brought his wife to the same location 
and the two asked millers neighbor to introduce them they spent 
the day with miller and slept on the beach at night 
henry was close to 70 kaufman recalled he was wearing 
jeans which was pretty unusual for someone that age then he was 
very serene he looked like a zen buddhist monk we talked about 
russia about literature and he showed us different trees we 
drank some warm gin he seemed happy he seemed like a man always 
trying to keep his spirits up

what does the commander of us forces in 
the persian gulf do when his spirits dip 
he rereads a letter from a 10yearold texas girl who recovered 
from a serious heart defect and told him to make sure that your 
soldiers dont give up no matter how hard things get 
in an interview published today in the rosslynbased usa today 
gen h norman schwarzkopf said that every now and then even my 
morale gets down 
for a boost schwarzkopf reads the letter he received from 
andrea turnbough her teacher at roberts elementary school in el 
paso assigned her fifthgrade class to write to soldiers in saudi 
arabia 
andrea wrote 
most of the adults who know me say that i never give up when 
i was little i had a serious heart problem 
after lots of surgery i got better it seems to me that your 
job is to make sure that your soldiers dont give up no matter how 
hard things get 
people like you and me know how important that is 
good luck sincerely your friend andrea 
ps i live in the desert all the time its not so bad 
in his reply schwarzkopf told andrea her letter was beautiful 
and it truly touched my heart it also provided me with just the 
inspiration i needed to try a little harder to take care of my 
troops 
he also said he was happy she got better after her surgery 
i am sure one reason why you got better is because you never 
gave up but i also know the reason why the doctors were able to 
fix your heart was because you have a beautiful heart 
in a postscript he added youre right the desert is not so 
bad my troops have already learned to deal with its problems

participants in a bitter miners strike 
that divided a town along racial lines and gained international 
attention during the mccarthy era gather this weekend to 
commemorate the events 40 years ago 
the empire zinc strike and the making of an awardwinning movie 
about the walkout salt of the earth were played out against a 
backdrop of congressional witch hunts for communists in the 
government the labor movement and the film industry 
mexicanamerican miners from local 890 of the united mine mill 
and smelter workers quietly went on strike against the zinc mine in 
a remote corner of southwestern new mexico in 1950 
the labor dispute new mexicos longest and one of its most 
bitter drew national attention when it was kept alive midway by 
miners wives mothers sisters and children who took over picket 
lines and withstood tear gas beatings and jail 
and before it was over hollywood filmmakers blacklisted because 
of the mccarthy era red scare were on location in the mining 
town of hanover making a movie about the 15month walkout 
we made history all over the world said virginia chacon 
66 who still lives in the area 
she was a member of the unions ladies auxiliary 209 which took 
over the picket line aftr the men were served with a court 
injunction threatening them with arrest if they blocked the road to 
the mine 
her husband longtime union leader juan chacon who died in 1985 
at age 66 played the role of ramon quintero the movies male 
lead 
the workers were fighting segregation at the mine which placed 
hispanic workers in underground lowerpaid jobs and left surface 
work in the mill and shop for anglos the policy extended to the 
companyowned houses 
people should be reminded that it was a good and a hard 
struggle not only for grant county workers and labor people but 
all over the world mrs chacon said 
the reunion will include a showing friday night of the 
fulllength blackandwhite film now considered a classic at a 
hall named for her husband at western new mexico university in 
silver city 
the film finished in 1954 despite pressure to stop production 
from forces as disparate as local vigilantes and howard hughes was 
a joint production of the miners union and the blacklisted 
filmmakers 
it won several international awards but pressure on theater 
owners by the communisthunting followers of sen joseph mccarthy 
kept it out of most american movie houses said producer paul 
jarrico 75 of santa monica calif 
ultimately of a possible 13000 it played 13 theaters he 
said and of the 13 seven were theaters that we had rented 
ourselves 
but it still may have been seen by more people than any other 
film jarrico said cryptically because it was the only american 
film playing in china for 15 years 
the movie group chose local 890s battle for its subject because 
we wanted to make a film that would have real content and the 
kind of content that wed never really been able to express as 
hollywood filmmakers jarrico said 
and wed already been punished by the blacklist so we 
wanted to commit a crime to fit the punishment 
the movie which explored issues of racial discrimination and 
womens equality was denounced in congress as a new weapon for 
russia 
the films director was the late herbert biberman who was one 
of the hollywood 10 imprisoned for refusing to testify before the 
house unamerican activities committee 
for the miners of grant county the strike and the worldwide 
attention the film created were well worth the battle 
although many original demands were lost when the 32 miners 
remaining on strike signed the contract that ended the walkout 
striker lorenzo torrez said the agreement strengthened the union 
within a few years of the strikes end company housing was 
integrated hispanic miners had equal access to jobs and the 
mines safety record was one of the best in the region said 
torrez 63 who continued to work at the mine until it was closed 
in 1970 
the strike solidified the voice of the union and gave a 
political voice to mexicanos so political offices were open to 
them for the first time he said

while congress stays pinned to the floor in its wrestling match 
with the federal budget some of the nations largest cities are 
grappling with their own fiscal crises 
in new york philadelphia washington and elsewhere costly 
social problems and a slumping national economy have conspired to 
plunder municipal budgets cities are slashing services raising 
taxes and laying off workers to do what the federal government 
cant seem to accomplish balance their budgets 
not all cities are hurting seattle and denver are thriving 
houston is rising from an economic abyss and dallas gets high marks 
for steering its budget along the black line of solvency 
but some strains are universal drugs homelessness and aids are 
costly burdens for nearly every city insurance is ever more 
expensive and while some urban economies are still booming most 
are beginning to feel the effects of a national economic slowdown 
i think all cities are experiencing financial crunches to 
different degrees said lance simmens assistant executive 
director of the us conference of mayors which represents cities 
with populations of more than 30000 
most cities are facing problems that didnt exist in 1980 
aids crack cocaine the infrastructure has endured years of 
neglect and thats starting to take its toll he said 
simmens added there are strains being experienced from the 
federal disinvestment from the social problems from the 
restrictions on the ability to issue taxexempt debt and the 
beginnings of an economic downturn in many areas of the country 
the national league of cities surveyed 576 communities about 
their budgets earlier this year twothirds reported they were less 
able to meet their financial needs than the year before 
theres quite a lot of stress to cities of all sizes league 
spokesman randy arndt said 
philadelphia is the nations leading economic basket case the 
nations fifth largest city expects to go broke sometime early in 
december unless it can plug a 206 million hole in its budget 
if philadelphia has even a temporary period without sufficient 
cash the result will be a legal political and public safety 
nightmare the citys finance director betsy c reveal told 
mayor w wilson goode in a recent memo 
standard amp poors corp recently downgraded philadelphias 
general obligation bond rating to junk bond status ccc 
no other major city has such a poor bond rating detroit comes 
closest with a bbb 
new york could become the next big city to see its bond rating 
fall standard amp poors recently announced the nations largest city 
was under a credit watch a warning to shape up or slip down in 
the credit rankings its current ranking was a minus 
lower credit ratings make it more costly for financially 
strapped cities to borrow 
new york mayor david dinkins announced plans tuesday for 13 
billion in budget cuts that will dig deeply into nearly every type 
of city service except police and jails dinkins wants to raise 
taxes to pay for them 
public concern about crime is at a peak and cities are loathe 
to cut money for police thats why you have to find cuts 
elsewhere said hyman c grossman standard amp poors managing 
director of municipal finance 
so residents of fiscally troubled big cities can expect shorter 
library hours less frequent garbage pickup shabbier streets and 
parks and less reliable transit 
miami recently eliminated grants to cultural groups street 
festivals exile groups and charities the miami film festival lost 
100000 or 25 percent of its cash budget 
officials of toledo ohio announced plans to limit garbage 
pickups to once every two weeks and to slash most recreation 
programs san francisco cut public health funds and aids programs 
and doubled some city fees 
budget troubles cut across regional lines but most analysts 
agree the problems are most acute in the northeast 
the midwest seems to be perhaps not quite as stricken by 
some of these events as some other regions particularly the 
northeast said arndt of the league of cities the contortions 
and strains that the midwest went through earlier in the 1980s have 
made them perhaps more resilient 
no city knows more about fiscal failure than cleveland which 
defaulted in 1978 cleveland has since regained relative financ the budget

diarist anne frank has become the 
focus of a namecalling match pitting one of her closest friends 
against her stepsister and the official group that maintains her 
world war ii hiding place 
jacqueline van maarsen alleges in a book published thursday that 
anne franks stepsister eva schloss is opening exhibits and 
giving lectures posing as annes friend although the two never knew 
each other 
she writes that the governmentsubsidized anne frank foundation 
is supporting that claim even though it knows ms schloss is lying 
author van maarsen is known as jopie in anne franks diary 
because anne invented pseudonyms for many of the people she wrote 
about the diary found after anne perished in a nazi death camp 
is world famous 
anne and jopie is ms van maarsens 113page defense of her 
claim to being annes best friend to the exclusion of all others 
ever since shes become famous because of the diary i 
have heard people say so many times they were close to anne frank 
when i know its not true the 60yearold author said in a 
telephone interview 
according to ms van maarsen ms schloss is being used by the 
foundation and is capitalizing on her supposed friendship with anne 
to promote her own book about the holocaust evas story 
ms schloss is the daughter of fritzi schloss who married 
annes father otto after his entire family perished in nazi death 
camps 
author van maarsen argues theres no way the two young girls 
could have known each other even though the schlosses lived on the 
same street as the franks before the war 
i was annes best friend i feel it is my duty to anne to 
bring these facts to out into the open it is part of history 
ms van maarsen said 
anne frank foundation president hans westra said the anne 
and jopie story is a lie 
it is a theory she has made up in her head a trivial 
debate over who knew anne frank better i have no idea why she is 
doing this 
ms schloss said i dont know what has got into ms van 
maarsen 
anne was a very lively child with many friends i say i 
knew her but i never say i was her best friend or even a good 
friend she said in a telephone interview from london where she 
now lives 
the diary contains references to jopie as well as eva 
levien rouw an anne frank foundation researcher said it wasnt 
clear whether that meant eva schloss or was just another pseudonym 
in a sept 25 1942 letter to dear jacqueline anne said 
farewell to ms van maarsen after going into hiding and wrote i 
hope that we will always be best friends until the day we meet 
again 
the anne frank foundation noted that otto frank wrote letters 
saying anne and eva schloss played together after school 
westra said he often invites ms schloss to speak because her 
wartime experiences resembled annes ms schloss was deported to 
the aschwitz camp after years in hiding 
the franks were german jews who fled the nazis in 1933 and 
settled in the netherlands like the schlosses who came from 
austria 
anne her parents her sister margot and four other people hid 
in an attic closed off by a bookshelf from june 1942 until their 
betrayal to german police in august 1944 
anne was 15 when she died at bergenbelsen in 1945 months 
before american troops liberated the camp 
about 600000 people a year visit the hiding place in a 
17thcentury building and the anne frank foundation has developed 
into a prominent dutch pressure group against antisemitism and 
racism 
ms van maarsen said anne was spirited funny cheerful and 
active but she could also be nasty and jealous 
she said that by writing her own book i became part of the 
anne frank cult which i had been observing with mixed feelings for 
years

us officials are gaining important espionage 
information from newly available files of the disbanded east german 
secret police cia director william webster says 
west german officials have shared with the united states 
information from voluminous files seized when the communist 
government of east germany was toppled by popular discontent last 
fall he said 
we have pursued a number of important leads the cia 
director said in an interview with the associated press on 
wednesday thats not to say weve identified spies but weve 
learned more about some notorious cases he said declining to 
elaborate 
east germanys notorious stasi secret police had about 80000 
agents keeping tabs on its 11 million citizens webster said the 
files have yielded a bonanza of secrets and identified some highly 
placed west german officials as east german spies he said 
webster said his counterpart in moscow must be wondering how 
many soviet spies have been compromised by the seizure 
the cia director also said the united states and soviet union 
have been sharing information about terrorist threats and the 
persian gulf crisis may open the way for more intelligence 
cooperation 
but the kremlin must be careful about sharing intelligence on 
iraq with the united states because it is trying to negotiate the 
departure of about 5000 soviet citizens trapped there webster 
said 
anything they say that suggests they provide intelligence to 
us may diminish their chances of getting the soviets out he 
said many of the soviets serve as military advisers and the iraqi 
arsenal is largely sovietmade 
kgb chairman vladimir kryuchkov said in a recent interview with 
the ap that his organization is willing to share intelligence about 
iraq but hasnt offered because the cia has rebuffed its past 
efforts to cooperate 
our common interests in the gulf open up an opportunity to 
deal more frankly on terrorism webster said 
soviet support for states like iraq and libya which sponsor 
terrorism appears to have declined making some cooperation with 
the united states possible he said 
the united states cannot expose its intelligence sources in such 
cooperation but it has passed along warnings to the soviet union 
about threats to its officials or diplomatic facilities abroad 
webster said 
in several cases it was pivotal to their preventive 
actions he said some of the warnings were specific others more 
general he said 
the soviets too have relayed information to the united states 
about threats to this countrys people webster said he declined 
to elaborate 
iraqs president saddam hussein has isolated himself from his 
top advisers and is forming many of his impressions based on news 
accounts webster said 
he said saddam enjoys broad support among poorer iraqis and 
among the military ranks and any move to unseat him would have to 
come from the top echelons of his military 
saddam believes a sittight mode is his best posture but if 
he thinks the united states is planning to attack iraq likely 
would take preemptive action webster said 
iraq has dug in substantial ground forces in kuwait and it 
looks like he intends to make it costly for us troops to launch 
a landbased offensive the cia chief said 
on other matters webster said 
the gulf crisis has improved chances for the release of eight 
americans held hostage by proiranian extremists in lebanon 
there is good reason why iran would want to resolve the 
hostage issue because it wants to improve its image and ease its 
international isolation he said although iran doesnt necessarily 
control all the hostageholders 
on the whole i am more optimistic than i was two years ago 
he said 
cuban leader fidel castro is having serious economic troubles 
especially because the soviets have cut their support while he 
doesnt appear in immediate danger his trouble thermometer is 
up webster said

the successor to ig farben the infamous 
chemical works that propelled adolf hitlers nazi war machine is 
trying to reclaim vast amounts of property in former east germany 
for many the news comes as a shock while the goverment agency 
returning land and businesses to private ownership has tried to 
withdraw a reported statement the claims may be valid 
the victorious world war ii allies in the west broke up ig 
farben into several companies including the mighty bayer hoechst 
and basf concerns communists in east germany nationalized the ig 
farben property there 
a successor company called ig farben in liquidation was 
formed in the early 1950s to handle remaining legal claims 
including pension rights the frankfurtbased company went into a 
lengthy liquidation process that was expected to be completed by 
1992 
then the berlin wall fell in november reuniting families 
thrilling the world and giving hope to 166 million east germans 
beyond the iron curtain 
it also gave hope to the thousands of shareholders in the ig 
farben successor company who have a right to any further property 
the company can recover share prices since january have doubled to 
16 each on the frankfurt exchange 
ernstjoachim bartels one of the two liquidators is now 
actively pursuing the lost property he is looking into 
reactivating ig farben to administer whatever may be returned 
to the companys ownership 
it is clear to me we will get something bartels said 
adding it is too soon to make precise predictions 
in some cases ig farben would accept financial compensation 
rather than the return of the land and factories themselves 
bartels and his colleagues work out of a 10room suite in 
frankfurt 
the fabled krupp arms maker and the ig farben conglomerate are 
the two names most closely associated with the industrial muscle 
behind hitlers murderous third reich 
ig farben itself stands for for interessengemeinschaft der 
deutschen farbenindustrie or german dye industry syndicate at 
its height it was the largest chemical company in the world 
the mammoth concern was involved in the production of the 
infamous zyklonb gas used in masskillings at the auschwitz death 
camp 
profithungry managers also used cheap slave labor from 
auschwitz at a neighboring plant to make allimportant synthetic 
rubber and fuels for hitlers army 
in 1948 one of the nuremberg tribunals sentenced 11 men 
connected with the ig farben war crimes to prison terms ranging 
from 18 months to eight years 
bartels overseer of the ig farben successor says the company 
paid 71 million in reparations in the 1950s he says that 
fulfills the companys obligations 
still the tagesspiegel daily newspaper of berlin wrote that 
possible compensation for the survivors of the work camps in the 
third reich must be discussed in the event of a return of 
property 
the newspaper also reported that two british investment 
companies had bought ig farben shares over the summer as 
speculators saw the chance of huge profits 
joining tens of thousands of others seeking to regain property 
in the former east germany ig farben filed its claims by 
saturdays deadline 
the properties named are reportedly worth billions of dollars 
including several stilloperating chemical plants and real estate 
in the eastern half of berlin 
in all ig farbens holdings in former east germany totaled 58 
square miles the company says 
complicating matters is a section of the germangerman 
unification treaty wiping out the rights of those whose property 
was confiscated from 1945 to 1949 
that is when the soviet occupiers reportedly took over most of 
the ig farben facilities although ig farbens liquidators have 
indicated they may challenge the legal basis of those 
expropriations 
while interest in ig farben has been growing in recent weeks 
the stock price jumped when a key german official was quoted in 
german newspapers this week as saying the claims may be legitimate 
we are trying to go as quickly as possible wolfgang nautsch 
later told berlins rias radio he said speedy action was needed to 
settle legal rights and at the affected plants employment 
obligations 
nautsch is a topranking official of the treuhandgesellschaft 
agency overseeing the return of east german property to private 
ownership 
however a spokesman for the agency insisted that nautsch had 
been misinterpreted regarding the legitimacy of the demands 
there are no claims said spokesman wolf schoede regarding 
the ig farben position he said nautsch was only thinking out 
loud about possible courtordered changes to make such claims 
possible

the gunfire on jerusalems temple mount did 
more than put israel back at the middle easts center stage it let 
loose domestic political squabbles that had been stilled by the 
persian gulf crisis 
a week after police killed 19 palestinians in riots on the 
sacred mount prime minister yitzhak shamirs government is under 
fire from israels left wing and from human rights activists 
even his rightwing allies are bickering among themselves 
strangely the uproar comes as most israelis are united in anger 
over a un security council resolution condemning their country 
for excessive force and over a rare us vote against israel in 
the council 
but political leaders and newspapers both are complaining that 
by refusing a un invesetigation of the killings shamirs cabinet 
is keeping the worlds indignation focused on israel instead of on 
saddam husseins iraq 
this is an empty and damaging stubbornness that doesnt serve 
israels political interests yedioth ahronoth said in an 
editorial wednesday 
the daily newspaper said the move will certainly lead to a 
harsh and unnecessary confrontation with the united nations and the 
us administration 
before the cabinet vote secretary of state james a baker iii 
pleaded for israel to accept the un probe and both he and 
president bush have since repeated the plea 
mayor teddy kollek jerusalems leader for more than 25 years 
says that despite the cabinet rejection he will meet un 
investigators if they come 
te centerleft labor party and several leftwing factions are 
engineering a vote of noconfidence next week in parliament because 
of the governments stand 
shimon peres whose labor party is the largest opposition 
faction in parliament says the cabinet action has served only to 
keep the heat on israel 
with our own hands instead of extinguishing the fire we are 
increasing the flames he told reporters 
shamirs colleagues in the rightwing likud bloc have stuck with 
him but they have their own dispute on the emotional issue of 
jerusalems status 
right after the cabinet challenged washington by rejecting the 
un probe housing minister ariel sharon announced plans to build 
5000 new apartments for new soviet immigrants in arab east 
jerusalem 
washington immmediately made public a letter signed a week 
earlier by foreign minister david levy to secure 400 million in 
us housing loan guarantees for the thousands of arriving soviet 
jews 
levy promised not to direct or settle soviet jews beyond the 
green line which divided israel from jordan before the 1967 
middle east war 
east jerusalem is beyond the green line and the united states 
views it as occupied land just like the west bank and gaza strip 
washington sees jewish settlements on the captured lands including 
east jerusalem as obstacles to peace 
but israel annexed the eastern part of the city into its 
eternal capital after the 1967 war any threat to israeli 
control is cause for alarm particularly among shamir and his 
fellow likudniks 
thus levys letter has raised an uproar 
sharon fumed on israel army radio i dont believe that a 
foreign minister could give such an obligation newspapers have 
carried blasts at levy from other unidentified likud officials 
what embroils east jerusalem in the un dispute is that the 
temple mount where the killings occurred sits on what was 
jordanianheld territory before the 1967 war 
shamir and levy have argued that no un delegate has a right to 
investigate killings of palestinians that occurred on land israel 
considers sovereign territory 
levy complained too that the security council condemned israel 
even before its probe opened and never mentioned stonethrowing by 
palestinians at jewish worshipers that set off the police charge on 
the temple mount 
israelis in general share the governments anger at the security 
council for failing to mention stoning of jews at the western wall 
the last remnant of the ancient jewish temple and judaisms holiest 
site 
but a few nagging voices have questioned whether injuries to 34 
israeli civilians and police minor injuries at that justified 
shooting that left 19 palestinians dead and more than 140 wounded 
at a site also holy to moslems 
the human rights group betselem comprised of liberal israelis 
raised the question in a report accusing police of firing 
indiscriminately in the temple mount killings 
betselems charge added to the roar of debate over the cabinet 
rejection of a un probe and the american role in condemning 
israel before the world 
the volume has increased since the days when israel was keeping 
a low key approach to the gulf crisis

young skinbaring and refreshing are the first 
messages as readytowear shows for next spring get under way 
more than 80 designers will be showing for the next week in a 
courtyard in the louvre and elsewhere spending up to 200000 for 
the larger runway shows 
there appears to be as much hype and crowd interest as in the 
past despite of market downtrends and the persian gulf crisis 
lolita lempicka got applause wednesday for a lilting collection 
that featured micromodels with bustiers and bras shaped like 
underwear 
this lingerie trend started out with several houses last season 
and lempicka took it into a perky ingenue vein adding lace to 
little green or pink satin slip dresses covering them decently 
with peppy short trench coats 
she like several other designers showing this week liked the 
look of bare backs crossed by straps and occasional bare midriffs 
as her forte is suits she put plenty of pep back into grey flannel 
by adding appliqued flower details 
some of her shortie prints had a certain 1940s nostalgia with 
their fit and headwraps though they were far too short for that 
period 
those wanting to dress up lolitastyle might try some of the 
little white dresses decked out in big pearl or silver baubles and 
buttons if they were not in light summer fabrics they would look 
just fine along with the skaters at rockefeller center at 
christmas 
lempicka showed some safari suits and appealing sailor looks 
turning up already elsewhere as well 
at dorothee bis the clothes also had a youthful bent with 
shorts shortie jackets flaring tent dresses corsair and longer 
pants they came in redwhiteblue linens and kabig a kind of 
smooth broadcloth like that used in pea jackets 
paco rabannes show in a small left bank shop was also a hit for 
the younger set who can wear the stretch fabrics and microminis 
the spanishborn inventor of the chainmail and metallic dresses 
put a witty little flourish on some of his baremidriff cotton 
outfits they were made of cotton patterned just like his original 
metalplate models of some 20 years ago some were even cut and 
metal ringed though the plates were cotton this time 
metallic lame stripes in green and warm yellow added lateday 
dash to trouser outfits 
ishiro kimijimas collection was one of the most creative so 
far this 61yearold japanese brought out a smart group of 
beachwear with fishnet inspiration a good use of raffia lots of 
seethrough voile over bikinis or shorts 
he took nefertiti and ancient egypt for some inspiration but he 
also used plastic minis to advantage and many of the clothes had 
seashell and starfish embroideries and decor 
kimijimas heavily bewigged mermaids ending the show draped in 
strands of lamelace looked as if theyd just emerged from a golden 
seaweed sea 
another younger japanese inoue jun showed equally short and 
youthful lines for his company called june july auguste who 
showed in a small space on the right bank 
his forte for next summer is in the skimpy but wellcut little 
jackets with soft shoulders theyre worn over shortie skirts or 
shorts with some longer looks thrown in for good measure he 
concentrates on soft offbeat pastel shades and blues in a bluejean 
vein 
the house of lecoanethemant opted out of a big runway show but 
their rack line shown in a hotel display room had some fine ideas 
for summer with plenty of expensive couture touches 
stonewashed soft silk suits with soft cuts and short skirts 
look quite elegant in either salmon or coral pink deep navy or 
black 
they also pep up a well cut easilyfitted dark shantung silk 
suit with lifesaver embroideries in rustshaded raffia 
a fine topper here for a slinky stretch skirt or hostess pyjamas 
is the generous acidgreen waffled organza blouse with a big collar 
and billowing sleeves tied under the elbow 
one striking innovation is the use of coppermetal threads for a 
new fabric in a transparent blouse typical of lecoanethemants 
occasional enthusiasm for eccentric but beautiful new fabrics

a rookie politician just graduated from high 
school but he already may be drawing the most attention to the 
office of justice of the peace since judge roy bean and his 
sixguns were the law west of the pecos 
in march while still a senior 18yearold john payton defeated 
50yearold incumbent jim murrell in the republican primary 
there is no democratic candidate on the nov 6 ballot so payton 
is assured of victory unless murrell is successful with a writein 
campaign hes waging to hold on to the 37944ayear job 
i didnt take him seriously but i am certainly capable of 
running a campaign said murrell who lost 6549to6029 in the 
primary 
justices of the peace perform weddings issue warrants and 
conduct trials on criminal and small claims cases perhaps the most 
well known texas jp was bean whose court was the jersey lily 
saloon in langtry 
in the 1880s bean a hero of pulp fiction and 20th century 
television dispensed his own brand of justice with the help of his 
guns he once fined a corpse 40 for carrying a concealed weapon 
peace justices dont have to be lawyers and the age requirement 
is only 18 so payton chose the job for his first foray into 
politics which he wants to make his career 
i went out there the old fashioned way and worked for it 
said payton whose 19th birthday is jan 23 
hes now a political science major at collin county community 
college in this town just north of dallas 
murrell says he learned a lesson from his primary loss 
we are doing everything that we know how to do to contact 
voters murrell said 
were talking about our age education time in the area 
the experience i have as justice of the peace teaching 
instructing and community service murrell said 
hes also asking reporters to check whether payton had to make 
up classes and was fired from his parttime job in the grill at 
chase oaks golf course 
lynn coker in the school registrars office said she couldnt 
release paytons record without his permission payton said he 
needed to take extra courses because he transferred from maryland 
during his junior year 
golf course manager gary black said payton wasnt fired and was 
a good employee for the three months he worked there 
he just basically said he did not have enough time to do his 
job and run his campaign and try to do a good job as a justice of 
the peace candidate black said 
county republican party chairman jerry madden predicts another 
victory for payton 
he did an outstanding job in the primary madden said 
payton has promised to conduct night court and weekend weddings 
he also has attacked murrell as a college dropout 
murrell said ministers conduct weekend weddings and says night 
court would cost a minimum of 100000 murrell acknowledges he 
never finished college but says he has a wealth of life experience 
vital to the job 
i do not feel that an 18yearold is capable of having the 
maturity to do the job that we have to do he said 
payton responds that murrell is prejudging him 
i bring to the court integrity honesty high ethics and 
high moral standards payton said i support hard work i 
was out there walking doortodoor 
payton said his campaign has the attention of other teenagers 
theyre very excited because they now can say that what lies 
ahead of them is a good and a hopeful and a prosperous future he 
said 
murrell isnt planning his future beyond the election but said 
he has other job offers to consider if he loses 
im not running just to keep a job or to keep a paycheck 
coming to my house he said theres always something im 
capable and qualified of doing

some say prosecutor collier vale blamed 
himself for the slaying of a police informant in a tragic mixup 
and believed his career was over at age 39 but no one thought he 
would kill himself 
perhaps not even vale thought that until the last moment 
it appears to have been a spontaneous event monterey 
countys chief deputy coroner glen brown said of the 
selfinflicted gunshot 
authorities are still investigating vales apparent suicide oct 
5 at his apartment he didnt leave a note and although colleagues 
say he seemed to linger with goodbyes the day before he died he 
didnt appear suicidal 
i dont know why this happened said vales boss district 
attorney mike bartram 
friends say vale felt tremendous guilt when an informant was 
killed aug 8 1989 after information got out that she was helping 
police investigate a double killing in seaside 115 miles south of 
san francisco 
through a mixup of similar telephone numbers vale called 
songia petite johnson 20 instead of sonjii yvette johnson 23 
who was a witness in the july 16 double killing both women lived 
in the same highcrime neighborhood and both their names were 
pronounced sonya 
while trying to interview the wrong woman vale said enough for 
her to figure out that the other woman was an informant 
authorities speculate that largely to protect herself from drug 
dealers songia petite johnson spread the word that the other woman 
was the snitch three weeks later sonjii yvette johnson was 
shot to death authorities would not say where songia petite 
johnson could be located for comment 
after the mixup was discovered the johnson slaying was 
assigned to the state attorney generals office vale was widely 
blamed in press reports for the young womans death the story also 
was televised nationally on a current affair about a week 
before vales death 
when you have so many fingers pointing at you and saying you 
caused another persons death its going to have an effect on 
you said monterey police sgt fred ragghianti 
vale claimed he was given incorrect information and authorities 
say a police officer may have confused the numbers vales 
defenders also note that he offered the informant police protection 
three times 
still vales guiltfeelings persisted 
it bothered him considerably that he might have caused this 
ladys death said superior court judge john phillips who gave 
vale a job in the district attorneys office in 1979 
when youre a prosecutor or a police officer youre supposed 
to be hardhearted and not let things get to you said sheriff bud 
cook i think he felt maybe he did something wrong and it 
finally got to him 
bradley hardison 25 is charged with killing sonjii yvette 
johnson to prevent her from testifying in the double killing 
hardison was a friend of anthony jacobs 25 who later pleaded 
guilty to manslaughter in the earlier slayings 
johnson reportedly overheard jacobs talking about the double 
slayings 
melinda young a court reporter in salinas who was vales

the senate blocked a rankandfile democratic 
effort wednesday to redirect the pain of a bipartisan 
deficitreduction bill more heavily at the wealthy and less sharply 
at the middle class 
the 250 billion budgetcutting measure then withstood its 
second crucial test as lawmakers turned aside an effort by western 
senators to kill a doubling of the gasoline tax 
the votes left intact a compromise budget that mildly raises 
income taxes on the rich cuts medicare benefits and boosts the 
federal gasoline tax from 9 cents per gallon to 18 cents overall 
the senate plan includes a broaderbased tax increase than the 
soaktherich house version that president bush has said he will 
veto 
lawmakers rejected the taxtherich proposal offered by sen 
kent conrad dnd by 6732 they then voted 5940 to keep the 
gasoline tax in the bill defeating an attempt by sen steve symms 
ridaho to knock it out adoption of either effort would have 
unraveled the entire package leaders said 
id say to those who want to kill the package vote with the 
senator from idaho said senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
just before the vote on the gasoline tax 
the defeated effort to tax the rich proposed by sen kent 
conrad dnd sought to capitalize on what legislators say is 
growing public disenchantment with the tax code it would have 
imposed higher incometax boosts on the wealthiest americans cut 
the gasoline tax increase in half and eased cuts in medicare and 
agriculture 
but leaders of both parties stuck by their middleoftheroad 
package senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine warned 
that the amendment would never be enacted into law 
adoption of this amendment would make a very strong 
statement conceded mitchell it will result in no law 
as debate began democratic budget committee chairman james 
sasser dtenn said we tell the american people that there 
will be some sacrifice in this package but we tell them at the 
same time that it will be fair 
and the white house said the senate version could form the basis 
for ending the governments long budget stalemate 
the white house is ready to receive the bipartisan package 
similar to the senate package said bushs chief of staff john 
sununu get it to the presidents desk and hell sign it 
the administration also said bush might not shut down the 
government saturday if lawmakers show good faith progress toward a 
deficitreduction package sununu said bush might sign legislation 
keeping the government operating if it included budgetcutting 
provisions that show congress meant business about it 
until now the president has tried to keep the pressure on by 
threatening to shut the government down unless congress sends him a 
full budget he can accept without emergency legislation federal 
authority to spend money expires at 1201 am saturday 
acting one day after the democrats pushed a bill much tougher on 
the rich through the house senate leaders chose to face election 
day just three weeks off with a proposal bearing all the marks of a 
political compromise 
there would be limits on deductions for people with incomes 
exceeding 100000 but no boost in tax rates for the rich as the 
house approved the 9centagallon gasoline tax would be doubled 
but the earnedincome tax credit for the poor would increase too 
the package would shave about 250 billion from the federal 
deficit over the next five years by raising 142 billion in new 
taxes and paring medicare farm support and other benefit programs 
savings in other bills mainly defense cuts would bring total 
deficitreduction to about 500 billion including 40 billion in 
the budget year that started oct 1 
bush had threatened to veto the house bill because of its 
increase in the upper bracket income tax rate though 
administration officials objected to some provisions in the senate 
version sununu said in an interview on nbctv the president liked 
the compromise 
despite the plans powerful supporters the senates democratic 
and republican leaders spent the day defending their plan from 
lawmakers unhappy for regional or philosophical reasons 
western senators complained that the higher gasoline tax would 
be a severe blow to states such as theirs where people routinely 
drive long distances others insisted that the bills overall tax 
package was unnecessary that spending should have been cut more 
deeply instead 
grab your wallets and run for cover because congress is 
getting up a head of steam to raise your taxes said symms 
party leaders replied that with the economy teetering everyone 
had to pull together 
i believe the deficit of the united states is so serious that 
it isnt a democratic issue or a republican issue or the 
presidents issue said sen pete domenici of new mexico the 
budget panels ranking republican the people want us to do

a judges decision to dismiss a drug charge 
against a woman whose baby was born with cocaine in its system 
should discourage similar prosecutions of pregnant women a lawyer 
involved in the case said wednesday 
the decision was the first in the country to validate a womans 
constitutional privacy rights in such cases said nancy gertner a 
boston lawyer who represented 20 groups interested in the case 
among them was the american civil liberties union 
plymouth superior court judge suzanne delvecchio on tuesday 
dismissed a drug distribution indictment against josephine 
pellegrini a 24yearold brockton woman prosecutors charged 
pellegrini when it was discovered her infant son nathan was born 
with cocaine in his body 
its not that a woman has a right to take cocaine and abuse 
her own body gertner said explaining pellegrinis defense 
what the state cant do is seek to use her status as a pregnant 
woman for additional penalties 
delvecchios ruling has no authority outside plymouth county 
but gertner predicted the 19page decision will sway judges in 
massachusetts and elsewhere 
whenever a judge ventures into a new area and writes something 
this thoughtful it makes a difference gertner said 
there is no familiar bond more intimate and more fundamental 
than that between the mother and the fetus she carries in her 
womb delvecchio wrote this court will not permit the 
destruction of this relationship by the prosecution 
pellegrini was indicted by a plymouth grand jury in september 
1989 on charges of distribution of cocaine to a minor and cocaine 
possession based on the boys medical records authorities 
determined pellegrini must have ingested cocaine shortly before 
nathans birth 
district attorney william omalley said he pursued the case to 
discourage pregnant women from drug abuse 
but delvecchio said education drug treatment and medical care 
are better alternatives 
by imposing criminal sanctions a woman may turn away from 
seeking prenatal care for fear of being discovered she wrote 
geline williams the assistant prosecuting the case said her 
office has not decided whether to pursue the pellegrini case 
further 
williams argued the case fell under legal precedents for 
charging third parties with murder or manslaughter in the death of 
a viable fetus when a pregnant woman is injured or killed

rep bill grant switched to the 
republican party just months after the 1988 elections and democrats 
are out to avenge his treason on nov 6 
republicans see grants reelection bid as a test case if gop 
candidate grant wins in a district where 85 percent of voters are 
democrats other conservatives particularly in the south might 
be enticed to leave 
it would show the national democratic party can vow all this 
retribution and then it comes down to a lot of hot air said gary 
koops spokesman for the national republican congressional 
committee 
the message for other democrats 
i certainly think the conservative democrats who are more in 
tune with the republican party nationally would be more 
comfortable about switching said koops 
democrats want to make an example out of grant 
we dont like party switchers and we would like to send them a 
definite message said howard schloss of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee there hasnt been a referendum 
on the bill grant switch 
grant won reelection as a democrat two years ago in the 
sprawling north florida district a few months later in a rose 
garden ceremony with president bush at his side he converted to 
the gop 
democrats searched for a seasoned candidate to take him on this 
year but couldnt find a big name that prompted decorated vietnam 
veteran douglas pete peterson to make his first bid for office 
for the democrats peterson could help stem a decade of erosion 
in florida republicans now make up 40 percent of registered 
voters their highest total ever in the state the house delegation 
tipped to the republicans for the first time when grant switched 
sides 
it now stands at 118 in favor of the gop rep ileana 
roslehtinen a republican won a special election for the miami 
seat vacated when claude pepper died last year 
grants district one of the largest east of the mississippi 
river is sparsely populated and rural more like alabama and 
georgia than the florida of beach resorts disney world or miami 
vice grants theme is that despite the change in party labels 
hes still a good old boy 
im not about to forget my heritage and my background grant 
says in a campaign tv ad this ground is sacred to us 
grant who has enjoyed campaign visits by president bush vice 
president dan quayle and white house chief of staff john sununu is 
running as a cando washington hand with the contacts to get the 
most for constituents 
grant says he moved to the republican party for the right 
reason i can do the job better now because we have the attention 
of the administration 
as someone told me once people vote for the person not the 
party he said 
with 450000 raised through the end of september grant has 
more than twice as much money as peterson 
peterson who easily defeated youthful attorney bob boyd in the 
sept 4 primary is a retired air force colonel who was shot down 
over north vietnam in 1966 and spent 6 years as a prisoner of war 
hes running as the outsider with proven integrity hoping to 
capitalize on the countrys antiincumbency mood 
pete peterson they wont change him in washington says a 
peterson tv ad that focuses on his years as a pow 
i want to do it as a citizencongressman as opposed to 
somebody whos up there trying to further his political career 
peterson said im not interested in a long political career 
peterson campaign manager jon ausman said hes been somewhat 
disappointed in the money raised by the state and national parties 
were getting a lot of technical assistance which is 
extremely valuable he said theyre not providing the level of 
support you would have been led to expect when they declared this 
the no 1 race in the country 
peterson could never have expected to outspend grant and can run 
better as the lowbudget candidate say schloss and simon ferro 
chairman of the florida democratic party 
hes going to win this race in the trenches ferro said 
the key is telling the voters of grants treason we think 
grants vulnerable 
koops however said the incumbency is a trump card that helps 
neutralize any lingering anger among voters over grants 
conversion 
the democrats underestimated that strength of bill grant he 
said i think he has got an outstanding record that people cant 
quibble with 
no independent polls have handicapped the race but both sides 
say grant is in the lead although a significant percentage of 
voters remain undecided

a radioactive fuel assembly at the indian 
point nuclear power plant was successfully detached wednesday from 
overhead equipment it had become snagged on the utility said 
earlier another fuel assembly was accidentally dropped about 10 
feet 
the two fuel assemblies had been inadvertently extracted from 
the fuel core when they failed to detach from at plate that was 
being removed as the reactor was prepared for refueling 
the new york power authority has said the public never was 
endangered by the mishap at the plant on the hudson river 35 miles 
north of new york city 
the first fuel assembly dropped into a steel basket placed in a 
fuel storage area to receive it tuesday night rather than being 
slowly lowered by special equipment said power authority spokesman 
todd forte 
about 16 workers left the building which is designed to contain 
any radiation they returned when it was determined no radiation 
was released 
workers detached the second fuel assembly from the cover 
wednesday forte said 
the plan to remove the stray assemblies was approved by the 
nuclear regulatory commission 
forte said both assemblies will be inspected by staff from the 
power authority and from westinghouse electric corp which 
designed the reactor before they are moved to the plants fuel 
storage area 
the plant was taken out of service sept 15 for refueling 
maintenance and replacement of lowpressure turbines 
the plnat was scheduled to resume electric generation on 
thanksgiving day weekend utility officials have not determine how 
much delay the fuel assembly problem will cause

rep charles chip pashayan is a 
congressman with two strikes against him 
the sixterm republican incumbent accepted campaign 
contributions from indicted savings and loan figure charles 
keating and hes running against a fourthgeneration farmer in a 
district that covers part of the heavily agricultural san joaquin 
valley 
frankly im running a favorite son race said democrat 
calvin dooley 
dooley say he doesnt believe pashayan provides the 
proactive progressive leadership this valley needs he cannot 
provide leadership independent of his special interests 
only two california incumbents have lost reelection bids to 
congress since 1982 
but pashayans savings and loan involvement combined with a 
general antiincumbent fervor make him the member of congress most 
likely to lose his job in november says a capitol hill newsletter 
roll call 
the rothenberg political trend report said pashayans is one of 
only 20 house elections nationwide in which the party holding the 
seat may change 
pashayan of fresno won easily in 1988 with 71 percent of the 
vote however he since has had negative publicity about the 
campaign contributions from keating and his associates 
one dooley ad told voters we can sit by and let pashayans 
contributors clean out our wallets or we can clean house and change 
congressmen 
although he returned 26000 to keating pashayan has been 
criticized for failing to return 4350 from keating lobbyist 
leonard bickwit pashayan said the bickwit funds are not keating 
money but donations from a longtime friend 
the bush administration is intensely interested in the race 
so far three cabinet secretaries have campaigned for pashayan 
and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter is expected to show up in 
the district before the election 
the district includes all or part of the nations top two 
incomeproducing farm counties fresno and tulare 
despite pashayans vote against the budget compromise president 
bush recently released a 30second commercial urging voters to 
return him to washington 
i voted for what i felt was in the best interests of the 
district and california pashayan said of his vote against the 
budget compromise this is just one enormous struggle because 
congress is attempting to make an enormous solution to an enormous 
problem 
dooley has accused pashayan of being an ineffective congressman 
and aligning himself with corporate farming interests at the 
expense of family farmers 
we have to have government that is responsive to the people 
that requires that your elected officials have to live at a higher 
standard than the general populace dooley said 
house speaker tom foley has virtually assured dooley a seat on 
the agriculture committee if he defeats pashayan rep beryl 
anthony chairman of the democratic congressional campaign 
committee said he supports dooleys bid for the committee 
assignment because it is critical to the valleys economy 
dooley has criticized pashayan for not sitting on the 
agriculture committee and pointed out that he has only sponsored 
one piece of legislation that has been signed into law the 1986 
bill authorized the interior secretary to let southern california 
edison co continue its contract on a hydroelectric plant in 
sequoia national park

the 1990 farm bill worked out by a 
housesenate conference committee is meeting lukewarm acceptance at 
best and downright rejection at worst from farm organizations 
the bill was somewhat disappointing rob nooter lobbyist 
for the american farm bureau federation said wednesday he said 
his organization has not decided whether to endorse the package 
the compromise was approved in conference early tuesday and 
requires adoption by the full senate and house 
its more poison than antidote for the struggling rural 
sector said the national farmers union which is urging 
rejection 
nfu president leland swenson said the budgetcutting provisions 
in the bill will slice farm income as much as they lower the 
federal deficit 
its really ironic that congress can pass farm law that 
practically mandates rural devastation swenson said 
the bill contains a rural development package to help businesses 
in communities losing their farm base expand with special loans 
based on federal matching funds 
it also would establish satellite hookups for rural schools with 
educational programs in urban areas and rural hospitals with 
bigcity health centers 
but some view the budgetcutting provisions as so damaging to 
rural economy that the development package wont matter much 
the bill is a disaster for family farmers and for recent 
cooperation between farmers and environmentalists said randolph 
nodland president of the national family farm coalition 
this bill is guaranteed to drive farm income down and restrict 
farmers access to affordable credit he said further the cut 
in base acreage tells farmers to get out of the program if not out 
of farming 
the key to saving the 136 billion from agriculture programs 
forced on the conference committee by deficitreduction mandates is 
the socalled triple base program 
under the plan farmers will have to reduce their subsidized 
acreage by 15 percent those acres could be used for anything but 
growing fruits and vegetables giving farmers the opportunity to 
grow for consumer demands rather than the governmentprotected 
programs 
proponents of the system say it could actually earn farmers more 
money than government dependency if they plant wisely 
another big chunk of government savings comes from calculating 
deficiency payments over 12 months instead of five this will start 
in 1994 
nodland said the 15 percent cut in subsidized acreage and change 
in computation of deficiency payments will encourage farmers to 
leave the government programs which are strictly voluntary and 
require conservation efforts 
this triplebase proposal comes at a very bad time said 
sen bob kerrey dneb who served on the conference committee 
a triplebase on lets say a hundred bushelperacre corn 
operation by our calculations is about 15anacre reduction in 
income for the producer 
combined with increased production costs caused by rising oil 
prices farmers will experience a 35 to 40 cashflow reduction 
per acre kerrey said 
this bill makes tough but fair budget decisions said senate 
agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy dvt who chaired 
the conference the major increases in flexibility will give 
farmers greater freedom to plant the crops that are best for their 
farm 
other savings measures in the bill include 
maximum acreage reduction of 20 percent for wheat and feed 
grains 25 percent for cotton and 35 percent for rice the 
agriculture secretary has the discretion to reduce acreage as 
needed to control excess stocks 
frozen target prices of 4 per bushel for wheat 274 for 
corn 261 for grain sorghum 236 for barley 145 for oats 
79 a pound for cotton 1071 per hundredweight for rice 
in 1994 and 1995 deficiency payments on wheat feed grains and 
rice computed on a 12month basis instead of the current five 
months 
price support for wheat and feed grains of 85 percent of a 
fiveyear moving price with the agriculture secretary given the 
discretion to drop the loan rate by up to 20 percent 
an 18cent loan rate for sugar 
an assessment on dairy producers if government purchases exceed 
7 billion pounds 
soybean nonrecourse marketing loan of 502 a bushel with a 2 
percent service charge 
tighter payment limitations on wool and honey programs capping 
the loans at 75000 per producer 
service charges of 1 percent on loans for dairy sugar 
tobacco wool mohair and honey

jurors sent the wrong message on gun 
owners responsibilities by acquitting a hunter of manslaughter in 
the shooting death of a woman he mistook for a deer relatives of 
the victim said 
theres going to be blood on their hands if someone else in 
maine dies under similar circumstances gerry veninsky brother of 
karen wood said after the jury cleared donald rogerson on 
wednesday 
its not a hunting issue its not a gunrights issue its 
responsibility and accountability veninsky said 
rogerson 47 a supermarket produce manager from bangor shot 
wood in the chest as she walked in woods 130 feet behind her home 
in hermon in 1988 the 37yearold mother of twin yearold girls 
had moved from iowa four months earlier 
rogerson the lone defense witness testified tuesday that he 
fired after he spotted what he thought was a deer through the scope 
of his rifle he said he apparently mistook the womans white 
mittens for a deers white tail 
the superior court jury reached its verdict after nine hours of 
deliberations rogerson could have received up to 20 years in 
prison if convicted 
im very overwhelmed at this time he said i hope and 
pray the lord will give mr wood the strength he has given me 
through this whole ordeal 
the case had pitted hunters against nonhunters and newcomers 
against oldtimers in maine where hunting is a way of life maine 
sells more than 200000 hunting licenses each year 
the states top wildlife official said the verdict made no 
social statement about maine and hunting 
the verdict makes it clear that the jury feels it was an 
accident said william j vail commissioner of the department of 
inland fisheries and wildlife accidents are accidents it was 
a tragedy on both sides 
members of rogersons family embraced after the verdict mrs 
woods husband kevin who now lives in bettendorf iowa said he 
was stunned 
perhaps people outside the state of maine will view this as i 
do that donald rogerson was criminally negligent in killing my 
wife he said his voice breaking 
some critics had suggested that mrs wood was at fault for 
wearing the mittens during hunting season and that because she was 
from away from another state she was ignorant of maines 
hunting tradition 
when you are from here the rules are ingrained in you as a 
child hermon resident joanna payne said i wouldnt come out 
here during deer season you just have to know that 
the victims sister rejected such notions any one that would 
think karen is to blame would be foolish lets face facts if she 
couldnt be in her own back yard where are you safe said sharon 
veninsky 
jurors declined to comment 
this year hebron a town of about 5000 is giving residents 
red warning signs that advise hunters they are approaching 
residential areas nearly 100 people have signed up for the 
firstever hunting safety course held in the town 
defense attorney lewis vafiades said rogerson hasnt hunted 
since the shooting and probably never will 
rogerson was arrested the evening of the shooting but a grand 
jury concluded that his actions were neither negligent nor 
reckless 
prosecutors reopened the case in 1989 after a portland tv 
station reported that a nephew of rogersons attorney had served on 
the grand jury a second grand jury indicted rogerson that year

the government is protesting a us decision 
to embargo mexican tuna and says the restriction could complicate 
the two countries move toward a free trade agreement 
the united states advised mexico on monday that it was forced to 
halt mexican tuna imports because of a finding by a california 
court that mexicos tuna fishermen kill too many dolphins 
fisheries secretary maria de los angeles moreno called the 
embargo exaggerated and said it constitutes a nontax trade 
barrier that could complicate trade talks between presidents bush 
and carlos salinas de gortari next month 
mexican officials have said that they hope by the end of 1991 to 
negotiate a trade agreement similar to the one the united states 
signed with canada last year 
a federal court in san francisco ruled on oct 10 that mexicos 
tuna catch the second largest after the us fleets violates the 
1988 marine mammal protection law which limits the number of 
dolphins that can be killed in tuna fishing 
moreno said the us commerce department had assured her it will 
appeal the ruling within the next 10 days 
we hope that since we are on the best of terms and seeking a 
free trade agreement that will be positive for the tuna embargo 
moreno said 
earlier the fisheries department issued a statement contending 
that parts of the us law were unilateral lack scientific 
foundation are discriminatory run counter to the principles of 
international accords on trade and limit coastal countries 
exercise of sovereign rights in their exclusive economic zones 
the federal court ruling overturned a sept 7 finding by the 
commerce department that mexicos marine mammal program provides 
dolphin protection comparable to that of us law 
in april the three largest tuna canners in the united states 
distributors of starkist bumblebee and chicken of the sea brands 
said they would stop buying and selling tuna captured with 
dolphins 
that decision has meant a 15 percent loss of exports by mexican 
tuna producers felipe charat of the national fishing industry 
chamber told the government news agency notimex 
in june mexican officials prohibited night tuna fishing to cut 
down on the number of dolphins caught along with tuna 
dolphins are airbreathing mammals and swim alongside tuna 
schools they painfully suffocate to death when inadvertently 
caught in large purse nets commonly used in tuna fishing 
the fisheries department said wednesday that mexican dolphin 
captures have been reduced 70 percent since 1986 
operation of the mexican tuna fleet would no longer be 
economically viable if the levels and percentages established in 
the arbitrary us legislation were met the department said 
mexicos tuna fleet captures about 150000 tons a year half of 
which is exported 
about 14000 tons are normally sold annually to the united 
states but the amount dropped to 3000 tons this year when mexican 
authorities faced with possible us sanctions instructed tuna 
fishermen to seek other markets 
the united states imposed an embargo on mexican tuna in 1980 in 
retaliation for mexicos declaration of a 200mile offshore 
economic zone that prohibited us boats from fishing for tuna in 
its waters without a permit 
that embargo lasted six years

hes 55 with a slight paunch saltandpepper 
hair and a penchant for bologna sandwiches and cowboy hats hes in 
the federal witness protection program or maybe producing 
movies or driving an 18wheeler 
hes elvis in the 90s 
or so says gail brewergiorgio author of the bestselling is 
elvis alive shes back with the elvis files her latest look 
at the phenomenon shes helped create about elvis presley and his 
alleged death 13 years ago 
the folks at graceland say elvis remains buried at his memphis 
tourist attraction biographer albert goldman maintains presley 
committed suicide elvis hairstylist best man personal cook and 
memphis mafia sidekicks all in books of their own confirm the 
king is gone 
gail is not convinced 
the possibility of elvis presleys being alive is greater now 
than it was a year ago two years ago and i am not alone in that 
belief brewergiorgio writes in the new book 
she goes so far as to guess via a letter from one true 
believer when elvis will make his comeback ag 16 1993 the 
16th anniversary of his excursion to that graceland in the sky 
brewergiorgio is right about one thing shes not alone seven 
percent of americans in a 1989 cbs news poll said they believed 
elvis was alive most of them apparently sent the author 
unsolicited accounts of their firstperson encounters with the king 
of rock n roll 
theres gas station attendant alton r who lives outside 
nashville 
i was talking on the telephone to my mother when a man stopped 
in for gas as he approached the store to pay for his purchase i 
told my mother i think this man is elvis presley he turned 
to me smiled with that same crooked smile and winked and left 
without a word i am convinced that elvis was in my presence that 
night says alton 
a woman named sunny of jonesboro ga says she received a 
bologna sandwich and a bag of cheetos from e during an october 
1987 visit to the air force museum in dayton ohio a missouri man 
spotted elvis on the second floor at graceland earlier that year 
the book contains divergent tales of elvis musical tastes a 
seattle woman says she spotted a bearded elvis in a cowboy hat 
checking out the competition at a rolling stones concert while a 
michigan man says the king was inspecting old monkees albums at the 
lakeside mall 
elvis told that same michigander that he owned an old english 
sheepdog and an airedale later in an alleged telephone 
conversation with brewergiorgio elvis drops several bombshells 
elvis attended his daughters oct 3 1988 wedding 
hes disappointed with the way things are in society today 
when i was a kid people treated me cruelly but they were nicer 
back then compared to today the maybe king says on the tape 
which comes with the book 
he hangs out in washington dc 
the last ties in with one of brewergiorgios pet theories 
elvis like wiseguy henry hill was forced into the federal 
witness protection program for his own safety presley who had 14 
prescription drugs in his system at death could have been targeted 
for his work as a federal drug agent she suggests 
the possibility of elvis working at orion pictures they did the 
film great balls of fire about buddy jerry lee lewis is also 
raised as is the possibility that he could be back driving trucks 
he is often reported talking to folks via cb 
but the last word comes from an oglivie minn woman who asked 
her local postmaster to explain why there was no elvis presley 
stamp the anonymous federal employee provided this ominous 
response 
for a person to be on a postage stamp he has to be dead the 
government is not sure elvis is dead

after shunning the us grain market since 
last spring the soviet union once again is buying corn just as 
american farmers are harvesting a bumper crop 
agriculture department officials said wednesday that private 
exporting companies sold 350000 metric tons to the soviets under 
terms of the current longterm supply agreement between the two 
countries no prices or other details were disclosed 
the pact including a threemonth extension expires dec 31 a 
new fiveyear agreement will begin at that time 
although the soviet union recently bought some us soybean 
meal it had not purchased significant quantities of wheat or corn 
since may usda officials have speculated that moscow delayed 
purchases to see how 1990 harvests turned out in both the soviet 
union and the united states 
other factors mentioned have included russian hard currency 
problems the direction of us farm legislation and whether the 
united states might extend credit 
rumors have circulated in the grain trade for weeks that the 
soviet union was or soon would be in the market for more us corn 
market prices have been under pressure from this falls huge 
harvest estimated by usda at 802 billion bushels up 7 percent 
from the 1989 crop 
a big question is whether the relatively modest corn purchase 
was the start of another substantial round of buying by moscow or 
simply a oneshot deal in the past the soviets have bought us 
grain every few months usually in a series of purchases over 
several days or a week 
large sales to foreign buyers must be reported daily to usda by 
exporters 
sales of wheat and corn to the soviet union for delivery during 
the year that ended sept 30 totaled 203 million tons including 
nearly 165 million tons of corn and more than 38 million tons of 
wheat 
in addition the soviets in 198990 bought 342300 tons of 
soybeans 137 million tons of soybean meal and 7300 tons of 
barley 
the 350000 tons reported wednesday were the first for the 
threemonth extended period although soybean meal sales amount to 
355000 tons 
a metric ton of 2205 pounds is equivalent to 394 bushels of 
corn thus the 350000 tons would be about 138 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 223 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usdas fiveday average thus the latest 
sale could have a farm value of about 31 million 
 
washington ap a swarm of africanized honeybees thought to 
be the first to enter the united states naturally from mexico was 
destroyed this week according to the agriculture department 
the swarm was detected near hidalgo texas james w glosser 
administrator of the departments animal and plant health 
inspection service said wednesday 
glosser said the africanized honeybees were found by department 
officials monday during a regular check of traps baited with a 
chemical sex lure to attract and capture migrating swarms 
the swarm was destroyed and samples of the insects were 
identified by the departments agricultural research service 
laboratory in weslaco texas as the africanized variety 
africanized honeybees are hybrid offspring of african bees 
brought to brazil in 1956 some escaped and mated with native bees 
their descendants have been moving north since that time 
the africanized bee can be aggressive when threatened and swarm 
quickly against an intruder this characteristic has contributed to 
their notoriety as killer bees which usda officials have 
blamed on horror movies and exaggerated news reports 
although this is the first time we have trapped a natural 
introduction of africanized honeybees in the united states we have 
intercepted and eliminated swarms artificially introduced on 
ships arriving from south and central america many times since 
1979 glosser said 
bee experts say it is uncertain how fast the bees spread but 
estimates range from 100 to 300 miles a year 
to the unaided eye africanized bees look like other honeybees 
the agriculture department says the only way to tell is through 
microscopic examination 
 
washington ap new projections by the agriculture department 
show that rising energy costs from the mideast crisis will add 
greatly to the expense of operating the nations farms next year 
if the world price of crude oil averages 30 per barrel instead 
of an earlier usda projection of 2090 farm expenses for diesel 
fuel gasoline liquefied petroleum gas and electricity will rise 
10 to 15 percent a report said wednesday 
and if the crude oil price in 1991 is 40 per barrel as it is 
now farm energy expenses would go up around 25 percent 
in 1990 the report said farm energy costs will increase only 
slightly to about 72 billion 
this represents a modest gain in total cropland acres planted 
and harvested and a slight increase in the number of acres 
irrigated coupled with higher refined petroleum product prices in 
the later part of the year the departments economic research 
service said 
overall energy costs are expected to account for about 62 
percent of total cash production expenses this year

vietnam is promising to increase cooperation 
with the united states on obtaining an accounting of american 
servicemen still missing 17 years after us forces were withdrawn 
from that country 
vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach met wednesday with 
the president bushs special envoy for the mia issue retired army 
gen john vessey and both were in an upbeat mood afterward 
he has agreed to all the proposals i made and we agreed to the 
proposals that he has made vessey said with thach standing at 
his side 
later thach said there are no divergencies we will have 
much closer cooperation on this issue he added that both sides 
agreed to accelerate their efforts to locate missing americans 
the subject matter was limited to the nearly 1700 missing 
americans but the meeting clearly had political overtones 
for thach his invitation to visit washington was a breakthrough 
in that no vietnamese foreign minister had come here since hanoi 
became independent from france in 1954 
vessey a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
technical cooperation for joint investigations was agreed to as 
well as ways to seek information and to return the remains of us 
servicemen 
he said the first priority will be given to the socalled 
discrepancy cases these involve americans who were last seen 
alive but have nonetheless never been accounted for 
thach offered assurances there are no american servicemen in 
vietnamese custody but he allowed for the possibility that some 
might still be alive in a remote region without the knowledge of 
the government 
a joint team will be formed to examine the specifics of the new 
forms of cooperation vessey said also participating in the 
discussions was anne mills griffiths head of the national league 
of families which represents relatives of missing americans 
mrs griffiths said the results of wednesdays meeting remain to 
be seen but she expressed optimism about the outcome 
before the meeting mrs griffiths had said cases involving 
hundreds of missing americans could be resolved if the vietnamese 
attitude were more responsive 
after meeting with vessey and attending a luncheon that included 
highlevel state department officials thach had separate meetings 
with the foreign affairs committees of the senate and house 
he suggested that the two countries should put the bitterness of 
their wartime rivalry behind them 
i believe there will be normal relations because abnormal 
relations is abnormal said thach one of the architects of the 
1973 agreement that led to the withdrawal of us forces from 
vietnam more than 55000 americans died there 
the united states has linked the establishment of 
usvietnamese diplomatic relations to hanois cooperation on mias 
and on obtaining a settlement to the civil war in neighboring 
cambodia 
thachs groundbreaking visit is consistent with a pattern of 
improving relations that dates back to july when the bush 
administration agreed to open discussions with vietnam for the 
first time on resolving the conflict in cambodia 
earlier usvietnamese contacts had been limited to 
humanitarian issues

senate documents show sens alan cranston 
donald w riegle jr and dennis deconcini had more extensive 
dealings with the owner of the failed lincoln savings and loan than 
previously acknowledged 
in one of the documents cranston thanks exlincoln head charles 
h keating jr for a 250000 contribution to a pet political 
cause in the same memo the senator expresses pleasure that 
keatings meeting with the chief thrift regulator had gone so 
well 
the senate ethics committee documents obtained by the 
associated press are expected to play a major role in the panels 
deliberations beginning today on whether to intensify the 
investigation of the three senators part of the socalled 
keating five 
committee counsel robert s bennett has recommended advancing 
the investigation against cranston dcalif riegle dmich and 
deconcini dariz while dropping the investigation of sens john 
mccain rariz and john glenn dohio a committee decision was 
not expected today 
some of the documents show 
riegles march 1987 visit to keatings major company a month 
before he met with banking regulators on lincolns behalf had a 
fundraising purpose the senator previously contended the visit was 
just a brief stop to meet the employees 
keatings fundraising efforts for riegle in the two months 
before all five senators met with regulators were far more 
extensive than previously known 
a former top us banking regulator roger f martin said that 
just weeks before the government seized irvine califbased 
lincoln in april 1989 he received highly unusual calls from 
cranston and deconcini at his unlisted home number urging sale of 
lincoln rather than a takeover cranstons call came after 10 pm 
and deconcinis at 530 am the next morning 
it sounded to me as if they were reading from the same script 
or memo martin told the committee 
deconcini assisted keating in his crusade to have former top 
thrift regulator edwin j gray removed from the examination of 
lincoln after gray left office the senator wrote keating maybe 
things will change now that he is gone i sure hope so 
another document shows an application to lincoln that identifies 
cranston as a prospective borrower in september 1986 cranston 
spokesman murray flander said the application was for a line of 
credit in case cranston needed more money in the closing days of 
his 1986 reelection campaign flander said the credit line was 
never used 
it was known previously that keating and associates gave 13 
million to the campaigns and favored causes of the five senators 
the ethics committee is trying to determine whether there was a 
connection between keatings contributions to the senators and the 
help he received from them as lincoln headed toward collapse 
the takeover of lincoln could cost taxpayers more than 2 
billion but keating insisted he was treated unfairly by us 
regulators 
flander said cranstons latenight call on the sale of lincoln 
was an attempt to save jobs and taxpayer bailout expense he said 
cranston never said they should make the sale regardless of 
whether it met the criteria 
the spokesman added there was no connection between any money 
raised by cranston and contacts with regulators by keating or the 
senator 
deconcini spokesman robert maynes said the arizona democrat is 
following his lawyers advice not to comment and unfortunately is 
not in a position to defend himself maynes deplored leaks of 
documents which he said could be taken out of context 
riegle aide david krawitz said the senator was bound by the 
committees request for confidentiality but is confident that his 
conduct was proper and ethical at all times 
riegles trip to keatings major company american continental 
corp of phoenix came a month before riegle and his four senate 
colleagues met on april 9 1987 with the federal regulators who 
were examining lincoln 
the senators public statement issued last november did not 
mention that deconcinis main arizona fundraiser earl katz went 
along the senators personal itinerary said no discussion of 
money earl will collect what needs to be collected later 
the documents show that in the month before riegle and the other 
senators met with regulators there was an extensive fundraising 
operation for riegle it was led by keating deconcini and katz 
an oct 6 1987 memo from cranston to keating coupled the 
subjects of keatings donations and a cranstonassisted effort to 
ensure better treatment for lincoln savings from federal 
regulators 
cranston wrote that he was pleased to hear that your meeting 
with danny wall then the top thrift regulator had gone so well 
in the same memo cranston said he was very grateful for your 
willingness to contribute 250000 this year to voter 
registration projects for which the senator solicited money 
deconcinis help for keating over a fiveyear period was 
detailed in memos from his staff 
one memo dated march 10 1988 said keating first contacted 
deconcini about his problems with gray in june 1984 
a confidential internal memo from a deconcini staffer to the 
senator on dec 20 1988 mentioned that in july 1985 the senator 
had phone conversations with both don regan then white house 
chief of staff and secretary james baker then secretary of the 
treasury re gray 
they share ddcs deconcinis assessment that gray is a 
problem although no action was promised the memo said

the house is moving to shift us policy in 
angola by cutting off covert lethal aid to antigovernment rebels 
if steps are made toward a peaceful end to the countrys 15year 
war 
but the lawmakers acting after an unusual fivehour public 
debate wednesday on the technically secret program rejected a move 
to stop the aid immediately 
rep stephen solarz dny said the conditional aid cutoff he 
sponsored would turn the united states from a policy of continued 
war to a policy of a creative search for peace in the southwest 
african nation 
the house voted 213200 for the amendment which would suspend 
the lethal portion of us aid to the unita rebels if the countrys 
marxist government agrees to a ceasefire sets a timetable for 
free and fair elections and the soviet union halts weapons 
deliveries 
rep henry hyde rill used a parliamentary gambit to demand a 
second vote on the issue after administration officials sought to 
turn around republican votes but the solarz amendment survived 
207206 with house speaker thomas foley dramatically casting the 
deciding vote from the chair 
in a related move the house also accepted on a voice vote an 
amendment by rep bill richardson dnm to convert a 13 million 
covert aid program for cambodias noncommunist resistance into an 
overt program once a political settlement to the conflict is 
achieved 
the cambodia vote and the open debate on angolas lethal aid 
program were evidence of congress increasing disenchantment with 
covert paramilitary operations that many see as relics of the cold 
war 
there is declining support for these efforts solarz said a 
statement underscored by senate intelligence committee cuts earlier 
this year in support for covert wars in cambodia and afghanistan 
and in an interview with the associated press central 
intellgence agency director william webster acknowledged wednesday 
that there is public and economic pressure on the united states and 
the soviets to abandon such proxy wars in the third world he 
predicted that such conflicts will wind down to our mutual 
advantage 
sources say the united states contributes about 60 million in 
covert aid annually to unita the portuguese acronym for the 
national union for the total independence of angola that compares 
with about 500 million the soviets give the popular movement for 
the liberation of angola the marxist group that controls the 
government 
the sources say the primary reason for making the operation 
covert is to provide cover for neighboring zaire which cooperates 
with the united states in funneling aid to unita 
secretary of state james a baker iii in a letter circulated on 
capitol hill argued against cuts in any of the covert paramilitary 
operations saying that to do so would disrupt efforts to achieve 
diplomatic solutions 
we have come a long way but we are not there yet baker 
wrote i firmly believe that now is not the time for us to reduce 
our support for these initiatives these programs have made a 
critical contribution to bringing each of these conflicts closer to 
a negotiated settlement 
covert operations are only a tiny part of the overall 
intelligence bill which authorizes us intelligence activities 
around the world from spy satellites to military threat assessments 
and economic analysis the house version now goes to a conference 
with the senate to work out differences between the two versions 
while most of the bill is secret it is believed to authorize 
spending in the neighborhood of 30 billion most of which is 
hidden in the pentagon budget 
it includes authorization for operations of the central 
intelligence agency the defense intelligence agency the national 
security agency which electronically spies on the world the 
national reconnaissance office which is building and launching a 
new generation of radarimaging spy satellites 
the report accompanying the house bill notes that the 
intelligence budget is growing more slowly than in the past decade 
and that the bill provides a 1991 spending level lower than 
president bush asked

scientists have rushed to southern texas 
to thwart the nations first invasion of killer bees across the 
mexican border 
officials on wednesday slapped a quarantine on all bees in the 
area to keep the fierce africanized killer bees from wiping out 
much of the domestically raised variety which produces more honey 
and pollinates valuable crops 
a swarm of the africanized bees was trapped monday near the 
border city of hidalgo in the lower rio grande valley said anita 
collins head researcher with the us department of agricultures 
honey bee research lab in weslaco 
the swarm was later confirmed to be killer bees she said to 
the unaided eye they look like other honeybees they must be 
identified under the microscope 
scientists headed to the area to check for africanized bees in 
all managed hives and to look for any other wild swarms said john 
g thomas extension entomologist with the texas agricultural 
extension service at college station 
africanized bees hybrids descended from docile european bees 
and a vigorous african species earned the killer nickname 
because of their highly defensive behavior upn a perceived threat 
to their nests hundreds of the bees have been known to attack 
intruders and chase them for long distances 
their sting is no worse than that of european bees commonly 
raised in the americas but their persistence and swarm attacks 
make them more dangerous several hundred people in latin america 
have been killed by the bees 
the killer bees first escaped from a breeding experiment in 
brazil in 1957 and have rapidly expanded their range since 
several stowaway swarms have been trapped at us ports aboard 
ships from latin america and one swarm arrived in california 
aboard a truck 
the bees trapped monday are the first known to have made it to 
the border on their own said james w glosser administrator of 
usdas animal and plant health inspection service 
scientists have expected them since a swarm was trapped last 
november about 150 miles south of brownsville in the mexican border 
state of tamaulipas hundreds of traps were placed to detect bees 
crossing the border 
ms collins said the swarm caught monday was taken alive in a 
trap baited with a natural chemical sex lure known as a pheromone 
under the states emergency plan beekeepers and farmers wont 
be allowed to move bees beyond a twomile radius of where the swarm 
was trapped 
agriculture officials worry about the impact killer bees are 
more difficult to manage than european ones which have lost much 
of their fighting spirit through centuries of breeding for 
agriculture 
the usda has estimated that the africanization of us bees

leftist rebels attacked air 
force headquarters on wednesday night and apparently engaged troops 
in several other sections of the capital authorities said a number 
of people were wounded 
an official of the military press office said the guerrillas 
attacked the air force headquarters located in the citys eastern 
sector near ilopango air base with automatic weapons and homemade 
mortars 
an air force mechanic was wounded and one aircraft damaged said 
the official who spoke by telephone and insisted on anonymity 
he gave no details and said the situation is now under the 
control of the armed forces 
however reporters also heard explosions and exchanges of 
gunfire in the poor neighborhood of soyapango on the citys east 
side and in delgado to the northeast 
the red cross said several people were wounded in fighting but 
a spokesman said he did not know how many or have other details 
reporters touring the streets saw army helicopters dropping 
flares and firing with automatic weapons at suspected guerrilla 
positions near ilopango and at other points in the city 
guerrilla leaders and representatives of president alfredo 
cristianis rightist government have been negotiating 
unsuccessfully for more than a year to end the decadeold civil 
war 
but so far the talks have ended in deadlock with the guerrillas 
of the farabundo marti national liberation front insisting the 
military should be drastically reduced in numbers and officers who 
violated human rights be prosecuted 
the cristiani government has balked at these requests saying it 
would be tantamount to doing away with the armed forces 
human rights groups estimate more than 73000 people have been 
killed in the war in this country the size of massachusetts with a 
populaltion of 5 million 
in november the guerrillas launched their biggest offensive 
ever in the capital it was repulsed after two weeks leaving about 
2500 people dead

invading rival tadeusz mazowieckis 
territory in whirlwind campaigning lech walesa told the people of 
pollutiondevastated krakow that as president he would work to 
protect its historic monuments 
he also invited 20000 cheering suporters in the citys 
historic market square to join him in governing poland 
as i was able to overcome communism together with you now i 
am inviting you to help with building a new system he said 
wednesday 
mazowiecki the countrys prime minister chose krakow to kick 
off his campaign sunday 
but walesa arriving in the city three days later appeared to 
receive an equally hearty reception and a much larger crowd than 
any that appeared for the prime minister 
he told workers at sendzimir steel mill in nowa huta formerly 
called the lenin steel mill that their plant might have to close 
in part because of the pollution it causes but other work must be 
found for the 28000 employees 
walesa traveled from his industrial home city of gdansk to 
krakow the former royal capital in southern poland that has served 
as the political base for mazowiecki a former walesa adviser who 
now opposes him in nov 25 presidential elections 
mazowiecki officially registered as a candidate for president 
wednesday by the national election commission edited the 
krakowbased monthly wiez for decades and is linked politically to 
the citys progressive catholic znak publishing house 
at his hourlong market square rally walesa was applauded after 
nearly every answer offered to questions shouted from the crowd at 
the end almost everyone raised their hand when he asked who would 
vote for him next month 
i can see i will build poland with you walesa responded 
walesa met for 30 minutes with invited krakow intellectuals at 
the national museum and appealed for agreement with the 
faction that has largely left his workerbased union and rallied 
around mazowiecki 
passing through the city i felt the strength of workers and 
here i want to feel the strength of your minds i want to be wise 
with your wisdom and strong with your strength he said 
walesa earlier received an honorary citizenship of the city 
conferred by city president jacek wozniakowski a znak colleague of 
mazowiecki and the father of mazowieckis campaign director 
in nowa huta walesa said the jobs the steelmaking district 
provides are important but the pollution it spews threatens the 
city itself 
everyone must stop and think because 28000 people are 
employed here walesa said those 28000 people must have jobs 
lets sit down and find something i dont believe there is no 
solution 
at city hall walesa told city council members and a crowd that 
packed the building i promise to do everything in my power to 
prevent the devastation of krakows great monuments 
krakow was polands capital until the end of the 16th century 
its medieval monuments include wawel castle and cathedral with 
the tombs of kings queens and national heroes like tadeusz 
kosciuszko writer adam mickiewicz and marshal jozef pilsudski 
pollutants from the industrial silesia region and the nowa huta 
mill built by the communists in the 1950s to bring a large 
workingclass to bourgeois krakow have corroded much of the 
centuriesold sculpture and stonework 
walesa laid flowers and knelt in prayer at a simple metal cross 
monument in nowa huta to honor bogdan wlosik a teenage protester 
beaten to death in 1982 in a killing blamed on police during the 
martiallaw period 
the sacrifice of this life will not be wasted walesa told 
wlosiks parents 
crowds waited for walesa at each stop chanting lech walesa 
lech walesa and solidarnosc 
the city hall was decorated with banners hailing walesa and a 
band greeted him playing a new song set to an old folk melody 
long live lech walesa long live solidarity

civil rights forces say president bush will 
unleash widespread anger among minorities and women if he arries 
out his promise to veto a job discrimination bill on grounds it 
would encourage hiring quotas 
if the president vetoes the civil rights act there will be a 
firestorm of protest civil rights advocate ralph neas said 
wednesday after the house approved the bill 273154 and sent it 
to the president 
the aye votes fell just short of the twothirds margin sponsors 
would need to override a veto it was the second such 
disappointment for civil rights forces in as many days 
the senate approved the bill tuesday but also was a handful of 
votes short of a vetoproof margin 
bush is expected to veto the measure and return it to capitol 
hill with an alternative version he would be willing to sign but 
the chances of winning approval for an alternative version this 
year appeared all but nil 
the measure is aimed at overturning six job discrimination 
rulings that created a furor when the supreme court issued them 
last year 
it would ban racial harassment in the workplace and allow 
punitive damages in the most serious discrimination cases 
the fiercest disputes however have come over fine print 
changing complex rules on how job discrimination cases would 
decided they would make it easier for minorities to win lawsuits 
and harder for employers to defend themselves 
bush said tuesday in a letter to sen slade gorton rwash he 
would be compelled to veto the bill because it would force 
employers to adopt hiring quotas 
the measure says it does not require or encourage the use of 
quotas but critics say it would lead to them all the same its 
not what the label says its whats in the bottle said rep 
henry j hyde rill 
critics say employers would feel so vulnerable to lawsuits that 
they would turn to quotas as a readymade defense 
it is easy for employers to hide behind this false hue and cry 
of quotas said sen edward m kennedy dmass but anyone who 
takes an independent and objective look at this bill will see at a 
glance that the quota argument is a sham 
sponsors picked up just one additional house vote since aug 3 
when an earlier version of the measure was approved 
were somewhat disappointed because we had hoped that the 
additional compromises that were made since the vote last time 
would have picked up some votes said william taylor a longtime 
washington civil rights advocate 
taylor said that if bush carried out his veto threat i think 
theres going to be a great anger 
business critics of the bill were plainly in an upbeat mood 
us chamber of commerce official frederick j krebs issued a 
statement saying the bill balkanizes and tribalizes our nation 
rather than addressing the real problems facing many minorities 
today education and drugs 
fortunately there were sufficient no votes in both the 
house and senate to sustain the veto promised by the president 
krebs said this is the silver lining 
but rep john lewis dga a prominent civil rights leader 
during the 1960s wrote a note to bush recalling that he had been 
beaten and jailed more than 40 times why because i dared to 
exercise my rights as an american citizen and i happen to be 
black 
as one who has tasted the bitter fruit of racism and been 
victimized by discrimination and racial violence i appeal to you 
to sign the civil rights act of 1990 lewis said it is the 
right thing for you to do

there will be fewer commercials on childrens 
television shows under a new law that president bush said he does 
not especially like but nonetheless declined to block 
bush said wednesday that he wholeheartedly backs the goals of 
the childrens television act of 1990 but that he objects to 
provisions that he believes infringe on first amendment rights of 
free speech 
thus he said he would not sign the bill but neither would he 
veto it allowing it to become law today without his signature 
the new rules will limit commercials on childrens television 
shows to 10 minutes for each hour of childrens programming on 
weekends and 12 minutes an hour on weekdays 
congressional critics said some stations now allow 13 minutes to 
17 minutes of advertising during each hour of childrens 
programming 
the president said he had constitutional questions about the 
bills requirement that stations provide educational programming as 
well as the limits on commercials 
this bill is intended to increase the amount and quality of 
childrens television programming and to diminish the 
commercialization of programming for children he said in a 
statement 
but while lauding the intent he said he regretted that congress 
has chosen inappropriate means of attaining admirable goals 
a childrens advocacy group criticized bushs refusal to sign 
the bill peggy charren president of action for childrens 
television noted his previous pledges to boost american education 
one would have thought that the education president would 
embrace a measure that gives the tv industry an incentive to become 
a partner in the education of this nations young people charren 
said from her organizations cambridge mass headquarters 
bush said he particularly disliked applying commercial 
restrictions to cable stations which he views as analagous to 
the print media under the first amendment 
another section requires that applicants for tv station licenses 
provide educational programming specifically designed for children 
the justice department had recommended that the president veto 
any bill containing that provision as an unconstitutional intrusion 
into program content 
although bush rejected the recommendation he said in his 
statement wednesday the first amendment does not contemplate 
that government will dictate the quality or quantity of what 
americans should hear rather it leaves this to be decided by free 
media responding to the free choices of individual consumers 
he said a constitutional challenge to the law might force the 
supreme court to reconsider its current upholding of contentbased 
regulations on broadcast license holders 
further bush said the limits on commercials cannot 
reasonably be expected to advance their intended purpose 
because childrens tv is financed by advertising he said the 
quality of programming could actually be diminished by curtailment 
of advertising 
the house and senate last month approved the bill without 
dissent 
it effectively reverses president reagans 1984 deregulation of 
the commercial content of childrens tv programming reagan vetoed 
congressional legislation similar to the bill that bush allowed to 
become law 
before the deregulation broadcasters followed industry 
guidelines allowing 12 minutes per hour on weekdays and 9 minutes 
per hour on weekend days 
the new rules require the federal communications commission in 
renewing the licenses of television stations to weigh how well 
broadcasters are serving the educational and informational needs of 
children 
they also require the fcc to complete an inquiry into 
commercialization guidelines for childrens television this 
provision is targeted at programs featuring toy characters brought 
to life 
the legislation sets up a federally funded national endowment 
for childrens educational television to subsidize the production 
of childrens programming the endowment will receive 2 million in 
1991 and 4 million the next year

burglars breaking into a danish 
liferaft factory drew a little unwanted attention setting off an 
alarm heard across scandinavia 
they accidentally tripped an emergency transmitter on a life 
raft which sent out distress signals wednesday from southern 
sweden to northern norway the swedish news agency tt reported 
among the first to notice were passenger plane pilots who 
reported the signals which are used by life rafts aircraft and 
ships to the airsea rescue station at stockholms international 
airport the agency said 
the station couldnt locate the source of the signals and 
alerted norways main rescue center in bodoe in northern norway 
which was able to pick up the signals 
the bodoe center found that they were emanating from the danish 
city of esbjerg and alerted the danish rescue service at karup 
which in turn told esbjerg police 
police made the connection and sent a squad car to the factory 
there they found a smashed window a howling burglar alarm and a 
switchedon emergency transmitter but no trace of the uninvited

here are major provisions of the civil rights 
bill approved by the house and sent to president bush 
the bill 
bans racial harassment in the workplace 
limits opportunities for third parties to reopen courtapproved 
minority hiring agreements 
gives individuals more time to file job discrimination suits 
than they have now 
makes illegal any employment decision in which race color 
religion sex or national origin played any part even if there 
were other motivations 
requires employers named in job discrimination suits to prove 
in court that any of their employment practices with a disparate 
impact on women and minorities is required by business necessity 
currently the plaintiff must prove that it is not 
says the mere existence of a statistical imbalance in an 
employers work force is not enough to establish a discrimination 
case 
states that nothing in the bill is designed to require or 
encourage the use of hiring quotas by employers 
allows courts to award punitive damages in especially serious 
cases and bars such damages except for employers engaging in 
practices with malice or with reckless or with callous 
indifference to the federally protected rights of others 
caps punitive damages at 150000 or the total of compensatory 
damages plus back pay whichever is greater 
applies the provisions of the bill to congressional employment 
but provides that the house and senate themselves rather than a

the killer of a sheriffs deputy was 
executed in the electric chair despite a plea for mercy for his 
role in protecting prison workers during an inmate uprising 
wilbert lee evans 44 was pronounced dead at 1109 pm 
wednesday at the state penitentiary 
evans convicted of grabbing deputy william truesdales gun and 
murdering the officer while being returned to jail from a hearing 
in 1981 went to his death after gov l douglas wilder denied a 
request for clemency 
the inmate said he deserved a second chance because of his 
actions during a 1984 uprising in which six deathrow inmates 
escaped from mecklenburg correctional center evans was on death 
row there at the time 
bart stapert assistant director of the virginia coalition of 
jails and prisons said evans told him a halfhour before the 
execution i want to say to the family of mr truesdale im dead 
you dont have to hate me any more 
evans execution was the 141st in the united states since the 
supreme court allowed use of the death penalty to resume in 1976 
and the 10th in virginia 
just 3 hours before he was put to death the us supreme court 
denied a stay of execution on an 81 vote justice thurgood 
marshall who opposes the death penalty in all cases was the 
dissenter 
marshall said the event at mecklenburg casts grave doubt on 
the jurys prediction of evans future dangerousness 
evans lawyers produced statements from prison guards and nurses 
that evans intervened to save them from harm during the breakout 
of the escapees three have been executed the others remain on 
death row 
i am taking justice marshalls dissent opinion to the electric 
chair and to my grave evans said in a statement 
on saturday a federal judge granted evans a stay concluding 
that the jurys finding of future dangerousness as a reason for 
imposing the death sentence was thrown into question by evans 
actions during the breakout 
a federal appeals court lifted the stay tuesday on grounds that 
the relief sought by evans was clemency a matter for the governor 
to decide 
about 75 deathpenalty opponents carrying candles walked to the 
prison from a church service and sang gospel songs as the execution 
approached wednesday 
here is a guy that turned around suzanne hawver said 
what are we going to do are we going to kill him

industries that now release more than 24 
million pounds of toxic chemicals into the atmosphere each year 
would have to cut those emissions by 90 percent under provisions 
tentatively added to a compromise cleanair bill 
housesenate talks produced an agreement wednesday that would 
require factories and many businesses to install new technology 
over the next 10 years to contain 189 hazardous chemicals 
including many that cause cancer 
the members of the congressional conference committee were 
expected to formally adopt the measure today along with provisions 
tentatively approved last week requiring tougher emission controls 
on automobiles 
approval of the toxics section of the 600page cleanair bill 
represented a major step toward possible completion next week of 
the legislation the first tightening of federal air pollution laws 
in 13 years 
only one major section requirements for utilities to reduce 
emissions that cause acid rain are left to consider and several 
participants in the talks said they expect those differences to be 
resolved 
it shouldnt be that difficult sen dave durenberger 
rminn said when asked about the acid rain issue he suggested an 
agreement could be reached within a day or two 
bills passed by the house and senate both call for utilities to 
reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million pounds by the 
end of the decade the major areas of discord in drafting a final 
version is expected to involve efforts by midwestern lawmakers 
whose states have the dirtiest coalburning power plants to seek 
additional pollution credits 
the sticking point on acid rain will be how much pain will 
be inflicted on the dirtiest states said rep gerry sikorski 
dminn whose state is among those that already have clean 
utilities and balk at helping the midwestern utilities cut their 
pollution 
the air toxics agreement represents the first time the 
government would require factories and businesses to make dramatic 
reductions in the 189 hazardous chemicals including many 
cancercausing agents they release into the atmosphere 
the new controls would force emission reductions not only on 
large petrochemical plants and factories but also on smaller 
businesses such as dry cleaners furniture refinishers and 
commercial boiler operators the bush administration estimates the 
controls would cost industry 6 billion to 7 billion a year by the 
year 2005 
environmentalists lauded the compromise agreement 
people can breathe a sigh of relief quipped daniel weiss of 
the sierra club 
david doniger of the natural resources defense council said the 
new requirements will make a very giant dent in the toxic air 
pollution in this country 
the compromise agreement on air toxics comes after lengthy 
closeddoor negotiations that began last weekend and for a time 
were bogged down over whether to give the steel industry additional 
time to comply with the new pollution controls 
the two sides finally decided to provide steel companies 20 
years longer than other industries to the year 2020 to cut 
cancercausing emissions from coke ovens 
toxic chemical emissions from smaller polluters such as dry 
cleaners or furniture refinishers would have to be cut by 75 
percent large polluters such as chemical plants would have to 
reduce emissions by 90 percent by using improved technology 
the environmental protection agency also would be required to 
direct polluters to take additional measures after the turn of the 
century if it is determined that an ample margin of safety from 
cancercausing emissions is not being provided to people living 
near a plant 
the agreement includes new air pollution requirements for 
garbage incinerators new safeguards and response programs in the 
event of a chemical release accident 
the housesenate conferees began working on the clean air bill 
in midjuly but made little progress until september a 
breakthrough came oct 10 when the two sides reached agreement on 
measures to reduce smogcausing pollution from automobiles and 
trucks 
earlier the negotiators had resolved sections on setting a 
timetable for cities to meet federal air quality standards 
reducing smogcausing emissions from industrial sources and phasing 
out chemicals that damage the ozone layer

jurors in the 2 live crew obscenity 
case who have sat stonefaced during the trial but were seen 
doubled over in laughter in the hall have been told they can laugh 
in court too 
the ruling from judge june johnson came wednesday after jurors 
confided that their efforts to keep from laughing during some 
testimony had left them aching 
the jury spent most of wednesday straining to hear a barely 
intelligible recording of a 2 live crew concert and listening to a 
playbyplay description of the show by a sometimes redfaced 
sheriffs deputy 
the jurors have an unusual request the judge told attorneys 
for both sides they want to know if they can laugh some of them 
are having some physical pain 
attorneys for both sides offered no objection 2 live crew 
leader luther campbell said it was a healthy sign for him and his 
codefendants 
thats what this music is about campbell said theyre 
supposed to be laughing 
the tape played wednesday is the states primary evidence 
against campbell and fellow 2 live crew members mark brother 
marquis ross and chris kid ice wongwon 
the rappers are charged with obscenity over an adultsonly show 
june 10 at a hollywood nightclub if convicted they could get up 
to a year in prison and 1000 in fines 
prosecutors acknowledged that introducing the murky tape was a 
gamble after the judge refused to let jurors have a transcript of 
it while it played 
instead they listened to snatches of the tape many shorter 
than five seconds followed by sheriffs detective eugene mcclouds 
descriptions of the actions of band members and the crowd 
he detailed how young women from the audience got on stage and 
danced suggestively with band members one woman gyrated on her 
knees with her face an inch from campbells crotch he said while 
anothers breast escaped her blouse as she danced closely with 
ross 
the detective appeared to be uncomfortable describing the show 
the way they were dancing it was im embarrassed he 
said at one point 
eugene were all grownup adults here assistant state 
attorney leslie robson prompted 
during a break late in the day johnsons bailiff mary palacios 
found the six jurors doubled over in laughter as they waited to 
return to the courtroom 
they were cracking up palacios said one of them was 
laughing so hard he could barely breathe i said whats the 
joke they said they didnt know if they could laugh or sneeze or 
what during all of this 
another prosecutor pedro dijols said he wasnt concerned by 
the outburst 
laughter can mean many things he said people laugh when 
theyre nervous i laugh when im about to convict

world producers are replacing lost iraqi and 
kuwaiti oil faster than expected with the shortfall projected to 
be less than 1 percent by december the energy department says 
the loss of oil due to the iraq occupation of kuwait has been 
almost eliminated the departments energy information 
administration concluded wednesday 
the agency said the average worldwide shortfall of crude is 
expected to be 11 million barrels a day this month and will drop 
to 600000 barrels a day in november 
the agency projected a shortfall of 400000 barrels day in 
december and january or less than 1 percent of the free world oil 
consumption the shortfall should be reduced to about half of that 
in february through march said calvin kent the agencys 
administrator 
an estimated 43 million barrels a day were lost as a result of 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait and subsequent oil embargo against 
iraq the shortfall in september was 34 million barrels a day the 
agency said 
kent said that while many countries boosted production saudi 
arabia accounts for more than half of the additional oil followed 
by nigeria libya iran and venezuela 
a month ago the energy department estimated that despite 
increased production to make up for the lost iraqi and kuwaiti oil 
there still would be a worldwide shortfall of nearly 19 million 
barrels a day in october and as much as 1 million barrels a day 
through january 
kent cautioned wednesday that while the worst of the 
production loss is behind us any unforeseen production problem 
could cause market reactions since the world is now operating at 
near capacity production levels 
in another development the doe announced that it had awarded 
the first contracts for the test sale of crude oil from the 
strategic petroleum reserve sun refining and marketing co 
purchased 540000 barrels and shell oil company bought 95000 
barrels 
the two were among 11 companies selected for purchases totaling 
39 million barrels of oil from the reserve under the test 
drawdown

homeowners should air out their houses when 
painting inside with latex paint because of the possibility of 
mercury fumes health experts said today 
federal researchers reported in the new england journal of 
medicine that hazardous traces of mercury were found in peoples 
bodies after they painted with latex paint containing mercury as a 
preservative 
mercury poisoning can cause a variety of problems including leg 
cramps rash low fever personality changes and nerve problems 
because of the danger the environmental protection agency 
prohibited ading mercury to paint after aug 20 however paint 
manufactured before the ban can still be sold 
experts estimate that until recently onethird of all interior 
latex paint contained mercury it was added to prevent fungal and 
bacterial growth and prolong shelf life oilbased paint contains 
no mercury 
if i was a consumer i would contact the paint company to 
determine if the paint i was using had mercury in it said dr 
mary m agocs whether or not paint has mercury we recommend 
that people ventilate their houses when painting 
she said mercury levels are probably highest during the first 
few weeks after the paint is applied she did not recommend 
removing latex paint from walls 
agocs is a researcher with the federal centers for disease 
control in sacramento calif 
her study was conducted on 74 people living in 19 suburban 
detroit houses that had been painted about a month earlier with 
mercurybearing paint 
their bodies contained almost four times as much mercury as did 
28 people in 10 houses who did not use the paint 
none of the people exposed to the paint appeared to be sick 
however some had mercury levels that have been associated in the 
past with symptoms of mercury poisoning the mercury levels were 
highest in children 
concern about mercury in paint arose last year after a 
4yearold michigan boy suffered mercury poisoning when his home 
was painted

a former chairman of the hong kong stock 
exchange who helped transform the british colonys bourse into one 
of the bestknown in asia was sentenced today to four years in 
prison for corruption 
ronald li 61 was also ordered to pay an estimated 14 million 
in court costs and profits reaped from his corrupt acts 
the highrolling stock exchange chairman was convicted in high 
court on wednesday on two counts under hong kongs bribery 
prevention ordinance 
li was found guilty of accepting preferential offerings of 
shares in cathay pacific airways ltd and novel enterprises ltd in 
1986 and 1987 in exchange for helping obtain listings on the market 
for the companies shares 
justice kemal bokhary sentenced li to two years in prison for 
each count he had faced a maximum penalty of seven years in prison 
and 64000 in fines on each count 
prosecutors contended that li made more than 100000 in profits 
by selling the shares he was awarded michael kalisher the lead 
prosecutor said court costs reached 13 million 
lis lawyer john lloydeley said he would most probably 
appeal the verdict li faces other charges along with seven former 
members of the exchange scheduled to be tried in february 
in sentencing li bokhary said he took account of mitigating 
circumstances in the case such as lis good behavior in the past 
li was a powerful figure in this british colonys stockbroking 
community for two decades and is the one of the most prominent 
figures ever tried in hong kong 
in the trial kalisher painted li as the patriarch of an 
exclusive society funded by friendly merchant bankers 
it was a very cozy little club he said in court 
li was instrumental in merging the colonys four exchanges into 
the hong kong stock exchange four years ago turning the bourses of 
this british colony into one of the most dynamic in the world 
his decision to levy a small fee for each stock purchase put the 
exchange on solid financial ground 
but his move to close the exchange for four days during the 
world stock market crash in october of 1987 made him a 
controversial figure and led to calls for his resignation 
he stepped down as chairman of the exchange one month before he 
was arrested in january 1988 
between lis arrest and his appearance in court prosecutors 
dropped 13 charges lodged against him under the colonys bribery 
prevention ordinance because of lack of evidence

the house has moved to normalize us 
relations with czechoslovakia for the first time since world war ii 
and to dramatically reduce tariffs on that nations exports to the 
united states 
the house by a voice vote wednesday night approved a trade 
agreement signed last april by the bush administration and the 
newly elected prague government under which each country would 
grant the other mostfavorednation trade status 
that status would qualify the exporting country for the lowest 
tariffs in effect on the goods it ships to the buying country 
the agreement is the first us bilateral trade accord with a 
former eastern bloc country since the warsaw pact began collapsing 
more than a year ago 
the senate also must approve the pact before barriers to trade 
with the formerly communistruled czechs are removed 
president bush signed the agreement in april but did not send it 
to capitol hill for congressional approval until last month 
the accord will effectively reduce by 90 percent the tariffs 
paid on some 82 million in czech exports to the united states last 
year and open the way for increased business ties between the two 
countries 
the effect will be to give czechoslovakia a much broader us 
market for its exports by cutting their prices to wholesalers 
retailers and ultimately american consumers by as much as up to 40 
percent 
it also will open the czech economy to more us exports while 
also protecting american companies patents and copyrights

three consumer groups want american car buyers 
to refuse to buy automobiles not equipped with air bags 
motor voters the center for auto safety and the us public 
interest research group staged news conferences and demonstrations 
in 12 cities to propose the boycott focusing their ire on japanese 
economy models 
rosemary dunlap president of motor voters noted that many 
automakers equip only luxury vehicles with air bags claiming the 
320 devices would drive away bargain hunters 
she noted that chrysler has several economy models with driver 
air bags as standard equipment if chrysler can put air bags in a 
car for under 8000 whats hondas excuse for leaving them out of 
the civic crx which costs over 11000 she asked 
but the groups faulted even chrysler for not equipping its 
popular minivans with air bags and for not moving more quickly to 
make them standard equipment for frontseat passengers in cars 
chrysler is providing driverside air bags in virtually all of its 
1991 cars 
honda has announced it will make air bags standard equipment in 
all cars in 1994 currently the only hondabuilt car sold in the 
united states with an air bag is the topoftheline acura legend 
according to industry projections for the current model year 45 
percent of fords cars and 33 percent of general motors cars will 
be sold with at least a driver air bag six companies bmw isuzu 
mercedesbenz porsche saab and volvo equip all their us cars 
with air bags while five others hyundai peugeot suzuki 
sterling and yugo have no such models 
the figure for toyota is 27 percent for nissan 20 percent for 
mazda 15 percent and for mitsubishi 1 percent

the seneca indians would receive millions of 
dollars in back rents on leased lands under a bill approved by the 
senate 
the bill directs the federal government to pay 35 million to 
the senecas admitting that congress wrongly forced the tribe to 
lease its land for 115 years to the city of salamanca ny 
we took advantage of the seneca nation and now we ought to 
correct this injustice said sen daniel p moynihan dny one 
of the senate sponsors 
the bill was adopted on a voice vote late tuesday it passed the 
house on oct 10 
the bush administration has said the government is not 
financially liable for the low rents paid to the senecas and 
opposes the measure because of its cost president bush has 10 days 
in which to sign it veto it or simply allow it to pass into law 
unsigned 
the bill would ratify an agreement reached by salamanca three 
nearby villages and the seneca nation to replace a 99year lease 
accord expiring feb 19 1991 
under the agreements about 85 percent of the city of salamanca 
is leased from the senecas at rents that were frozen as low as 1 
per year 
the state of new york must also pay 25 million which will 
require state legislation

boosting energy efficiency and stopping the 
destruction of forests around the world could prevent the most 
disastrous consequences of global warming and save money says a 
new report 
the report prepared for delivery to the second world climate 
conference in geneva beginning oct 29 says the technical means to 
slow global warming are here 
whether those technologies get implemented depends on the 
agressiveness of policies said michael oppenheimer one of the 
reports authors some of this can be done at a cost saving 
because some of the technologies are cheaper to use than what we 
already use 
for instance energy efficiency measures can cut energy use 
thereby reducing the emission of carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is 
the most important of the socalled greenhouse gases which warm 
the atmosphere by trapping the suns heat like the windows of a 
greenhouse 
it is projected by us that energy use will double by 2020 if 
no action is taken oppenheimer said we can cut that growth in 
half by simply implementing energy efficiency measures which are 
cost effective 
the report concludes that a rise in world temperatures of 2 
degrees may be inevitable but it says every effort should be made 
to avoid rises higher than that oppenheimer said 
a rise of four degrees entails the risk of grave damage to 
ecosystems said oppenheimer a senior scientist with the 
environmental defense fund in new york city 
those sorts of warmings also entail rapid sea level rise and 
rapid sea level rise is difficult and expensive for society to 
respond to he said wednesday the trouble is we may be 
already be committed to a warming on the order of two degrees 
fahrenheit 
even that level of global warming could cause extensive 
ecosystem damage concluded the scientists members of the advisory 
group for greenhouse gases 
the oct 29 meeting in geneva could set the stage for an 
international treaty to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide methane 
and other greenhouse gases oppenheimer said 
negotiations on the details of such a treaty are expected to 
follow in washington in february he said 
energy efficiency isnt the only means for reducing global 
warming oppenheimer said 
we think that a very large emissions reduction can be obtained 
by ending deforestation which we think can be done by the year 
2005 and then by planting trees which will suck some carbon 
dioxide out of the atmosphere he said

some criticize the snails pace of the 
budget talks on capitol hill others give it their highest praise 
the procrastinators club of america has given its procrastinator 
of the year award to president bush and congress 
the club which champions delayed decisions and postponed 
projects announced the honor wednesday and said it will begin 
working on a ceremony for the winners sometime in 1992 or maybe 
later 
bush and congress did an outstanding job of putting things 
off said club president les waas 
the procrastinators were aware of what was going on with our 
taxes because we eventually read bushs lips waas said but we 
also like congress and people in politics because they are just 
like us they procrastinate 
the procrastinators club established in 1956 by employees at a 
philadelphia advertising agency says it has about 8500 members 
and halfmillion who havent found the time to sign up 
the award was accompanied by advice for the president and 
congress 
spend the money first waas said then determine the 
budget later that way they will always come out even and without 
any need for quibbling 
previous winners included comedian jack benny for putting off 
turning 40 for so many years and topless dancer julie gibson the 
first winner in 1957 for always putting things off

the dollars continuing plunge took it to a 
22month low against the japanese yen in tokyo today while stock 
prices surged for the fourth consecutive day 
the dollar closed at 12440 yen down 140 yen from wednesdays 
12580yen finish and its lowest close since 12405 yen on jan 4 
1989 the dollar has now fallen 1355 yen in the last 13 trading 
days 
after opening at 12560 yen it ranged between 12415 yen and 
12585 yen 
on the tokyo stock exchange where the yens rise encouraged 
buying the 225share nikkei stock average finished at 2436708 
up 50772 points or 213 percent the close was the highest for 
the blue chip index since 2436560 points on sept 17 
trading was energetic and volume on the first section was 
estimated at 700 million shares up from 590 million wednesday and 
the highest since june 
the strong yen is definitely the predominant sentiment said 
katsumi oshima a researcher at sanyo securities 
the dollars dip to the 124yen level at one point in new york 
wednesday had a psychological effect he said the dollar closed at 
12543 yen in new york 
traders said many factors discouraged investment in dollars 
including the american deficit declining support for president 
bush and the middle east crisis 
oshima said the dollar is likely to fall to 120 yen before the 
end of the year 
recent reports that bank of japan officials favor the yens rise 
helped drive the currency up traders said meanwhile the dollar 
was hurt by remarks by us officials that a lower dollar could 
help boost american exports by making them cheaper overseas 
the strong yen is the main factor today behind the stock 
prices the other factor is the drop in interest rates the market 
has recovered notably both in strength and volume said 
masayoshi yano a dealer at nikko securities co 
investors were buying construction steel and finance issues 
the price of the benchmark no 119 10year japanese government 
bonds was 8436 points at 5 pm 4 am edt close to wednesdays

a rightwing hindu party has threatened 
to pull out of prime minister vp singhs already shaky government 
in a dispute over a holy site claimed by both hindus and moslems 
the threat wednesday by the bharatiya janata or indian peoples 
party raised fears that the coalition government will collapse 
next month less than a year after taking office 
the bharatiya janata party said it would withdraw support if the 
government tries to stop a hindu procession to the northern town of 
ayodhya intends to dismantle a mosque and replace it with a hindu 
temple 
this is not a communal issue it is a matter of national 
honor the party said in a resolution passed at an emergency 
metting 
the national front government has repeatedly said it will not 
allow the mosques demolition 
lal krishna advani head of the bharatiya janata party plans to 
lead thousands of hindus to auodhya 300 miles east of new delhi 
on oct 30 and begin the temple construction 
hindu fundamentalists claim the mosque known as babri masjid 
replaced a temple destroyed in the 16th century by moghul 
conquerers moslem leaders dispute the claim and refuse to leave 
the site 
advani is traveling across india to build public opinion for 
what he calls a case of majority rights he has completed half of 
the 6000mile journey in a toyota pickup converted to look like a 
chariot and used during festivals to carry hindu idols 
hindus represent 82 percent of indias 880 million people while 
moslems represent only 12 percent members of the two faiths 
commonly clash in most indian states leaving dozens of people dead 
every year 
earlier wednesday singh called a multiparty meeting to resolve 
the issue but it was boycotted by the bharatiya janata party and 
the congress party of former prime minister rajiv gandhi which is 
now in opposition 
other parties passed a resolution at the meeting that said the 
government was committed to protecting the mosque 
singhs government relies for its survival on the support of the 
bharatiya janata party and the left front a coalition of communist 
parties withdrawal of support by either group would topple the 
government 
the national front a loose coalition of five parties took 
office dec 2 1989 after no party was able to get a clear 
majority in national elections the previous month 
the bharatiya janata party also used the resolution to criticize 
the governments performance in the last 10 months citing rising 
prices growing separatism in punjab and kashmir and street 
protests by uppercaste hindus against the governments job policy 
that favors lower castes

a rare bird that apparently flew 
3000 miles across the atlantic was killed when it crashed into a 
plateglass door at one of britains leading bird sanctuaries the 
facility reported 
the graycheeked thrush is thought to have been blown off course 
while migrating from its summer home in canada to south america 
ornithologist basil hughes said wednesday 
it died sunday when it flew into the door of the visitors 
center at the headquarters of the wildfowl and wetland trust at 
slimbridge in the county of gloucestershire in western england 
hughes said 
hughes a researcher with the trust at slimbridge said a man 
selling nesting boxes heard a loud thud and then watched the 
sixinchlong bird fall to the ground 
hughes identified it as one of the northern subspecies of 
graycheeked thrush from its drab olive color speckled breast and 
white underside 
he has preserved the body in a refrigerator so that it can be 
stuffed by a taxidermist and put on permanent display 
if it had survived there would have been thousands of 
twitchers bird watchers traveling from all over the country to 
see it he said 
hughes said the bird apparently became disoriented after winds 
blew it off course last week as it flew south 
strong winds occasional gales and a succession of mild winters 
have been responsible for the appearance in britain of a succession 
of birds rarely seen in this country in recent years 
ornithologists say

iraq has acknowledged that there might have 
been isolated displays of inhumanity by its soldiers in 
kuwait but denied that they represent government policy 
responding to reports of mistreatment of people in kuwait 
including alleged summary executions beheadings and stripping 
babies from incubators iraqs embassy in washington denied that 
any such incidents were widespread and said it was the governments 
policy to observe basic human rights 
the statement released wednesday was the most thorough of any 
iraqi denials of the reports which came mostly from refugees in 
kuwait including some who testified before congressman tom lantos 
committee on human rights 
some western and kuwaiti leaders have used the atrocity reports 
to press for military action to dislodge iraq from kuwait which it 
overran in an aug 2 invasion 
we were taken aback by the widely reported stories of flagrant 
and rampant disregard for human rights which these reports asserted 
were committed by our servicemen the embassy statement said 
while we acknowledge that in any conflict which involves the 
use of force there are likely to be isolated incidents in which 
individuals misinterpret their mission and display inhumanity we 
categorically deny that such incidents if they occurred represent 
any official policy of any level of our government 
moreover we dismiss any suggestion that there have been 
widespread such incidents the statement said 
it accused the media of reporting the congressional hearing 
testimony without examining the reasons why the hearings were 
conducted the veracity of witnesses or the lack of completeness of 
the testimony 
the statement said at least one american who had been in kuwait 
at the time of the invasion dr mohammed said was refused an 
opportunity to testify before lantos committee although he would 
have disputed some of the other testimony 
it is the policy of the republic of iraq to observe basic 
human rights anyone who is found to have committed any of the acts 
would be dealt with according to our laws the embassy statement 
said 
the war mongers who slander iraq with propaganda about 
makebelieve atrocities in a kind of pep rally to build enthusiasm 
for the big game will have to dispose of the ashes of the bonfire 
built from their youth it said

oklahoma city he was buried here saturday

opposed the death penalty rose to prominence as head of cummins 
state prison in arkansas in the 1960s gov winthrop rockefeller

claimed belonged to fellow inmates the prisoner said they had been 
beaten and shot by trusties and guards

the african national congress 
which for years has called for nationalizing big business is now 
asking corporations for financial help a newspaper reported today 
anc leaders including nelson mandela have approached at least 
two major corporations in south africa and are expected to approach 
a third soon said business day the countrys leading financial 
daily 
no financial commitments have been made the newspaper said 
quoting unidentified business sources 
corporate representatives said they were wary of offering money 
given the ancs past hostility toward big business 
we would certainly first demand answers to questions about 
their intentions on economic policy and particularly whether they 
expect us to support a party whose strategy is to break us up it 
quoted one business spokesman as saying 
for years the anc supported nationalizing mines banks and 
other large businesses recently it has been more vague saying 
utilities should be nationalized and the future of other 
corporations left open to debate 
the anc has an ideological preference for socialism saying 
there is an urgent need to bridge the gap between white wealth and 
black poverty 
but the antiapartheid organization has acknowledged that the 
private sector will play an important role in creating jobs and 
other opportunities for the countrys 30 million blacks 
according to business day the anc is hoping to raise millions 
of dollars to pay for a range of activities including resettlement 
of returning exiles and the purchase of office equipment 
it said one of the businesses approached was angloamerican a 
goldmining corporation that is south africas largest 
conglomerate angloamerican chairman julian ogilvie thompson met 
with mandela on oct 3 the company refused to comment on the 
meeting 
another large south african corporation has been asked for 
money and a third expects to be approached soon business day 
said representatives of both spoke to business day on condition 
the corporations not be identified 
both said the idea of funding party political activities also 
was of concern and they might be inclined to limit donations to 
social projects such as resettlement of exiles

the fiscal watchdog who helped rescue new york 
from the brink of bankruptcy 15 years ago says the city is spending 
its way toward an even worse financial crisis and hes getting 
out now 
felix rohatyn who has run the municipal assistance corporation 
since its creation in 1975 said wednesday he will step down as 
chairman at the end of the year 
the 62yearold investment banker said he wants to spend more 
time with his wife who is recovering from surgery but he also 
expressed frustration at his inability to persuade mayor david 
dinkins of the seriousness of the citys troubles 
he said the citys problems are financial economic and social 
and are of proportions that i havent seen in 40 years 
dinkins replied reasonable people can differ i dont know 
that his position and mind are so far apart anyway 
rohatyn has headed mac since its creation in 1975 to assist the 
city by using sales tax revenues to back municipal bonds new york 
was near bankruptcy at the time and rohatyn was one of the 
architects of its recovery 
among the current financial problems rohatyn cited are a 
predicted budget shortfall of 300 million to 500 million for 
fiscal 1991 and a gap for fiscal 1992 that begins at 14 billion 
he also said union leaders are helping lead the city toward 
financial ruin by making unrealistic salary demands 
he urged that a 55 percent raise recently promised teachers be 
rescinded and the money put into city coffers to strengthen new 
yorks credit rating 
teachers union president sandra feldman said rohatyn is really 
meddling with things that are not really his affair

much paramount owes buchwald and his producing partner for their 
script that ultimately became the eddie murphy blockbuster coming 
to america 
franklin johnson a managing partner of price waterhouse of los 
angeles was chosen wednesday by the judge to help him figure out 
how risky moviemaking is 
the judge previously ruled that paramount stole buchwalds idea 
and owes him a share of the profits 
paramount claims that the film which has grossed some 300 
million has never shown a net profit and buchwald and his partner 
alain bernheim are owed nothing the two claim they are owed 
between 69 million and 146 million 
paramount says winners pay for losers in the movie business 
and profits from hits are diluted by losses incurred by box office 
bombs

start rummaging for your long underwear 
flannel sheets and electric socks the ninth annual lee county 
woolly worm survey issued today says theres a cold winter ahead 
the folksy forecast of kentuckys winter weather is based on the 
coloring of caterpillars known locally as woolly worms the number 
of foggy mornings in august inner designs of persimmon seeds and 
the height of hornets nests also are factored into the forecast 
the lee county woolly worms are never in error said 
rosemary porter kilduff of beattyville in rural eastern kentucky 
mrs kilduff compiles woolly worm sightings in and about lee 
county and releases the winter forecast in time for lee countys 
annual woolly worm festival which begins friday 
organizers expect lee countys population of 7000 will double 
with visitors for the woolly worm races crafts show and a 50s 
street dance a parade will feature tasha harris of beattyville 
miss woolly worm festival queen for 1990 
lee county residents hope the caterpillars predictions someday 
will gain the same status in forecasting as punxsutawney phil 
movements of the pennsylvania groundhog foretell the coming of 
spring on groundhog day 
this fall 88 of the 188 woolly worms sighted were black 
with black in the lead it pains me to say that we can predict 
a very very cold winter from beginning to quit mrs kilduff 
said 
the 25 foggy mornings in august mean there will be 25 days of 
snow a sighting of a hornets nest low to the ground means the 
snow wont stay around long she added 
the communities of vermilion ohio and banner elk nc also 
forecast winters severity with the caterpillars vermilion 
forecaster willis goodnews gebheart predicted chilly weather 
for ohio after examining the bugs called woollybears up north 
the thick overcoats on the ohio woollybears are as dark as a 
tax collectors heart the sign of an unusual snowy and cold 
winter he wrote in a beattyville weekly paper 
mrs kilduff turns the woolly worm survey over to the national 
weather service station in nearby jackson to aid in their 
forecasting 
gil russell official in charge of the station promised to take 
mrs kilduffs forecast into consideration last year the woolly 
worm forecast accurately predicted an early cold winter in 
kentucky followed by a warming trend but the worms prediction of 
a harsh ending to winter didnt occur 
there are some things i hear in folklore that i can make some 
kind of scientific reason for but woolly worms is not one of 
them russell said

iraq said today that it is willing to 
sell its oil to all sides in the persian gulf conflict including 
the united states for 21 per barrel opecs benchmark price 
before iraqs invasion of kuwait 
the announcement appeared a sign that iraq was feeling the pinch 
of the unordered embargo on trade which is being enforced by a 
naval blockade and seeking to entice nations into abandoning the 
alliance arrayed against it 
iraq already has offered to give oil free of charge to third 
world countries but there have been no reports of any takers 
oil had been iraqs only significant source of export earnings 
and baghdad is not now able to sell its crude on the open market 
iraqi oil minister issam chalabi proposed that payments for 
iraqi oil be placed in an escrow fund because of the un 
sanctions 
we accept that the price of sold oil is not to be transfered 
to iraq but to deposit according to a special arrangement and iraq 
will not deal with it normally until we get over this crisis and 
when the problems settle down on the bases of relations empty from 
any crisis chalabi said 
chalabi said the offer was made to stem the rise of world oil 
prices 
he said iraqi president saddam hussein approved the measure to 
fulfill iraqs humanitarian role 
oil has nearly doubled in price to about 40 per barrel since 
iraq touched off the crisis by seizing oilrich kuwait on aug 2 
the iraqi announcement appeared aimed at trying to get countries 
that are feeling the economic pinch of high oil prices to losing 
their resolve and abandon the embargo on trade with iraq 
a prominent kuwaiti economist jassem alsaadoun of the alshall 
financial house estimated wednesday that the un embargo is 
costing the iraqis 54 million a day 
prior to the invasion iraqs opec production quota was 31 
million barrels of crude oil a day much of that and kuwaits 
production of 15 million barrels a day has been replaced on the 
world market by production increases by saudi arabia and other opec 
countries 
with the invasion iraq increased its share of world oil 
reserves to about 20 percent

time mulay was 13

mulay while nina grunseth has signed an affidavit denying them 
according to all the affidavits prepared on grunseths behalf

the swimming pool they said they observed none of the activities 
alleged by the women although about half of them said they left 
the party by midnight 
william and ingrid emstad said they stayed overnight at the 
grunseth home in a room overlooking the pool 
from approximately midnight until the morning i did not 
observe or hear anyone in the pool emstad said

gov rudy perpich for the accusations saying they are part of a 
winatanycosts strategy 
nelson and mulay have denied any contact with the perpich 
campaign and perpich and his campaign officials have denied any

the tabloid tv notoriety of a 
former playboy waitress and policewoman convicted of murdering her 
husbands exwife helped lead to her capture three months after she 
escaped from prison 
lawrencia bambi bembenek 31 was arrested at an apartment 
in thunder bay ontario on wednesday on a tip from a viewer of 
last weeks episode of americas most wanted 
ms bembenek who has steadfastly professed her innocence was 
captured with her fiance dominic gugliatto 34 
her flight had thrilled supporters in milwaukee prompting 
sales of tshirts that read run bambi run and was covered 
on several tabloid tv shows which played up her looks and the 
romantic elements of the escape 
i think all the tv shows that have aired this thing in regard 
to bembenek and gugliatto have romanticized and that concerned me 
a little bit early on that people were getting so hung up on 
whether she was guilty or innocent that it kind of detracted from 
what we had to do which was catch her said lt edwin sheppard 
of the fond du lac sheriffs department 
but obviously in this case its a success story for 
americas most wanted he said were glad they chose to do 
it 
ms bembenek and gugliatto who had scheduled a prison chapel 
wedding before the escape were being held without bail sheriff 
james gilmore said extradition proceedings could begin next week 
i wish she would have got away said deter day 32 of 
milwaukee she was dealt injustice by the wisconsin judicial 
system and i think the case should be looked into further 
i hope she enjoyed her freedom while she had it said ann 
martel 31 also of milwaukee 
an anonymous tip from a california man the fugitive had served 
while working as a waitress led to the arrest authorities said 
thunder bay detective ron arthurs pursuing the tip interviewed 
ms bembenek on wednesday at the restaurant where she had worked 
since july 23 
when her only piece of identification a birth certificate 
didnt check out officers went to her apartment and found the 
couple about to move on gilmore said 
she obviously made a call pack up lets go the car was 
packed they think it was probably five minutes before they would 
have fled the sheriff said 
once a waitress at the nowdefunct playboy club in lake geneva 
ms bembenek became a police officer in milwaukee in the late 
1970s she was fired in 1980 for lying 
the following year ms bembenek was convicted of murder in the 
killing of christine schultz the exwife of her thenhusband 
elfred schultz a milwaukee detective they were divorced after her 
conviction 
prosecutors contended ms schultz who was bound gagged and 
shot in the back was murdered because ms bembenek resented the 
700amonth alimony schultz was ordered to pay his exwife 
supporters contend she may have been the victim of a frameup 
because of her knowledge of questionable police activities they 
noted that one of ms schultzs young sons had testified that the 
person seen in the house the night of the killing was not ms 
bembenek 
ms bembenek escaped july 15 from the taycheedah correctional 
institute near fond du lac 
while on the lam ms bembenek worked as a waitress at the 
columbia grill and tavern and also worked as an aerobics 
instructor said her landlord jenny beck 
she knew ms bembenek as jennifer gazzana someone who said she 
fled chicago with her husband tony to find a simpler life 
they were disenchanted with the american way of life ms 
beck said she certainly didnt like the violence in the 
states 
she described her tenant as a friend a hard worker and a smart 
polite beautiful woman i felt safe having her in the house 
ms beck said 
gugliatto a lawn mower factory worker from suburban milwaukee 
faces a charge of aiding ms bembeneks escape and a possible 
fiveyear sentence authorities said ms bembenek could have five 
years added to her life prison term 
ms bembenek was one of 122 fugitives apprehended after being 
profiled on americas most wanted since the show began in 1988 
said jack breslin spokesman for the fox broadcasting co show 
it was a phenomenal amount of interest not only in terms of 
local interest but in national interest said jon wendt fbi 
agent in charge of the bureaus milwaukee office it was far 
beyond our normal interest in an unlawful flight

fourteen members of a bankrupt soviet allstar 
circus have applied for political asylum and hope to restart their 
troupe in the united states 
the members of the great circus bim bom nine performers and 
crew members and their families applied for political asylum 
wednesday claiming they would be treated unfairly and blocked from 
pursuing their careers if they returned to the soviet union 
tom fischer regional director of the immigration and 
naturalization service said they were granted a oneyear work 
permit as the ins began a 90day evaluation 
the circus members said they would take whatever jobs they could 
find to earn money to restart their troupe 
the circus was our life we will do anything to get it back 
said vadim lomakin whose act included chimpanzees who can ski 
last spring 118 members of bim bom began a twoyear tour of the 
united states but they ran into problems with the tour promoter 
and went bankrupt after just two us performances financial 
backers then pulled out and creditors seized the animals and 
equipment 
bankrupt the circus came here in may hoping to raise money and 
get the show back on the road 
three months later they were rescued the promoter of the rival 
moscow circus paid some of bim boms debts and brought most of its 
performers and their families home last week most of the animals 
and equipment were returned to moscow said dale schwartz an 
immigration lawyer representing the remaining members 
circus director yuri turkin said the four bim bom families who 
remained are afraid to return because soviet newspapers are blaming 
the circus failure on the performers who refused to return home 
the ministry of culture of the soviet union is blaming the 
situation on the circus members who stayed in the united states 
even though the circus wasnt given one dollar or any help at all 
to get out of trouble by the government turkin said if we 
went back we would never be able to perform our art again

a cabinet minister whose racial remarks infuriated 
american blacks has sent a letter of apology to black us 
lawmakers who demanded that he step down foreign ministry 
officials said today 
a group of japanese legislators meanwhile said today they 
planned to visit the united states to explain the remarks made by 
justice minister seiroku kajiyama who compared blacks to 
prostitutes 
kajiyamas letter of apology was delivered wednesday in 
washington by japanese ambassador ryohei murata to rep ronald 
dellums dcalif officials said dellums chairs the 24member 
us congresional black caucus 
murata asked dellums to reconsider the caucus resolution urging 
president bush to demand kajiyamas resignation and an official 
apology from prime minister toshiki kaifu a ministry official 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
murata had not yet received a reply 
kaifu has expressed regret and rebuked kajiyama but refused to 
fire him the caucus resolution was presented to the house of 
representatives shortly after kajiyamas racial slur on sept 21 
ichiro ozawa secretary general of the governing liberal 
democratic party told a news conference today that the party will 
send a group of lawmakers to the united states on sunday 
ozawa said the delegation will meet with congressional leaders 
including the black caucus in hope of heading off the resolution 
demanding kajiyamas resignation he said passage of the resolution 
could damage the relations between japan and the united states 
after a police roundup of foreign prostitutes in tokyo kajiyama 
compared the prostitutes to blacks in the united states 
the area is becoming mixed just like in america where blacks 
move in and whites are forced out he told reporters 
in his letter kajiyama said there was no intent of racial 
discrimination behind his comment but i learned again how deeply 
i have hurt the feelings of the american people particular of the 
africanamericans 
what i thoughtlessly said on sept 21 was wrong and grossly 
improper he added although i am acutely aware how difficult 
it is to heal the wounds that my remarks inflicted i will 
personally do whatever i can to strengthen japans relationship 
with the africanamerican community 
ambassadors from six african countries sent a letter of protest

japanese products and the mayor of trenton nj douglas palmer 
said a planned visit by a delegation of the tokyo metropolitan 
government was not welcome the japanese officials had been 
scheduled to visit the city to study garbagedisposal methods 
kajiyama is the latest japanese politician to offend minorities 
with public racial remarks 
in 1986 then prime minister yasuhiro nakasone said americans 
have a lower intelligence level than japanese because the 
population includes a considerable number of blacks puerto ricans 
and mexicans 
in 1988 former finance minister michio watanabe said american 
blacks have few qualms about going bankrupt and implied that tey 
walk away from debts

the nations 40 million social security 
recipients will see their benefit checks increase by 54 percent 
starting in january the biggest advance in 8 years the 
government said today 
that increase will translate into an extra 31 per month for the 
average retired worker whose monthly check will increase from 571 
to 602 
the maximum monthly benefit for a worker retiring in 1991 at age 
65 will rise by 47 to 1022 
since 1975 benefits have risen automatically each year keeping 
pace with the annual inflation rate with the exception of six 
months in 1983 that were skipped to help bail the social security 
system out of a crisis 
the exact size of the 1991 increase became official today when 
the labor department announced septembers 08 percent increase in 
the consumer price index the inflation measure used to determine 
costofliving increases for the social security program 
the 54 percent increase which will show up in the jan 3 
benefit checks followed a 47 percent increase that took effect 
last january and a 4 percent increase in 1989 
it was the largest increase since a 74 percent jump in july 
1982 when high inflation rates translated into bigger 
costofliving increases 
the 54 percent increase in 1991 also applies to the nations 
45 million recipients of supplemental security income which 
provides a minimum income floor for poor people who are aged blind 
or disabled 
the maximum federal ssi payment will rise by 21 to 407 per 
month for an individual and by 31 to 610 for a couple 
the government also said today that the maximum amount of wages 
subject to the payroll tax that finances social security benefits 
will climb from 51300 to 53400 next year 
that change will boost taxes for about 10 million higherincome 
workers who earn above the current wage cap 
the tax rate of 765 percent which finances both the social 
security and medicare programs would remain unchanged next year 
but higherincome workers may still see a bigger bite taken out 
of their paychecks depending on what type of deficitreduction 
bill finally emerges from congress 
both the house and senate are considering proposals to boost the 
amount of wages subject to the medicare portion of the payroll tax 
the house measure would increase the wage cap to 100000 
however neither chamber is considering trimming social security 
benefit checks as a way of reducing the huge federal deficit 
even though social security is the governments biggest spending 
program after national defense efforts to cut benefits in the past 
have triggered a heavy backlash from retirees 
the social security administration gave these examples of how 
the 54 percent increase will affect average monthly benefits 
aged couple both getting benefits up 52 to 1022 
widowed mother and two children up 62 to 1203 
disabled worker spouse and children up 52 to 1022 
all disabled workers up 30 to 587 
for the 42 million people who receive social security and 
supplemental security income checks each month this costofliving 
adjustment will be their assurance that those checks will continue 
to allow them to pay for needed goods and services said social 
security commissioner gwendolyn s king 
at the start of this year sen daniel p moynihan dny 
attracted attention with a proposal to reduce the social security 
payroll tax to reflect the fact that the system is producing more 
revenue for the federal government than social security is paying 
out in benefits an estimated 74 billion more for the 1991 fiscal 
year 
however with lawmakers trying to bridge a yawning budget gap 
moynihans proposal to cut social security taxes never advanced in 
congress 
the payroll tax was 1 percent of income up to 3000 when social 
security started in 1937 it stayed at that rate until 1950 but has 
been boosted since that time with the current rate set by a 1983 
rescue plan passed by congress to bail the system out of recurrent 
financing problems

government bulldozers today began 
dismantling the oldest section of the socalled green line that has 
divided beirut into moslem and christian sectors for more than 15 
years 
police said government troops were removing mines along the 
heavily fortified 12mile strip that has separated the christian 
district of ein rummaneh and the moslem quarter of shiyah since the 
civil war broke out 
government bulldozers were also dismantling other parts of the 
green line and reopening roads linking the christian and moslem 
sectors of the capital and the central mountains to the east and 
northeast police said 
the demarcation line began taking shape april 13 1975 when 
moslems in shiyah opened fire at christians in ein rummaneh in 
retaliation for an attack by christian militiamen of the phlange 
party that had killed 27 palestinians and wounded 19 
president elias hrawis government decided to reunify beirut 
after crushing rebel christian gen michel aouns mutiny in an air 
and ground assault saturday that police said left 160 dead and 
about 800 wounded 
most of aouns 15000 troops declared allegiance to hrawis army 
under gen emile lahoud at least six of the defeated generals 
intelligence officers were known to have been arrested by syrian 
troops 
meanwhile aoun was spending a sixth day holed up in the french 
embassy in beiruts christian suburb of hazmiyeh hrawis 
government continued to ask foreign banks to freeze aouns accounts 
in preparation to bring him to trial 
france on saturday granted aoun asylum but lebanon said it will 
not allow him to leave and that he has to face a court of law for 
war crimes and the alleged theft of 75 million from the ailing 
state treasury 
voice of the nation the moslem radio station said today that 
aouns stay in the embassy was expected to be long 
no settlement is in the offing to the diplomatic differences 
between lebanon and france over aoun the radio said 
in paris today riot police removed about 50 lebanese 
demonstrators from the lebanese embassy which they had occupied 
for five days in a show of support for aoun police said there was 
no violence 
hrawis government plans to create a militiafree zone covering 
the capitals moslem and christian sectors and their immediate 
suburbs as the first step toward disbanding militias in the country 
and ending the civil war 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations said contacts were under way with commanders of 
leftist militias to withdraw them from the 80squaremile area 
formerly controlled by aoun 
the leftist newspaper assafir said hrawi will visit the syrian 
capital damascus in the coming few days for talks with 
president hafez assad on the plan syria is the main power broker 
in lebanon with 40000 troops deployed mainly in predominantly 
moslem sectors under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 21nation 
arab league 
hrawis plan would be in line with an arab leaguebrokered peace 
pact to disband all the warring militias and end the war which has 
killed more than 150000 people 
the peace pact ratified by parliament in august 1989 divides 
power equally between moslems and christians the nation has a 
population of 4 million belonging to 17 sects 
aoun had rejected the peace plan and refused to recognize hrawi 
as head of state saying the president was a syrian puppet

washington mayor marion barry saying that 
something drastically different must be done to combat murder 
on the capitals streets has suggested invoking neighborhood 
curfews and calling out the national guard 
the recent rash of homicides is getting out of hand barry 
said wednesday night after a forum for candidates competing for 
atlarge seats on the district of columbia council we have got 
to do something drastically different 
the police chief is as frustrated about this as i am we cant 
let this keep up he said 
a total of 373 homicides have been reported so far this year 
last year a record 434 deaths were reported 
on monday after a weekend during which nine slayings were 
recorded police chief isaac fulwood jr announced that he had 
created a unit of 100 officers to fight the problem that squad is 
scheduled to begin operation on sunday 
but barry said that if there was no sign the unit has slowed the 
homicide rate after about a month he would establish a nightly 
curfew in neighborhoods where crime and violence are high if that 
plan doesnt work the national guard would be called in he added 
barry is one of seven candidates running for two atlarge 
positions on the council during his drug and perjury trial this 
summer when he was convicted on a misdemeanor charge of cocaine 
possession he announced he would not seek a fourth fouryear 
term 
council attempts to impose a curfew for anyone under 18 have 
been rejected twice this year in the courts 
barrys plan however is broader than the voided laws he 
suggested the curfew apply not only to juveniles but to all 
residents in neighborhoods where people are killing each other 
barry has previously rejected calls for national guard help 
saying in 1988 the city is not out of control 
wednesday night however he said guard help may be needed if 
all else fails

un chief javier perez de cuellar was quoted today as saying he 
sees little progress toward peacefully ending the persian gulf 
crisis he raised the possibility the security council could 
authorize military action against iraq 
at the united nations the five permanent security council 
members have reached general agreement on a draft resolution that 
would require iraq to pay for damages stemming from its aug 2 
invasion of kuwait diplomats said today 
countries that have suffered serious economic losses stemming 
from the invasion such as jordan india sri lanka and bangladesh 
could apply for compensation out of iraqs foreign assets which 
have been frozen or from future oil earnings the diplomats said 
no date has been set for the full security council to consider 
the matter 
in an interview with the german news magazine stern the 
secretary general said the un security council cant strengthen 
the embargo and sanctions against iraq because everything possible 
has already been done 
but perez de cuellar added he would never be the first one to 
say there remains only a military solution of the conflict the 
magazine said 
in washington the 12weekold gulf crisis was blamed for some 
bad economic news in the united states 
the jump in energy prices brought on by the crisis sent 
americans cost of living up 08 percent in september matching the 
increase the month before the government said it was also 
announced today that the us merchandise trade deficit had jumped 
24 percent in august spurred by the high price of oil imports 
iraq meanwhile said it was willing to sell oil for 21 a 
barrel about half the market price the announcement appeared 
aimed at trying to undermine the unordered embargo on trade with 
iraq imposed to try to force an end to the occupation of kuwait 
iraq already has offered free oil to the third world but there 
have been no reports of any takers willing to get around a naval 
blockade 
on the diplomatic front soviet envoy and middle east expert 
yevgeny primakov headed to washington today for talks with 
president bush

a honduranregistered freighter sank 
two miles offshore early today after its load of construction 
material shifted and all nine crew members were rescued from life 
rafts unharmed the coast guard said 
the 164foot freighter raychel went down in 43 feet of water 
shortly after midnight after stopping at miami said coast guard 
petty officer jennifer hogg 
the freighter was carrying a load of construction material 
cinder blocks wood nails that nature hogg said the report 
we received is that the load shifted and the vessel capsized 
a small amount of the ships 5500 gallons of diesel fuel had 
leaked by daylight said petty officer buddy dye 
what has come out so far is not really a concern dye said 
there is a sheen visible from the air but they believe it will 
dissipate on its own there are choppy seas out there and its 
very light and easily dissipated 
a florida marine patrol diver was assigned to plug fuel vents to 
keep any more fuel from spilling and coast guard crews planned to 
check nearby beaches for any signs of the oil dye said 
the ship went down by the approach channel for the port of miami 
but was not blocking the waterway which is heavily traveled by 
freighters and cruise ships hogg said 
the crew included three americans she said 
she said the coast guard will decide whether the freighter will 
have to be raised to keep the area clear

the deputy chairman of the ukrainian legislature 
pressed the republics sovereignty demands on the kremlin today 
one day after studentled protests forced the ukrainian prime 
minister to quit 
in the ukraines boldest separatist action yet two weeks of 
mass demonstrations hunger strikes and classroom boycotts 
culminated wednesday in the resignation prime minister vitaly 
masol 
the ukrainian legislature also passed a resolution embracing the 
students demands including the transfer of ownership of communist 
party property to the government and refusal to sign a new treaty 
of union proposed by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev tass 
reported 
the unrest in the nations second most populous republic 
combined with sharp criticism by russian federation president boris 
n yeltsin of gorbachevs latest economic reform plan could hurt 
gorbachevs efforts to forge a new treaty of union with the 15 
diverse republics 
the proposed treaty would link the republics in a loose 
confederation and redefine their political and economic links with 
the central government the economic reform plan would give them 
more control over property and some prices republic leaders and 
liberal national lawmakers have criticized both initiatives as 
insufficient 
interestingly the right and the left have the same demand 
about refusing to sign the union treaty vladimir grinev deputy 
chairman of the ukrainian supreme soviet said in an interview 
published today 
the center sometimes looks on our declarations as adults 
games but it is from such declarations that the new state order 
will merge an association of free states grinev told 
komsomolskaya pravda the youth newspaper 
union law can only become law if ratified by the republics we 
came to moscow to get that across to the president and defense 
ministry 
the protesters insist ukranian conscripts be allowed to serve 
within the republic a demand echoed by other republics but 
rejected by the ministry 
most of the 15 republics and many smaller provinces within them 
have declared some form of independence or sovereignty from central 
authorities most say they want independence first and will then 
decide whether to voluntarily join any new confederation with the 
kremlin

mayoral candidate vincent a buddy 
cianci jr missed the deadline to file his 1989 tax returns a 
newspaper reported today 
ciancis accountant daniel kieliszak said he has asked for a 
30day extension until nov 15 to file the federal and state 
returns 
but internal revenue service spokesmen in rhode island and 
washington told the providence journalbulletin that there is no 
provision in the federal tax code that allows for extensions more 
than six months beyond the april 15 filing date 
the state division of taxation has the same rules the newspaper 
said 
kieliszak said cianci has not received some bank statements that 
he needs to file complete returns 
cianci a former mayor who is running as an independent has 
made public his 1987 and 1988 filings and promised to disclose his 
1989 return as soon as it was ready his opponents have already 
released their returns for the three years 
it is not finished and i am not going to release an incomplete 
return cianci said wednesday 
a late income tax filing is a civil infraction if the government 
is owed money said irs spokesman frank keith penalties of at 
least 5 percent a month plus interest on the amount due could be 
assessed there is no penalty if the taxpayer is due a refund 
elected mayor as a republican in 1974 cianci was forced out of 
office 10 years later after he attacked his estranged wifes lover 
with a fireplace log an ashtray and a lit cigarette he pleaded no 
contest to two assault charges and in april 1984 he received a 
fiveyear suspended sentence and probation

city police commanders say the deployment of 
border policemen without their knowledge on the temple mount was a 
main factor behind last weeks riots in which 19 arabs were killed 
israel radio said 
the disclosure was the first israeli suggestion that police 
could have provoked the violence at the jerusalem holy site arab 
witnesses have said police set off the violence the worst in the 
34month palestinian uprraeli occupation 
in the occupied gaza strip today at least 35 palestinians were 
shot and wounded with bullets and rubbercoated steel balls in a 
sevenhour clash with soldiers in the rafah refugee camp arab 
reports said 
witising against isnesses told palestinian reporters stoning started 
after 
soldiers raised an israeli flag on a building in the camp 
apparently in an effort to make it a headquarters they said the 
clash ended when soldiers withdrew to just outside the camp the 
army said it was checking the report 
the radio report did not identify the police commanders who made 
the statements on the temple mount riots but it said it was 
quoting testimony they gave before a threemember committee 
deployment of troops there was no 
force mentioned that was supposed to be stationed on the temple 
mount the radio said quoting the testimony 
it said the force was only discovered once another group of 
police stormed the mount when stones came down on worshipers at the 
wall injuring 28 people 
a separate probe of the killings has also been opened by a 
magistrates court judge jerusalem police spokesman elhayan said it 
was a routine inquiry mandated by law into any violent incident 
the hadashot daily said the investigating judge may request 
autopsies on the 19 victims 
the riot raised tensions in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip where more than a million palestinians were kept under 
curfew for a week to prevent unrest most restrictions were lifted 
by tuesday 
in the west bank city of nablus merchants shuttered their shops 
for a second day in mourning for temple mount victims

two leading economic advisers to president mikhail 
s gorbachev warned today that the soviet leaders plan for 
introducing a market economy would cause severe inflation and 
unemployment 
abel aganbegyan told soviet lawmakers in a onehour report that 
preliminary steps toward a market system had already created an 
inflationary spiral particularly for prices of meat and dairy 
products 
he warned that hyperinflation was likely despite measures in the 
gorbachev plan designed to combat runaway prices such as 
restricting the nations money supply and retaining state price 
controls on some items 
aganbegyan and another economist oleg bogomolov spoke to a 
meeting of several committees of the supreme soviet legislature 
before a full legislative session friday when gorbachev is to 
formally present and defend his plan 
bogomolov said the gorbachev plan for fails to identify 
potential victims of the transformation he also said it should 
have established that no soviet citizens standard of living would 
be allowed to drop more than 25 percent 
bogomolov predicted the reforms were likely to halve the value 
of the ruble and force people to dip into their savings soviets 
have an estimated 500 billion rubles in savings because many 
necessities are subsidized by the state and few consumer goods are 
available 
both economists said the success of the gorbachev plan hinged on 
cooperation from the 15 soviet republics the largest russia has 
already rejected it and renewed threats to implement its own more 
radical program 
gorbachevs main political rival russian president boris n 
yeltsin has called the plan a catastrophe and said it would 
fail within months 
but aganbegyan said during a questionandanswer session with 
lawmakers that yeltsin was criticizing gorbachevs politics rather 
than his economics 
he made a political speech and would have spoken this way 
regardless of what we had proposed said aganbegyan who headed a 
24member commission that drafted one of the many economic reform 
plans considered by gorbachev 
the commission was appointed after the governments first 
proposals caused panic buying last spring and had to be scrapped 
aganbegyan also said yeltsins predictions could cause political 
instability resulting in millions of rubles of losses he did not 
specify how that might happen 
gorbachevs fourstage blueprint begins by reducing the 
approximately 100 billion budget deficit and cutting the money 
supply efforts would also be made in the first stage to increase 
production of consumer goods and boost agricultural output through 
land reform 
in the second stage prices on roughly 70 percent of all goods 
and services would be freed to respond to market forces and small 
private businesses would be encouraged 
the third stage would emphasize establishing a free market for 
housing a modern banking system and entrepreneurship the final 
stage would end government monopolies in many industries and allow 
the ruble to be freely traded against other world currencies 
gorbachev has set no timetable for his reforms but states other 
countries have achieved similar goals within 18 months to two 
years

recently completed a us tour has joined four fellow dancers in 
deciding to stay in the united states at least for now

decided not to leave with the rest of the troupe when its plane 
departed new york at 9 am wednesday said her attorney martin 
garbus 
four other members of the troupe defected earlier 
garbus declined to describe devis action as a defection 
however noting she may eventually change her mind her passport 
allows her to stay in the united states as a visitor until 
december 
shes going to explore her options garbus said she might 
stay two days she might stay a week who knows she may want to 
pursue her studies here

knifepoint in new york on oct 8 and told her he would kill her if 
she didnt defect

during the tour 
federal officials questioned the dancers individually tuesday to 
see if any wanted to seek asylum said arthur helton director of 
the refugee project of the lawyers committee for human rights

the army today drove off leftist guerrillas 
who attacked air force headquarters with homemade mortars and 
automatic weapons and authorities said several people were 
wounded 
a military spokesman said he had an initial report that one 
military mechanic was wounded and one aircraft was damaged in the 
three hours of fighting at ilopango air base on the east side of 
the capital 
a red cross spokesman said several people were wounded but he 
did not immediately know the precise number 
the fighting began at 945 pm wednesday and died down after 
midnight 
helicopters were patrolling today but the city was calm and 
traffic moving normally in most of the capital in the eastern 
sector near the air force headquarters military roadblocks were 
set up to search vehicles for arms 
the situation is now under the control of the armed forces 
said the military spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
shortly after midnight 
however the government indicated it expected more trouble it 
broadcast a communique saying leftist labor and student 
organizations planned to launch a series of provocative actions 
of street violence 
the attack came exactly a month after yet another round of 
unsuccessful peace talks between rebels and the rightist 
government 
a fifth round of unmediated peace talks between the rebels 
and the government of president alfredo cristiani had ended in a 
stalemate sept 18 
rebel commanders have said for weeks that an eventual stalemate 
at the negotiating table could provoke a major offensive the two 
sides have agreed to meet again in mexico before nov 4 
witnesses said wednesdays attack began with a string of about 
20 loud explosions presumably caused by homemade mortars hurled 
from rebel catapults 
heavy smallarms fire followed for about 90 minutes most of it 
on the edges of ilopango and in the adjacent working neighborhood 
of soyapango as government paratroopers moved into the areas 
at least four helicopters provided air support dropping flares 
around the base and firing red tracer bullets and machine guns 
as many as 100 rebels appeared to have been involved in the 
attack on the air force headquarters located inside the base a 
paratroop sergeant at the scene said 
as soon as the fighting began the eastern half of the city 
turned into a ghost town with virtually everyone taking refuge in 
their homes 
when the shooting died down radio stations opened their air 
waves to residents wishing to inform relatives that they were 
unharmed and would spend the night in workplaces or at friends 
rather than venture into the streets 
guerrilla leaders and government representatives have been 
negotiating unsuccessfully for more than a year to end the 
decadeold civil war 
the guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
insist the military should be drastically reduced in numbers and 
officers who violated human rights be prosecuted 
the cristiani government has balked at these requests saying it 
would be tantamount to doing away with the armed forces 
the killings caused an uproar in washington and calls to scale 
back us aid since 1980 the united states has provided more than 
4 billion in economic and military aid to bolster a succession of 
salvadoran governments 
human rights groups estimate more than 73000 people have been 
killed since the war began in late 1979 in this country of 5 
million people 
death squads linked to the military and rightwing extremists 
are blamed for a large percentage of the deaths

authorities struck a blow to hells angels 
motorcycle clubs that traffic in methamphetamines when they 
arrested 15 people in the omaha area and one in california an fbi 
agent said 
were going to knock the socks off the hells angels here 
said dennis aiken assistant special agent for the fbi in omaha 
surrounded by confiscated rifles a 22caliber automatic 
pistol 800000 worth of drugs 200000 in cash as well as hells 
angels jackets and posters aiken said a twoyear investigation 
culminated in simultaneous raids wednesday on 14 locations 
including the motorcycle clubs headquarters in omaha 
a rottweiler guard dog was killed after it attacked an officer 
at the clubhouse and one man at the clubhouse resisted arrest but 
the other searches and arrests were conducted without incident 
aiken said 
we consider this group to be a major center in the trafficking 
of methamphetamines aiken said at a news conference hells 
angels clubs have played a major role in methamphetamine traffic in 
the country he said 
many of the fewer than 50 club members in the omaha area are now 
in jail aiken said everyone arrested in the omaha area wednesday 
was a hells angel club member or an associate of the club aiken 
said 
the investigation continued and it wasnt known how much 
contraband and money would eventually be confiscated aiken said 
charges included interstate and foreign travel in support of 
racketeering enterprises money laundering manufacturing and 
distribution of a controlled substance and felony possession of a 
firearm an fbi news release said

connection between the arrest in california and the others here 
douglas county sheriff dick roth said the suspects had been 
investigated as far back as 1978 
we have had tons of intelligence on these peoples actions 
over the years roth said 
a cooperative effort that included the fbi nebraska state 
patrol and the federal drug enforcement administration used 
electronic surveillance such as wire intercepts aiken said he

a projection of a major earthquake in the 
midwest in early december is as about as reliable as a random 
guess a group of scientists said today 
such a projection especially at the predicted 5050 chance 
level implies a level of detailed knowledge that simply does 
not exist for the new madrid or any other fault zone in the 
world the group said in its report 
the group released its findings prepared for the national 
earthquake prediction evaluation council today at a news 
conference in st louis 
the 11 scientists were brought together from universities and 
governmental agencies to evaluate the scientific validity of iben 
brownings projection of a 50 percent chance of a big quake hitting 
the new madrid fault on or about dec 3 
browning a climatologist based in sandia park nm bases his 
prediction on the cyclical forces of tides and gravity he has said 
that for 48 hours before and after dec 3 tidal forces will be 
particularly strong 
earlier this week browning said that conditions will again be 
ripe for a major quake in the region on new years eve 
browning told cape girardeau television station kfvs that tidal 
forces on that date will not be as high as on dec 3 but they 
will still be dangerously high 
in 18111812 a series of quakes estimated at up to 8 on the 
richter scale struck the new madrid region causing the mississippi 
river to appear to flow backward and forming reelfoot lake in 
tennessee the tremors rang church bells in washington dc more 
than 850 miles away 
brownings dec 3 claim has been widely reported causing public 
anxiety throughout the region at least nine school districts in 
three states have canceled classes insurance agents have been 
swamped with requests for earthquake insurance and attendance at 
earthquake preparedness meetings has been high 
the new madrid fault runs from marked tree ark across 
southeastern missouri to southern illinois and produces hundreds of 
small quakes every year most hardly felt its named for the 
missouri bootheel town of new madrid about 140 miles south of st 
louis 
in todays report the scientists agreed with other findings 
that the longterm potential for a large earthquake does indeed 
exist for new madrid 
but it said that brownings correlations of earthquake 
activity with danger periods at times of highs in tidal forces does 
no better at predicting earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 65 
than does random guessing 
the scientific group also said it found no evidence to support 
the claim that browning had predicted the oct 17 1989 earthquake 
in northern california 
we can only infer that successes claimed before that time were 
retrospective that he found after the fact that certain 
earthquakes occurred during times of his danger periods 
a quake measuring 46 on the richter scale hit the new madrid 
region sept 26 the quake the second strongest in the region this 
century caused no injuries and no significant damage but it added 
significantly to what has been called the earthquake hysteria

a family of dolphins has circled an ailing 
young dolphin inside the surf line off pacific palisades for 10 
days trying to keep the sick mammal from beaching itself 
nicknamed bonnie the pacific bottlenose dolphin was kept in 
the water off will rogers state beach today by six companions 
marine conservationists said 
bonnie has a limp dorsal fin possibly a birth defect said 
peter wallerstein director of the sea shepherd conservation 
society 
she could have been deformed at birth or possibly have been 
born with a weakened immune system he said wednesday 
wouldbe rescuers could do nothing because of the fear their 
efforts would further traumatize the 3footlong dolphin 
wallerstein said 
as long as the family is with her theres no need for human 
intervention he said at this point theyre keeping her 
afloat kind of pushing her back and forth but shes in bad shape 
theyll keep shepherding her along as long as she needs 
help he added this is a great example of how these 
intelligent animals care for each other 
wallerstein said rescuers would intervene only if any of the

democrat bruce kings involvement in new 
mexico politics goes back 36 years a fact that both he and his 
opponent are trying to use to their advantage in the governors 
race 
king already has served longer than anyone as governor of new 
mexico two fouryear terms starting in 1970 and 1978 
i wont need any onthejob training the 66yearold king 
tells audiences as he bids for a comeback i have the experience 
i need to carry out the needs of the state 
his rival is republican businessman frank bond who says he 
offers voters a new generation of leadership 
bond 47 reminds voters that since new mexico governors now can 
seek consecutive fouryear terms the next governor could serve 
through 1998 when he would be 55 years old and king 74 
gop gov garrey carruthers the first republican governor since 
1968 was prevented from seeking reelection by a constitutional 
provision that now has been changed 
bond who trailed king by some 12 percentage points in recent 
polls is turning up the heat on the campaign trail as he tries to 
boost his name identification 
he has attacked what he calls an excessive number of executive 
pardons issued to exconvicts by king and has accused king of 
cronyism two highranking officials were convicted of federal 
crimes and two resigned under a cloud of suspicion during kings 
second administration 
king responds that hundreds of people are appointed by the 
governor and that a few bad apples are a small percentage 
known for his friendly ways king talks often about his 
experience and ability to work well with the legislature and 
diverse groups 
i have the political maturity to carry out the needs of the 
people he says 
the state gop chairman casts kings experience in a different 
light 
yes hes back like those tired old vaudevillian jokes 
john lattauzio wrote of king in a recent fundraising letter but 
time has wrung the humor out of bruce king as well 
bond disavowed the letter and said it was not his style 
both candidates come from ranching families with deep new mexico 
ties and each has established himself in modern business they 
first met as adolescents 
there are all these connections and coincidences but they 
dont bring us politically at all close together says bond 
king and his two brothers built the family homestead into a 
farming ranching and business empire covering nearly 500000 acres 
and including a propane and butane company feedlots and land 
development 
his political outlook was influenced by the new deal of 
president roosevelt at the same time king emphasizes that the 
big thing im interested in is reducing big bureaucratic 
government 
bond a lawyer and former state legislator studied photography 
under ansel adams and stopped just short of a doctorate in spanish 
literature his grandfather and greatgrandfather migrated from 
canada to northern new mexico in 1883 
bonds republican roots also run deep his father helped stat 
candidates and his maternal grandmother was a gop national 
committeewoman for 18 years hosting president eisenhower in her 
albuquerque home 
i grew up basically with probably a much more conservative 
philosophy particularly fiscally with respect to taxes with 
respect to the size of government and the like he says 
bond hopes to exploit the states political shift since kings 
last election 
in 1978 democrats outnumbered republicans 23to1 and king 
won the election by just 1 percent of the vote republicans have 
narrowed the ratio to about 17to1 this year

mephiste set in new orleans 
he once said in an interview that he kept writing in new orleans 
because it was the only way he could get control of his life

no one placed the minimum 100 million bid at a 
courtordered auction of the crown building one of four manhattan 
properties tied to the late philippine president ferdinand marcos 
and his wife imelda 
a second auction of the 26story retail and office building will 
be held probably before the end of the year auctioneer stephen 
estroff said at the close of the unsuccessful sale wednesday in 
us district court 
the auction came in a foreclosure action by security pacific 
mortgage and real estate services proceeds were to have gone into 
an escrow account until the resolution of civil lawsuits in which 
the philippine government and others claim ownership of the four 
properties 
mrs marcos was acquitted in july of criminal charges that she 
and her husband used embezzled government funds to buy the 
buildings 
estroff said one reason for the lack of bidders was concern 
about the shaky economy 
two of the other marcos properties already have been auctioned 
the herald center a retail building near macys brought 25 
million and an office tower on wall street was sold for 77 
million 
the fourth property at madison avenue has not come up for

president fw de klerk today 
lifted the state of emergency in violencetorn natal province 
meeting a key demand that had slowed peace talks with the african 
national congress 
the state of emergency has now been completely lifted de 
klerk told a news conference there is only one route to peace 
and reconciliation that is through peaceful negotiation 
he said the door to negotiations is now fully open and i am 
appealing to all leaders and all south africans to accept the 
challenge 
the anc issued a statement welcoming the move it has long 
demanded that the emergency be lifted as a precondition for 
fullscale negotiations on blackwhite power sharing and ending 
apartheid 
president bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater welcomed de 
klerks action as yet another important landmark on the road 
toward full normalization of political activity in south africa 
fitzwater said we believe that president de klerk deserves 
credit for his political courage and leadership 
de klerk lifted a 4yearold nationwide state of emergency in 
june but kept the restrictive measures in natal province where a 
power struggle between the anc and the conservative inkatha 
movement has claimed 5000 lives since 1986 the president said the 
violence though still sporadic was receding and that law and 
order could be maintained through normal police powers 
inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi said the decision to lift 
the emergency was a step which should bring south africa nearer 
to the negotiating table 
the state of emergency gave police and the army widespread 
powers including detention without trial and the authority to 
break up political rallies and meetings but police will retain the 
right under security laws to impose stringent restrictions in what 
they deem to be emergency situations 
more than 30000 activists mostly black were detained for 
varying lengths of time during the four years of the nationwide 
state of emergency 
law and order minister adriaan vlok told the news conference the 
number of police and soldiers would remain the same in natal but 
that they would operate under normal procedures 
police still have some special powers in townships around 
johannesburg that have been declared unrest areas but the 
measures are far short of powers under the state of emergency 
about 800 blacks have died in factional fighting around 
johannesburg in the last two months 
with de klerks latest announcement he has addressed all of the 
ancs demands including the release of political prisoners and the 
return of some 20000 exiles however the exiles have yet to begin 
returning in large numbers and only a few dozen of the more than 
1500 political prisoners claimed by the anc have been released 
de klerk said there was basic agreement on any remaining 
obstacles to negotiations but that there have been some 
hiccups 
the fighting around johannesburg had strained governmentanc 
relations with the anc accusing security forces of instigating the 
unrest the government denied the charge and challenged the anc to 
provide proof 
de klerk reiterated that all political parties including 
rightwing conservative and militant black groups are welcome at 
constitutional negotiations he hopes to launch early next year 
only the anc inkatha and the white antiapartheid democratic 
party have expressed a desire to attend 
de klerk said he wants to eliminate apartheid measures and give 
all south africans a vote of equal value 
he again promised that whites would have a chance to vote on any 
new constitutional agreement before it would be implemented the 
president said he wants such an agreement by 1994 when the next 
national election is due

million to 80 drug treatment programs in 35 states and territories 
to improve services for three population groups that have a high 
prevalence of drug problems adolescents minorities and public 
housing residents 
officials hope these programs can become national prototypes of 
comprehensive services that will better serve others such as the 
homeless people with aids and people with mental illness who also 
have drug or alcohol problems or both 
also 8 million will be used to fund 19 demonstration projects 
designed to improve drug treatment in the criminal justice system 
including people who are in jail and others who are on probation or

from the budget for the fiscal year that just ended they are the 
first projects funded by the office for treatment improvement

secretary of state james a baker iii is 
weighing prospects for a settlement of the persian gulf crisis with 
a senior soviet expert who is reporting on his recent talks in 
iraq 
the unannounced visit thursday of evgeny primakov to the state 
department is a warmup to the session the soviet official will have 
at the white house on friday with president bush 
the two superpowers are cooperating in efforts to force iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait its smaller oilrich neighbor in the persian 
gulf however an embargo on trade and other steps taken by the 
un security council so far have failed to persuade president 
saddam hussein to pull out his troops 
a report from moscow in todays editions of the washington times 
quoted unnamed us officials as saying primakov is carrying a 
peace plan from soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that calls on 
iraq to withdraw from kuwait possibly in exchange for free 
elections in the emirate and cash compensation to iraq from an oil 
claims dispute 
baker earlier this week ruled out any partial solution short 
of total iraqi withdrawal or anything that would enable saddam to 
claim benefits from the aug 2 invasion however baker also 
stressed the us quest for a political settlement 
on wednesday baker told the senate foreign relations committee 
a worldwide arms embargo might be maintained against iraq even if 
it withdrew from kuwait 
baker suggested the security council also consider calling for 
iraqi reparations to kuwait and an international war crimes trial 
of iraqs leaders 
bakers latest proposal reflected concern within the 
administration and congress that even if iraq withdrew its troops 
its large army and nuclear and chemical weapons technology would 
pose a danger in the middle east and persian gulf 
sen jesse helms rnc suggested meanwhile that companies 
providing military technology to iraq be held liable for war 
crimes as well 
baker did not respond to the suggestion which helms supported 
with a chart showing that firms in 19 countries including the 
united states had assisted iraq before the invasion 
west germany headed the list with 87 companies austria was 
second with 18 and france was third with 17 
the hearing was marked by demands by key senators that congress 
participate in any decision to send us troops into combat against 
iraq 
but baker resisted he promised only further consultations 
we should not have a constitutional argument over whether or 
not the president as commanderinchief has authority to commit 
forces baker said in an effort to end the debate 
besides baker said a vote on capitol hill could tip off saddam 
about a pending military operation or even cause the white house to 
abandon that option 
only two members of the committee sens rudy boschwitz 
rminn and daniel p moynihan dny supported the 
administration in its insistence that consultation with 
congressional leaders was sufficient 
typical of the demand was an assertion by sen paul s sarbanes 
dmd that consultation is not enough 
there is a difference between consultation and 
authorization sarbanes said the notion that the president 
alone would be able to commit american forces in a military assault 
in effect without receiving a shared decision by the congress is 
contrary to the constitution 
besides sarbanes said it is clearly contrary to what makes 
good sense so far as ensuring support of the american people 
but baker responded if you want us to agree to do nothing 
unless we get the approval of 535 members of congress we cant 
agree to that right now 
the disagreement mostly under wraps until now is rising to the 
surface as congress prepares for a yearend adjournment beginning 
possibly late next week

parents whose babies died 
after receiving contaminated intravenous solutions at two clinics 
may be taken to court if they continue to refuse to pay bills for 
the treatment officials said thursday 
as many as 16 children all white may have died at the two 
clinics this year from a bacterial infection possibly caused by 
contaminated intravenous solution used in the neonatal wards 
the parents met with an attorney wednesday and mandated that he 
ask the government to order an inquiry into the deaths at the 
morningside and park lane clinics in johannesburg 
the parents have said they should not have to pay the medical 
bills the clinics have replied that they were not responsible for 
the deaths and should not be left with the bills 
the managing director of the morningside clinic johan van 
reenen said it is impossible to determine if the fatal infections 
were a direct result of contaminated solution 
he said there are 1001plus causes of the bacterial 
infection known as klepsiella in addition of the many infants who 
received the same drip formula some became ill and others did not 
van reenen said 
if it was contaminated solution that caused the deaths its 
not the hospital that was negligent he said he also said most 
of the affected parents were covered by medical insurance 
four babies died at morningside after contracting the infection 
and another three who died might have been infected he said 
the number of infant deaths at park lane was unclear news 
reports mentioned nine the hospitals managing director jeffrey 
hurwitz said thursday he could not give a specific figure 
at the parents meeting wednesday night the mother of one dead 
child said park lane had threatened to take her to court if she did 
not pay a 12000 bill within 10 days 
hurwitz denied any of the bills were that high he said they 
ranged from about 2000 to 6000 and he indicated park lane 
would pursue legal action if parents did not pay 
the point is we bill patients as a normal procedure and we 
give them credit terms the same as any business we expect payment 
within those terms if we dont receive payment we take the matter 
further hurwitz said

republican al mccandless is a 
fourterm congressman battling for name recognition against a 
firsttime candidate actor ralph waite 
waite best known as televisions papa john walton has been 
campaigning nonstop for eight months wherever he goes waite is 
greeted by fans of the waltons who ask him to autograph his 
campaign brochures 
both he and mccandless have lined up bigname support in the 
battle for the nations fastestgrowing congressional district 
democrat waite draws on entertainment celebrities such as st 
elsewhere star ed begley jr and film superman christopher 
reeve 
mccandless has bob hope and gerald ford serving as his chief 
fundraisers palm springs mayor sonny bono also is in his corner 
mccandless who stresses fiscal conservatism and a strong 
military represents a district where republicans outnumber 
democrats 200000 to 165000 
but his constituents include voters in half a dozen cities that 
didnt even exist a decade ago 
people who have moved into this district dont know the name 
of the man who represents them says indian wells mayor richard 
oliphant a mccandless supporter hes the incumbent but he 
needs to build name identification its a unique situation 
the district includes palm springs rancho mirage and riverside 
plus new communities on the mojave desert 70 miles inland from los 
angeles 
in this district it could be a close race says former 
president ford just because the registration is plus republican 
and because al has been reelected four times you can never be 
sure 
waite says he has come from 28 percentage points behind 
mccandless in polls during the spring to a dead heat in the final 
weeks 
waite also leads in fund raising with 450000 including 
156000 of his own money mccandless has raised 250000 
a lot of it has to do with waite being a celebrity and its 
the first time al has been seriously challenged mccandless 
campaign spokesman james moore says when you get the hollywood 
liberals in a race it create tension 
republicans have brought in agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter and have scheduled former president reagan treasury 
secretary nicholas brady and transportation secretary samuel 
skinner to raise funds for mccandless 
were using the secretaries and former presidents to define 
what we represent as opposed to sitcom actors moore said 
early in the campaign mccandless ignored waite and made few 
appearances but mccandless switched tactics in august in response 
to the challenge from waite and challenged his democratic rival to 
debates that have yet to occur 
mccandless 63 labels waite a typical bigspending democrat 
for the 62yearold waite the districts heavily republican 
registration is a problem 
being a democrats a tough job in these parts but someones 
got to do it said a sign on a waite booth at a community fair 
before becoming an actor waite was a social worker and a 
minister giving him experience dealing with housing and drug 
rehabilitation issues 
waite also reminds voters of his hollywood past 
i guess ive been in almost every one of your homes for 10 
years on the waltons he told a senior citizens group at a mobile 
home park 
being an actor playing on the waltons doesnt necessarily 
make a good leader or qualify you for congress but it might say 
something about the kind of values you have waite continued 
waite faults mccandless for failing to act to avert the savings 
and loan scandal mccandless who has spent five years on the house 
banking committee calls that a meaningless pot shot 
waite endorses environmental regulations and more federal 
spending for seniors education health and social programs he 
tells senior citizens mccandless does not seem to have your 
interests very high on his agenda 
mccandless received taxpayers friend and watchdog of the 
treasury awards from conservative groups he says he wont vote 
for increased taxes while democrats promise vague spending 
cuts 
even his own campaign brochures acknowledge the lowprofile 
mccandless isnt a smile and backslap politician his campaign 
materials credit him with water and flood control projects highway 
construction and housing grants for his district

justice thurgood marshall now a supreme court 
minority of one on the death penalty still has an abolitionists 
fervor he blistered his fellow justices for their indifferent 
shrug of the shoulders in allowing a virginia execution 
wednesday 
marshall indisputably the courts most liberal member fired 
off a strongly worded dissent as the court voting 81 rejected a 
death row inmates lastgasp legal gambit wilbert lee evans was 
electrocuted in richmond hours later 
marshall said the execution the nations 141st since the high 
court allowed states to reinstate the death penalty in 1976 
highlights the inherently cruel and unusual character of capital 
punishment 
since justice william j brennans retirement in july marshall 
82 is the only court member who opposes the death penalty in all 
cases 
we hope our movement will help justice marshall feel less 
isolated said leigh dingerson of the national coalition to 
abolish the death penalty even though the polls say 70 
percent of americans favor the death penalty those polls mean 65 
million people agree with him 
michael mcconnell a university of chicago law professor said 
marshalls persistent refusal to condone capital punishment does 
not weaken the courts authority 
i can see no principled objection to a justice refusing to 
follow a precedent if he feels it sufficiently important to 
register continued disapproval mcconnell said but he who does 
so must not object when others similarly depart from precedent 
regarding some other issue 
in the virginia case evans was convicted of murdering a deputy 
sheriff in 1981 he was sentenced to death because jurors found one 
aggravating factor the likelihood that evans would be a future 
danger to society 
while on death row evans was credited with saving the lives of 
prison guards taken hostage during a 1984 riot and with preventing 
the rape of a nurse marshall said such action casts grave doubt 
on the jurys prediction of evans future dangerousness 
virginia prosecutors did not argue that evans still must be 
considered a future danger but they said letting him attack his 
death sentence based on his actions in prison would lead to every 
wellbehaved death row inmate challenging a past finding of future 
dangerousness 
marshall accused virginia officials and his eight fellow 
justices of ignoring latearriving evidence that should have 
been taken into account 
the indifferent shrug of the shoulders with which the court 
answers the failure of its procedures in this case reveals the 
utter bankruptcy of its notion that a system of capital punishment 
can coexist with the constitutions eighth amendment marshall 
said 
the amendment bans cruel and unusual punishment 
a death sentence that is dead wrong is no less so simply 
because its deficiency is not uncovered until the eleventh hour 
marshall said a system of capital punishment that would permit 
wilbert evans execution notwithstanding astonow unrefuted 
evidence showing that death is an improper sentence is a system 
that cannot stand

republicans cant stop talking about michael 
dukakis nothing flattering mind you they just find the 
massachusetts governor an irresistible campaign issue 
oklahoma republicans offered dukakis firstclass air fare to 
come to their state and campaign for david walters the democratic 
candidate for governor the offer was not accepted 
democratic candidate david worleys vote for dukakis in the 1988 
presidential election is an issue in a georgia congressional race 
can nebraska gubernatorial candidate ben nelson overcome the 
fact he has dark hair bushy eyebrows and a prominent nose giving 
him a superficial resemblance to the massachusetts governor 
nowhere of course is dukakis more of an issue than in his home 
state where john silber the democratic nominee for governor 
relishes telling people he voted for george bush in 1988 
dukakis can take some small comfort in the fact hes far from 
the first defeated presidential candidate to remain a political 
target 
republicans ran against jimmy carter and walter mondale long 
after their names no longer appeared on any ballot a whole 
generation of democrats ran against herbert hoover and with 
considerable success 
sheffield nelson once raised money for edward m kennedy and for 
jimmy carter that was before he became a republican in 1989 now 
hes running for governor of arkansas against democratic incumbent 
bill clinton 
during a recent debate nelson said clinton wants to run for 
president he wants to do like michael dukakis and if you give him 
four more years hell bring the massachusetts miracle down 
south 
the souring of the booming economy that dukakis liked to call 
the massachusetts miracle triggered a voter revolt that gave the 
gubernatorial nomination to outsider silber 
also worried is sen john kerry dmass who is being 
challenged by republican jim rappaport once thought safe kerry 
now is looking at polls showing him in a very close contest 
the gop candidate is running an ad in which a picture of dukakis 
gradually transforms into one of kerry hes back says the 
voice oh not mike dukakis hes gone but the man who was 
dukakis lieutenant governor hes back he and dukakis were a 
team they think like a team 
in neighboring new hampshire republican gov judd gregg likes 
to point out that his democratic opponent joseph grandmaison ran 
dukakis first campaign for governor during a debate with gregg 
grandmaison tried to laugh off any such comparison by pointing out 
that he looked nothing like the massachusetts governor 
im the one with the double chin he said 
thats not so easy for democrat ben nelson running against 
republican gov kay orr of nebraska 
the michael dukakis of the midwest is how the orr camp 
refers to nelson so far at least nelson leads orr in opinion 
polls despite his hair and eyebrows and nose 
david worley is running against rep newt gingrich the georgia 
republican who is house minority whip gingrich repeatedly 
characterizes worley as a liberal the proof he voted for mondale 
in 1984 and dukakis in 1988 
david walters did more than just vote for dukakis he ran the 
democratic nominees oklahoma campaign 
or as republican gubernatorial candidate bill price puts it 
walters tried to ram michael dukakis down the throats of 
oklahomans

airline cabin crews could save lives by telling 
passengers before takeoff how to brace themselves for a crash 
medical investigators said thursday in a report on an accident that 
killed 47 people 
a separate report released thursday by the department of 
transports air accidents investigation branch blamed pilot error 
for the crash of a british midland airways 737400 jet on jan 8 
1989 
the jet developed trouble in its left engine but the pilots 
mistakenly shut off the right engine before attempting an emergency 
landing at east midlands airport near kegworth 20 miles northwest 
of leicester 
thirtynine passengers died on impact as the plane crashed short 
of the runway another eight died later and of 79 who survived 74 
suffered serious injury 
the air accidents investigation branch report concluded the 
pilots reacted prematurely to initial engine trouble and in a way 
that was contrary to their training 
both reports called for study of turning airline seats around so 
that passengers face the rear as in some military aircraft 
the investigators also recommended research to strengthen 
floors improved designs for seats and seat belts engine 
modifications and improved cockpit displays and pilot training 
the civil aviation authority the government agency responsible 
for airline operations and safety said research would continue 
into the best position to brace for a crash as well as the possible 
introduction of rearfacing seats 
the preliminary results of this research indicate that even a 
small change in the passenger brace position might improve 
survivability or reduce the degree of injury the authority said 
in a statement later 
the aviation authority said shoulder harnesses and air bags were 
also possible areas for research 
the medical report by the university of nottingham medical 
school commissioned by the aviation authority recommended that the 
braced crash position be demonstrated before every flight it said 
that was more important than the routine demonstration of life 
jackets 
the report said many leg injuries suffered by 57 passengers were 
caused by floors disintegrating and seats collapsing in the forward 
cabin seventyseven survivors had head and face injuries it said 
few of the passengers were in the correct position when the plan 
crashed the report said the doctors said their new recommended 
crash brace position offered significant protection against head 
injury and concussion 
the researchers recommended that passengers bend forward with 
their heads resting against the seat ahead hands should be clasped 
behind heads with elbows tucked outside the knees feet should be 
together on the floor resting slightly behind the knees 
john wolfe managing director of british midlands parent 
company airlines of britain said the airline would change its 
flight safety cards to reflect the new position 
the british midland jet was flying from londons heathrow 
airport to belfast northern ireland when fan blades failed in the 
left engine 
the government report said the combination of heavy engine 
vibration noise shuddering and smell of fire was outside the 
training and experience of the pilots

virtues of potatoes and found a smart bunch of kids who

wed like to present you with a yeuttero potato name tag 
11yearold crystal ford told a surprised yeutter 
all 25 youngsters in the van ness elementary school classroom

marked national school lunch week and world food week 
yeutter and seven other top officials at the us department of 
agriculture discussed the potato in second through sixgrade 
classes at van ness which has been a partner of the usda for 
about six years 
most people dont realize how important a food potatoes are 
yeutter said after distributing white potatoes to each of the 
students they are the most important vegetable in the whole 
world 
of course theres broccoli the president says you shouldnt 
eat broccoli but dont pay attention to him he said smiling 
yeutter rhapsodized on the merits of the spud using a lesson 
plan developed by john s niederhauser the winner of this years 
world food prize for advancing the production and consumption of 
potatoes 
reneya gaston 11 eagerly told yeutter that water is stored in 
potatoes while two other students traded guesses of 100 pounds and 
125 pounds as the amount of potatoes most americans eat per year 
joking with teacher maxwell yeutter said you got a smart 
bunch of kids here they dont really need a teacher 
bernadette goatley 11 presented to yeutter a green school cap 
key chain and a framed copy of the schools vision on behalf of 
all potato lovers here at van ness 
yeutter left the students a potted leafy green potato plant

year my favorite is french fries said bernadette 
after class yeutter and the officials put on large white aprons 
and served the students a lunch of barbecued chicken macaroni and 
cheese mixed vegetables oatmeal roll fresh fruit and pear 
cobbler but no potatoes

twentyfive american movies as old as the 
great train robbery of 1903 and as recent as raging bull in 
1980 were named thursday to the national film registry of the 
library of congress as outstanding films worthy of historic 
preservation 
the list was announced by james h billington the librarian of 
congress under terms of a 1988 statute that established the 
registry to honor 25 films a year deemed culturally historically 
or aesthetically significant 
this is not academy awards night billington told a news 
conference these are not annual lists of the best american 
films 
rather he said they were chosen because they impressively 
display the depth and variety of the american creative spirit in 
filmmaking 
this years selections join the first 25 films chosen last year 
for the registry listed alphabetically the 1990 choices are 
all about eve made in 1950 by director joseph l 
mankiewicz all quiet on the western front 1930 directed by 
lewis milestone bringing up baby 1938 produced and directed 
by howard hawks dodsworth 1936 directed by william wyler 
duck soup the marx brothers classic made in 1933 walt 
disneys fantasia made in 1940 
also harold lloyds the freshman made in 1925 francis 
coppolas the godfather 1972 edwin s porters the great 
train robbery a 12minute classic made in 1903 harlan county 
usa 1973 directed by barbara kopple john fords how green 
was my valley 1941 frank capras its a wonderful life 
1946 
also charles burnetts killer of sheep 1977 love me 
tonight produced and directed by rouben mamoulian 1932 
meshes of the afternoon an 18minute film directed by maya 
deren in 1943 ninotchka a 1939 greta garbo film directed by 
ernst lubitsch primary a time inc film made in 1960 
also raging bull directed by martin scorsese 1980 
rebel without a cause the james dean movie of 1955 red 
river made by howard hawks 1948 the river a 32minute 
farm security administration film made in 1937 sullivans 
travels a preston sturges film made in 1941 
also top hat a 1935 musical starring fred astaire and 
ginger rogers the treasure of the sierra madre directed by 
john huston 1948 and a woman under the influence directed by 
john cassavetes 1974 
the list was based on 1500 nominations made by the public and 
narrowed by a 14member national film preservation board 
representing the academy of motion picture arts and sciences the 
american film institute movie and television producers directors 
broadcasters screen writers the screen actors guild of america 
film critics and scholars 
the final choices were made by billington a cultural historian 
and movie buff based on consultations with advisers including the 
staff of the librarys division of motion picture broadcasting and 
recorded sound 
films are eligible for the registry 10 years after their first 
theatrical release they need not necessarily be american films 
the library said but the first 50 movies in the registry all were 
made in the united states 
the library of congress contains the nations largest film 
archive and accounts for more than half the number of films 
preserved in the united states even so billington said half of 
all movies made before 1950 and 80 percent of those made before 
1930 are lost forever 
the cold hard fact is that for all their popularity in 
america today films are an endangered species for the america of 
tomorrow he said 
billington estimated it would cost a minimum of 600 million to 
preserve all remaining american movies on nitrate film a highly 
flammable film that eventually deteriorates into gunpowder 
other library officials said the cost of restoring those movies 
and transferring them to safety film is probably closer to 1 
billion or more the librarys annual budget for film preservation 
is about 300000 officials said 
billington said the library is still trying to obtain archival 
quality originals of two films selected last year for deposit in 
its national film collection they are some like it hot the 
billy wilder movie of 1959 and the best years of our lives of 
1946 
so far library officials said six of the 50 listed in the 
national film registry have been released in colorized versions on 
videotape cassettes 
under the 1988 law those taped copies must carry a label noting 
that they are colorized versions of black and white films that were 
altered without the participation of the principal director 
screenwriter and other creators of the original film 
the six are the maltese falcon casablanca bringing 
up baby the treasure of the sierra madre top hat and 
its a wonderful life officials said

a robotic arm once used in an auto assembly 
plant has been programmed to spread tomato sauce sprinkle cheese 
and toss pepperoni onto pizzas in a plan to help handicapped people 
work in restaurants 
carnegie mellon universitys pizzabot which takes orders 
verbally and warbles back the command in a computergenerated 
voice was unveiled wednesday at a pittsburgh pizzeria 
the robots developers say it should open up the food service 
job market which needs workers to the handicapped by performing 
tasks they cannot the technology already is used in the auto and 
electronics industries 
this is an effort to bring humans very intimately into the 
loop of robot technology said kg englehardt director of the 
universitys center for human service robotics wed like to 
level the playing field in business for the handicapped 
developers say applications extend beyond helping the 
handicapped citing the increase in repetitive strain injuries to 
the wrists and hands and potential dangers in restaurant kitchens 
humans are thinkers by nature were not good at repetitive 
tasks said roger edwards president of intervention technologies 
inc which built the arm just as we created forklifts when it 
became inhuman to lift with our backs were learning of the 
injuries caused by repetitive menial work 
the pizzabot which formerly twiddled knobs on dashboards in 
general motors corp cars stands in the center of a semicircle of 
nine bins its dimensions match those of a human arm with elbow 
and wrist joints and two pinchers for fingers 
the arm drops up to nine toppings on pizza dough placed on a 
spinning stainless steel disc fluidly and silently it levels the 
toppings with a ladle passing less than an inch over the surface 
of the pizza 
ms englehardt proud of the robots smooth movements said the 
arm is a descendant of robots she programmed to dance ballet 
psychologically its important it move like a human moves 
she said no one likes to see these jerky motions thats 
scary 
ms englehardt said the robot and a handicapped worker together 
would be able to do the work of one nonhandicapped employee human 
hands still must shape the dough and place the pie in an oven 
the arm was displayed at foxs pizza den on pittsburghs north 
side and will be used to help train the handicapped for jobs in the 
food industry 
james fox chairman of a chain of 130 stores in six states with 
headquarters in nearby monroeville said he hopes a handicapped 
franchisee will be able to open a shop complete with a robot 
within two years 
with the meat and potatoes of pizza making in the robots hands 
a handicapped owner should have more time to manage his business 
affairs said tom poppa who owns foxs stores in irwin and 
monroeville 
its still the american dream to own your own business 
poppa said 
foxs cmu and pittsburgh human services industries and 
charities founded robotic assisted employment a partnership trying 
to place robots in the regions restaurants cafeterias and airline 
kitchens 
fox whose father was a disabled war veteran said he was 
motivated to help handicapped people because of frustration he saw 
while growing up by spending my weekends in veterans 
hospitals

north korean communist dictator kim il 
sung on thursday offered to meet south koreas president for the 
first time since the korean peninsula was divided four decades ago 
his offer was contingent on progress in highlevel talks between 
the enemy neighbors but it was seen as a positive step toward 
easing tension 
the 78yearold kim head of one of the worlds most closed 
societies and the longestruling communist dictator told south 
koreas premier he hoped for progress in a third round of 
northsouth premiers talks 
the second round of talks finished thursday in north koreas 
capital of pyongyang with no tangible results both sides claimed 
their differences had narrowed and they agreed to meet again in 
seoul dec 1114 
if the december talks come off as scheduled it will mean the 
rival koreas will have met three times in roughly three months to 
discuss facetoface issues at the senior levels of government 
the issues being discussed at the premiers talks would also 
be discussed at the summit talks kim told south korean premier 
kang younghoon i want the prime ministers to do a lot of work 
so that summit talks can be held and bring about good 
results 
he said the talks between kang and north korean premier yon 
hyong muk must show visible results before a summit can be 
planned 
the premiers contacts are the highest level talks between the 
two sides since the peninsula was divided in 1945 and they hold 
great symbolic value as a meeting of two enemy nations the two 
koreas fought a threeyear war in the early 1950s a peace treaty 
was never signed 
the border between them is tightly sealed and remains one of the 
most heavily fortified in the world with 15 million troops on 
either side 
the next and most significant step toward easing decades of 
confrontation and beginning efforts toward unification would be a 
summit between the communist leader of north korea and the 
capitalist leader of south korea 
south korean president roh taewoo has called repeatedly for a 
summit meeting but north korea has not responded 
kims willingness to even consider a summit is surprising to 
many south koreans who for years have assumed change can only occur 
when the north korean leader is dead 
partially for that reason south korea is obsessed with kim il 
sungs health television reports of thursdays meetings talked 
excessively about kims apparently robust health his erect 
stature his lack of a reported limp and his voice which was 
slightly hoarse 
there was no immediate official south korean response to kims 
comments but officials said privately they viewed them as a step 
forward in efforts to improve relations 
the south korean delegation returns to seoul on friday 
reports of the two days of talks in pyongyang said the 
differences narrowed on two different proposals calling for among 
other things mutual recognition nonaggression and arms 
reductions 
south korea proposed a joint statement requiring both sides to 
recognize each others government and cooperate through 
multilateral exchanges north korea insisted on a declaration of 
nonaggression 
in another development thursday south korean opposition leader 
kim daejung said he would end his 11dayold hunger strike and

the senate today voted 5545 to defeat an 
effort to raise taxes on the rich and moderate a medicare premium 
increase as it struggled to complete work on a deficitreduction 
plan 
the vote killed an amendment by sens albert gore dtenn and 
barbara mikulski dmd that would have scaled back increases in 
gasoline taxes and medicare premiums and substituted a 
houseapproved threepronged attack on those with higher incomes 
the amendment was one of more than two dozen ready for senate 
consideration many of which have been designed to move the senate 
bill closer to the soaktherich package that won house approval 
tuesday 
do we want to ask senior citizens in the hospital to pay more 
so the wealthiest in our society can pay less gore asked before 
the vote on his amendment 
the middle class has no more to give ms mikulski said 
democratic leaders praised the aim of the amendment but said it 
would have killed the deficitreduction package because president 
bush has promised to veto any plan raising the top tax rate on the 
wealthiest americans to 33 percent the proposal would have raised 
that rate from 28 percent 
what we have tried to do is put together a package the 
president will sign said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman 
of the finance committee there is substantial divergence with 
what came out of the house we will end up with something that 
is in between 
the budget bill is on a fast track that congressional leaders 
hope could place it on bushs desk for his signature friday night 
without final action or at least considerable progress on such 
a package bush has said hell shut down the government saturday 
morning when federal spending authority is due to expire 
a key element of the senates deficit plan is a 9cent increase 
in the gasoline tax the senate voted wednesday to leave that 
provision intact the goremikulski amendment would have provided a 
6cent increase 
the amendment would have been attached to a measure raising 
taxes and reducing benefit programs by 250 billion over the next 
five years 
in addition to increasing the tax rate for the wealthiest 
americans the goremikulski plan proposed imposing a 10 percent 
surtax on those with taxable incomes over 1 million and raising to 
25 percent the alternative minimum tax designed to snare welltodo 
investors who have so many deductions that they might otherwise 
escape any tax 
the senate package appeared to be in considerable trouble 
wednesday after sen steven symms ridaho proposed stripping the 
9cent increase in the gasoline tax the issue wasnt settled 
until almost 14 hours later just before midnight when the senate 
heeded pleas from democratic and republican leaders and used a 
procedural vote to dispose of symms amendment 
once again the american people are going to have their pockets 
picked symms protested 
a vote for this amendment is a vote to destroy this effort at 
deficit reduction countered majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine no senator who votes for the symms amendment should have 
the temerity to go anywhere and say they are trying to reduce the 
deficit 
symms amendment which was put aside on a 5940 vote probably 
was the biggest challenge facing the bipartisan proposal 
in addition to raising the 9cent gasoline tax and the 15cent 
tax on diesel by 9 cents a gallon the bill would boost taxes on 
alcoholic beverages tobacco and such luxuries as expensive cars 
boats furs and jewelry 
it would require retirees to pay slightly more for medicare 
coverage of doctors bills limit itemized deductions of people 
making more than 100000 a year and raise to 89000 the 51300 
maximum wage against which the 145 percent medicare tax is 
applied 
a bigger package was shot down by the senate on a 6732 vote 
sponsored by sens kent conrad dnd and max baucus dmont 
it would have included those three tax increases on the wealthy 
moderated the gas tax increase and medicare charges restored half 
of 15 billion in farmprogram cuts that would be required for 
deficit reduction and eliminated the proposed limitation on 
itemized deductions claimed by higherincome people 
raising the gasoline tax in the name of deficit reduction is one 
of the less popular ideas in congress the house would not accept a 
package that included such an increase and senators were told 
wednesday that drivers would rebel 
the 250 billion in tax increases and tightening of medicare and 
other benefits represents about half a promised 500 billion 
deficitreduction plan the remainder still working its way 
through congress would come from reductions in appropriations and 
in interest the government pays for borrowing

under pressure from cabinet hardliners the 
foreign minister on thursday backed off a promise he made to the 
united states that israel would not settle more soviet immigrants 
in arab east jerusalem 
the change could affect 400 million in loan guarantees the bush 
administration approved last week after receiving the ministers 
promise 
the change of position by foreign minister david levy came in a 
letter to secretary of state james a baker iii the letter was 
sent thursday and read aloud on israel radio a foreign minstry 
official confirmed its contents 
levy said in the letter that he wanted to clarify differing 
interpretations of a letter he signed oct 2 while visiting the 
united states to secure the loan guarantees to help finance housing 
for soviet jews 
in the oct 2 letter levy wrote that israels policy is not 
to direct or settle soviet jews beyond the green line the green 
line divides arab territories captured by israel from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 war the west bank gaza strip and east 
jerusalem from israel proper 
but in his new letter levy said he made no commitment 
directly or indirectly not to house soviet jews in east 
jerusalem or even in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
he said however that us funds would not be used to build 
such settlements 
the bush administration considers east jerusalem occupied land 
along with the west bank and gaza strip it has opposed settlement 
of jews on such land as an obstacle to ending the arabisraeli 
conflict under the us policy calling for trading occupied land 
for peace 
prime minister yitzhak shamir also sought thursday to reverse 
any us conditions that levy agreed to in his first letter 
whomever accepts these conditions doesnt mean he agrees to all 
these limitations always and under all circumstances shamir said 
on the radio without elaborating 
the issue of the loan guarantees has become entangled with 
israels anger over last weeks un security council resolution 
condemning the jewish state for the police killings of 19 
palestinians in a riot on the temple mount 
on sunday israels cabinet rejected the resolution and said it 
would not accept a un investigation of the killings which 
occurred in east jerusalem on what israel considers sovereign 
territory 
that same day housing minister ariel sharon announced that he 
planned to build up to 17000 new housing units for soviet 
immigrants in jerusalem in the next three years most in the arab 
eastern sector in announcing the plans sharon said we never 
obligated ourselves not to build in jerusalem never levy made 
the promise to baker before the oct 8 temple mount riots and has 
been called to task since by shamir and sharon 
at the same time the issue has arisen in washington and baker 
has said he considers levys commitment on housing to apply to east 
jerusalem baker told reporters tuesday we think the united 
states is and should be entitled to rely upon assurances received 
from the foreign minister of israel 
but levy said in his latest letter that was not the case 
he wrote i want to make sure that you are aware that it the 
earlier letter made no commitment either directly or indirectly 
to refrain from building in east jerusalem or restricting it or 
in any other place including judea samaria and gaza 
judea and samaria are the biblical names for the west bank 
the united states took months to negotiate the loan guarantees 
with israel at a time when it was trying to bring together israeli 
and palestinian delegates in the first preliminary peace talks 
between the two sides 
it was also when palestinian leaders and arab states were 
complaining that the housing of soviet jews in the occupied 
territories could push out the 17 million palestinians who live 
there 
only several hundred soviet families are believed to have 
settled in the west bank or gaza but more than 3000 soviets have 
moved to east jerusalem where israel has built a ring of jewish 
suburbs around the arab city about 140000 palestinians live in 
east jerusalem along with about 120000 jews 
israel receives 12 billion in us economic aid annually and 
is the largest recipient of us assistance

the pentagon on thursday criticized major 
parts of the 1991 military budget approved by congressional 
negotiators but a spokesman said defense secretary dick cheney had 
not decided whether to recommend a presidential veto 
cheney is on an official visit to the soviet union he has been 
apprised by his pentagon office of wednesdays outcome of house and 
senate negotiations on defense spending for the fiscal year that 
began oct 1 said spokesman bob hall 
the bill sets military spending at 288 billion or 19 billion 
less than the bush administration requested last january the bill 
which must be approved by the full house and senate sharply 
reduces spending on major strategic weapons programs and imposes 
larger troops cuts than bush had sought 
hall said he could not say whether cheney will recommend that 
bush veto the bill and that the defense secretary wont know all 
the measures details until it is filed formally in the house and 
senate probably on friday 
hall said that while he could not speak for cheney on specific 
aspects of the spending bill others in the pentagon have raised 
numerous objections 
for example he said the 29 billion budgeted for the 
strategic defense initiative is nearly 2 billion less than bush 
requested and 900 million less than congress provided last year 
for the antimissile research program 
hall also cited a provision in the bill requiring a cut of 
100000 troops from the 21 million now in uniform cheney had 
urged congress to hold the cuts to 80000 
the pentagon also is unhappy with a provision that establishes 
new procedures for closing military bases hall said this would set 
up a cumbersome process that appears to be designed to delay and 
deter and prevent management decisions 
although the bill makes deeper cuts in military spending and 
troop levels than bush had proposed sen john warner of virginia 
the ranking republican on the armed services committee said he 
believed the president would not veto the measure 
im optimistic that the president will sign this bill the 
best that could be achieved in this conference given the 
circumstances fiscally warner said wednesday

a moderate earthquake jolted orange 
county in southern california today breaking glass but causing no 
injuries or serious damage 
the 1021 am quake a year and a day after the major quake in 
northern california measured 40 on the richter scale and was 
centered one mile north of costa mesa said dorothy jennings of the 
california institute of technology 
it was a pretty good jolt said susan maples spokeswoman 
for south coast plaza one of the nations largest shopping malls 
which is located close to the epicenter we all got up in the 
doorway 
she said the only damage discovered immediately was a single 
fallen ceiling tile at the may co crystal department sales clerk 
ursula yang said a few things fell off the shelves and broke 
costa mesa is about 50 miles southeast of downtown los angeles 
at disneyland in nearby anaheim we certainly felt it said 
spokesman bob roth i dont think the people in the park felt it 
though there was no response there was no damage 
everybody looked a little peaked for a minute there but 
nothing fell down or anything he said 
dan carpenter service manager at a vons supermarket about four 
miles southwest of the epicenter said the stores only loss was 
about six bottles of wine that fell from a shelf canned goods also 
were knocked off shelves 
gary gray owner of orange coast jeepeagle inc in costa mesa 
said it was a severe jolt the showroom is covered with glass 
and we lost about four panes of 4 foot by 12 foot each no one 
was hurt he said 
police reported no injuries 
it hit home real hard just boom you could feel the rattle 
and roll coming like that wave effect said officer bob crogan 
of the costa mesa police department 
a magnitude 40 to 49 quake on the richter scale of ground 
motion is considered small to moderate and is capable of producing 
some local damage 
the quake of oct 17 1989 which measured 71 on the richter 
scale killed 67 people and caused an estimated 7 billion in 
damage in the san franciscooakland area of northern california

here is a look at the fiscal condition of the nations 10 
largest cities along with standard amp poors rating of each citys 
ability to repay its bond investors the highest possible rating is 
aaa then aa then a plus and so forth the lowest possible rating 
is d the cities are listed by population size beginning with the 
largest 
 
new york 
standard amp poors bond rating a 
new york city is facing its worst fiscal crisis since it nearly 
went bankrupt in the mid1970s mayor david dinkins is trying to 
plug a 18 billion budget deficit in this fiscal years budget he 
announced plans tuesday for 13 billion in cuts including layoffs 
of least 15000 city workers 
the city also has a major crime problem and on oct 2 dinkins 
announced plans to hire nearly 8000 more police officers as part 
of a fouryear 19 billion effort but its proposed financing 
remains in doubt 
 
los angeles 
bond rating aa 
a relatively healthy economy coupled with stringent legislative 
spending caps have prevented serious fiscal woes from besetting los 
angeles 
however the 36 billion budget approved by the city council in 
june provided for 6 percent cuts in all city departments except 
police emergency medical services and sanitation mayor tom 
bradley said the cuts in the 199091 spending plan were intended to 
maneuver a soft landing in order to prevent a crash later 
bradley also declared a municipal hiring freeze that began in 
march and lasted through june 30 
 
chicago 
bond rating a 
mayor richard m daley has proposed a 31 billion 1991 budget 
based on the assumption the city will keep collecting revenues from 
what is now a temporary income tax surcharge but if the illinois 
general assembly doesnt extend the surcharge beyond june 1991 the 
budget would be 75 million short 
daley indicated he would propose a supplemental budget in that 
likelihood and cautioned that essential services may have to be 
cut 
the budget includes funds for an additional 600 police officer 
and for pay raises worth 71 million to the citys unionized 
workers as required by contract 
 
houston 
bond rating aa 
after struggling through economic hard times brought on by the 
collapse in oil prices in the 1980s the nations energy capital 
has enjoyed a modest recovery the last several years 
there have been no budget cuts for the 1990 fiscal year that 
began july 1 and no layoffs for the first time in several years 
the city has seen an increase in property tax values 
 
philadelphia 
bond rating ccc 
philadelphia faces a 206 million deficit in the fiscal year 
that ends next june 30 mayor w wilson goode has frozen hiring and 
delayed pension fund payments and tax refunds but the city expects 
to go broke by dec 1 
few taxes can be raised or added without state approval the 
wage tax already is among the nations highest a proposal to 
impose a halfcent sales tax on top of the states 6 percent tax 
was passed by the city council but awaits action in the 
legislature the increase would only raise 45 million a year 
further budget cuts are difficult because many expenses are locked 
in by longterm labor contracts 
 
detroit 
bond rating bbb 
longstanding fiscal problems could worsen because of a fluke of 
michigan law the law allows cities with a population of 1 million 
or more to impose special taxes on utilities and paychecks detroit 
had been the only city to qualify but preliminary 1990 census 
figures put detroits population at 970000 
the utility tax generates more than 50 million annually while 
the income tax brings in 190 million detroits budget is about 
19 billion mayor coleman a young has threatened vast layoffs if 
the state doesnt extend the utility tax 
 
san diego 
bond rating aa plus 
the 199091 budget is 956 million although it was san diegos 
largest ever mayoral spokesman paul downy said the city had to 
freeze some services at the 198990 level 
theres been a slight decline in city services but we had no 
option short of raising taxes and thats something we didnt want 
to do downey said still downey added that the city is in good 
financial shape overall he said officials are continuing efforts 
to recessionproof the city 
 
dallas 
bond rating aaa 
fiscal analysts nationwide point to dallas as an example of a 
city that has weathered tough times by hewing to fiscal 
conservatism 
the 199091 budget included some staff cuts to pay for an 
increase in police staffing overall spending was cut by slightly 
more than 8 million to 1006 billion 
cynthia marietta director of budget research said the city 
tried to make cuts without hurting essential services 
 
san antonio 
bond rating aa 
san antonio has faced financial problems the past two fiscal 
years in september the city council adopted a 7742 million 
budget that required the elimination of 225 jobs and an 8 percent 
tax rate increase 
the services cut include public works parks and recreation and 
libraries there was much public debate about paying for school 
crossing guards until a restaurant chain agreed to help pay for the 
service 
 
phoenix 
bond rating aa plus 
city officials announced delays last month for about 200 
capitalimprovement projects which now will take eight years 
instead of five the phoenix real estate market remains in a slump 
and city officials said the timetable revision was needed because 
of slow growth in assessed valuations for property taxes

israeli troops shot and wounded 35 palestinians 
with live ammunition and rubber bullets on thursday in seven hours 
of clashes fueled by army efforts to set up a new lookout post in a 
gaza strip refugee camp 
the incident reflected the continuing tension in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip over the temple mount killings on oct 8 
in jerusalem 
prime minister yitzhak shamir appealed again thursday to the 
united states and other nations to put the temple mount incident 
behind them and refocus their attention on the persian gulf crisis 
he defended israels rejection of a un factfinding team 
saying it challenged israels control of jerusalem israel seized 
east jerusalem the west bank and gaza strip in the 1967 middle 
east war 
israel can in no way sign with its own hands a verdict 
abandoning its sovereignty over jerusalem shamir told army 
radio 
we call on our friends to turn the poor page to wipe it off 
and to concentrate again on the main mission curbing the terrible 
threat to peace and stability in this part of the world shamir 
said 
residents of the gaza strips rafah camp said the incident began 
when soldiers raised an israeli flag on a rooftop in the center of 
the camp 
scores of teenagers began throwing stones and at least eight 
military jeeps full of soldiers were sent to try to restore order 
the residents told arab reporters 
the entire camp was in turmoil for seven hours one said 
the army said in a statement that an army unit in rafah was 
attacked massively by stones it said soldiers responded by 
firing plastic bullets in a controlled fashion 
an army official confirmed on condition of anonymity that the 
soldiers were setting up a lookout post and said the camp reaction 
was not expected 
arab hospitals said 35 palestinians were treated for bullet 
wounds most from live ammunition the army put the toll at 26 and 
said most had light wounds 
on oct 8 israeli police opened fire on palestinian rioters on 
the temple mount in jerusalem killing at least 19 arabs and 
wounding 140 others the shooting came after the rioters threw 
stones on jewish worshipers at the wailing wall below the wall is 
also known as the western wall 
it was the worst violence in the 34monthold palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
some 761 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or 
civilians in the uprising and an additional 281 were slain by 
other arabs as suspected proisraeli collaborators fortyeight 
israelis also have died 
the temple mount located in east jerusalem is the most 
sensitive spot in the arabisraeli conflict jews revere it as the 
site of their ancient temple to moslems it is the place where the 
prophet mohammed ascended to heaven 
israel has launched its own investigation into the shooting 
deaths and the threeman commission headed by a former mossad spy 
chief zvi zamir is expected to conclude its probe next week 
in jerusalem on thursday city police commanders were quoted as 
saying that a force of paramilitary border policemen reportedly 
deployed without police knowledge on the temple mount may have 
fueled last weeks riot 
the disclosure on israel radio was the first israeli suggestion 
that police might have provoked the violence at the holy site not 
palestinian demonstrators 
arab witnesses have claimed police set off the violence by 
firing tear gas then rubber bullets and live ammunition at arabs 
on the mount 
the radio report did not identify the police commanders but said 
they made the statement to the zamir commission which has kept its 
findings private 
jerusalem police spokesman aharon elhayani declined comment 
border police commanders rejected the claims saying they had 
documents proving there had been advance notification of the 
paramilitary posting the radio reported

twentyfive american movies as old as the 
great train robbery of 1903 and as recent as raging bull in 
1980 were named thursday to the national film registry of the 
library of congress as outstanding films worthy of historic 
preservation 
the list was announced by james h billington the librarian of 
congress under terms of a 1988 statute that established the 
registry to honor 25 films a year deemed culturally historically 
or aesthetically significant 
this is not academy awards night billington told a news 
conference these are not annual lists of the best american 
films 
rather he said they were chosen because they impressively 
display the depth and variety of the american creative spirit in 
filmmaking 
this years selections join the first 25 films chosen last year 
for the registry listed alphabetically the 1990 choices are 
all about eve made in 1950 by director joseph l 
mankiewicz all quiet on the western front 1930 directed by 
lewis milestone bringing up baby 1938 produced and directed 
by howard hawks dodsworth 1936 directed by william wyler 
duck soup the marx brothers classic made in 1933 walt 
disneys fantasia made in 1940 
also harold lloyds the freshman made in 1925 francis 
coppolas the godfather 1972 edwin s porters the great 
train robbery a 12minute classic made in 1903 harlan county 
usa 1973 directed by barbara kopple john fords how green 
was my valley 1941 frank capras its a wonderful life 
1946 
also charles burnetts killer of sheep 1977 love me 
tonight produced and directed by rouben mamoulian 1932 
meshes of the afternoon an 18minute film directed by maya 
deren in 1943 ninotchka a 1939 greta garbo film directed by 
ernst lubitsch primary a time inc film made in 1960 
also raging bull directed by martin scorsese 1980 
rebel without a cause the james dean movie of 1955 red 
river made by howard hawks 1948 the river a 32minute 
farm security administration film made in 1937 sullivans 
travels a preston sturges film made in 1941 
also top hat a 1935 musical starring fred astaire and 
ginger rogers the treasure of the sierra madre directed by 
john huston 1948 and a woman under te influence directed by 
john cassavetes 1974 
the list was based on 1500 nominations made by the public and 
narrowed by a 14member national film preservation board 
representing the academy of motion picture arts and sciences the 
american film institute movie and television producers directors 
broadcasters screen writers the screen actors guild of america 
film critics and scholars 
the final choices were made by billington a cultural historian 
and movie buff based on consultations with advisers including the 
staff of the librarys division of motion picture broadcasting and 
recorded sound 
films are eligible for the registry 10 years after their first 
theatrical release they need not necessarily be american films 
the library said but the first 50 movies in the registry all were 
made in the united states 
the library of congress contains the nations largest film 
archive and accounts for more than half the number of films 
preserved in the united states even so billington said half of 
all movies made before 1950 and 80 percent of those made before 
1930 are lost forever 
the cold hard fact is that for all their popularity in 
america today films are an endangered species for the america of 
tomorrow he said 
billington estimated it would cost a minimum of 600 million to 
preserve all remaining american movies on nitrate film a highly 
flammable film that eventually deteriorates into gunpowder 
other library officials said the cost of restoring those movies 
and transferring them to safety film is probably closer to 1 
billion or more the librarys annual budget for film preservation 
is about 300000 officials said 
billington said the library is still trying to obtain archival 
quality originals of two films selected last year for deposit in 
its national film collection they are some like it hot the 
billy wilder movie of 1959 and the best years of our lives of 
1946 
so far library officials said six of the 50 listed in the 
national film registry have been released in colorized versions on 
videotape cassettes 
under the 1988 law those taped copies must carry a label noting 
that they are colorized versions of black and white films that were 
altered without the participation of the principal director 
screenwriter and other creators of the original film 
the six are the maltese falcon casablanca bringing 
up baby the treasure of the sierra madre top hat and 
its a wonderful life officials said

freedom for british hostages in lebanon 
may take time if the restoration of diplomatic ties between syria 
and britain is made a condition for their release a western 
diplomatic source said thursday 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity also said he 
saw no linkage between british and us hostages he said there was 
nothing special to indicate any us hostages would be freed 
soon 
the western source responded to comments made by syrian foreign 
minister farouk alsharaa on wednesday to the nbc television 
network 
in the interview alshaara said the proiranian extremists 
holding most of the 13 westerners missing in lebanon would take the 
hostage issue more seriously if ties were restored between syria 
and britain 
i can say securing the release of the british hostages would 
be easier if theres a diplomatic relationship between syria and 
britain alsharaa said 
when the hostagetakers know that syria and britain have 
restored ties certainly theyll take more seriously our pressure 
and our efforts he said 
the missing westerners are six americans four britons two 
germans and an italian the longestheld is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped 
on march 16 1985 
on thursday sharaa told british journalists that syria would 
keep working to win the release of british hostages backtracking 
from his comments to nbc 
syria is the main powerbroker in lebanon and previous hostage 
releases have depended on syrian help 
britain broke relations with syria in october 1986 after 
claiming it had evidence syrian air force intelligence was involved 
inan abortive attempt to put a bomb aboard an israeli airliner at 
londons heathrow airport 
syria has denied involvement 
the western source said both iran and syria have concluded that 
continued captivity for the hostages is in neither nations 
interest 
he said the recent syrianled removal of rebel lebanese gen 
michel aoun in east beirut will have a positive effect on the 
hostages because of the diminished role of militias that will 
follow 
beirut newspapers have reported that one of the british 
hostages anglican church envoy terry waite would be freed soon 
but informed sources with some knowledge of the negotiations to 
free the captives said another briton journalist john mccarthy 
would be released before waite 
waite disappeared jan20 1987 in beirut mccarthy was 
kidnapped in beirut on april 17 1986 no group has claimed to hold 
either man but they are believed to be the captives of proiranian 
shiite moslem groups

a diverse coalition is taking to the 
airwaves handing out leaflets and holding teachins in an effort 
to awaken opposition to us intervention in the middle east 
a round of protests began thursday at harvard university where 
students and faculty held teachins reminiscent of the vietnam era 
the events continue through saturday when rallies are planned in 
at least 15 cities 
television ads opposing us intervention and starring vietnam 
veteran ron kovic aired for the first time thursday and support 
was widening for a marine corporal facing courtmartial in honolulu 
after he refused to go to saudi arabia with his unit 
the response weve been getting is tremendous versus how long 
it took to build up opposition to the vietnam war said charles 
twist spokesman for the new york coalition to stop us 
intervention in the middle east 
this time though the coalition members range from veterans 
groups and labor unions to disabled people and environmentalists 
groups representing the homeless and the elderly also are involved 
a protest march on saturday in new york city will begin in harlem 
its a big step forward from the 60s when the majority of the 
antiwar movement was mostly white and mostly students twist 
said 
organizers credit this apparent broad appeal not only to 
concerns about the morality of sending soldiers to the middle east 
but also to the cost 
the front pages are full of the budget crisis twist said 
it doesnt take much to make the connection that were spending 
billions to keep our troops there at the same time were cutting 
social security 
antiintervention leaders who complain they have been virtually 
ignored by mainstream media said the word is being spread 
theres been very little negative response and not a lot of 
leaflets end up on the ground said phebe eckfeldt spokeswoman 
for the new england coalition to stop us intervention in the 
middle east 
veterans group have been particularly active in the opposition 
the days of us veterans blindly supporting their government 
are over since vietnam said winston warfield president of the 
400member smedley d butler brigade of veterans for peace us 
soldiers are being asked to pay the ultimate price in a war for oil 
and to protect the grotesque profits of multinational oil 
interests 
kovic author of born on the fourth of july stars in a 
30second television spot funded by money raised from veteran and 
peace groups and airing in 50 us cities in it he says american 
troops are risking their lives not to defend democracy but to 
protect the big oil companies kovic is scheduled to address a 
los angeles rally saturday 
labor unions also have been drawn to the protests 
youve got inflation budget cuts joblessness and now the 
war said nan genger an organizer for a united auto workers 
local that is cosponsoring the rally scheduled for boston 
working people are under attack 
besides los angeles new york and boston protests are planned 
on saturday for albuquerque nm birmingham ala chicago 
cleveland honolulu houston minneapolis olympia wash 
portland ore san diego san francisco and seattle 
they follow rallies held on tuesday in honolulu washington 
houston seattle and san francisco in support of jeffrey paterson 
a 22yearold marine corporal who refused to go to the middle east 
with his unit 
there also are events planned saturday supporting us forces in 
the middle east 
in atlanta where protesters plan to gather at a downtown 
induction center saturday families of soldiers stationed in the 
gulf have scheduled a counterdemonstration 
and in savannah ga residents will bake and airlift 120000 
brownies to the 24th infantry division now in saudi arabia 
president bush who has been heckled along the campaign trail 
this week has defended the us involvement amid signs of 
decreasing public support 
the bottom line for us is iraqi aggression will not be allowed 
to stand saddam hussein will be held accountable and the 
legitimate government of kuwait will be restored bush said 
tuesday 
a recent washington postabc news poll showed 60 percent of 
people questioned believe the united states should keep troops in 
the region until iraq withdraws from kuwait five weeks ago the 
figure had been 75 percent

a university will return rare copies of 
works by wolfgang amadeus mozart and other composers apparently 
stolen from an austrian monastery at the end of world war ii 
officials said thursday 
we are sad to see them go said john roberts chief music 
librarian for the university of california at berkeley 
the 18 manuscripts include religious works by mozart and michael 
haydn transcribed by monks in the 18th century and s an evening mass 
and liturgical works by 
lesserknown composers roberts said 
an austrian music expert noticed this year that there were 
several references to the missing works in a catalogue published by 
ucberkeley in 1988 
they inquired and we investigated roberts said it became 
clear to us that they had been unlawfully removed during the war 
and it seemed appropriate that they be returned 
the manuscripts are important but not priceless parts of the 
berkeley music library roberts said they include 13 copies of 
austrian church music and five schubert songs many of which are 
unpublished roberts said 
ucberkeley has one of the worlds foremost music collections

washington state public power officials 
said thursday they will ask the nuclear regulatory commission to 
extend a construction permit for a nuclear power plant now in 
mothballs 
an extension for the no 1 plant at the hanford nuclear 
reservation would give the washington public power supply system 
the option of completing the plant that was 63 percent finished 
when construction came to a halt in 1982 
this appears to be the first time any operator has indicated 
interest in resuming construction of a commercial nuclear power 
plant that was put on hold over the last decade said frank 
miraglia deputy director of the nrcs office of nuclear reactor 
regulation 
wppss officials told nrc staff members during a meeting at 
commission headquarters that they have not decided whether they 
want to complete the systems no 1 plant at hanford or another 
mothballed facility the no 3 plant at satsop wash 
the no 3 plant was 76 percent done when work stopped in 1983 
construction at the plants was halted due to the default of 
municipal bonds and a sharp downturn in energy demand 
the no 3 plants federal construction permit is good until 
1999 but the nrc permit issued for the no 1 plant in 1975 will 
expire in june 
gerry sorensen wppsss manager of regulatory programs said the 
supply system will ask the nrc probably in february or marc to 
extend the construction permit for the hanford plant but we have 
no direction at this time to pick up the hammer and start building 
again he said 
during thursdays meeting wppss officials sought the nrcs 
cooperation in identifying potential roadblocks to licensing the 
plants and reviewing proposed solutions to such concerns 
we would like to enhance the licensability of the plants 
said don bouchey the supply systems director of licensing and 
assurance 
sorensen said he could foresee no problems that would be show 
stoppers issues that would stop us dead in our tracks 
miraglia said the nrc will be happy to cooperate but regulators 
will need more specific plans before they can review the licensing 
potential 
energy demands in the pacific northwest are expected to increase 
over the next 20 years due to economic growth and the potential for 
reduced hydroelectric power as a result of anticipated 
environmental protection in rivers where salmon spawn sorensen 
said

the american civil liberties union and a 
national guard official on thursday criticized mayor marion barrys 
suggestion that curfews be imposed and troops called out to help 
slow the number of drugrelated homicides in the nations capital 
barry said wednesday night that the citys drug wars and 
homicide rate are out of control he said he may impose a 
curfewto keep drug dealers off city streets and may ask president 
bush to send national guard troops to conduct traffic patrols and 
help man roadblocks in drugravaged areas 
but the aclu and the guard were cool to the proposals thursday 
we dont like the idea of curfews in general and we certainly 
look upon any curfew with suspicion said arthur spitzer legal 
director of the national capital chapter of the american civil 
liberties union one of the elements of a constitutional curfew 
would be that it would be a shortterm response to an emergency 
not an ongoing response to an enduring problem 
said district of columbia national guard spokesman harry dorsey 
the military is not permit before soldiers could patrol the streets 
the president would 
have to declare an emergency dorsey added 
typically the guard is called out after earthquakes other 
natural disasters riots or other shortterm things dorsey 
said declaring an emergency for an enduring problem could be 
done but it would be unusual he said 
the mayors remarks came as the city grappled to control a sharp 
increase in homicides which are already on pace to set a new 
record for the third year in a row nine homicides were reported 
last weekend as of thursday 373 slayings were recorded so far 
this year police blame more than 60 percent of the killings on 
drugs 
barry who is awaiting sentencing on one misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charge made his comments at a candidates forum he is 
not seeking reelection but is running for a seat on the dc 
council 
city council member john ray noted that barry opposed involving 
the guard in the citys drug war two years ago but is considering 
that option just three weeks before the election 
its real interesting that the mayor has gotten religion on 
the national guard said ray who opposes calling in the guard 
i think this is the mayors new platform ray unsuccessfully 
sought the democratic nomination for mayor this year but will keep 
his seat on the council 
two attempts by the dc council to institute a curfew in the 
past two years were struck down in federal court on constitutional 
grounds 
there may be a curfew law somewhere that has withstood 
constitutional scrutiny but if there is i am unaware of it 
us district judge charles r richey ruled in striking down a city 
law barring youths under the age of 18 from congregating on city 
streets at night 
the aclu had complained that the law violated teenagers right 
of assembly and also prohibited them from traveling to and from 
legitimate activities like band practice and athletic events 
the national guard already assists the city police departments 
drug war by providing sophisticated surveillance equipment and 
helicopters for monitoring drug activity dorsey said 
if we are asked to do more than that the city in effect would 
be turning their powers over to us dorsey said 
barry said that before deciding on his next step he will assess 
whether a new 100officer homicide task force reduces the 
killings

a police officer stretched the truth when 
he reported having a prisoner in custody 
officer will platts did take a prisoner tuesday but the guilty 
party was a 7footplus 25pound boa constrictor and for a while 
it was platts arm that was in custody 
platts made the arrest after answering a call from alton ray 
kelly about 1015 pm a reluctant bystander held a flashlight to 
the snakes head while platts picked it up 
the snake got a little irritated when i picked him up he 
hissed a little bit platts said i thought well ive got 
him now what am i going to do with him 
nobody in the neighborhood acknowledged ownership or even 
knowledge of the snake 
so much to my wifes dismay i brought him home until we can 
find out what to do platts said

drugstore magnate jack eckerd said he was 
misled into donating 250000 to the university of south florida 
eye institute a week before its financial collapse now he wants 
his money back 
in a sept 14 letter to university president francis borkowski 
eckerd said he was shocked to read a newspaper story about the 
private institute closing in september its building was paid off 
in a 14 million bailout from the legislature and transferred to 
the university 
i cant help but feel grossly misled eckerd wrote i feel 
our good faith and trust has been maligned 
university spokesman mark lono said borkowski would agree to 
return eckerds money but the institute foundations entire board 
of directors will make the final decision 
steve pankau an institute foundation attorney said the board 
probably would review eckerds request at its november board 
meeting 
no one has indicated an interest in going against his 
wishes pankau said

st louis county voters may oppose a 
government plan to build a dioxin incinerator at times beach when 
they go to the polls nov 6 
but a no vote isnt likely to halt the project aimed at 
cleaning up this community turned toxic ghosttown 20 miles from 
downtown st louis not with the environmental protection agency 
and missouris governor john ashcroft solidly behind the plan 
we dont have many vestiges of hope left said jerome 
wallach attorney for the neighboring town of eureka and a 
spokesman against the incinerator we fought the thing as hard as 
we could 
for months wallach and fellow members of the citizenbased 
times beach task force have been fighting the plan to build a huge 
incinerator to burn dioxintainted soil from times beach and 27 
other sites in eastern missouri 
despite assurances from federal and state environmental 
officials they doubt the incinerators safety they say it 
shouldnt be built in heavily populated st louis county or in the 
meramec river flood plain 
theyre also concerned that state and federal pledges to the 
contrary times beach will become a permanent hazardous waste 
site 
times beach has sat empty and fencedoff since 1983 when the 
government bought out the town because of the discovery of dioxin 
in the soil on the towns streets the toxic chemical was in the 
waste oil sprayed on the streets in the 1970s to keep the dust 
down 
this summer federal and state environmental officials reached a 
cleanup agreement with syntex agribusiness inc the plan calls for 
syntex to provide about 100 million in cleanup services including 
building and operating the incinerator building a levee to protect 
the incinerator from meramec river flooding and demolishing 
abandoned buildings at times beach 
syntex didnt produce the dioxin but the government considered 
the palo alto califbased firm a responsible party because the 
chemical was produced by a tenant in a verona mo plant owned by 
a company syntex later acquired 
martha steinkamp regional counsel for the epa said the plan 
adequately addresses all safety concerns she said the agency would 
go ahead with what it had determined to be the best alternative 
despite public opposition 
all thats left now is for the settlement with syntex to be 
approved by us district judge john nangle steinkamp said that 
could come before the end of the year 
were interested in getting this process through so we can 
hurry up and get the dioxin dug up and incinerated so we can 
dismantle the incinerator get out of there and return times beach 
to beneficial use steinkamp said 
ashcroft agrees said his spokeswoman yolanda murphy 
he would like to see the proposed cleanup proceed she said 
the governor feels the epa plan is the best viable alternative in 
dealing with the dioxin in a way that would protect both the health 
of the people and environment as well 
wallach said task force members had proposed the nonbinding 
referendum hoping a resounding no vote would sway state 
leaders particularly gov ashcroft 
were not going to change the epas mind wallach said 
were hoping that perhaps our elected officials will recognize 
that this is an absurd idea 
since the issue reached the november ballot ashcroft has made 
his support of the cleanup plan clear and hopes for the governors 
intervention have been all but died 
but hope springs eternal doesnt it wallach said

charities outside of united way campaigns are 
gaining an increasing share of the millions of dollars that 
american workers give through workplace campaigns a report said 
thursday 
the report was issued by the national committee for responsive 
philanthropy which has campaigned for giving workers access to 
newer and smaller charities that are not usually part of united way 
campaigns the committee representing more than 300 fundraising 
organizations was established in 1976 to monitor developments in 
philanthropy 
alternative organizations are getting 101 percent of the money 
raised in workplace campaigns the report said ten years ago it 
said alternative groups got 35 percent of the total 
among the alternative organizations are some health agencies 
such as the muscular dystrophy association international agencies 
such as care and oxfam america arts funds the united negro 
college fund and agencies which raise money for social action 
causes and womens and environmental groups 
all told united way campaigns are expected to raise 32 
billion in contributions this year twothirds of it through 
payroll deductions and other employee contribution programs 
organizations not under the united way umbrella are expected to 
raise 205 million from employee contribution programs 
we have already witnessed the dismantlement of the united 
ways monopoly of workplace fund raising said robert bothwell 
executive director of ncrp our figures indicate that the 1990s 
will produce a 20 to 25 percent market share for alternatives to 
united ways 
clark lamendola senior vice president of the united way of 
america said the report failed to make clear that united way acts 
as the campaign manager for raising most of the money collected by 
the alternative organizations 
we get the volunteers together we raise the money we print 
the pledge cards we count the money and we make sure the 
organizations get it he said 
he said the report gives the erroneous impression that these 
funds are somehow raised independently 
twothirds of the 205 million expected to be raised this year 
on behalf of the alternative organizations will be solicited by 
campaigns managed by united way lamendola said 
the ncrp report said alternative charities made their most 
significant gain in the huge combined federal campaign which 
collects contributions from federal employees 
cfc is the worlds largest workplace charity drive it solicits 
contributions from almost five million workers in 1987 it 
collected 187 million 
in 1980 united way organizations got 71 percent of all money 
collected by the federal drive by 1989 their share had fallen to 
37 percent the report said 
cfc donors have sent out a message that has been picked up by 
workplace giving campaign decision makers across the country in 
both the public and private sectors said don sodo who champions 
broader workplace fund drives 
they have demonstrated that they are interested in a wide

about 250 riot police entered the kyoto university 
campus on thursday and arrested two students occupying an office to 
protest a government plan to send troops to the persian gulf 
officials said 
in tokyo police said 80 people most of them women from a peace 
group rallied outside the foreign ministry to protest the plan 
which would allow deployment of japanese soldiers abroad for the 
first time since world war ii 
the two students at kyoto university had barricaded themselves 
inside the deans office since early wednesday in one of the first 
public protests against the measure which was introduced in 
parliament on tuesday 
there has been a surge of criticism from japanese media and 
politicians over the plan opinion polls have shown significant 
public opposition to sending japanese soldiers overseas 
opponents say the bill violates the countrys pacifist 
constitution which bars the use of force to settle international 
disputes 
government officials say the bill is constitutional because the 
military would be deployed only for noncombat duty under the 
auspices of the united nations soldiers would be allowed to carry 
small arms for selfdefense only 
the two students arrested in kyoto were charged with 
trespassing said kyoto police spokesman kenichi yoshino police 
believe the students belong to a leftist radical group chukakuha 
yoshino said about two dozen radicals demonstrated at the campus 
when the riot police arrived but there were no major incidents

officers of several degreegranting trade 
schools on thursday attacked as cruel and discriminatory a 
proposed education department rule that changes the way they would 
measure a students academic progress 
the rule among a host of regulations proposed to curb abuses 
waste and mismanagement in the embattled federal student loan 
program would redefine the academic year trade and vocational 
schools would be required to offer courses in clock hours 
rather than credit hours 
for the half million students attending careerspecific 
schools the rule would result in excessively long hours in the 
classroom and several extra years to earn a degree officers of the 
art institutes international devry inc the fashion institute of 
design amp merchandising and itt educational services inc said at a 
news briefing 
colleges universities and most community college programs would 
be excluded from the proposed rule they say 
the deadline for commenting on the rule ends this month and 
officials are lobbying the education department and congress for an 
extension so trade school officials can submit alternative ideas 
the education department under pressure from congress has 
taken a number of actions to stem student loan defaults that have 
spiralled to 78 billion a large percentage of the money is owed 
by students who attended trade or vocational schools 
robert knutson chairman of the arts institute said the 
department is trying to get at abuse and we support the 
departments goal to do that it needs to happen but our students 
already are in school more hours than other collegiate institutions 
and counterparts 
its cruel to have our kids go to school 40 hours per 
week in the classroom in order to receive the same credits and 
the same amount of financial aid as college students knutson 
said 
education secretary lauro cavazos testified last week before a 
senate committee that the clock hourcredit hour conversions are 
highly questionable he said unscrupulous institutions either 
compress or expand what they say is classwork time just to 
circumvent the minimum course length requirements and 
dramatically increase the amount of student aid funds they 
receive for the same course 
the departments inspector general learned of a school where a 
13month 1300clock hour xray technician program was reported as 
converted to 78 credit hours cavazos said 
the proposed rule published in the federal register oct 1 
requires that a semester or trimester hour include at least 375 
clock hours of instruction while a quarter hour include at least 
25 clock hours of instruction 
sharon thomasparrott of devry inc described the rule as 
discriminatory and said our students receive threefifths of 
what regular college students receive in financial aid and now 
would have to work much harder for the disproportionate share of 
student loan dollars

the united states on thursday pushed for 
the swift passage of a new security council resolution condemning 
iraqs human rights violations in kuwait and demanding the release 
of all hostages held by baghdad 
its one we hope will pass quickly a state department 
official said on condition of anonymity however no formal council 
meeting or even private consultations of the whole council have 
been scheduled 
officials were told the council might act on the resolution over 
the weekend 
the five permanent security council members have reached broad 
agreement on the resolution which also lays the groundwork for a 
system of compensation under the measure iraq would pay for 
damages stemming from its aug 2 invasion of kuwait diplomats 
said 
the british french soviet chinese and us ambassadors 
continued meeting thursday to refine the language of the 
resolution while their capitals studied its legal ramifications 
the other 10 council members may receive the text later they 
said since the five permanent members hold veto power they 
customarily reach agreement on a draft text before presenting it to 
the other 10 council members 
according to the draft resolution baghdad would be liable only 
for compensation not for punitive reparations diplomats said on 
condition of anonymity 
countries that have suffered serious economic losses stemming 
from the invasion such as jordan india sri lanka and bangladesh 
could apply for compensation out of iraqs foreign assets which 
have been frozen they could also apply for compensation from 
future oil earnings the diplomats said 
the draft would address the mistreatment of kuwaitis by iraqi 
soldiers and would also urge iraq to let all foreign hostages go 
reiterating a resolution the council passed on aug 18 
it would urge iraq to permit the sending of supplies to western 
embassies in kuwait city foreign missions in kuwait have had their 
water electricity and supplies cut off by the iraqis 
iraq says kuwait is now a province of iraq and that the 
diplomats must move their operations to baghdad 
during their private talks the five permanent security council 
members dropped a proposal for a warcrimes tribunal for iraqi 
president saddam hussein the diplomats said 
they said the ambassadors wanted to focus on humanitarian issues 
in this resolution and avoid specifically targeting saddam 
the americans in particular do not want a text on war crimes 
they fear it could spur arab appeals for similar resolutions 
holding israeli leaders individually responsible for the deaths of 
palestinians in the uprising against israeli rule in the occupied 
territories 
the united states would veto any such resolution thus 
endangering its fragile antiiraq coalition with arab states

erich honecker fell from power in east germany one 
year ago thursday and a dissident who helped topple him said its 
time to put the aging communist in a nursing home 
baerbel bohley one of the most heralded dissidents in east 
german history said she disagrees with widespread demands that the 
78yearold honecker be prosecuted 
i would find it absurd to put him before a court she said 
authorities are trying to decide whether to prosecute honecker 
on charges of corruption harboring leftist terrorists and ordering 
authorities to shoot people who tried to flee the country 
bohley however said she believes he should be put in a home 
for the aged he is suffering from kidney cancer and is staying at 
a soviet military hospital near berlin 
bohley led the activist group new forum which helped direct the 
peaceful street protests that toppled the communists and opened the 
door to unification of the two german states 
her group comprised of intellectuals artists and veteran 
dissidents found little political success after east germanys 
brief stint as a sovereign democracy 
the group remains an opposition force in the united germany 
frequently opposing what it says are heavy handed attempts by 
western germany to impose its will on the former communist nation 
bohley a painter is widely respected throughout germany 
however as the mother of the revolt and a dedicated activist who 
endured years of harassment by the old regimes secret police 
she met with reporters on thursday to mark the first anniversary 
of the day when honecker was forced out of power by members of his 
party who were trying to placate the growing masses of protesters 
a german magazine reported thursday that honecker himself blames 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for his downfall 
the hamburgpublished stern magazine said in its latest issue 
that honecker made the statement to heinz junge an old friend who 
recently visited the former east german leader at the tworoom 
apartment where he lives on the soviet military hospital compound 
from the beginning i was in gorbachevs way because my 
political experience made me see glasnost and perestroika 
differently honecker told junge according to stern 
junge a former member of the communist antinazi resistance 
and werner cieslak a former member of the leadership of the west 
german communist party have both visited honecker stern said 
the magazine printed a photograph of honecker and his wife 
margot a former education minister in his government sitting at a 
table with cieslak in the sparsely furnished apartment 
honecker 78 was deposed at a stormy communist party meeting on 
oct 18 1989 as the ruling party was trying to hang onto power 
with thousands of east germans demonstrating on the streets for 
democracy 
a little more than a week before honeckers removal gorbachev 
visited east berlin and said in a television interview that life 
punishes those who are late an indirect referrence to honeckers 
refusal to accept reforms 
junge told stern that honeckers condition appears to have 
improved in recent weeks and that he had regained some weight 
honecker underwent surgery for kidney cancer in january and was 
briefly detained after leaving the hospital german prosecutors 
have opened a criminal investigation against the former communist 
boss but there is not arrest warrant against him 
stern quoted his friends as saying honecker did not plan to 
leave germany it said the former communist leader has been 
receiving a monthly pension of 340

predictions of a major earthquake in the 
midwest in early december are without scientific basis and could 
even be dad the bush administration has been trying to come up 
with a way to protect the bird while limiting the loss of 20000 
jobs in the timber industry considered to be in jeopardy 
the owls are rapidly dying off because of intense cutting in the 
oldgrowth forests of the pacific northwest 
interior secretary manuel lujan prompted an uproar among 
environmentalists when he suggested the endangered species law be 
made more flexible to better take into account economic 
considerations in some circumstances 
the report concluded that the fish and wildlife service has 
neither developed nor implemented a basic management system for 
effective administration of the endangered species program 
it said investigators found that in addition to the huge backlog 
of petitions to list species for protection the agency also has 
failed to develop recovery plans for plants and animals already are 
under the laws protection 
the investigators acknowledged that lack of money is a major 
problem 
the report said the cost of protecting all of the presently 
known endangered species is more than 46 billion while the fish 
and wildlife service is provided only about 33 million a year to 
administer the program 
it estimated that the cost of simply listing the 601 species 
that are current candidates for protection would cost 36 million 
but that the agency has a listing budget of only about 35 million 
a year 
the cost of programs designed to ensure the recovery of 
protected species could be 46 billion while currently the agency 
has only about 84 million a year for recovery programs the 
report said

japans governing liberal democratic party said 
thursday it will send a group of lawmakers to washington to follow 
up new apologies by a cabinet minister for racial remarks that 
infuriated black americans 
in his remarks on sept 21 following a police raid on a tokyo 
redlight district justice minister seiroku kajiyama compared the 
arrival of foreign prostitutes in japan to blacks moving into 
neighborhoods in the united states and forcing whites out 
foreign ministry officials said kajiyama apologized in a letter 
to the us congressional black caucus which demanded his 
resignation they said japanese ambassador ryohei murata delivered 
kajiyamas letter of apology in washington on wednesday to rep 
ronald dellums dcalif chairman of the 24member caucus 
murata also asked the caucus to reconsider its proposed 
resolution demanding the resignation but received no immediate 
response an official said 
the resolution to be presented to the us house of 
representatives urges president bush to demand kajiyama resign 
asks that prime minister toshiki kaifu officially apologize and 
suggests programs to improve japanese officials understanding of 
racial issues 
murata later delivered a letter from kaifu to the national 
association for the advancement of colored people in which the 
prime minister apologized for kajiyamas remarks and pledged to 
work for more awareness among the japanese of american minority 
problems said a foreign ministry official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
kajiyama retracted his comments four days after making them 
after civil rights groups in the united states protested he also 
apologized to us ambassador michael armacost 
kaifu expressed regret and rebuked kajiyama but protests have 
continued and demands for kajiyamas resignation have grown 
on thursday ichiro ozawa secretarygeneral of the liberal 
democrats said the party decided to send a group of legislators to 
the united states on sunday to make further explanations 
he said the delegates would meet with congressional leaders 
particularly the black caucus in hopes of heading off the 
resolution he said passage of the resolution could damage the 
relations between japan and the united states 
in his latest letter kajiyama said he did not intend any racial 
discrimination in his comments 
i learned again how deeply i have hurt the feelings of the 
american people particularly africanamericans he said 
what i thoughtlessly said on sept 21 was wrong and grossly 
improper although i am acutely aware how difficult it is to heal 
the wounds that my remarks inflicted i will personally do whatever 
i can to strengthen japans relationship with the africanamerican 
community 
six african ambassadors also condemned kajiyamas remarks and 
delivered a letter of protest to foreign minister taro nakayama 
us civil rights groups asked a boycott of japanese products 
and mayor douglas palmer of trenton nj called off a planned 
visit by a delegation of the tokyo metropolitan government 
on wednesday kaifu rejected an opposition demand to dismiss 
kajiyama saying he deeply regrets the comment and has 
apologized to those concerned i trust that he will be speaking 
with more discretion in the future 
other japanese politicians have offended minorities with public 
racial remarks 
in 1986 yasuhiro nakasone then prime minister said americans 
have a lower intelligence level than japanese because the 
population includes a considerable number of blacks puerto ricans 
and mexicans 
in 1988 former finance minister michio watanabe said american 
blacks have few qualms about going bankrupt and implied they walk 
away from debts

much as 5 percent a year through 1994 and employees living in 
highcost cities would receive extra compensation under an 
agreement by house and senate negotiators 
the compromise on thursday 
saying it would provide a muchneeded morale boost to the 24 
million federal employees who have faced furloughs and government 
shutdowns in recent weeks because of the budget stalemate 
these are people whove been demoralized and beat about the 
head and shoulders said john sturdivant president of the 
american federation of government employees which represents 
700000 federal workers 
this is a breakthrough that will allow us to keep those people 
and attract bright new recruits as well the taxpayers win on this 
one sturdivant said of the tentative agreement reached late 
wednesday 
studies have indicated that federal workers are paid an average 
of 30 percent less than their privatebusiness counterparts the 
new plan is aimed at closing the pay gap within 13 years said 
george king a spokesman for the 140000member national treasury 
employees union 
under the plan civil service salaries would be raised as much 
as 5 percent each year from 1992 through 1994 for 1991 federal 
pay would increase 41 percent a bigger boost than the 35 percent 
recommended by president bush 
the administration has pledged to commit 36 billion for the 
federal pay plan over the next five years king said 
starting in 1994 federal workers in highcost cities such as 
washington new york boston los angeles and san francisco would 
receive even bigger pay raises federal workers now are paid the

tractor pulls those revemup spectacles where 
giant machines test metal and mettle in hauling competitions can 
produce potentially hazardous levels of carbon monoxide us 
health officials warned thursday 
carbon monoxide levels at two tractor pulls in 1988 in canada 
represented a potential health hazard to both participants and 
observers the centers for disease control said 
carbon monoxide is a colorless odorless gas in exhaust and 
smoke that can cause headache dizziness cardiac problems and 
death 
health officials urged officials of the winnipeg manitoba 
arena not to allow future tractor pulls the management of winnipeg 
arena agreed said rod thiessen the arenas director of 
operations theyve never come back and made them safe enough 
federal health officials arent sure whether the problem is 
peculiar to the winnipeg arena 
i wish i knewsaid dr ruth etzel a researcher with the 
environmental health center of the atlantabased cdc we would 
certainly like to see some data so we would know if this is a 
problem 
we were quite surprised at the levels of carbon monoxide that 
can build up in these things 
the hazard at the winnipeg arena prompted cancellation of a 
february 1989 tractor pull and no future pulls will be held there 
the cdc said 
tractor pulls typically feature a dozen or so truck rigs 
outfitted with superpowerful engines made of anything from 
supercharged car engines to aircraft turbines the tractor drivers 
are professionals who compete by pulling 50ton sleds across a dirt 
floor a 2hour event can feature 25 competitive pulls 
in a february 1988 pull at winnipeg health inspectors measured 
airborne carbon monoxide levels averaging 62 parts per million at 
the start or nearly twice the winnipeg health departments 
recommended indoor guideline of 33 parts per million in one hour 
by the events end the level had risen to 262 parts per million 
during a november 1988 pull at the arena roof louvers were 
opened the duration of the event was extended and one fewer pull 
was run even then carbon monoxide levels rose more than five 
times from 78 parts per million to 436 parts per million 
the control measures were not effective the cdc said 
adverse effects have been reported in people breathing a 
constant 15 parts per million the cdc said 
health officials reported no incidents of carbon monoxide 
poisoning during either winnipeg event although members of the 
ambulance crew reported severe headaches etzel said 
louisville kybased tnt calls itself the worlds largest 
promotor of indoor motor sports attracting 25 million fans a 
year it has never had problems like those cited at the winnipeg 
arena tnt spokesman mike weber said from his office in lombard 
ill 
tnt was not involved in the winnipeg events 
we present motor sports events in all the major arenas across 
the country and we take every precaution we do constantly monitor 
our emitted fumes its worked very well for us weber said 
weber is also director of public relations for the united states 
hot rod association the organization sanctions tnt events 
weber said some giant trucks that might perform in outdoor 
stadium shows shouldnt be run indoors there are so many 
different classifications of vehicles some are appropriate for 
indoors and there are some which are not he said

government soldiers stopped killing civilians and if foreign troops 
withdrew 
zaire has sent as many as 1000 troops to help rwandas army 
france and belgium rwandas former colonial ruler also have sent 
troops but say they are there only to protect their citizens and 
embassies 
the rebels enlisted from a 250000strong population of rwandan 
refugees in uganda accuse habyarimanas government of corruption 
human rights abuses and failing to repatriate the refugees 
as many as 10000 tutsis were massacred and hundreds of 
thousands driven into exile from rwanda in the 1960s

thousand rwandans have crossed into uganda since the invasion many 
say they fled massacres by rwandan soldiers and zealous hutu youth 
armed with machetes

aftermath of an apparent massacre when he visited a small village 
12 miles north of rwandas capital kigali 
the village had been burned to the ground and the bodies of 20 
inhabitants hacked to pieces and burned the photographer said the 
army appeared to be responsible he said citing indications the 
village was a tutsi settlement 
many of the tutsi rebels are former ugandan army soldiers they 
are led by the former ugandan deputy army commander maj gen fred 
rwigyema a tutsi of rwandan origin 
belgiums foreign minister mark eyskens said thursday a 
solution to the conflict must be found by african nations but said 
the european community might help with aid 
returning home from a peace mission eyskens said he and belgian 
prime minister wilfried martens had told african leaders the 
organization of african unity should be responsible for monitoring 
a ceasefire 
habyarimana and the ugandan and tanzanian chiefs said wednesday 
the ceasefire should be supervised by an ec peacekeeping force 
the ec at present has no formal mechanism for deploying such 
forces

the chairman of a house task force on el 
salvador said thursday the state department withheld from 
salvadoran investigators important information about the slaying 
last year of six jesuit priests and two others 
rep joseph moakley dmass said he had learned of an 
affidavit given by an american army major to the fbi in january 
detailing a threat against the jesuits by a salvadoran officer some 
10 days before the nov 16 killings 
the american officer later recanted his statement but the fbi 
believed it important to inform salvadoran authorities and 
forwarded it to the us embassy in san salvador us officials 
never passed the information along moakley said 
at best i consider this to be an unbelievable and inexcusable 
error in judgment he said in a statement which also made clear 
he did not know whether the affidavit was true 
the state department had no immediate response to moakleys 
charge 
a congressional source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the document told of an incident in which col guillermo benavides 
had been angrily ranting against the jesuits and making threats 
prior to the murders

panamanian authorities said thursday 
they broke up a military ring plotting against the government and 
named as a coup leader the man picked as security chief following 
last years us invasion of panama attorney general rogelio cruz 
accused the band of terrorist activities and of conspiring to seize 
military installations 
he said former col eduardo herrera and a brother capt 
francisco herrera were implicated 
eduardo hererra who took charge of the newly formed public 
forces after us troops invaded panama on dec 20 1989 and 
ousted gen manuel antonio noriega was reported out of the 
country his brother apparently is not in custody 
col hererra retired last august after 23 years of service 
noriega who as chief of panamas heavyhanded defense forces 
was de facto ruler of panama now is held on federal drug 
trafficking charges in miami 
the civiliandirected public forces were formed to replace the 
defense forces in a move to demilitarize panama 
vice president ricardo arias calderon said thursday that members 
of the public forces could be connected to the explosion of bombs 
in the province of chiriqui and possibly to some bombs that went 
off in the capital 
there are three military men under arrest and being 
investigated by prosecutors 
calderon who also serves as interior minister overseeing the 
new police force said no bombs had gone off since the start of the 
investigation 
the explosions damaged electrical facilities and homes of 
government officials but caused no injuries 
cruz said the group had plans to take over military bases in 
western chiriqui province 
he said capt ivan moreno subdirector of public forces in 
chiriqui divulged the conspiracy after he was detained cruz said 
a corporal and a private also were in custody 
cruz said plot leaders deceived other members of the public 
forces and told them their plan had american support 
a communique from the presidency said explosions in chiriqui 
took place on orders coming from col eduardo hererra 
it said moreno told authorities that last tuesday he was to 
receive a signal to put all the military detachments in the 
chiriqui police zone on alert 
the communique called the conspiracy part of a national movement 
and said francisco hererra was a gobetween for his brother 
it said the goal was to take over the province after a 
demonstration of public employees that took place on tuesday

prosecutors said thursday that mayor marion 
barry should not be granted a retrial on his cocaine possession 
conviction arguing there was no evidence jurors were unfairly 
influenced in making their decision 
barrys attorney has said he should receive a new trial because 
some of the jurors in his case witnessed a drug sting operation at 
the hotel where they were sequestered and because deputy us 
marshals told at least one juror that an alternate would have voted 
to convict barry of all 14 charges against him 
barrys jury convicted him of one misdemeanor cocaine possession 
charge acquitted him of another and was deadlocked on a dozen 
other charges including a possession charge resulting from his 
jan 18 arrest in an fbi sting operation at a washington hotel 
lawyer r kenneth mundy asked for the retrial in court papers 
filed last week prosecutors responded in papers submitted 
thursday 
the defendant has not offered any affidavits in support of his 
claim but instead has referred to postverdict interviews with 
some of the jurors us attorney jay b stephens argued 
generally in order to make a colorable showing of extraneous 
influence to justify further inquiry the defendant must submit 
affidavits or other sworn statements 
stephens also argued that even if barry were able to prove the 
two improprieties he alleged in his request for a retrial he 
might not be entitled to another trial 
not every extraneous influence on the jury warrants a new 
trial stephens said citing a supreme court ruling which 
indicates that due process does not require a new trial every 
time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising 
situation 
stephens also insisted that the deputy marshals alleged 
statements could not have influenced the jury since it voted to 
acquit the mayor on one of the two charges it decided 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson has set 
sentencing for oct 26 a presentencing hearing is set for friday 
and jackson could rule on mundys retrial request at that time

former transportation secretary william t 
coleman pleaded thursday for permission to make one last 
facetoface pitch before president bush vetoes a major civil 
rights bill designed to combat job bias 
if you veto it whether such veto is sustained or overridden 
you subject this country and the republican party to years of 
divisiveness over these issues coleman said in a letter to bush 
the prominent black republican recounted how bush called him in 
august and asked me to get involved in the civil rights bill 
you indicated that i could come to see you if there were any 
problems i herewith request such a meeting before you do other 
than sign the bill 
the house approved the bill wednesday and sent it to bush one 
day after the president promised to veto it on grounds that it 
would prompt employers to adopt hiring quotas 
provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme discrimination 
cases 
the fiercest disputes however have come over proposed changes 
in complex rules under which courts decide job discrimination 
cases the changes would make it easier for those filing 
discrimination suits to win and harder for employers to defend 
themselves 
bush said in a letter tuesday to sen slade gorton rwash 
that he would veto the bill because these provisions would force 
employers to turn to hiring quotas the idea is that the use of 
quotas would provide employers with a readymade defense 
all reliable criteria of reason demonstrate that the bill as 
finally passed is not a quota bill coleman said 
first there is not a word in the bill that would require 
quotas in fact the bill actually provides that a statistical 
shortage of minorities or women in the employers workforce is not 
by itself sufficient to hold the employer liable under this act 
he said 
it further provides that nothing in the bill shall construed 
to require or encourage quotas coleman added 
coleman said his meeting also should be attended by attorney 
general dick thornburgh white house counsel c boyden gray health 
and human services secretary louis sullivan and us civil rights 
commission chairman arthur fletcher as well as sens arlen specter 
rpa warren rudman rnh john danforth rmo and orrin

the air force has imposed new restrictions on 
lowlevel flying in the persian gulf area in response to a recent 
rash of air crashes the pentagon said thursday 
lt gen charles horner commander of the central command air 
force in saudi arabia ordered pilots on training missions not to 
fly below 1000 feet they previously had flown as low as 150 feet 
the pentagon issued a statement quoting horner as saying the new 
limit of 1000 feet is not realistic for combat training but 
itll get the point across then well work our way back down to 
realistic training altitudes 
the statement did not elaborate and maj margaret sutter an 
air force spokeswoman said she had no further information 
the action was taken after the air force last wednesday grounded 
all warplanes on training missions in the gulf area for one day 
pilots were given special safety awareness briefings during the 
flight ban which did not apply to operational missions such as 
reconnaissance border patrols and airtoair refueling 
twenty us military aircraft have crashed in the gulf area 
during operational desert shield since the defensive buildup began 
aug 7 last week the pentagon reported three separate air crashes 
in which 12 pilots and crew members were killed two of the crashes

residents of ruse on the romanian 
border told the government thursday that the entire city of 
250000 may pack up and seek ecological asylym elsewhere unless 
pollution stops the state news agency bta said 
ruse has suffered health problems and ecological damage for nine 
years because of chlorine gas clouds drifting across the danube 
river from a chemical works in giurgiu romania 
protesters demanded quick official action and asked un 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar for help at a mass rally 
organized by the ruse salvation committee 
bta said a declaration warned that the population would leave 
ruse for a time to protest the chemical warfare from giurgiu if 
the government fails to take effective measures to stop the 
chlorine gas attacks within a month 
if that proved unavailing people would give up bulgarian 
citizenship en masse and seek ecological asylum for the entire 
city in another country or community of countries bta quoted the 
statement as saying 
the move was seen as reflecting ruses despair over bulgarian 
failure to get the romanian factory closed down and followed road 
blockades and other ineffectual protests 
in the letter to perez de cuellar read at the rally residents 
said that in ruse the fundamental right to health and life is 
not granted 
they lashed out at the diplomatic helplessness and 
transparent demagoguery of those responsible on the bulgarian and 
romanian side 
we ask you please use all your political influence take a 
diplomatic initiative so word will spread at the un that romania 
owes 250000 bulgarians the right to ecological security the

a private group complained thursday that the 
internal revenue service is trying to sugarcoat evidence that 
the agency disciplines blacks at a larger rate than other workers 
but the agency said it is making a goodfaith effort to uncover the 
cause 
the national coalition of irs whistleblowers issued a copy of a 
memo it obtained in which michael j murphy a deputy commissioner 
for the irs acknowledged that blacks had been punished at a higher 
rate than other workers 
enclosed is a bar chart which reflects that black irs 
employees are disciplined servicewide at a substantially higher 
rate than their percentage in the workforce the memo said 
the memo written jointly with the president of the union that 
represents irs workers asked irs executives and union officials 
to answer a questionnaire about the agencys disciplinary policy to 
uncover why the disparity had occurred 
the memo noted that the irs and the national treasury employees 
union had formed a task force to review the agencys disciplinary 
practice and make recommendations on minority employees 
the task force is trying to determine the causes of the higher 
rate and the most appropriate solutions to correct the 
imbalances the memo said 
irs spokesman henry holmes said the joint effort by irs 
management and union officials shows the agency is trying to 
uncover the causes for the disparity 
we want to find out why if its attributable to anything 
unwarranted such as discrimination were going to correct it 
holmes said 
figures show that both black male and female workers are 
disciplined at higher rates than their white counterparts holmes 
said 
for instance in 1989 the irs took 700 disciplinary actions 
involving black females while there should have only been around 
400 if the actions were distributed evenly throughout the 
workforce holmes said 
there were about 500 actions taken against white females when 
there should have been around 750 under a statistical model 
figuring in the entire workforce holmes said 
george king a spokesman for the 140000member treasury 
employees union said the memo shows both sides are trying to 
uncover the cause of the imbalance and see if it needs correcting 
both the union and the agency are doing everything possible to 
begin to further identify these disparities and rectify the 
situation king said 
but mike lashaway a spokesman for the whistleblowers group 
said the irs is trying to sugarcoat the evidence 
theyre trying to shuffle it under the carpet he said 
its more or less a white mans world within the upper power 
structure of the irs its been going on for years its not like 
they were blind to it lashaway said 
the group formed in 1985 by the church of scientologys freedom 
magazine said it had received numerous reports of harassment 
against minority irs employees 
the government has had numerous legal battles with the church of 
scientology many of them concerning taxes and charges brought 
against the church by the irs

the government gave an explanation for his decision no replacement 
was immediately named to the 14member cabinet 
amat y leon was one of three members of the marxist united left 
coalition named to the cabinet of president alberto fujimori who 
took office july 28 under the banner of a tiny party with a 
populist ideology 
amat y leon a former economics professor said this week that 
peru faced a famine unless 300 million in agricultural loans were 
quickly approved for the october to december planting season

will heighten inflation which has risen the past two weeks after 
declining to 138 percent in september the lowest rate in many 
months 
the country is suffering its worst drought in history and many 
of this years crops have been almost entirely lost 
drought is one of many critical problems facing the fujimori 
government ranging from drug smuggling and inflation to a 
10yearold insurgency by leftwing extremists

highlands said thursday that farmers had reported the discovery of 
a grave with at least 15 bodies they say are the remains of 
relatives who were detained by police

the parliaments of latvia and armenia said friday 
they would challenge president mikhail s gorbachevs decree 
requiring all major cities to hold parades on nov 7 anniversary 
of the bolshevik revolution 
the dispute threatens to turn revolution day one of the top 
holidays on the soviet calendar into a day of protest for 
republics striving for independence 
the chairman of the national democratic party of georgia also 
urged his republic to prevent any parade in tbilisi its capital 
the cocalled socialist revolution of 1917 abolished 
democracy and stopped the peoples drive for freedom with 
bayonets said the party leader georgy chanturiya 
any attempt to hold a military parade in tbilisi on nov 7 may 
have unpredictable consequences the independent soviet news 
agency interfax reported 
armenias lawmakers declared the 73rd anniversary of the 1917 
revolution will not be marked by a military parade in yerevan 
the republics capital according to the official soviet news 
agency tass 
latvias parliament passed a resolution saying there was no 
legal basis for a parade in riga its capital according to the 
independent baltic news service 
a demonstration of soviet military power will be in 
contradiction with latvias sovereignty and it will sharpen the 
political situation the latvian parliament said 
latvia armenia georgia and most of the other 12 soviet 
republics have been pushing for greater autonomy or in some 
cases outright independence from the central government in 
moscow 
gorbachev issued his decree oct 10 in an attempt to prevent a 
boycott by radicals led by the mayors of moscow and leningrad the 
mayors have called for abandoning the traditional revolution day 
festivities saying deteriorating economic conditions give soviets 
nothing to celebrate 
november 7 is usually devoted to patriotic marching flagwaving 
and praising the glories of communism the parades usually include 
military equipment such as tanks and rockets followed by 
peoples demonstrations involving thousands of residents in

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
thursday it would be selfdefeating for the administration to 
promise congress a role in deciding whether the united states 
should engage in armed conflict with iraq 
testifying before the house foreign affairs committee baker 
raised the possibility that any such commitment would give a 
decided advantage to iraqs military forces 
baker reaffirmed that the administration would be willing to 
consult the congress but offered no commitment beyond that 
rep ted weiss dny strongly urged that the administration 
call on congress to declare war if the need arises consistent with 
its constitutional responsibilities 
though the president is commanderinchief of the armed forces 
the constitution says in article i section 8 the congress shall 
have power to declare war 
weiss suggested that the administration follow the example of 
president franklin d roosevelt who won a declaration of war by 
congress against japan the day after the bombing of pearl harbor 
the world war ii declarations of war were the last in us history 
but baker replied that a nightmarish situation would result if 
tensions in the persian gulf escalated during a period when 
congress were not in session 
i really think it would be selfdefeating if congress was 
called back into session and we had days of debate about what we 
should or should not do 
what i cant do is make a general acrosstheboard 
commitment baker said 
baker had faced similar questioning on wednesday by the senate 
foreign relations committee 
congress has become increasingly concerned about the situation 
as the stalemate in the gulf continues without solution and as the 
current session of congress winds down congressional leaders hope 
to adjourn by next friday normally not to reconvene until january 
baker said repeatedly during his appearance that the 
administration is seeking a peaceful outcome to the conflict he 
said he did not foresee an early solution because un sanctions 
against iraq will take a substantial period of time to cripple 
the countrys economy 
committee chairman dante fascell dfla opened the hearing by 
suggesting the formation of a new group of lawmakers to consult 
with the executive branch on a regular basis some senators have 
made similar suggestions 
the group would consist of the house and senate leadership and 
the chairmen and ranking members of the relevant house and senate 
committees 
it could be convened when the congress is in recess or has 
adjourned and would avoid the need for the administration to 
consult with all 535 members fascell said 
rep william s broomfield of michigan the ranking republican 
on the committee opposed fascells proposal 
we should never be placed in a situation where a single 
americans life is risked in the persian gulf because a requirement 
to consult with congress tipped the presidents hand to our 
adversaries broomfield said

defense minister moshe arens warned syria on 
thursday against trying to spread its influence from beirut to the 
israelicontrolled security strip in south lebanon 
syrian forces ousted christian rebel leader michel aoun from 
beirut on saturday and control almost the entire city 
there is a danger that the syrians after their success in 
beirut and their big influence on the lebanese government of 
president elias hrawi will want to perhaps have influence in 
our security zone arens said speaking on israel radio 
i hope they will not do this because this is something we 
cannot accept he added 
foreign minister david levy speaking on israel television said 
israel has certain parameters which it sees as a red line the 
syrians are aware of this and every other element is aware of this 
too a violation of such red lines he warned would trigger a 
serious response from israel 
levy added however that syrian involvement in beirut does not 
constitute a serious threat to israel 
when asked if there were signs of a change in syrias hostility 
toward israel levy responded i want to hope so there are 
small veiled signs i want to encourage them 
syria one of israels most heavily armed and hostile arab foes 
has long been a rival to israel in lebanon where each country has 
carved out its sphere of influence 
the two nations have avoided confrontation since june 1982 when 
israel invaded lebanon to rout palestinian guerrillas from the 
south 
the israeli security zone was formed in 1985 when israel ended a 
threeyear occupation of south lebanon it runs about six to 10 
miles north of israels border and is patrolled by israeli soldiers 
and an israelisupported lebanese militia 
syria maintains 40000 troops in lebanon and controls most of 
beirut and eastern lebanon 
arens met thursday morning with visiting british foreign 
minister douglas hurd who later left for athens 
the israeli defense minister said on radio later that he doubted 
the western standoff with iraq could be solved without military 
action 
mentioning the goals of getting iraqi forces out of kuwait and 
stripping iraq of its military capability he said they western 
countries certainly would like to do this through diplomatic 
means i cast a lot of doubt on whether this is possible 
iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 and president saddam hussein annexed 
his oilwealthy neighbor four days later

residents of this capital 
nervously went about their business thursday after being rattled by 
a guerrilla attack overnight the latest rebel offensive in el 
salvadors decadeold civil war 
dozens of explosions from rebel mortars were heard from the 
citys eastern outskirts starting at 945 pm wednesday and 
lasting until about midnight when army troops said they drove 
rebels off 
smallarms fire however lasted into the early morning 
as many as 100 rebels appeared to have been involved in the 
attack on the ilopango air base which is headquarters of the air 
force the base is four miles east of downtown 
gen rafael villamariona commander of the air force said at a 
news conference thursday that five soldiers were wounded in the 
offensive he said six helicopters and two trucks were also 
damaged 
reporters were shown the aircraft but the damage appeared 
slight though only a small sector of the sprawling airfield was 
seen 
the guerrillas in a communique claimed they damaged most of 
the governments helicopter fleet they charged the government with 
covering up the damage 
the attack came exactly a month after yet another round of 
unsuccessful peace talks between rebels and the rightist 
government 
a fifth round of unmediated peace talks between the leftist 
rebels and the rightist government of president alfredo cristiani 
ended in a stalemate sept 18 
the two sides have agreed to meet again for peace talks in 
mexico before nov 4 
rebel commanders have said for weeks that a stalemate at the 
negotiating table could provoke a major offensive disabling the 
air force fleet would be key to blunting the militarys 
effectiveness in rebuffing any guerrilla offensive 
the rebels used an abandoned commercial building in the la palma 
neighborhood adjacent to the airfield as the main staging area for 
the attack 
about 30 empty packing tubes for 60mm mortar rounds as well as 
tubes for launching homemade bombs were strewn about the building 
early thursday 
a dozen unfired rocketlike weapons that one officer said were 
chinesemade were lined up on the floor also in the building were 
ingredients for explosives 
the government indicated it expected more trouble it broadcast 
a communique saying leftist labor and student organizations planned 
to launch a series of provocative actions of street violence 
the insurgents last november launched the biggest offensive of 
the civil war about 1000 soldiers guerrillas and civilians died 
in three weeks of intense mostly urban combat 
guerrilla leaders and government representatives have been 
negotiating unsuccessfully for more than a year to end the 
decadeold civil war each side accuses the other of intransigence 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler issued a 
statement thursday noting us and soviet officials had met in 
washington last week seeking ways to promote peace talks 
the soviet and american participants urged intensified 
negotiations toward a ceasefire said the statement issued 
jointly with the soviet union 
it added they also consider that both sides in the dialogue 
should refrain from military actions which would damage the 
prospects for peace 
the statement appeared to be aimed at the rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front the fmln maintains a ceasefire can only 
be put in effect after substantive agreements on reform of 
salvadoran society are reached 
fmln spokesman miguel saenz in an interview in tegucigalpa 
where rebel leaders met with honduran president rafel callejas 
said the salvadoran army was negotiating in bad faith the 
government says much the same of the rebels 
the fmln insists the military should be drastically reduced in 
numbers and officers who violated human rights be prosecuted the 
military has not rejected a cleanup of rights abusers but says it 
would conduct such a purge on its own 
soldiers are charged with murdering thousands of suspected 
leftists in cold blood during el salvadors civil war last 
novembers murder of six jesuit priests who were out of favor with 
the military has led congress to consider cutting military aid to 
el salvador 
rep joseph moakley dmass chairman of a house task force on 
el salvador charged thursday that the state department had 
withheld information about the slayings from salvadoran 
investigators 
moakley said he had learned of an affidavit given by an us 
army major to the fbi in january detailing a threat against the 
jesuits by a salvadoran officer about 10 days before the nov 16 
killings 
the us officer later recanted his statement but the fbi 
believed it important to pass along to salvadoran authorities and 
forwarded it to the us embassy in san salvador us officials 
never passed the information along moakley said 
the killings led to calls to scale back us aid since 1980 
the united states has provided 4 billion in economic and military 
aid to bolster a succession of salvadoran governments 
rights groups estimate 73000 people have been killed since the 
war began in 1979 in this country of 5 million people

northwest airlines said thursday that two 
dc9 jets whose hydraulic systems were accidentally filled with a 
mixture of hand soap and hydraulic fluid were repaired and back in 
service 
fifty flights were canceled around the country wednesday and 12 
dc9s were grounded for inspections of hydraulic systems northwest 
spokesman doug miller said tests showed only two of the grounded 
planes contained the soap mixture 
those two systems were flushed last night and replaced and 
those planes are back on the flying line as well he said 
northwest spokesman bob gibbons said wednesday it was an honest 
mistake not sabotage that led ground workers in atlanta to fill 
the hydraulic systems with the mixture 
it was certainly inadvertent and nothing suspicious gibbons 
said wednesday he said an investigation was under way to determine 
how it happened 
gibbons said he knew of no problems associated with the mixture 
he said there could have been danger if the problem had not been 
detected by a mechanic who noticed the fluid was an unusual color 
the planes had been flying with the contaminated fluid no longer 
than 10 days he said

a group of farmstate democrats appealed to 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter on thursday to prop up 
slumping wheat prices by raising the government loan rate 
yeutter however believes boosting the loan price would have a 
devastating impact on us grain exports an agriculture 
department spokesman said thursday 
wheat prices have fallen under 250 a bushel this fall the 
lowest in five years because of a bumper crops in the united 
states and around the world a year ago the price would have been 
about 350 a bushel 
in a letter to yeutter the nine house members said he is using 
the loan price to manipulate the market and drive market prices 
down 
we feel that the lowprice strategy fails our farmers badly 
because it does not allow them a loan price sufficient to pay off 
their own cash operating costs the lawmakers said 
they proposed raising the loan rate from the current 195 a 
bushel to about 265 
the loan rate is the price at which farmers can take out 
government loans using their grain as collateral it effectively 
puts a floor under grain prices since farmers usually forfeit 
their stocks to the government if market prices fall below the loan 
rate 
yeutter and others with a marketoriented philosophy say high 
loan rates allow foreign competitors to undercut us exports and 
encourage farmers to dump grain on the government 
we tried raising loan rates in 1981 said department 
spokesman steve censky referring to the 1981 farm bill we saw 
grain being produced and simply forfeited to the government instead 
of going to the market 
it comes down to a fundamental disagreement on philosophy and 
policy the folks who signed this letter are those who favor high 
loan rates and have advocated such policies for years 
signing the letter were reps richard gephardt of missouri who 
is the majority leader jim oberstar and tim penny of minnesota 
byron dorgan of north dakota tim johnson of south dakota richard 
stallings of idaho david obey of wisconsin pat williams of

federal engineers are stepping up an 
investigation of reported brake disc corrosion in all ford taurus 
and mercury sable models the government reported thursday 
the national highway traffic safety administration said it had 
upgraded the probe from a preliminary evaluation an examination 
of paperwork to an engineering analysis in which engineers will 
study the possibly defective parts 
the investigation could result in a recall 
in an unrelated matter the agency said it was discontinuing an 
investigation of seat separation in the 1988 and 1989 ford festiva 
and 1985 toyota vans and cargo vans because it could find no 
pattern to incident reports 
on the brake issue ford motor co said it was conducting its 
own investigation of all its models that have the same brake rotor 
and hub assembly as the taurus and sable they include the lincoln 
continental ford thunderbird and mercury cougar spokeswoman joyce 
stinson said 
the investigation of the taurus and sable brake problem is the 
second this year the government opened a preliminary investigation 
but closed it several months later saying there was no evidence of 
a widespread defect ms stinson said 
agency spokesman tim hurd said there had been six complaints of 
front disc brake corrosion in the taurus and sable an estimated 
18 million of the vehicles are on the road 
the complaints allege that the discs deteriorate and fail the 
problem has been blamed for one accident and a minor injury 
the problem appears to be centered in northern climes where 
roads are heavily salted in the winter hurd said reports also 
have come in from maritime areas of canada ms stinson said 
the agency also announced the following new preliminary 
evaluations 
ford bronco and bronco ii 1986 models four complaints of fuel 
tank corrosion and leaks an estimated 170000 of the vehicles are 
on the road

its certain now that infamous africanized 
killer bees will invade southern texas officials said 
thursday touting a plan to slow down the bees if they can get the 
money to pay for it 
africanized bees are hybrid descendants of bees that escaped a 
breeding experiment in brazil in 1957 they have been heading 
toward the united states ever since 
to the untrained eye the bees are indistinguishable from 
domestic varieties they earned the nickname killer bees 
because of their tendency to sting in swarms when they perceive an 
intruder is threatening their hive 
according to unofficial estimates several hundred people 
probably have died from africanized bee attacks since 1957 in south 
america central america and mexico 
the arrival of the bees in texas seemed more imminent last 
november when a swarm was trapped about 150 miles south of the 
us border with mexico 
on monday us department of agriculture scientists discovered 
the first swarm of the dreaded bees in a trap set just east of the 
border city of hidalgo 
a quarantine is already in place it bans beekeepers or anyone 
else from moving bees from an area 100 miles north of the rio 
grande river 
the emergency texas africanized honey bee management plan also 
includes searchanddestroy missions against the africanized bees 
enforcing quarantines public education and research 
fowden g maxwell head of the entomology department at texas 
aampm university estimated it would cost 800000 to carry out 
last year the state legislature denied a funding request for the 
plan though it funneled 100000 through other programs 
we are worried that other states will decide that we are not 
doing our job to manage these bees and they will place a quarantine 
on all texas bees said maxwell who supervises the state apiary 
inspection service which regulates honey bees 
state and federal officials are still hoping the legislature 
will provide more money when it meets in january 
their main concern is to reduce economic damage to beekeepers 
and farmers africanized bees could cause havoc if they mate with 
the domestic variety 
in the mean time the federal animal and plant health inspection 
service has stepped in the agency of the usda brought in 14 
apiarists to search a 2mile radius of the site where the 
africanized swarm was caught monday 
it will take the bee experts about three weeks to take samples 
and test for africanization in all managed bee hives and any wild 
swarms they find in that area said elba quintero program manager 
of the search but the inspection service is committed to stopping 
only the first five swarms 
it may be a year before people in the area notice an increase in 
wild bee swarms said anita collins resaarch leader at the honey 
bee research laboratory in weslaco 
although bee attacks are unlikely she said people should be 
aware that theres something out there besides rattlesnakes to 
watch out for

israel said thursday it would try to help 
the un chief write his report on the killing of 19 palestinians 
in jerusalem but stuck to its refusal to receive a visiting un 
team of investigators 
un officials said secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
would have no immediate comment on what his course of action will 
be 
he summoned israeli ambassador johanan bein to discuss the 
extent of israels cooperation with a security council demand that 
perez de cuellar submit a report on the oct 8 killings on temple 
mount 
bein said later he had been called to convey some messages 
from the government of israel and we agreed that well cooperate 
in trying to find ways if means to facilitate the secretarygeneral 
to write his report and present it 
when asked if israel would receive the secretarygenerals 
emissaries bein smiled said thank you and concluded the 
briefing 
officials said later on condition of anonymity that israel 
would send deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu to new york 
next week with a copy of israels official inquest into the 
shootings 
at least 19 palestinians were killed when israeli security 
forces fired on protesters throwing rocks down on jews praying at 
the western wall more commonly known in the west as the wailing 
wall 
last friday the security council condemned israels security 
forces over the incident the resolution also regretted that 
worshipers were injured its only reference critical of the 
palestinians 
the council asked the secretarygeneral to send a team to 
investigate the killings and report back by the end of october 
perez de cuellar told the council he needed clarification from 
israel on its cooperation 
he was adamant on thursday that he would not prepare a report on 
the violence without firsthand information from a un mission he 
was asked if he might prepare a report based on news reports and 
other information 
no thats not what the security council is asking us to 
do he said they want that i send a mission to the area they 
are not asking me to prepare a report here in new york 
israel rejects an official un mission as violating israels 
sovereignty 
the mission goes or it doesnt perez de cuellar told 
reporters who asked about a possible alternative 
israel has said that un officials could enter as tourists but 
the secretarygeneral has rejected travel on a less than official 
basis 
most members of the 15nation security council including the 
united states are urging the secretarygeneral to press ahead and 
send a mission despite israels refusal to accept one

an exit poll announced early frida 
indicated the centrist liberal democrats may defeat the governing 
conservatives in a special parliamentary election to replace a 
legislator killed by the ira 
a defeat in this coastal town in southern england a 
conservative stronghold would come as a stunning setback to prime 
minister margaret thatchers tories 
the british broadcasting corp exit poll of 2000 voters here 
had the liberal democrats taking 47 percent of thursdays vote and 
the conservatives 45 percent 
the labor party had just five percent and fringe candidates took 
three percent according to the poll 
the bbc said the margin of error was three percent and that the 
contest appeared a cliffhanger 
official results were expected later friday 
ian gow the previous legislator was killed july 30 when the 
irish republican army blew up his car his constituents are among 
the staunchest conservatives in the country 
but conservative candidate richard hickmet 42 a lawyer was 
accused of overplaying the ira card in his campaign to get a 
sympathy vote 
a blacklash combined with disillusion with the thatcher 
government was likely to slash the tories huge majority of nearly 
17000 votes observers predicted 
the liberal democratic party ran an aggressive campaign and said 
its candidate david bellotti 47 stood a good chance of snatching 
the 71400voter constituency to pull off a major special election 
upset 
the main opposition labor party which has led in national 
opinion poll ratings for more than a year has no chance in 
eastbourne at the 1987 general election labor ran a distant third 
in eastbourne behind the liberal democrats 
the liberal democrats needed a strong showing to revive their 
waning fortunes before the next general election which must be 
held by mid1992 
the latest national opinion poll taken by icm and published 
thursday in the guardian newspaper indicated labor had 49 percent 
support the conservatives 36 and the liberal democrats 9 
the conservatives have a 97seat majority in the 650member 
house of commons before voting the conservatives had 373 seats 
labor 226 and the liberal democrats 19 the rest were split among

george washington was found not guilty on thursday 
of treason against the british crown at a mock trial in which his 
lawyer argued that the american revolution was a case of 
selfdefense 
i am delighted elated said washington played by bill 
sommerfield justice has been done weve been vindicated and now 
i must go back and pursue the war with vigor and bring it to a just 
conclusion 
sommerfield and actors portraying thomas jefferson and benjamin 
franklin are members of the royal pickwickians of philadelphia a 
troupe that combines acting with historical research 
jefferson and franklin testified at the trial which pitted 
pinstriped american lawyers against british counsel in wigs and 
gowns 
harold braff a new jersey trial lawyer and one of the team 
defending the commanderinchief of the american revolutionary 
army said the british were the ones who declared war on the 
colonists hurting them economically and depriving them of 
liberties 
if the british leadership had played their cards right there 
would have been no revolution he said 
the colonialists werent interested in severing the 
relationships they felt a loyalty to the king but they were 
unwilling to have to accept laws from parliament 
the three judges lord bridge of harwich a senior british law 
lord sir patrick neill a british appellate judge and us 
federal judge a sherman christensen of utah were unanimous in 
their ruling of innocent they found that the way britain governed 
the colonies forced the americans to react 
the colonists only as a last resort were driven to the 
declaration of independence bridge said 
the judges agreed that washington and all americans were 
entitled to revolt against repression 
the conduct of the crown was in violation of the right of 
selfdetermination christensen said 
bill barker playing jefferson spoke softly in a southern 
accent and wore a blue ribbon to hold his ponytail he told the 
court he was the governor of virginia and an author of the 
declaration of independence 
franklin played by robert gray testified that he had traveled 
to england to try to reach a compromise with king george iii and 
parliament 
prosecuting washington under the treason act of 1351 was sydney 
kentridge the human rights lawyer who defended steven biko in 
south africa 
the lawyers agreed to limit the number of objections so the 
trial filmed for screening on british and us television would 
make good drama said lanny kurzweil a member of the defense 
team 
about 280 court spectators paid 34 each to attend the money to 
go to the international scholarships for young lawyers fund 
the mock trial came about after lord goff a member of the house 
of lords made the treason charge at a june meeting of the american 
inns of court foundation 
lawyers from illinois and new jersey took up the challenge and 
traveled to historic lincolns inn for the trial 
the inn an oasis of georgian office buildings and tidy gardens 
in central london was founded in the 14th century it is the 
oldest of four inns of court that train and admit barristers 
lawyers allowed to plead cases in court 
barristersintraining must spend 18 months following senior 
barristers through the courts and the inns socalled because many 
barristers used to work and live there 
the american inns of court foundation with 128 inns in 38 
states works to bring the same tutorial methods to the us legal 
system matching young lawyers with senior advocates and jurists

the bush administration on thursday promised 
droughtstricken hungary 475 million in agricultural credits and 
loan guarantees and called for international lending concessions to 
help embryonic eastern european democracies 
president bush also announced during an official visit of 
hungarys prime minister josef antall that the united states is 
lifting travel restrictions on hungarys diplomats and has agreed 
to permit a hungarian consulate in los angeles 
hungary is no longer an emerging democracy hungary is a 
democracy bush said in a speech welcoming antall to the white 
house 
in keeping with administration support for the switchover from 
communism to democratic government and more freemarket economies 
in eastern europe bush said he would push the international 
monetary fund to expand its lending to those countries by making 5 
billion available 
the president said that lending is needed to help compensate for 
the economic the new democracies are facing because they support 
un sanctions against iraq 
we understand that the loss of export markets and rising 
energy costs complicate your historic effort to transform a 
centrally planned economic system to a freemarket economy bush 
told antall 
the president also pledged to ask the world bank to accelerate 
aid in the energy field drawing on 9 billion already committed to 
central and eastern europe 
hungary suffering from what one us official described as 
internal economic constriction sought us support to 
encourage foreign investment 
they asked for american support in giving a strong signal to 
foreign investors that hungary was a good place for investment 
said deputy assistant secretary of state curtis kammen 
bush gave that signal in his speech saying that us companies 
already have invested more than 500 million in hungarian 
enterprises 
i encourage more american businesses to find out what hungary 
has to offer the president said 
bush announced 475 million in credits and loan guarantees to 
help hungary cover its grain shortfall of 800000 tons after its 
drought 
the money will include 40 million in us guarantees for 7year 
commercial credits for us commodities and 75 million in 
longterm credits on specific items 
hungary has the highest per capita debt in east europe standing 
at 20 billion for a population of 10 million 
antall the first democratically elected hungarian leader to 
visit the white house in more than 40 years also met with 
secretary of state james a baker iii and with commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher

the white house where guests included actors kevin costner and 
tony curtis nuclear physicist edward teller and fashion designer 
adrienne vittadini 
entertainment was provided by classical pianist van cliburn

struggle toward democracy 
especially during the past two years a your gallantry has 
evoked our admiration your example has been our inspiration he 
said 
for his part the hugarian prime minister joked that bush was so 
popular in hungary that he could find future employment there 
since the us constitution limits the president to two terms 
antall told bush im sure the hungarian nation would surely 
elect you as president

although its still earning money abc news will 
close its bureaus in chicago boston and dallas because of lean 
times but will maintain reporters in all three cities an abc 
spokesman said thursday 
the spokesman scott richardson said no further cuts were 
expected the bureaus will be closed by dec 31 
the move which leaves abc with nine us bureaus comes as abc 
news is undergoing belttighting as a result of persian gulf 
coverage costs and lowerthanexpected advertising revenues that 
affect all three networks 
in dallas correspondent charles murphy will work from his home 
in boston a twoman staff will be kept to work with abcs medical 
correspondent dr tim johnson who reports for several abc shows 
in chicago correspondent chris bury will work out of abcowned 
wlstv 
twelve offcamera staff members are affected by the closings 
some will be reassigned or offered other jobs and others will be 
let go richardson said he said it was not yet known how many 
would be let go 
cbs which has seven domestic bureaus and nbc which has nine 
have no plans to close those offices spokeswomen for those 
networks said 
abcs action was expected the network earlier put on hold a

firstwave of layoffs thing richardson said 
abc news officials have said the division still will earn money 
this year despite the lean times although it probably will earn 
about 25 million less than the 75 million that had been

isnt a cutback said nbc spokeswoman peggy hubble their skills 
were just not needed for various projects being planned ms hubble

police with helicopter support captured 
israels bikerbank bandit thursday as he attempted to rob his 
23rd bank 
police minister roni milo announced the arrest on national 
radio 
the suspect an israeli in his 30s was spotted in the tel aviv 
suburb of ramat gan after parking his red and black motorcycle at a 
back entrance of a bank leumi branch 
he reportedly fled without entering the bank when he spotted a 
police car 
but a police team already had blocked off the area police on 
the goound and in a helicopter pursued him for 7 minutes before he 
was captured 
we were very close to the area heard reports on the radio 
and noticed a bike rider who fled on a small road police officer 
shlomo braunstein told a news conference in tel aviv 
i was directed into the courtyard where the suspect was and 
stopped him afterwards we continued searches and found the 
suspects bike and the pistol braunstein said 
the bandit nicknamed ofnobank hebrew for bikerbank 
robbed 22 banks in a dozen towns the past 22 months 
he became a local hero because of his ability to elude police 
israel television had primetime reports on his exploits and the 
daily hadashot newspaper ran a series of articles trying to pierce 
his mysterious ways there were even tshirts that said 
bikerbank 
before thursday police had no description of the man who 
always wore a crash helmet during his robberies the single 
fingerprint found had drawn a blank in police computers 
his method was always the same striking between 10 am and 
noon robbing the teller nearest the door firing one shot in the 
air from his 38caliber smith and wesson pistol and escaping on 
his highpowered motorcycle 
news reports say bikerbanks loot totaled 150000 
every legend has its end israel radio said after the 
capture was announced 
an unidentified israeli told the army radio the banks are 
harming us all the time its good that somebody harms them once 
milo made reference to such feelings in his statement 
in the course of the various robberies we have witnessed a 
certain feeling of public sympathy for the robber im convinced 
that the public today will see the fact of police success as a 
great public success too that this issue at this stage comes to a 
positive ending 
a tel aviv magistrates court issued an order banning publication 
of the suspects photograph or any identifying details about him 
but before the order was issued media reports said the suspect 
was 37 years old married had no criminal past and came from a 
very wealthy ramat gan family of industrialists 
according to radio reports he was captured at the house of his 
parents

portauprince haiti ap slum priest jeanbertrand aristide 
who has survived at least three assassination attempts and whose 
radical sermons led to his oster from the salesian order said 
thursday he will run for president 
if the people say run i must run aristide said over the 
catholic radio soleil 
aristide 35 was nominated by the democratic convergence a 
progressive political action group of about 300 public figures that 
has been seeking a unity candidate for weeks some grassroots 
organizations and small leftwing parties also endorsed him for 
the dec 16 presidential election 
his candidacy was unexpected reaction was not immediately 
available from the government the military and mainstream parties 
the outspoken priest has many enemies among the elite in this 
impoverished caribbean island nation of 6 million 
the last attempt on his life came in september 1988 as he was 
saying mass at st jean bosco church hooligans with machetes guns 
and spears burst into the church killed 12 worshipers and wounded 
at least 70 
today aristide seldom sleeps at home and never takes the same 
routes 
jeanclaude roy president of the centerleft union of haitian 
constitutionals said thursday aristides influence is 
essentially moral not electoral his candidacy will not win the 
support of conservatives nor even of moderates who are afraid of 
violent confrontation 
there are about 20 other presidential hopefuls but only seven 
have officially filed the deadline is sunday 
aristide runs a center for street children and is known as a 
spokesman for the poor and downtrodden he has said in the past he 
was not interested in political power unless the people called 
me 
aristide was expelled from the conservative salesian order in 
december 1988 after his superiors in rome accused him of fomenting 
class warfare and being a protagonist of destabilization 
a proponent of liberation theology which advocates church 
involvement in the social struggles of the poor aristide preached 
active nonviolence and repeatedly denounced human rights abuses 
by haitis military 
aristide is the one and only candidate on the political scene 
who has wide appeal said economist paul latourtue a former 
senatorial candidate 
his candidacy will not be popular with supporters of the 
duvalier regime which ruled haiti for 29 years until the fall of 
jeanclaude duvalier in 1986 
duvalierist leaders and militants founded the union for national 
reconciliation last sunday and chose roger lafontant for president

president fw de klerk 
meeting a key african national congress demand on thursday lifted 
the 4yearold state of emergency in violenceplagued natal 
province 
the anc and other antiapartheid groups welcomed the move which 
de klerk said removed all obstacles to negotiating powersharing 
between the dominant white minority and the black majority 
there is only one route to peace and reconciliation that is 
through peaceful negotiation the president said in pretoria 
the door to this is now fully open and i am appealing to all 
leaders and all south africans to accept the challenge 
the act officially ended a nationwide state of emergency 
declared in june 1986 when unrest spread throughout the country 
in june de klerk lifted the emergency restrictions in the rest 
of the country but kept them in natal where a power struggle 
between the anc and the conservative inkatha movement has claimed 
5000 lives since 1986 
ending the state of emergency was an anc condition for 
fullscale negotiations with the whiteled government on ending 
apartheid and giving blacks a voice in national affairs 
the united states and other nations that have imposed economic 
sanctions on south africa to protest apartheid also have called for 
the emergency measures to be withdrawn 
the anc praised the move thursday but urged de klerk to release 
all political prisoners and repeal all security legislation 
inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi called the decision a step 
which should bring south africa nearer to the negotiating table 
a spokesman for the white antiapartheid democratic party said 
ending the state of emergency forced anc and inkatha leaders to 
halt violence 
delegations from the two black opposition groups have been 
meeting in natal to try to stop the fighting but buthelezi and anc 
leader nelson mandela have refused to meet in what has become a 
political faceoff over control of the black opposition 
de klerk said the violence though still sporadic had receded 
and that order could be maintained through normal police powers 
the state of emergency gave police and soldiers wideranging 
powers including detention without trial and the authority to 
break up political rallies and meetings under security laws 
police retain the right to impose stringent restrictions in what 
they deem emergency situations 
more than 30000 activists almost all of them black were 
detained for varying lengths of time during the four years of the 
nationwide state of emergency 
law and order minister adriaan vlok told the news conference the 
number of police and soldiers in natal would not change 
police still have limited special powers in black townships 
around johannesburg that have been declared unrest areas about 
800 blacks have died in factional fighting around johannesburg in 
the last two months 
de klerk has now addressed all of the ancs demands including 
the release of political prisoners and the return of some 20000 
exiles 
but exiles have yet to begin returning in large numbers and only 
a few dozen of the more than 1500 political prisoners claimed by 
the anc have been released 
de klerk reiterated that all political parties including 
rightwing conservative and militant black groups are welcome at 
constitutional negotiations he hopes to launch early next year 
only the anc inkatha and the democratic party have expressed a 
desire to attend 
de klerk also said he wants to eliminate apartheid and give all 
south africans a vote of equal value 
the anc which for years has demanded nationalizing big 
business is now asking corporations for financial help business 
day newspaper reported thursday 
it said mandela and other anc leaders approached at least two 
major corporations in south africa and were expected to approach a 
third soon 
no financial commitments were made it said quoting 
unidentified business sources 
an anc statement acknowledged contacts between anc leaders and 
businessmen but said only that the anc was developing a 
fundraising strategy which would likely target business 
organizations

the state on thursday shut down one of the 
largest sludge and oil transport companies in new york harbor 
citing a pattern of abuse of environmental laws 
thomas c jorling state commissioner of the department of 
environmental conservation said the order was the first against an 
entire fleet of barges since the department was created in 1970 
the order comes after one of the barges operating illegally 
sank sept 27 at the first marine shipyard on staten island 
spilling 50000 gallons of oil into the kill van kull between the 
island and new jersey 
that was the latest in a series of unrelated spills that have 
dumped more than 1 million gallons of petroleum products into the 
harbor during the past year 
here we are going further because we have concluded that 
this corporation cannot operate safely jorling said thursday 
the barges cited in the civil order belong to the family of 
former city ports and terminals commissioner susan frank 
the order names three of about 45 familyowned businesses 
berman enterprises inc of manhattan and general marine transport 
corp and standard marine services inc both of bayonne nj 
the companies control at least 19 barges or 10 percent of all 
commercial barges operating in the harbor jorling said they are 
also being investigated for possible criminal violations he said 
also named in the civil order were ms franks mother 
72yearold evelyn berman frank who heads general marine peter 
frank president of general marine and susan franks brother and 
jane frank kresch secretary of berman enterprises and susan 
franks sister 
phone messages left at their offices and at first marine 
shipyard by the associated press were not returned thursday 
the order gives the companies seven days to dock the barges at 
first marine shipyard a hearing was scheduled for oct 30 to 
decide whether the operating licenses should be revoked 
permanently 
the companies hold contracts to dispose of sewage sludge fr 
westchester county and several new jersey cities jorling said 
adding that the state was looking for alternative disposal 
companies 
there should be no interruption in oil supplies he said 
besides the spill last month the state order blamed the 
companies for nine known oil spills three groundings and two 
collisions since 1983 they have also received 21 coast guard 
citations in other cases since then 
fires and explosions involving the barges have killed two people 
and injured several others it said 
eight of the 19 barges lack inspection certificates five failed 
to complete required midterm inspections and five lack dec 
licenses the order said 
evelyn frank and general marine recently pleaded guilty in new 
jersey superior court in a toxicsludge dumping case and was fined 
1 million 
according to the criminal indictment she ordered employees to 
dump toxic substances in the waters off brooklyn and newark nj

prime minister petre roman on thursday 
announced the lifting of most price and wage controls in 
conjunction with a devaluation of the currency 
the new measures which take effect nov 1 are a leap toward 
a market economy but could cause inflation and unemployment 
roman said in a speech to both houses of parliament 
however he said this is the price we must pay to fill 
stores combat speculation and correct the economy 
subsidies are to be maintained for the moment on energy rent 
and some food items it was not clear how much the uncontrolled 
prices actually would increase on nov 1 
items supplied by less than three producers will remain 
pricecontrolled because of insufficent competition to regulate 
prices on a market basis 
under the centralized economy inherited from the communists 
prices and salaries were set without connection to their real 
market value 
since the december revolution that ousted the communist regime 
of nicolae ceausescu both productivity and production have fallen 
by more than 20 percent wages however have increased 11 percent 
at present 50000 of the countrys workforce of 12 million 
people are registered as unemployed but roman warned that hidden 
unemployment is much higher 
he estimated that to avoid massive unemployment about 700000 
inefficient workers and another 300000 of next years 
graduates would have to be retrained 
according to the governments plan romanians should be 
partially compensated for expected price increases through a 
complex system of indexing 
roman said wages are to be liberalized according to market 
principles with the highest wageearners being those who produce 
the most profit 
he said he hoped this would stimulate production enough to 
counteract inflationary pressures of the reform program 
roman said the romanian leu would be devalued to 35 to the 
dollar from its present artificially low rate of 20 the move is 
an effort to halt the spiralling trade deficit and hasten 
convertibility

bambi bembenek and her fiances rekindled public interest 
thursday in the onetime police officer and former model who was 
convicted of murder 
minutes just 10 more minutes and we could have gotten away 
she said in a jail interview with the television show inside 
edition 
listeners jammed the switchboards of milwaukee radio callin 
shows eager to debate ms bembeneks conviction nearly a decade ago 
for killing her former husbands exwife 
as pretty as she is people dont want to believe she did what 
she did said elfred schultz a former milwaukee police detective 
who was briefly married to ms bembenek 
in her native milwaukee residents have long debated ms 
bembeneks involvement in the 1981 killing of christine schultz

killing before that she worked briefly as a milwaukee police

her fiance after escaping from a wisconsin prison three months ago 
ms bembenek was serving a life sentence for killing mrs 
schultz former wife of elfred schultz authorities allege ms

that we were never able to get legally married 
the escape thrilled ms bembeneks milwaukee fans

private investigator offered to research new evidence that would 
help reverse the conviction 
several tabloid tv shows also reported on the escape playing up 
ms bembeneks looks and the romantic elements of the prison break

once on this island has blossomed on 
broadway 
the charming caribbean musical that was a hit last spring at 
offbroadways playwrights horizons has danced into the booth 
theater with its sweet simplicity and hearttugging emotions 
intact 
moving small offbroadway shows to a much bigger broadway 
theater is risky business for every chorus line or aint 
misbehavin theres a chu chem or the human comedy 
but graciela daniele has directed and choreographed once on 
this island with such a sure sense of style and unity that the 
leap to a larger space works the 90minute show a seamless blend 
of narrative song and dance expands to fill the theater 
the story spun by once on this island is a slight one it 
unfolds as a fable told to a little girl on a stormwracked island 
in the french antilles the storytellers virtually the entire cast 
of 11 performers become the characters in the tale 
the musical celebrates the love of a darkskinned peasant girl 
ti moune for daniel the mulatto son of a wealthy landowner she 
saves him from an auto accident and nurses him back to life and 
love 
their relationship is helped and hindered by the gods a 
quartet of deities who represent earth water love and death 
daniel eventually must marry a woman of his own class the two have 
been promised to each other since childhood 
but the ending is far from downbeat in fact its cathartic and 
exhilarating 
part of the exhilaration comes from a radiant young actress with 
an exotic name la chanze who plays ti moune she sings and 
dances with a freshness that is captivating she gets fine support 
from the rest of the cast particularly jerry dixon as the young 
man and kecia lewisevan as the most boisterous of earth mothers 
on a second hearing the score remains as melodic as ever 
stephen flahertys atmospheric music is rich in caribbean rhythms 
wedded to more traditional musical theater songs lynn ahrens who 
did the artful adaptation from a novel by trinidadian writer rosa 
guy has carefully matched flahertys music with simple but not 
simplistic lyrics 
designer loy arcenas has created a deceptively primitive 
background that immediately places the audience in a storybook 
frame of mind he has come up with a bright blue background with a 
few painted palm trees a style that suggests a tropical chagall 
crossed with matisse it looks like a giant childrens popup book 
come to life 
but in the end it is the shows emotional content that is its 
most appealing aspect we root for the girl and her attempt to find 
happiness but then thats not too hard when we have such a 
sparkling heroine who lifts our spirits and the musical as well

dramatic events elsewhere are drying 
up the money pool for afghan guerrillas and one group has started 
mining gems to finance the 12yearold war 
the snowcovered mountains and rocky valleys of the hindu kush 
have been known for centuries as a rich source of emeralds and 
rubies aquamarines and lapis but mining has been primitive and 
irregular 
guerrilla chief ahmed shah masood decided to exploit the mineral 
wealth of the panjshir valley the largest area controlled by a 
single commander to replace dwindling outside aid and pay the 
bills of his islamic army 
for help he turned to gary bowersox a gemologist based in 
honolulu 
bowersox is making a survey of the valleys deposits using a 
soviet study made in 1977 the year before a coup installed a 
communist government and the moslem uprising began 
he said preliminary findings point to a potential in billions of 
dollars 
were seeing crystals of a size and quality that equals or 
surpasses material from anywhere in the world he said in an 
interview during a monthlong visit to the panjshir what weve 
found justifies a closer look 
according to bowerox the valley could rival brazil zambia and 
colombia the worlds leading producers as a source of emeralds 
the richest known emerald deposits are in the colombian jungles 
but gangs of drug traffickers and bandits have interfered with the 
supply 
even in the mid1980s during the fiercest fighting between 
guerrillas and the sovietbacked afghan army precious stones 
trickled out of afghanistan to northern pakistan and on to other 
markets 
bowersox said he would like to bring in sophisticated drilling 
and sorting equipment to speed the mining process and save more of 
the gems 
a lot of the afghan miners are using explosives taken from 
bombs and shells to blast them up he said in the process 
theyre destroying a lot of valuable gemstones 
during the nineyear soviet military involvement in afghanistan 
the united states provided an estimated 300 million of military 
aid to the guerrillas since the red army withdrew in february 
1989 washington been trying to extricate itself from what has 
become a political and military stalemate 
many oilrich arab states that supported the moslem guerrillas 
now are preoccupied with the persian gulf crisis that began aug 2 
when iraq occupied kuwait 
guerrilla commanders say their flow of arms ammunition and 
money has nearly stopped 
gem mining in the panjshir is not done by masoods guerrillas 
but by prospectors who pay digging fees masood also either 
collects a 10 percent tax on gemstones or buys them to sell on the 
world market 
masood whose success against the soviet army made him a folk 
hero said he hoped the gems eventually would finance his military 
operation he would not be specific about profits but said 
were well ahead of our expectations 
residents say the panjshir valley has been relatively free of 
attacks by government forces since the soviets left admirers 
attribute that to masoods military prowess but critics claim he 
made a secret deal with president najibullah 
taloqan capital of takhar province has a population of about 
50000 and is the largest city outside government control it is 
administered by an advisory council that collects taxes to run a 
police force schools clinics and a movie theater 
if masood can continue to supply the level of security he has 
so far this place is a lot safer than colombia bowersox said

maria venus rozario has faced hunger and 
japanese invaders during 100 years in hong kong after her husband 
died when she was 33 she hacked a living for their eight children 
from this jungle of free enterprise 
now mrs rozario is leaving lonely for the children already 
gone and fearful of chinas communist government which takes over 
the british colony in 1997 
when she steps onto the plane for vancouver canada the frail 
but spry greatgrandmother will become the oldest emigrant in a 
mass exodus from hong kong 
the government says 62000 of hong kongs 57 million people 
will leave this year but other estimates put the number closer to 
80000 most emigrants are professionals in their 30s and 40s but 
growing numbers of old people are joining them 
hong kongs elderly left behind by their emigrating children 
often have the bitter choice of dying alone or leaving home 
its not too much to ask to be with ones family is it 
mrs rozario said fingering a tattered family photograph but i 
will also miss hong kong my whole life is here with all my 
memories 
mrs rozario who plans to leave in november has a daughter in 
british columbia and a son in san f section 
downstairs are the steamy steam baths and the chinese happy 
tattoo house upstairs in mrs rozarios apartment are fresh cut 
flowers and a small collection of butterflies 
maria venus gomes da silva was born into a family of sailors 
from the portuguese colony of macao 45 miles south of hong kong on 
the southern chinese coast 
her father moved to hong kong where he married and started a 
family maria went to work at 14 teaching english grammar to the 
daughters of british soldiers stationed in the territory 
she left the school in 1913 to marry a portuguese businessman 
and her first child was born in 1915 
his death of a heart attack in 1923 left mrs rozario alone with 
eight children she never remarried and supported the children by 
working two jobs at once sometimes three as secretary clerk and 
accountant 
you dont know how hard hunger is to take especially when 
its your children who are hungry she said 
then came japans brutal occupation during world war ii 
one day japanese troops lined up a group of young men on a 
boulevard by hong kongs harbor a japanese policeman moved along 
the rank chopping off their heads with a sword 
one of mrs rozarios sons marcos was last in line he had 
been arrested for resisting the occupation 
i ran through the crowd and pleaded with the man to save my 
boy she said he gave in 
at the end of the war mrs rozario collected marcos from jail 
he was tortured and broken by the japanese and still lives with his 
mother unable to work 
mrs rozario said she hopes to take marcos to canada but if 
we cannot get the visa then he will stay here this is what has 
become of my family 
after the war her other children left hong kong one by one 
attracted by better job prospects or propelled by fear of the 
communists in china 
the family all wanted to stay she said but it was the 
insecurity about hong kong that made them leave how can we live in 
peace here with the chinese ready to grab us back 
soon after chinas bloody crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing last year mrs rozario also decided to go 
just like in the bible its really an exodus she said 
im just a little drop of water in all this

cindys husband roused their sleeping 
12yearold son at midnight youre the first one thats going to 
die he said 
that night cindy and her three kids left the beatings the 
threats the daily violence of her crazyjealous husband forever 
after 16 years of marriage of control so complete she lost 
herself cindy found the courage to face freedom 
i thank god im free said cindy who didnt want her real 
name used for fear her husband will find her im home with my 
kids 
the twobedroom apartment they share is an experiment in 
independence for battered women believed to be the first of its 
kind in the nation permanent homes with social services 
downstairs thursday marks the official opening six women and 
their children have moved in and eight more are coming 
there are at least 4 million cindys each year in america 
according to the national coalition against domestic violence 
every 15 seconds a woman is beaten every six hours a woman is 
murdered by her husband or boyfriend 
still women stay with their abusers because a violent home 
often seems better than no home at all and that is the choice 
the sad truth is that battering causes homelessness a victim 
services agency study showed that 35 percent of women living in 
city homeless shelters were there to escape men who beat them 
in order to protect yourself and care for yourself you have 
to let go of everything friends family furniture clothing 
said social worker olosunde johnson who is helping these women 
face the future things that you love that have emotional value 
to you and you have to walk out and leave that and theres 
something wrong with that 
cindy left and lived in a shelter for battered women one of 
1700 serving 20000 cities nationwide the national domestic 
violence hotline receives 108000 calls a year about onethird of 
which request shelter but the need far outstrips the available 
space 
a los angeles county grand jury found last year that 90 percent 
of the battered women and children who sought safety were turned 
away in washington dc eight out of every 10 women are told 
there is no room advocates believe the situation is similar in new 
york chicago and other big cities 
and then after 90 days you have to be uprooted again this 
is victimization after victimization johnson said it just 
keeps eating away at the women and the children who am i is a 
question that comes up who am i 
the victimization stops at the glass doors on a residential 
street in brooklyn the ones that lead to these 16 apartments 
permanent homes ones the women and their children leave of their 
own free will and return to feeling safe 
this man used to tell me when to go to bed when to take a 
bath when to get up five minutes to go to the store and after 
five minutes there would have been a beating or a fight cindy 
33 said now its just me and the kids nobody to say no you 
cant go or if you go im going to hit you and its 
wonderful 
advocates say this permanent housing which cost 17 million 
over 18 months to develop is the logical conclusion in the 
evolution of services for battered women in the early 70s people 
would open their private homes for abused women and their kids 
emergency shelters followed where women could stay for up to three 
months 
it soon became clear that it took more than 90 days to reorder a 
life so transitional housing was born which allowed stays of a 
year or 18 months 
even that was not enough the economy was changing living costs 
were soaring in big cities like new york and the result was that 
during the 1980s battered women were increasingly returning to the 
men who abused them simply because they couldnt afford not to 
and the thing that was different was housing said lucy 
friedman executive director of victim services agency the 
independent nonprofit group that created the housing with the 
urban coalition it got down to going back to an abusive partner 
or going to a welfare hotel 
now these women are home for good the social services provided 
by johnson will be here for 18 months there is a support group 
for the women and another for their children johnson works on 
getting child care enrolling the kids and the women in school 
helping them achieve their career goals 
johnsons desk is in the basement but her heart is with the 
women shes been there and that helps her maintain her faith that 
these women will come as far as she has 
it also helps me in identifying whats going on with them 
even when theyre unable to identify it she said and it helps 
me to love them even when theyre unlovable 
sometimes jennifer gets that way comes downstairs acting like a 
fool leaves the tidy threebedroom apartment she shares with her 
two daughters and young son and vents some of the anger and 
depression that comes of growing up abused with 10 brothers and 
sisters then being abused for two years by a crackaddicted 
husband and being a crack addict herself 
jennifer bounced from shelter to shelter for more than a year 
her children in tow fighting urges to smoke crack again to drink 
herself into oblivion to kill herself and be done with it all she 
left her husband for her childrens sake but the injustice of 
having to walk out that door still galls her 
i left my own apartment not his mine he is the one who had 
my apartment when i was in the streets including the nights he put 
me in the streets the 26yearold said cold freezing outside 
with my children five or six in the morning 
she left once and returned once she left again almost returned 
again but thought better of it not being involved with the 
batterer is one of the criteria for renting one of these heavily 
subsidized apartments that and being drug and alcoholfree and 
being motivated to move ahead with life being willing to learn how 
to act independently without fear 
jennifer and cindy are doing their best 
when i finally felt safe that i could sleep and walk the 
street without somebody yelling or doing something then i started 
thinking i want a home for my children cindy said i always 
told them im going to get you a better home 
thank god i did now we have everything

richard lesher knew that relations with the 
white house were less than cordial when he says john sununu 
threatened to remove part of leshers anatomy with a chain saw 
sununu is chief of staff in president bushs white house while 
lesher is president and chief executive officer of the us chamber 
of commerce a strong supporter of free enterprise and economic 
growth 
the communications gap opened several months ago when the 
chamber expressed support for lower social security payments and 
took a stand against piling mandated benefit obligations on the 
back of industry 
now although lesher says the lines remain open the rift is 
wide as it is between the white house and other organizations that 
many people had assumed would be administration supporters the 
chamber opposed the budget package 
leshers lists the reasons why 
1 raising taxes when the economy is in recession is dangerous 
eighty percent of the original package was in higher taxes only 20 
percent in cuts 
2 the notion of secret summit meetings for six months followed 
by demands for approval within days and without open hearings is 
wrong especially since some of the agreements broke new ground 
3 among proposals agreed to by the budget summitteers was a 
huge increase to 50000 from 10000 in fines for violations 
of the occupational safety and health act it was carefully 
secluded in the package 
4 the assumptions that interest rates would decline inflation 
tail off and the economy grow in spite of antigrowth 
recommendations were unsupported 
after extensive talks with professional economists and with 
members around the country lesher says i feel very strongly we 
are heading into a substantial recession one made more so by the 
socalled solution 
popular forecasts generally refer to a mild recession one 
lasting for two straight quarters each of about 1 percent negative 
growth many forecasts assume that wise inventory management 
americans have learned to keep supplies to a minimum and strong 
exports will prevent a more serious decline 
lesher doesnt believe it he concedes that inventory management 
is good but points out that exports already are slowing 
he speculates about a world recession latin america already 
is in the tank asia is headed there and europe is weakening he 
says domestically the recession would last six straight quarters 
including all 1991 
vision and leadership in congress would lessen the blow he 
says but he laments that it isnt forthcoming asked for an 
example he refers to the nondebate on making the united states 
energy independent 
he suggests the countrys policy should be one of encouraging 
exploration and development of oil in alaska offshore and 
elswhere that distribution pipelines be built that nuclear 
possibilities should be reinvestigated 
these things alone might bring back the economy he said 
while of course making the country less dependent on supplies 
from abroad but he lamented proponents too often become buried 
in blind emotional reactions 
it has reached the point he said where people of common 
sense have been shouted down by voices of emotionalism and 
distortion he suggested that opponents of oil drilling posing 
as environmentalists prevent sensible debate on offshore 
developments to wit 
we have drilled thousands of wells on the coasts and weve 
had one major oil spill but since further efforts often are 
thwarted the united states must transport oil by ship incurring 
vastly greater ecological risks 
the economy is under siege said lesher not just from those 
whom he feels politicize and emotionalize energy issues but from 
economic policy makers too

after taking a back seat to worries about 
taxes the economy and the middle east abortion is reemerging as 
a potentially decisive issue in the final days of the 1990 election 
season 
its one of the few issues thats still out there that 
distinguishes people said harrison hickman a pollster for 
abortionrights causes i would predict youll see a lot of 
people using it at the last minute to try to push undecided 
voters 
conventional political wisdom has held that abortionrights 
candidates had the upper hand this year and that opponents of 
abortion were on the defensive after a 1989 supreme court ruling 
revived the issue electoral losses for abortion foes in 1989 
contributed to that view 
yet abortion hasnt proven to be the silver bullet for 
abortionrights candidates in the words of democrat donald 
avenson a prochoice candidate for iowa governor and abortion 
opponents point to races where their candidates have stood firm and 
are leading including governors races in ohio pennsylvania 
texas and iowa 
its not the issue some thought a year ago on the other hand 
its more salient this year than it has been in the past in a lot 
of states said doug johnson legislative director for the 
national right to life committee 
as a result some thought abortion was fizzling this year as an 
issue 
but strategists for abortionrights campaigns say there will be 
a flurry of lastminute advertising pushing the abortion issue in 
some races its already begun 
sometimes the push will be on television but in other cases it 
will be more selectively targeted toward young women voters through 
directmail or telephone 
people are thinking this is a dead issue i think thats just 
a fundamental misunderstanding of this issue said celinda lake 
who has conducted polling for abortionrights candidates around the 
country 
its a lastminute issue she said its something you lay 
out in the last weeks of a campaign 
abortionrights strategists say their target audience younger 
voters typically does not pay attention to campaigns until the 
final stages 
lake says polling shows that increasing economic worries and 
lack of trust of democrats on the economy has caused a dropoff in 
support for democrats among younger women she said abortion may 
lure them back 
its a big drop off 10 points she said because of that 
youll see more prochoice directmail geared toward that audience 
at the end 
in north carolinas senate race both antiabortion sen jesse 
helms and his democratic challenger harvey gantt have been airing 
ads on the issue 
but in most states its the abortionrights candidates who have 
been using the issue in television ads 
in oregon democrat harry lonsdale has drawn even in his 
challenge to gop sen mark hatfield according to recent polls 
after airing ads that attack hatfields opposition to abortion 
among other issues 
one race where abortion hasnt been the factor that was expected 
is in florida where former sen lawton chiles is challenging gop 
gov robert martinez who opposes abortion chiles who supports 
abortion rights has found the issue uncomfortable for him and 
isnt airing ads despite martinez seeming vulnerability on the 
issue 
the issue is important in iowas senate race where democratic 
incumbent tom harkin has a doubledigit lead over antiabortion 
challenger rep tom tauke according to recent polls 
harkin has been the abortionrights pointman in the senate and 
he led the fight last week to oppose an amendment requiring 
teenage girls to notify their parents before getting an abortion 
parental consent on abortion tends to gain strong support in most 
polls but harkin said the overall abortion issue helps him 
the last thing my opponent wants to talk about is the choice 
issue harkin said im watching my tracking polls and the 
number of people viewing his position as extreme is going like 
this he added pointing upward 
the senate adopted the parental consent provision on a 4848 
vote but the amendment was expected to be deleted in later 
congressional action harkins side was surprised it drew 48 votes 
that vote has become an issue in california where both 
candidates for governor are trying to appeal to abortionrights 
supporters democratic candidate dianne feinstein blasted her gop 
rival sen pete wilson for missing the vote while campaigning 
abortion opponents have the upper hand in several races 
in kansas democratic gubernatorial candidate joan finney has 
had difficulty explaining her antiabortion position recently but 
she still leads gop gov mike hayden an abortionrights supporter 
in the polls 
antiabortion republican george voinovich has the lead in ohios 
governor race where democrat anthony celebrezze has been 
criticized for a startling flipflop in which he dropped his 
longstanding opposition to abortion 
a september poll by the university of cincinnati found that the 
issue was helping voinovich more than celebrezze voinovich led 
among the 13 percent of respondents who said abortion was the 
single most important issue 
in iowas governors race democrat avenson is running 
abortionrights ads but has yet to catch up with antiabortion gop 
incumbent terry branstad 
abortion opponents in idaho were angered by gov cecil andrus 
veto of a restrictive abortion bill this year but he is in strong 
shape in his reelection bid 
its become more of an issue in idahos senate and house races 
however 
idaho republican senate candidate larry craig surprised his 
antiabortion supporters when he was asked in a debate what he 
would do if his wife became pregnant as a result of rape 
he responded that it was her decision which seemed at odds with 
his opposition to legal abortions democrat ron twilegar jumped on 
the response saying he wanted all women to have that choice but 
craig seemed to want it only for his wife craig says he was 
misinterpreted and hasnt strayed from his opposition to abortion 
abortion also is an issue in about a dozen congressional races 
in northern virginia for example democrat james moran is 
airing abortionrights ads against gop rep stan parris 
democrats see the issue helping moran the alexandria mayor 
since the district was won by gov doug wilder in an important 
abortion test last year

in the late 1940s the communist 
authorities chased jan zamoyski from the highlands of southern 
poland where his aristocratic family had ruled for nearly four 
centuries 
fortyfive years later another zamoyski is in charge of zamosc 
invited back by townspeople who elected him mayor in the first 
democratic vote in decades 
it is one of the many ironies in postcommunist poland a nation 
at once rushing forward and stepping backward 
jan zamoyskis son marcin walks the renaissance cobblestones 
of zamosc greeted by the slight bows of a respectful populace and 
kissing hands in the genteel style of old poland 
he is the first to say his name will get him only so far in 
todays polish republic however and that much must be done to 
repair respect for values the main thing lost during those 45 
years 
the communists nationalized private land and factories like all 
the vilified gentry jan zamoyski lost everything and was barred 
from living within 30 miles of his former estates 
that law remains on the books but parliament is working out 
ways to return confiscated property and businesses to former 
owners as poland plunges toward capitalism it is welcoming back 
the exiled nobility and in other ways resurrecting the social 
fabric of a prouder past 
when given a chance to vote the people of zamosc turned to the 
son of a man the communists called one of the reactionary relics 
of feudalism 
there is no doubt that my name decided it marcin zamoyski 
said maybe they imagined that i would do here as much as my 
father used to 
zamoyski born in 1947 was working in warsaw as a cameraman for 
german television he had little connection with zamosc and none 
with his familys prewar world of prestige wealth and public 
responsibility 
his father nearing 80 turned down an invitation from zamosc to 
run in the parliamentary elections of june 1989 when marcin was 
asked to be a candidate for mayor the son thought it was a nice 
joke 
marcin zamoyski was persuaded to run by the great joy of the 
people he met in zamosc a provincial capital three hours drive 
southeast of warsaw 
they thought i was the one who would assure them what they 
imagined the authorities should be good and just he said 
his father hugged and kissed him the son said and it was 
only then that i understood how happy he was 
it was in 1571 that his fathers namesake the secretary to king 
zygmunt august inherited three and a half villages as the 
history books say and began planning his ideal city 
that jan zamoyski educated in paris and padua brought the 
vision of the renaissance to zamosc building a university and 
library in a city underpinned by a geometric street plan and a 
sophisticated sewer system 
many ethnic groups settled in the city each contributing its 
skills and trades zamosc became selfsufficient a citystate that 
grew in prestige as its founder became polands chancellor and 
military chief 
the zamoyski family remained among polands most powerful and 
the zamosc properties were handed down through the generations 
at the outbreak of world war ii jan zamoyski was the 
ordinat or lord controlling farmland and numerous industries 
in the region 
in 1939 the soviet army invaded poland from the east in three 
days the soldiers carted off everything of value from the family 
palace at klemensow outside zamosc the family mansion in warsaw 
was burned the same year 
after the war according to a recent magazine article the 
time of social justice came the zamoyski name could be written 
only on graves 
jan zamoyski and his wife fled to krakow where he was arrested 
by security forces as the communists consolidated power 
they moved to the baltic coast after his release he was 
arrested again because his background made him suspect and 
imprisoned from 1948 until 1956 
the first return to zamosc in 1958 was painful for the elder 
zamoyski who was berated in the newspapers and tailed by security 
agents but marcin then 11 remembers a warm reception by 
townspeople 
zamoyskis father stopped returning to zamosc and the son came 
back rarely mostly for funerals 
marcin zamoyskis family lives in warsaw and he stays with a 
friend in zamosc where housing is scarce the communists turned 
the family palace into a psychiatric hospital 
zamosc like most polish cities is nearly broke because huge 
subsidies from the national treasury have ended the onceadmired 
sewer system is collapsing and there is no money to restore the 
fine architecture which zamoyski believes could be a valuable 
tourist attraction 
it is not so easy to incite people to work he said in a 
voice tinged with frustration im telling them they should start 
this work within themselves they should treat this town as 
something that is theirs 
the people came up with the idea that i was the one he 
said now it is hard work and nothing else 
residents of zamosc appear charmed by their new mayor 
maybe i am romantic i like history but he is from a very 
good family that contributed a lot to poland said marek 
rzezniak an artist 
rzezniak said the family name is money in the bank for him 
the future will tell whether he fulfills the requirements

the government is getting tougher on 
central americans who migrate through its territory in hopes of 
trading poverty war and repression at home for jobs in the united 
states 
us officials welcome the new policy in mexico which is 
forging closer economic ties with its powerful northern neighbor 
but some mexicans fear their government will turn next on its own 
citizens who sneak across the border 
smugglers and thieves prey on the central americans most of 
whom are from el salvador and guatemala crooked immigration 
officials take their money and honest ones deport them but still 
they come by the thousands 
they know there is a risk but its nothing compared to the 
risks they run in their own countries said jose luis perez 
canchola of the center for migrant investigations and studies in 
tijuana 
the number of central americans deported from mexico has 
increased from 14000 in 1988 to 80000 in the first six months of 
1990 which makes the long dangerous trip north even more 
difficult 
mexico is not the easy springboard it once was into the united 
states said duke austin of the immigration and naturalization 
service in washington 
between 300000 and 400000 central americans are estimated to 
be in mexico at any one time often working at menial jobs for 
money to complete the journey 
for many the departure point is tecun uman guatemala just 
across the border from tapachula in chiapas mexicos southernmost 
state 
in the town square of tecun uman the migrants meet the 
coyotes coyotes who smuggle human beings it is a place to 
change your money your identity maybe your luck 
sabino gonzalez is a parttime preacher and fulltime money 
changer who haunts the square calculator in one hand and a fistful 
of cash in the other he also is a gobetween for the smugglers and 
their customers 
this guy is good one of the best he said introducing a 
coyote who gave his name as jose manuel sanchez 
sanchez named his price 1000 from tecun uman to tijuana a 
journey of nearly 2000 miles from the suchiate river on mexicos 
southern border and the rio grande on the north 
you wont even get your feet wet sanchez assured a 
prospective client the price includes bribes hotels used by the 
coyote network and transportation by raft taxi bus train and 
private car he said 
at dawn on the river bank the journey began 
why not cross at night the client asked 
thieves sanchez replied they will rob you and maybe 
worse 
some people attribute the increase in the number of central 
americans apprehended to attempts by the 2yearold administration 
of president carlos salinas de gortari to clean up a corrupt 
immigration service 
sergio melendez director of a 220bed roman catholic church 
shelter in tijuana is not among them 
those without money are the ones who are deported he said 
there is still corruption we think about two out of five make it 
across 
at the northern end of the pipeline two salvadoran and three 
guatemalan women shared a cramped cell in the tijuana city jail 
they made it across both rivers only to be caught by the us 
border patrol near san ysidro calif 
because they claimed to be mexicans they were deported to 
tijuana where unscrupulous mexican immigration officers put them 
in touch with a coyote each paid 800 to cross again but were 
caught and deported a second time 
they have been in jail since aug 8 held as witnesses against 
the coyote and as illegal immigrants they have no idea when the 
case will be heard 
judith martinez salmeron 39 left three children with their 
grandmother in el salvador to seek work in the united states the 
journey cost everything the family could scrape together 
i cant work she said through the grating that separated 
her from a visitor i am worried about my children 
she looked down at her hands i dont know what is going to 
happen to us 
mexicos 560mile southern border with guatemala is even more 
hostile to central americans than its northern frontier the 
regional head of immigration in tapachula baltazar mejia said 
50000 illegal immigrants had been deported from the area in nine 
months 
its a whole lot easier to hold the line there and the 
south is out of the limelight bill freylick of the us 
committee for refugees in washington said during a recent trip to 
mexico and central america 
the crackdown has had a chilling effect on those who give 
sanctuary to the central americans 
a church hostel in tapachula the only shelter in the south 
closed recently the director miguel dominguez said he feared a 
new law providing prison terms of two to 10 years for those who 
help illegal migrants 
us immigration agents have increased their intelligence 
activities in the south virtually all the information they are 
gathering they are sharing with their mexican counterparts said 
a us official familiar with immigration matters 
closer cooperation between us and mexican officials which 
began last year was an early sign that mexicos tolerant attitude 
toward central american migrants had changed 
this is part of the price the united states is demanding for a 
freetrade agreement said monsignor samuel ruiz the catholic 
bishop of san cristobal de las casas in chiapas 
freylick agreed the us pressure doesnt even have to be 
explicit if mexico wants a freetrade agreement it has to seem 
simpatico 
us officials deny pressuring president salinas to stem the 
flow of central americans 
there is no substance to that at all one said salinas 
has ordered this for the good of his own country 
immigration issues particularly the flow of central americans 
have been high on the two nations agenda and they have established 
a highlevel working group 
we are asking mexico to pay attention to the problem but it 
is not a highpressure situation said the us official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
mexico did not stop its own people from crossing the border 
until recently last year mexican police and us border patrol 
agents carried out a joint operation at tijuanasan ysidro in which 
500 people were arrested most of them mexicans 
the mexican government responded to the outcry by saying the 
objective was to protect the migrants from drug dealers and 
thieves

in the eye of the cowboy artist the american 
west still rolls unfettered unsullied and untamed toward a horizon 
rich with opportunity and bright with adventure 
some critics say the image never reflected reality but it has 
turned the annual sale and art show of the cowboy artists of 
america into a happening for investors and collectors from more 
than 30 states and many foreign countries 
the event which started friday is the 25th since four hungry 
artists met in a tavern in sedona and drew up plans to market a 
brand of realistic actionbased art that was scorned in 
avantgarde areas on both coasts but seemed as natural to them as 
breathing 
they and a few others sold 49000 worth of paintings and 
sculpture in 1965 last years receipts from the offerings of 35 
artists totaled more than 1 million one oil by howard terpning of 
tucson brought a record 135000 
i thought when i first came in contact with their work that it 
had no real economic value said sheldon reich a university of 
arizona specialist in modern american and european art 
i have since changed my mind it has a rather broad audience 
and the pictures do have rather substantial value 
reich said that he nevertheless is no fan of the genre which 
association members call western american realism and which he 
calls representational 
yes they depict the west but its a mythical west for the 
most part theyre not into for example revealing any accurate 
depictions of the american past its the west of the imagination 
from my point of view its not much better than john wayne 
movies he said 
caa members have heard it all before along with the jibes that 
they are illustrators not artists 
in the preface to the 1989 exhibition catalog thenpresident 
william moyers of albuquerque nm wrote that there is no 
strict demarcation between art and illustration 
the only valid issue is whether our paintings sculptures and 
drawings are the best we can produce he added 
terpning who worked in new york for 25 years as an illustrator 
for magazines and advertising campaigns is equally unbowed by 
criticism 
im sure some abstract artists probably look down their noses 
at what we do and representational artists would prefer to look at 
other representational art he said i know a lot of great art 
is being done ive seen some beautiful abstract art and i say to 
each his own ive certainly seen some that i thought was 
atrocious but to somebody else it looks great 
if the cowboy artists are creating art for the masses the 
phoenix show indicates the masses are responding 
the event annually draws more than 1000 customers at 125 per 
head for the friday night show and some other events or 200 for 
everything else and an awards banquet saturday night 
each artist is allowed to display up to six works and set a 
price on each few pass up the chance to buy whether for resale or 
collection 
the bylaws of the invitationonly caa stipulate that the 
organization exists to perpetuate the memory and culture of the 
old west they also require it to sponsor a trail ride and 
campout each year in which the real horsemen of the group mingle 
with tenderfeet 
members such as terpning and harvey w johnson another 
illustrator who had taught for 19 years at the famous artists 
school form one end of the spectrum of the caa those who were 
born far from the areas they came to love and depict on canvas at 
the other end is bill owen a bona fide cowboy who grew up on a 
ranch near gila bend and owns another near dewey 
yet regardless of origin they share the feeling of the genre 
to paint cowboy art owen said each artist must know his subject 
intimately 
you have to have that love for the subject matter before you 
can paint he said you have to know it inside and out so many 
things you see where its obvious the painter just doesnt know his 
subject matter to me its like telling a lie 
johnson said he was illustrating pulp magazines when he became 
fascinated with mountain men and indians figures who recur again 
and gain in his work 
now a resident of santa fe nm johnson echoed owens feelings 
about authenticity depending on familiarity and said his 
background was helpful in the intensive research he needed to do in 
the new field 
even though the pulps were inexpensive magazines your things 
had to be accurate he said 
the accuracy required by representational art makes it valuable 
in preserving western history johnson said for example he helped 
restore the memory of the second fort built at what is now laramie 
wyo 
the original was a stockadestyle structure of wood it was 
replaced by an adobe fort which had vanished from memory johnson 
said he was able to paint it from rude sketches done by an army 
officer who had visited there 
the other thing is that the landscape hasnt changed very much 
in rural areas he said people say the old west is done 
thats baloney first of all theres the people theyre the old 
rawboned people you look in the old photographs thats the 
same face and of course the animals are the same coyotes deer 
eagles and everything else

when charles and carol stuart were found shot in 
their car on oct 23 1989 they were depicted as a perfect 
suburban couple whose lives had been destroyed by a monster from 
the inner city 
a year later it is clear monsters were unleashed that night 
but no one can say which ones or how many a husbands murderous 
inclinations law enforcement ineptitude a brothers complicity 
racism 
the monsters haunt boston a year after the shootings the grand 
jury investigating the case has yet to issue any indictments and 
though the crime was solved in a television dramatization 
broadcast nationwide questions persist that may never be answered 
on that night a year ago carol stuart a tax attorney who was 
seven months pregnant was shot in the head in the citys mission 
hill area as she and her husband left a hospital birthing class 
mrs stuart 30 died a few hours after her son christopher 
was prematurely delivered the baby died 17 days later 
charles stuart who was seriously wounded in the stomach told 
police a black man had abducted them in their car robbed them and 
shot them the next morning headlines delivered his story to the 
world 
police kicked in doors and randomly searched mission hill 
residents in the hunt for the black assailant whom they eventually 
announced they had located 
but that man was absolved jan 4 when stuart jumped to his 
death in the icy waters of boston harbor his death came the day 
after his younger brother matthew told police he had been 
enlised by charles to aid in what he thought was an insurance 
scam 
police say they had no reason to doubt stuart but blacks say 
the authorities were too quick to pursue a stereotypical suspect in 
a city racked by racism 
i dont think the citys learned anything from this louis 
elisa head of the boston chapter of the national association for 
advancement of colored people said recently 
the issues are the same violence against people of color 
continues people still complain they still dont get equal 
treatment under the law 
it still is not known exactly how the shootings occurred or who 
fired the weapon though police believe stuart killed his wife 
the conclusion of the television movie its possible someone else 
fired one or both shots 
if stuart did fire the gun what madness triggered him to kill 
his wife for the insurance money to start a restaurant as reports 
have suggested when the money was scarcely enough to cover the 
mortgage on their house 
two men apparently know the secrets of the case stuarts 
brother matthew and his lawyer john t dawley but laws have 
shielded both 
stuart apparently told dawley of his plot to kill his wife the 
day before he died prosecutors want the states highest court to 
force dawley to tell what he knows to the grand jury 
but dawley is protected by attorneyclient privilege and 
lawyers say it is unlikely the court will force him to testify 
matthew stuart told police his brother tossed him a package from 
his car in mission hill as part of what he thought was an insurance 
scam he allegedly disposed of the 38caliber pistol used in the 
shooting as well as other items he said he believed would later be 
reported stolen 
he also said he did not recognize mrs stuart in his brothers 
car mistaking her body for a duffle bag or laundry sack 
matthew stuart has been protected from arrest and the intense 
examination that would go with it by a state statute that immunizes 
blood relatives from prosecution as accessories after the fact 
its quite likely he would have been prosecuted as an 
accessory after the fact were it not for that exemption said 
phyllis goldfarb a criminal law professor at boston college who 
has followed the case 
his attorney nancy gertner said prosecutors were groping for 
dawleys testimony because they didnt have much of a case 
if the investigation is foundering because they cant get 
dawley to testify then theyve done a bad job she said if 
theyre waiting on that then their prosecution is in trouble 
paul leary first assistant district attorney of suffolk county 
has refused comment on the importance of dawleys testimony but he 
conceded the grand jury probably would not reconvene until the 
court rules on whether dawley must testify 
even if stuarts attorney has to disclose what he was told 
that may not clear up everything goldfarb said the chance of 
finding out the answers to this case died when charles stuart 
did 
in retrospect police had at least several reasons to look more 
closely at stuart the 29yearold manager of a fur store 
husbands always are considered suspects in such cases and 
stuarts failure in his call for help to distinguish any landmarks 
in a city he knew well seemed odd he told the police dispatcher 
that when the shots were fired he ducked and his wife was hit but 
ducking would have little bearing on a bullet fired by an assailant 
in the back seat 
when he viewed a lineup containing william bennett the black 
man police linked to the shootings he could provide no stronger 
identification than to say bennett most resembled the assailant by 
then staart probably had seen bennetts photo in boston 
newspapers 
stuarts death prompted renewed cries of outrage from black 
leaders who contended police ran roughshod over the rights of 
minorities in their search for a black suspect 
police had nothing on bennett but still they kicked in his 
mothers door tried to cajole his family to give testimony 
elisa said 
still some good has come from the tragedy a foundation set up 
by carol stuarts family in her name has raised nearly 500000 and 
funded 33 scholarships for students in mission hill 
for her family the pain of carols death has ebbed little in a 
year 
its painful to talk about we try not to said her brother 
carl dimaiti im surprised that its already been a year its 
still very hard to think about 
dimaiti has taken over the familys pizza dough business from 
his father who has retired 
dad comes down to the bakery to help he said id rather 
have him here with me than home by himself the worst thing is for 
them to sit around the house

the new 408 billion farm bill cuts deeply 
into spending on federal programs another indication that farmers 
will be linked even more firmly to overseas markets 
over the next five years the agriculture department will have 
to trim projected outlays by 136 billion as its part in an 
overall 500 billion federal deficit reduction 
the net result is that farmers will be looking less toward 
washington for a large part of their incomes and more to europe 
the soviet union japan china and scores of other countries that 
need us commodities 
by reducing the amount of land eligible for crop payments each 
year the 1990 farm bill cuts costs it also frees the extra land 
for use as a farmer chooses by not restricting it to a program 
crop base 
it gives the american farmer a great deal of flexibility and 
freedom to plant said sen richard lugar of indiana the ranking 
republican on the senate agriculture committee 
rep kika de la garza dtexas and the chairman of the house 
agriculture committee said you cross your fingers and hope that 
giving them flexibility will make up for the loss of support 
the new farm bill is the latest in a long series of moves to 
bring more marketoriented features into us farm policy and to 
provide an income safety net for producers 
it was the agriculture and consumer protection act of 1973 that 
produced a fundamental change in farm programs by initiating the 
target price concept 
under it farmers began to get deficiency payments or direct 
subsidies whenever market prices averaged less than the target 
levels 
this introduced federal income supports as a way of life in 
american agriculture officially the government said it was 
supporting the incomes of farmers not simply their commodity 
prices 
the concept survives in the 1990 farm bill but in a reduced 
role because of the need to trim federal spending 
marketoriented economies have burst upon the world scene faster 
than anyone had dared speculate a short time ago with new systems 
undergoing development pangs in the soviet union and eastern 
europe 
a final push for the integration of the european community the 
12nation trading bloc is set for 1992 
structural adjustments are being made throughout the third world 
as nations try to respond to complex and awesome debt problems 
these and other factors are being brought to bear on us 
agriculture and its producers says the agriculture department 
mathew shane of the departments economic research service says 
the multilateral talks under the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade also bear watching 
the gatt talks also called the uruguay round of discussions 
are scheduled to end by dec 31 the goal is to liberalize trading 
rules among the 97 gatt trading partners 
agriculture is but one of 15 trading areas being negotiated 
however it is seen as the key to the talks because third world 
countries have balked at agreeing to us proposals on removing 
barriers to trade in services and strengthening copyright 
enforcement unless they win expanded markets for their farm 
products 
last week the united states offered a compromise proposal aimed 
at breaking a deadlock on the gatt trade reform discussions the 
bush administration said it would seek agreement from the other 
countries to cut farm export subsidies by 90 percent and 
tradedistorting domestic supports by 75 percent over the next 10 
years 
previously the united states had sought total elimination of 
export and other tradedistorting subsidies and policies by the 
year 2000 
the us proposal in geneva where the gatt talks are being 
held was endorsed by the american farm bureau federation the 
national farmers union however had reservations and still viewed 
the us position as basically antifamilyfarm in its general 
thrust 
economist shane writing in the october issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine described a growing consensus that domestic 
farm policies have global repercussions 
a marketoriented outcome to the gatt talks would improve the 
environment in which commodity markets operate he said 
competitiveness in these markets would then be related to real 
comparative advantages of the producing countries 
shane said that for farmers to remain major players in world 
markets us policies must be realigned to reflect the new 
international realities 
he added this would not mean giving up the objectives of 
supporting farm income and providing increased stability for 
farmers but redesigning the policies to achieve these objectives 
without distorting the market signals would improve us export 
performance and promote efficient use of global resources

his poll ratings have slumped but it doesnt 
show at the republican cash register as president bush seeks money 
and votes for gop candidates in a methodical unmatched offyear 
election campaign 
hes helped raise more campaign money than any president before 
by white house count bush campaign events have produced about 
565 million for republican candidates this year that compares 
with about 33 million raised at ronald reagans appearances in the 
last offyear election campaign 
so far bush has attended 67 campaign events with more to come 
in the final two weeks an extra push is likely just before the 
nov 6 elections to help mobilize republicans and turn out the 
vote 
with the slip in bushs popularity rating democrats have been 
saying that hes less of an asset claiming that some republican 
candidates are keeping their distance wishful thinking said a 
white house official adding that there has been no letup in the 
requests for campaign help 
that held despite republican differences about the politically 
costly stalemate on the swelling federal deficit which led bush to 
jettison his nonewtaxes pledge while republican challengers for 
congress were campaigning on that very theme 
hes campaigned for dissenters including a senator who called 
his budget settlement a turkey and a senate challenger who likened 
the tax provisions to a mugging bush skirts their differences by 
saying that if there were more republicans in congress the deficit 
and the budget wouldnt be such a mess 
at one point white house chief of staff john h sununu 
suggested that republicans who broke with bush on the budget might 
be taking a campaign risk 
sununu said he didnt threaten punishment what i said was 
the president will go into your district and campaign for you he 
wants your support on the budget i hope that you supported him 
because if he looks you in the eye and asks you to do it on the 
campaign it might be a little embarrassing 
even that hasnt happened bush said he is campaigning for broad 
principles not itembyitem backing his campaign effort 
concentrates on senate seats and governors first on defending 
threatened republican incumbents then on boosting promising 
challengers 
the emphasis all along has been on fundraising and it began 
early even before the election year with gop appearances the 
white house said helped raise about 25 million in 1989 
the rallies and the speeches are the visible side of the effort 
but the vital campaign business is done at the 1000andup 
receptions where donors get a presidential greeting a handshake 
or a photo thats the most effective kind of campaign work for a 
president in an offyear when he isnt on the ballot 
for all his campaigning bush has avoided themes that would lend 
themselves to a reading of the offyear returns as a referendum on 
his presidency the appraisal is inevitable but hes done nothing 
to encourage it the way reagan did in his offyear campaigns 
reagan campaigned intensively in 1986 in an unsuccessful effort 
to keep republican control of the senate he said he didnt want to 
be a sixyear president with programs blocked by a democratic 
senate he urged voters to support republican senate candidates 
if youd like to vote for me one last time 
but republicans lost the senate that year the democrats gained 
eight seats to the 55vote majority they still hold 
bush asks support for republican candidates and principles 
without personalized appeals like reagans presidents who try that 
usually find their popularity is not transferable and even when he 
topped the gop ticket bush showed no coattails in winning the 
white house in 1988 
so the circumstances fit a startearly strategy concentrated on 
fundraising a strong suit for any president 
the president is raising a lot of money for their 
candidates said ronald h brown the democratic national 
chairman but beyond the help that provides it doesnt really 
affect the politics of a state or a district 
the chairman of the democratic governors association gov 
richard f celeste of ohio said the bush campaign wont deliver 
votes it is a cash cow which the republicans are milking every 
effectively he said last month it is not a raging bull aimed 
at democratic candidates 
maybe not but the democrats do complain with some frequency 
that some of their candidates are at a disadvantage because they 
are being outspent

for a century cranberry growers have 
planted and harvested in the wetlands exempt from state 
environmental rules now however they are seeing red over 
proposals to change all that 
the state department of natural resources claims the exemption 
led growers to destroy thousands of acres of wetlands and rare 
wildlife habitat the growers counter that environmentalists have 
misled the public about the quality of bogs converted from 
wetlands 
i had a flock of a couple hundred geese that fed every day on 
a cranberry marsh ryan walker said peering over his fields as 
cranberries were harvested i cant think of one cranberry marsh 
in wisconsin that i would be ashamed to take anyone to 
cranberries grow on low trailing woody perennial vines in 
beds usually 2 to 5 acres which are surrounded by dikes to 
harvest the crop each fall beds are flooded the bright red 
berries are gently knocked off the vines and the fruit floats to 
the surface 
wisconsin produces 36 percent of the nations cranberries 
second only to massachusetts in 1989 wisconsin produced 130 
million pounds of cranberries valued at 623 million 
at least in part because consumers are eating more fruits and 
vegetables the cranberry business grew in the 1980s when most 
other farmers faced financial crises and drought 
but environmentalists claim the bogs also have taken their toll 
wetlands teeming with plant life are being destroyed and natural 
habitat for wildlife sponges that prevent flooding and filters 
that clean water are disappearing 
destruction of wetlands by cranberry growers has increased 
flooding in some areas decreased waterfowl production and 
deteriorated the quality of water flowing into some lakes 
environmentalists claim 
i think there is a general consensus among the scientific 
community the environmental community that we have lost as many 
wetlands as we can afford said duane schuettpelz a spokesman 
for the dnrs bureau of water resources management 
a legislative proposal would modify or eliminate the 1867 law 
exempted cranberry growers from state regulations a proposal by 
the dnr would impose new rules to restrict growers activities in 
wetlands even if the law is not changed 
the massachusetts cranberry industry lives with regulations that 
forbid the loss of any more wetlands said dave farrimond general 
manager of the federal cranberry marketing committee an agency of 
the us department of agriculture 
in fact he said the industry there expects to put 1200 acres 
into production over the next three years the bulk of it in 
uplands 
schuettpelz said new regulations are needed in wisconsin because 
the us army corps of engineers which approves applications for 
expansion of cranberry operations under the clean water act has 
been too lax in enforcing wetland protection standards 
wisconsin has 150 growers with about 10000 acres of mostly 
wetlands involved in direct production of cranberries said tom 
lochner executive director of the growers association an 
additional 100000 acres out of 53 million acres of wetlands 
left in the state is used for small dams reservoirs channels 
and flowages needed for water for cranberry bogs 
but its the growth of the industry 2800 acres of new 
cranberry beds in mostly wetlands over the last 10 years that 
sparked the dispute 
when cranberry bogs are created from wetlands the ground is 
scalped vines are fertilized and chemically treated for bugs and 
wildlife and plants disappear schuettpelz said under current law 
the state has no say in any expansion 
state rep spencer black chairman of the assembly natural 
resources committee has formed a committee of environmentalists 
lawmakers and growers to reach a compromise 
black believes the growers have abused their special 
privileges 
im not out to hurt the industry and stop all expansion but i 
think reasonable control will make sure growth of the industry 
takes places in a positive manner he said 
but growers say theyll go to court if necessary to maintain 
the exemption 
i think people are being misled on the destruction of 
wetlands said bob duckart president of the wisconsin state 
cranberry growers association and a grower with 100 acres of bogs 
our feeling is that we are not destroying it we are 
preserving it we feel we are doing a lot of the things the dnr is 
doing when they create a wildlife preserve he said 
walker said proposed dnr regulations that would force growers to 
expand by building bogs in uplands away from water would cost too 
much 
he also believes growers are not being credited for 
environmental improvements made in bogs wildlife flourishes in 
some bogs and growers store water with dams reservoirs and 
flowages fulfilling functions of a natural wetland he said

leukemia meant almost certain death when e 
donnall thomas was in medical school more than 40 years ago 
the fascination he developed then sustained him through a 
fourdecade attack on the deadly disease and he overcame 
skepticism and sometimes shaky financing to develop an effective 
treatment 
thomas lifetime of work resulted in bonemarrow transplantation 
a cure for thousands of patients worldwide and earned him this 
years nobel prize in medicine along with joseph e murray 
forty years is a long period of time considering we thought 
this could be done in the middle 1950s its been slow thomas 
said reflecting on his work at the fred hutchinson cancer research 
center in seattle after being named a nobel winner oct 8 
thomas didnt expect to work solid months at a time and be 
constantly on call when he chose to go into clinical research he 
laughed when he recalled how he decided not to be a 
generalpractice physician after watching his father the lone 
doctor in prairie hill texas on call 24 hours a day seven days a 
week 
then my son looked at all the problems i had getting money for 
research and now hes doing what my father did thomas said 
thomas 70 became intrigued by leukemia and bone marrow 
transplantation while at harvard medical school in the mid1940s 
in leukemia abnormal white blood cells prevent bone marrow from 
producing healthy red blood cells 
scientists knew bone marrow produced blood and was vital to the 
immune system but did not know what controlled it or sometimes 
made it fail 
in the early 1950s while at hospitals and research centers in 
boston thomas was one of several scientists searching for the 
factor that could stimulate the regeneration of bone marrow cells 
it was discovered that transplanted marrow could replace damaged 
marrow in mice thomas extended the work to dogs and in 1956 he 
performed the first human transplant at cooperstown ny 
the transplant took but the patients leukemia later recurred 
that pattern was repeated often through the 1960s transplants 
were performed mainly on twins whose antigens or cell 
identifiers matched perfectly 
it was in 1965 at the university of washington that thomas made 
a breakthrough that helped prove transplants could be widely 
applied he transplanted bone marrow in canine siblings that were 
not identical but had matching antigens the dogs survived 
in 1968 thomas assembled in seattle a team of 
scientistphysicians from around the country by the early 1970s he 
and his researchers were performing dozens of human transplants 
team member alex fefer recalled their first paper which 
reported results from 100 transplant operations only 12 patients 
survived 
there were a lot of people on the outside who said this is 
terrible you shouldnt do it i wouldnt give it to my dog and 
so on he said 
many people felt that was a bad result thomas said but we 
took just the opposite view that if we could cure some of those 
patients with refractory instage leukemia we ought to do much 
better if we took the patients in an earlier stage of the 
disease 
the team persevered thomas and his wife dottie continued to 
take on what fefer described as an enormous work load mrs thomas 
has worked with her husband as lab assistant administrator and 
grant expert 
i have met many workaholics in my day but when i came here he 
and dottie worked literally every single day fefer said 
joleen kellehere director of nursing at the hutchinson center 
said she struggled along with him and when there were things to 
be done she did them she continues to this day to do it its an 
incredible relationship 
today thousands of patients with leukemia and types of anemia 
have been treated by transplantation and many have fully 
recovered survival rates for some forms of leukemia are as high as 
90 percent thomas said 
the 60bed hutchinson centerperformed about 430 transplants in 
the last year groundbreaking is scheduled soon for a new site 
that will add 40 beds thomas original handful of researchers has 
grown to a team of more than 50 
it was the combined research talents of the team that made 
bonemarrow transplants possible thomas said 
thomas said government grants are getting harder to obtain and 
the center has been forced to develop private financing sources 
but he and his wife have no plans to quit 
the work is so fascinating that we dont want to leave it 
he said there are so many new developments that offer solutions 
to some of the problems we have were looking at applying this 
kind of technology to other kinds of cancer and genetic diseases 
its an exciting time

in the early days of kidney transplants the murray 
children werent allowed to gab on the telephone for more than a 
few minutes at a time 
keeping the lines open for possible organ donors was frustrating 
for the houseful of teenagers but they knew it had to be 
important 
it was their father joseph murray won this years nobel prize 
for medicine along with e donnall thomas of seattle 
the award announced oct 8 recognizes murrays pioneering work 
in kidney transplants the 71yearold surgeon performed the 
worlds first successful organ transplant a kidney from one 
identical twin to another at the peter bent brigham hospital on 
dec 23 1954 
the household telephone regulations explained his eldest 
daughter illustrated murrays lifelong commitment to two groups 
his family and his patients 
our father was good about letting us know what he was doing 
and the courage of the patients said virginia murray boyle who 
now lives down the street from her parents in wellesley he tried 
to make us appreciate the simple things in life 
in fact as murray performed that first successful operation on 
ronald and richard herrick his family was gathered in prayer at 
home 
my mother called us in to say a prayer for the courageous and 
new type of operation boyle said many people didnt think he 
should be doing it but my mother said he was doing his best 
at age 5 his second child meg murray dupont hardly understood 
the significance 
all i knew was my father wasnt around much that christmas 
she said from her home in california we knew he was trying to 
make kidneys work but we had no idea it would lead to livers and 
hearts and lungs 
at times murray said it was more difficult convincing doctors 
of the promise of organ transplants than the public they thought 
i was just pursuing pie in the sky he said 
today however the significance is recognized 
it was more than just a technical feat said w hardy 
hendren chief of surgery at childrens hospital what dr murray 
did was truly a shot heard round the world once again from 
massachusetts 
his colleagues describe murray as a determined softspoken 
eternal optimist 
nicholas tilney director of transplant services at the brigham 
and womens hospital who was a resident when it was called the 
peter bent hospital described murray as a teacher and mentor 
i learned mostly by his example oneonone tilney said i 
recall one time a patient of his died in the middle of the night 
and he took the trouble to come and talk to the family normally 
residents would do that kind of thing 
when one of murrays kidney patients gave birth to her first 
baby murray was in the delivery room 
some patients have kept in touch with murray for decades 
born in milford in 1919 murray attended holy cross college in 
worcester and harvard medical school he was an intern at the peter 
bent hospital before serving in the army 
his early work treating soldiers became a common thread 
throughout his medical career 
soldiers often died because they had no skin of their own to 
be grafted to the burned areas murray said in a medical journal 
in 1985 and therein lay the challenge if only we could 
transplant skin from other persons to the burn victims these 
soldiers might live 
skin grafting was impossible at the time because scientists 
hadnt discovered a way to counteract the bodys inclination to 
reject someone elses skin but murray sensed that kidneys would be 
easier to transplant because they have larger blood vessels to 
connect 
from his early successes murray went on to perform the first 
kidney transplant from a brain dead person and founded the 
international kidney transplant registry 
after 20 years in the transplant field murray returned to his 
first love plastic surgery he made a name for himself as a 
leading physician in reconstructing facial deformities 
particularly in children in 1983 the nova television series 
featured murray in its documentary called a normal face 
although a perfectionist devoted to medicine friends and family 
said murray has always found time for them and a variety of 
interests 
every year he took july off to spend with his wife virginia

thomas austin got an award 130 years 
ago when he started raising rabbits for hunting in australia today 
he might get a swift kick 
richard downward a senior adviser at south australia states 
animal and plant control commission calls rabbits the most 
serious environmental pest we have today in temperate australia 
an area that encompasses the southern twothirds of the country 
officials conservatively estimate rabbits cost the wool and 
cattle industries 79 million annually not counting environmental 
damage 
the cost is not just in lost agricultural production said 
ivan nolan who has spent 25 years at the keith turnbull research 
institute in victoria state working to develop weapons against 
rabbits 
rabbits cause or contribute to oil erosion increasing 
salinity loss of top soil poor water quality silting of streams 
and dams and the destruction of trees as well as wildlife 
john burley another animal and plant control commission 
adviser said they are a very efficient grazing animal and can 
destroy the quality of a pasture quickly 
many scientists believe it will be impossible to eradicate 
rabbits but researchers like nolan fervently hope thats not the 
case 
he estimates his state alone has 25 million rabbits and 28 
million sheep since eight rabbits eat as much as one sheep nolan 
figures the sheep population could be boosted by 2 million to 3 
million if rabbits were wiped out 
the first rabbits arrived in australia in 1788 from europe but 
it wasnt until 1859 when austin introduced them to the savannah 
woodland of victoria state for game that they found ideal 
surroundings and started to multiply in earnest 
at first trappers found the fur business lucrative 
then farmers began complaining about ravaged pastures they 
built great walls of chicken wire poisoned rabbits and fumigated 
their burrows 
in the peak postworld war ii years hunters and trappers caught 
100 million rabbits a year and produced up to 154 million pounds 
of rabbit skins for export annually 
the problem was that even if 80 percent of the rabbits were 
killed in one area the survivors could multiply fast enough to 
recover their numbers in a year in theory one pair could produce 
2000 descendants in 12 months 
the first breakthrough came when myxomatosis was successfully 
introduced in 1950 initially killing 999 percent of the rabbits 
infected with the mosquitospread virus within three years the 
increase in annual wool production was estimated at 66 million 
pounds 
but rabbits began developing greater resistance to the disease 
which also was mutating into lessdeadly strains and the 1960s 
brought a new plague of bunnies 
scientists then introduced the european flea which was more 
efficient than mosquitoes in transmitting the most virulent forms 
of myxomatosis 
but the fleas were not effective in the arid outback and the 
rabbits continued developing stronger resistance as many as 75 
percent living in moist areas now survive the disease 
still the animal and plant control commission recently received 
approval to bring in the spanish flea which will be able to spread 
myxomatosis to rabbits in the outback where resistance to the 
disease remains low 
scientists hope to begin releasing them by early 1992 
research also is continuing into viral hemorrhagic 
tracheopneumonia known as vhd an epidemic of which decimated 
europes domestic rabbit population last year we dont know its 
origin or how specific to the rabbit it is said greg mutze 
research officer at the animal and plant control commission 
in the meantime farmers are once again digging up rabbit 
warrens sometimes planting explosives using poison gases and 
leaving out carrots laced with poison

regular exercise is more than a state of 
activity its a state of mind people who can stick with exercise 
apparently can focus how they feel and what they want says one 
expert 
people who come in for the first time need to be informed 
about the kind of experiences they are going through said lise 
gauvin an assistant professor in exercise science at concordia 
university in montreal her study of motivation was published in 
the canadian journal of sport sciences 
gauvin and her colleagues studied 78 people at a ymca some 
exercised alone and others in a class still others were taking 
language or art classes the report classed them as autonomous 
exercisers fitness program enrollees dropouts and nonexercisers 
researchers conducted interviews to draw out motivations and 
perceptions the report concedes this does not generate 
standardized answers 
autonomous exercisers and fitness program enrollees highly 
valued fitness and looks but the dropouts and sedentary 
individuals didnt seem to have wellfocused goals some reported 
liking fun and competition but the report said answers were so 
diverse that other categorizations were virtually impossible 
autonomous exercisers also tended not to be concerned with 
motivating themselves to exercise they already had made it a 
habit the researchers found similar force of habit among the 
fitness class enrollees 
dropouts however had planned extensively before they 
exercised and made sure their other jobs had been done beforehand 
regular exercisers generally liked the activity itself the 
researchers said but dropouts and nonexercisers tended not to 
dropouts tended to value the social interaction or competition 
while nonexercisers liked fresh air and sunshine 
the report also says regular exercisers perceived their level of 
intensity at 75 percent to 80 percent a good workout recent 
fitness enrollees gave estimates of 85 percent to 90 percent 
dropouts claimed 95 percent to 100 percent 
and the reaction to exercise was different 
the selfmotivated autonomous exercisers reported feeling 
energized afterward some of the fitness program enrollees reported 
being tired and the dropouts tended to feel glad it was over 
this might be a sign that those new to exercise or those who 
never developed a taste for it have not had a proper introduction 
to the stress of exercise and are confusing exertion with pain 
gauvin said instruction in how to gear themselves mentally might 
help them become regular exercisers she said 
that approach also is favored by another researcher rod k 
dishman an associate professor in the physical education 
department at the university of georgia in athens 
removing the barriers is as or more effective than increasing 
the motivation he said and he said barriers such as 
scheduling and family obligations are best addressed 
individually

here are some tips to help make sure the fish you buy is safe 
and fresh 
buy from a reputable popular dealer to be assured of good 
turnover of stock 
buy fish that is wellchilled on ice at about 33 degrees 
the eyes of whole fish should be bulging and bright and shiny 
not watery 
skin should be moist scales shiny gills should be red or 
pink 
the flesh should be firm to the touch filets should be firm 
and glistening 
fish that smells fishy probably has gone bad fresh fish 
smells mild 
eat the fish within 24 hours do not freeze fish unless you 
are absolutely certain it has not been previously frozen 
shellfish should be alive and lively 
in her new book fish the basics shirley king suggests 
shoppers go to the market willing to buy whatever fish is freshest 
the depressing fact is that most of our fish reach us after many 
days out of water but if fish are properly handled they can still 
be excellent she writes

a new drug can ease the headaches nausea and 
temporary infertility that afflict about 40 percent of the 1 
million americans with ulcerative colitis doctors say 
those side effects are the result of the sulfa drug 
sulfasalazine the standard treatment for ulcerative colitis the 
new drug olsalazine is equally effective against colitis but is 
not a sulfa drug 
that means it doesnt have the side effects of sulfasalazine 
said dr stephan targan of the university of california los 
angeles he is scientific adviser to the national foundation for 
ileitis and colitis 
ulcerative colitis a severe inflammation of the colon is 
characterized by diarrhea rectal bleeding weight loss and pain 
it can occur at any age but often strikes people in their 20s 
the new treatment also has side effects but they are milder 
than the side effects of sulfasalazine doctors say olsalazines 
side effects include abdominal pain and diarrhea in a small number 
of patients researchers say 
olsalazine wa recently approved for commercial use by the us 
food and drug administration

purdue university scientists are 
trying to create an enclosed system that relies on four crops to 
provide oxygen water and food 
they are working under a 5 million grant from the national 
aeronautics and space administration which hopes to have small 
selfsupporting colonies of astronauts living on the moon by 2010 
and on mars by 2020 
cary mitchell a plant physiology professor and director of the 
research said the work initially will focus on three plants that 
will comprise a complete diet for the astronauts cowpeas a 
relative of blackeyed peas brassica a mustardlike plant and 
two strains of rice 
the hydroponic crops also would give the astronauts oxygen 
mitchell said 
the astronauts shouldnt expect gourmet cuisine he said 
the species that were chosen are just the bare minimum that 
will give a balance of protein and carbohydrates and fat that 
doesnt mean the diet will be interesting he said 
a fourth crop bluegreen algae will help produce oxygen and 
consume carbon dioxide 
unlike the bubble colonies of science fiction astronauts and 
plants on the moon would live underground to protect them from the 
sun its damaging rays would be unshielded because the moon has no 
atmosphere 
on mars its a different story it would be interesting to use 
some natural sunlight there mitchell said

unlike programs for meat and poultry there is no mandatory 
inspection of the fish eaten in this country so as americans eat 
more fish they should be aware of how to buy and prepare it 
safely 
the us senate last month passed legislation that would charge 
the agriculture department with inspecting fish action was pending 
in the house 
the legislation called the fish safety act is based on a 
program in which the usda already tests meat products for 200 
harmful chemicals and other substances 
the food and drug administration and the commerce department 
conduct voluntary fish inspections but less than 12 percent of 
us seafood is inspected sen patrick leahy dvt says 
inspection is random its not enforced said jodie 
silverman of the washingtonbased public interest group public 
voice for food and health policy in his book diet for a 
poisoned planet david steinman says he found more than 2000 
advisory warnings against eating certain fish have been issued over 
the years by coastal and great lakes states 
in addition to naturally occurring bacteria or parasites water 
can be polluted by industrial and sewage discharge or by blooms of 
poisonous algae known as red or brown tide 
consumers should check for environmental warnings before going 
fishing eat a variety of fish species and avoid the viscera skin 
and fatty sections of a fish 
if you and others like you buy seafood from retailers who post 
the origin of their seafood other retailers will follow suit 
steinman says remember the way you spend your food dollars has 
an effect on retailers and ultimately on the environment 
americans are eating more fish each year because of health 
concerns and increased availability but still lag behind many 
countries says roddy moscoso a spokesman for the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administrationfisheries 
last year americans ate an average of 408 pounds of whole 
fish or 159 pounds of edible fish compared with 79 pounds of 
edible fish in 1943 but the average over the last four years was 
1528 pounds of whole fish in japan 463 pounds in denmark and 
569 pounds in france 
by comparison americans are expected to eat 64 pounds of beef 
apiece in 1990 down from 77 to 78 pounds in the early 1980s 
according to the national cattlemens association 
fish generally are low in calories and are a good source of 
protein they contain a range of vitamins and minerals and their 
omega 3 fatty acids have been linked to a lowered risk of heart 
disease 
on the low end of fat content is atlantic cod which has 82 
calories in a 35ounce portion about six of them from fat 
according to the book eat fish live longer by anne m 
fletcher 
at the other end is pacific herring 195 calories in 35 ounces 
125 of them from fat and black or red caviar with 252 calories in 
35 ounces 161 of them from fat fletcher says 
the tastes of different kinds of fish vary as much chef shirley 
king says in her new book fish the basics the book provides 
drawings nutritional information common and scientific names 
cleaning and cooking instructions and recipes for dozens of kinds 
of fish 
fish taste best when simply prepared broiled grilled 
roasted or baked in the oven poached or steamed king writes 
cooking fish to an internal temperature of 140 degrees will 
destroy parasites she says 
when you eat any type of meat poultry fish or shellfish 
thats not thoroughly cooked theres always the possibility of 
contracting certain types of food poisoning fletcher writes 
adding that the exact risks remain uncertain 
steinman says by far the greatest immediate toxic risk in 
eating seafood lies in raw shellfish 
the fda has determined that the risk from raw oysters clams and 
mussels from water considered clean is too small to warrant a 
warning however it recommends susceptible people such as those 
with cancer liver disease or chronic gastrointestinal illnesses 
avoid them 
steinman warns that some toxic chemicals that are fatsoluble 
will leach out of fish during cooking those liquids should be 
discarded he says

kuwait has a bustling economy a loyal 
population a functioning government but no territory 
the emirates governmentinexile is using kuwaits huge global 
financial resources to keep its national identity alive despite the 
aug 2 takeover by iraq 
but how long can kuwait with its dispersed population and 
scattered assets continue to function financially as a sovereign 
nation 
indefinitely according to some middle east analysts 
the oil revenues that made kuwait so rich have dried up with the 
oilfields in iraqi hands and there is a worldwide embargo on the 
oil itself 
but long before the invasion the kuwaitis had plowed their oil 
earnings into a variety of investments which are now serving them 
well 
theyre earning money on their money said katya maddison 
an economic analyst with the londonbased middle east economic 
digest theyre pretty stable for a considerable amount of 
time 
after the invasion an asset freeze was clamped on kuwaiti 
holdings by world governments to protect the assets from iraqi 
seizure 
but within three weeks after the invasion kuwaits finance 
minister sheik ali said said the governmentinexile had plenty 
of cash and was in full management control of its assets 
the kuwaitis have virtually an economy offshore now said 
stephanie cooke a financial specialist in the london office of 
institutional investor magazine 
but in another sense their hands are tied because theyre 
having to cope with this assets freeze although they appreciate 
it its making the daytoday operations very difficult 
every time they have to move assets around they need the 
permission of several governments in terms of where the financial 
instrument is she said 
iraq has looted and ravaged kuwait itself since the invasion 
but many of kuwaits most valuable properties are beyond iraqi 
reach 
kuwait airways which lost most of its planes to iraq planned 
to restart its operations thursday from cairo the kuwait petroleum 
cos q8 service stations are still pumping gas in western europe 
the kuwait investment office in london is gradually regaining 
control of its monumental portfolio estimated to total 100 
billion and the kuwaiti government has pledged to stand behind the 
obligations of kuwaiti banks 
the very fact that theyre able to operate kuwait air and 
kuwait petroleum co continues the countrys identity said 
maddison the very fact that the name kuwait is still there im 
sure is a major irritant to the iraqis 
unlike other conquered nations for example the european 
countries overrun by adolf hitler in the 1930s and 1940s kuwait 
has reconstituted itself outside its own borders with its 
governmental hierarchy and its assets largely intact 
the investment income from kuwaiti assets abroad is generally 
estimated to exceed the oil revenue from what its leaders say are 
the worlds fifthlargest oil reserves 
kuwaits rulers without a realm the alsabah family run their 
governmentinexile from the saudi resort town of taif and its 
international business empire operates mainly out of london 
policymaking is concentrated in the hands of the emir sheik 
jaber alahmed alsabah and a few advisers a bureaucracy under 
the prime minister and crown prince sheik saad handles daytoday 
decisionmaking 
both kuwait petroleum and the kuwait investment office are 
controlled by the nations top leadership 
kuwait petroleum which operates its own refineries in 
rotterdam skaelskoer denmark and naples has offset the loss of 
its own crude oil supplies with saudi oil and purchases on the open 
market according to the authoritative middle east economic survey 
in nicosia 
for a nation of only 640000 citizens with a territory smaller 
than new jersey preinvasion kuwait had enormous economic clout 
the kuwaiti investment portfolio originally put together as a 
hedge against the time when the oil ran out has given 
postinvasion kuwait a financial infrastructure that can be 
effectively operated from exile said rosemary hollis a financial 
analyst with the royal united services institute for defense 
studies in london 
but she noted many kuwaiti banks are still unable to operate 
because of the destruction of records in the occupied emirate

farmers who live in this nearly deserted 
prairie town depressed by years of drought and low wheat prices 
are starting to dream again thanks to a conflict halfway around the 
world 
the sound of their tractors is accompanied by a new sound oil 
rigs suddenly more profitable because iraqs invasion of kuwait 
more than two months ago has nearly doubled crude prices 
balcron oil of billings mont has found oil in two wells and 
is drilling a third they call it the lucky mound field the first 
in mclean county 
its very likely going to be a year or more possibly two 
years before outer limits of the field are defined said bob 
graveline associate director of the north dakota petroleum 
council 
the first oil well was found in early august on land belonging 
to ed wahner and his wife bette both 64yearold retired farmers 
from parshall company officials say its giving out about 120 
barrels a day so far 
it all happened so fast said ed wahner who leased his land 
to balcron about two years ago we farmed it for many years and 
we had no inkling whatsoever 
owners of the minerals get royalty payments or about oneeighth 
of the production graveline said the wahners dont know how much 
their first check will be nor have they made grand plans except 
for a reclining chair they bought for the rev thomas sullivan at 
st bridges catholic church in parshall 
thats what the priest had mentioned when bette wahner asked him 
jokingly about a year ago what he wanted if she ever got an oil 
well 
now sullivan has offered to help others in the community 
strike oil except he wants a cadillac as payment this time 
i havent got any takers on that he said 
north dakota the countrys ninth largest oil producer has 
given out 1 billion barrels since oil was discovered in the state 
in 1951 state wells currently average 100000 barrels a day 
the mclean county wells are part of the williston basin a 
geological formation that covers roughly twothirds of north 
dakota the balcron drilling is within the fort berthold indian 
reservation on land owned by indians and nonindians alike the 
indians own mineral rights to one of the wells said rich schilf 
natural resources department administrator for the three affiliated 
tribes on the reservation 
hope about the new wells comes as the persian gulf crisis 
continues to push oil prices into the 40abarrel range compared 
with 20 a barrel in midsummer if that trend persists exploration 
will become more profitable in the state although balcron 
officials said their mclean county operation was planned long 
before the price jump 
graveline said the williston basin will continue to be probed 
because it is one of the least explored parts in the continental 
united states 
thats good news to the countys economy annie hendrickson 
remembers the time when she and her husband ran a bar in raub the 
town died when the railroad passed it by and the farm economy 
slipped 
folks come by these days to sit at her kitchen counter have a 
cup of coffee and talk about oil jim odeman 26 who lives about a 
mile away was welcoming an oil exploration crew late last week 
theres some hope he said farming hasnt been too 
good 
balcron officials held meeting with area residents to explain 
the oil development process filling the raub town hall for the 
first time in years 
its nice to have some faces behind an oil company name 
schilf said 
hope has also sprung in the form of jobs hendricksons son neal 
found one to supplement his farm income when he heard about the 
drilling 
he didnt know what an oil pumper was or even what the job would 
pay now he goes out every day to check the wahner well and make 
certain it is pumping smoothly 
its something else to think about instead of trying to think 
about farm prices he said

once the epitome of the 1980s oil boom 
this west texas oil town is now plagued with closed businesses 
forsale signs and evershortening store hours 
as thousands of oil industry officials gathered here wednesday 
for the 1990 permian basin oil show crude prices were at a decade 
high 
still no one was talking about a return to the good old days 
industry officials here for the nations largest inland oil show 
appeared to be doing more window shopping than buying 
this quick rise in prices will not be the answer steve 
todt general manager of midlandbased cactus drilling co said of 
crudes current price this industry was decimated during the 
mid1980s it will take yearstto get it back on its feet again 
the price of a 42gallon barrel of sweet crude oil known here 
as west texas intermediate closed down 217 at 3672 in 
wednesdays trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
prospective buyers shuffled from booth to booth inspecting 
skyscraperlike rigs and pumpjacks 
but wallets stayed tucked away 
they are not quite in the spending mood said rad cagle an 
oil show director sporting a stetson hat and snakeskin boots 
i think people are upbeat and as soon as those oil prices 
stabilize at around 20 to 25 a barrel the folks will get real 
excited but until then they are not going to get crazy with the 
checkbook 
nobody is making plans for next year based on 40abarrel 
oil said gary johnson a phillips petroleum co representative 
at the oil show we would like to think prices will stabilize 
around 25 a barrel soon but if a war breaks out in the mideast 
the prices we are seeing now would seem cheap 
towns like odessa and nearby midland are hoping for a comeback 
albeit a gradual one 
pointing to a graph indicating the number of rigs drilling in 
the permian basin over the past 50 years todt points to a line 
drawn nearly off the chart in 1981 
there were 663 rigs pumping in the permian basin that year 
he said today we have 150 working nobody feels like we could 
get back to that level again and i dont think anyone wants to go 
back to that it was excessive 
the end of an eightyear war between iraq and iran in the 
mid1980s uncovered a huge surplus of oil in the middle east 
prices dropped and the bottom fell out 
locals watched the demise of nearly every oilrelated business 
that had lined up for miles on highway 80 connecting midland and 
odessa 
its tough to see odessa like this billy burcham said 
this town is oil and when times were good you would have 
thought this was downtown new york but when the market dropped 
people couldnt get out of here fast enough

the chairman and chief executive at dow jones amp 
co announced his retirement but company officials say the move is 
not connected to the wall street journal parents recent financial 
troubles 
warren h phillips 64 has been chief executive of the media 
and financial information company since 1975 and chairman since 
1978 he will relinquish his chief executive duties at the first of 
the year and retire as chairman next july 1 phillips will stay on 
as a director 
he will be 65 by the time of his retirement as chairman 
phillips decision was based on the customary retirement age of 
65 said dow jones spokesman roger may 
eric philo a media analyst at goldman sachs amp co said 
phillips announcement was not a great surprise he agreed it 
probably was not connected with the companys financial problems 
he has been operating in a very difficult environment in the 
past several years philo said citing the cutbacks on wall 
street and the softness in the advertising market you cant lay 
it at his doorstep he said 
journal newsroom speculation differed 
this could be phillips saying these problems are going to be 
tough to solve and take a long time a reporter who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said 
peter r kann the companys president and chief operating 
officer will succeed phillips as chief executive kann 47 also 
is publisher of the journal 
no date has been set for the board to elect a successor to 
phillips as chairman said dana jennings another company 
spokesman 
these actions will provide an orderly transition of executive 
responsibility phillips said in a statement after an

directors of the chicago board of trade have 
approved a plan to double the number of grain and soybean futures 
contracts that speculators can control at any one time 
the directors acted under pressure from large commodity fund 
managers critics said the move could make prices more volatile as 
huge commodity fund trades stir up the market 
commissions paid to many exchange members both brokers and 
brokerage firms likely would increase if the plan is adopted by 
the exchange membership and approved by the commodity futures 
trading commission 
approval is expected and expanded limits could be in place 
within a few months the wall street journal reported in todays 
editions 
focusing on more business overlooks the fact that these funds 
already exacerbate price movements benjamin raskin a futures 
trader and honorary cbot member told the newspaper 
acting en masse with holdings twice as large as previously 
allowed could make price fluctuations even more dramatic than they 
currently are raskin said 
earlier this year the national grain and feed association said 
they thought such a move could cause market distortions that 
would undermine price discovery 
the board approved doubling the total number of contracts 
speculators can control to 4800 for corn and soybeans and 3600 
for wheat but it voted to limit holdings in any one contract 
month excluding the front month which retains its current limit 
to no more than onethird of the total position allowed

soaring energy prices after iraqs invasion of 
kuwait pushed americans cost of living up 08 percent in 
september the second consecutive monthly dose of bad inflation 
the government said today 
the september rise matched the august increase in the labor 
departments consumer price index if prices continued increasing 
at the twomonth pace for a year it would produce an annual 
inflation rate of 95 percent 
the pickup in inflation this year translated into the biggest 
boost in social security benefits in 8 years based on todays 
report the government announced a 54 percent raise in benefits 
beginning in january for the 40 million social security recipients 
in addition to boosting inflation the aug 2 iraqi invasion 
hurt the nations merchandise trade deficit which jumped 24 
percent in august rising oil prices pushed imports to a record 
high the gap between imports and exports climbed to 93 billion 
the largest since january 
the stock market shrugged off the news with the dow jones 
average of industrial stocks rising 1337 to 240124 in the first 
half hour of trading analysts said traders were doing some 
cautious buying on the belief that worries about the economy had 
gone to unjustified extremes 
in a separate report the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation increased 
04 percent in september before adjusting for inflation they 
totaled to 35392 
in the inflation report energy prices in september jumped 56 
percent the worst rise on record since the department began 
tracking the sector in 1957 
gasoline soared 95 percent the worst increase in 17 months 
and fuel oil rose 159 percent for august and september together 
gasoline rose 179 percent and fuel oil was up 337 percent 
electricity and natural gas charges also rose but less steeply 
for the first nine months of the year consumer prices advanced 
at an annual rate of 66 percent well above the 46 percent 
increase for all of 1989 
analysts expect the bad news to continue through november or 
december even if oil prices stabilize near 40 a barrel double 
the july price they anticipate a 1990 consumer price rise near 7 
percent the highest in nearly a decade prices increased 89 
percent in 1981 
the oil shock will begin feeding through to chemicals airline 
tickets and other energyrelated products and services 
the big bite out of consumers wallets is expected to slow an 
already sluggish economy 
were going into a recession very clearly said economist 
david wyss of drimcgraw hill 
prices excluding energy rose a more moderate 04 percent in 
september the same as the previous month but the labor department 
noted several sectors of aboveaverage inflation 
while prices in most components of the index accelerated the 
runup for petroleumbased energy prices has had the largest 
effect it said in its release 
medical care was up 07 percent bringing prices 93 percent 
higher than a year earlier 
clothing costs were also up 07 percent in september mens and 
boys clothing prices fell but womens girls and infants 
clothing costs rose as did the price of shoes 
on a positive note for consumers food and beverage prices rose 
a moderate 03 percent last month the same as august new car 
prices edged up only 01 percent after remaining unchanged in 
august car dealers beset with lagging sales have been unable to 
wean the public from rebate programs and discounted financing 
housing costs were up 04 percent held back by a decline in 
hotel and motel costs which had been rising steeply earlier in the 
year 
the various changes put the index for all consumer items at 
1327 in september that means a hypothetical selection of goods 
and services costing 100 in the 198284 base period cost 13270 
last month up 770 from a year earlier 
as bad as the shortterm inflation outlook seems analysts 
expect inflation to return to normal next year unless a shooting 
war breaks out in the persian gulf and sends oil prices up further 
its important to draw a distinction between a onetime rise 
in price level and whether or not that works itself permanently 
into a higher rate of inflation said michael boskin president 
bushs chief economic adviser 
thus far it appears that the most likely outcome will be 
similar to its mirror image the collapse of energy prices in 1986 
when consumer prices fell but then the following year 
inflation went back more or less to its longrun historical 
level boskin told an american stock exchange conference earlier 
this week

colatepalmolive co a leading maker of 
consumer products reported strong gains in thirdquarter sales and 
earnings thursday attributing the improvement to new markets and 
the impact of a weak dollar 
the companys earnings report contrasted sharply with the

16 percent increase 
colgate said its household and personalcare operations did 
particularly well with notable earnings advances in europe and 
latin america colgate also said its expansion into eastern europe 
notably the former east germany also helped accelerate sales 
like some other large usbased companies with significant 
business abroad colgate said it was helped by the higher value of 
foreign currencies relative to the us dollar vs a year ago that 
translates into higher sales and earnings figures when calculated 
in dollars 
for the first nine months of the year colgate said it earned 
24759 million or 353 a share up 14 percent from 21752

rh macy amp co inc which reports fiscal year 
results later this month will announce losses more than tripled 
from the previous year a source familiar with the large national 
retailer said today 
macy still paying down debt from a 1986 managementled 
debtfinanced takeover known as a leveraged buyout will report 
losses of 2153 million for the year that ended july 28 compared 
with a loss of 63 million the previous year said the source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the retailers earnings before interest taxes and depreciation 
a key figure for a company paying down leveragedbuyout debt 
totaled 721 million in fiscal 1990 down from 9261 million the 
year before the 1990 figure which was lower than projections made 
by macy last spring reflected a 30 million accounting adjustment 
the source said 
although worse than expected the numbers were not a major 
surprise macy announced earlier this year it had a disastrous 
christmas 1989 season and suffered a 39 million loss instead of 
turning a profit during its second quarter 
however the fullyear results also reflected disappointing 
sales during the fourth quarter macys august sales fell 5 percent 
from a year earlier the source said 
macy reported sales of 727 billion for the year up from 697 
billion a year earlier 
the upcoming christmas season is expected to be sluggish for the 
entire retail industry and macys poor showing during the summer 
has raised concerns among investors about how the company will fare 
during the holidays 
macy said it has responded to the poor business forecast by 
reducing its costs and planning conservatively for christmas 
james fingeroth a macy spokesman noted that the retailer is 
carrying 560 million less in inventory than it had a year ago and 
is planning for a very sluggish environment going forward for the 
forseeable future 
last week macy announced it was selling its credit operations 
to ge capital corp macy said the move would reduce its 48 
billion debt load by 15 billion 
the company has also said it is buying back some of its junk 
bonds as another means of lowering its debt and a 595 million 
annual interest bill macy has sold equity stakes to help finance 
the buybacks 
besides its flagship macy stores located mainly in the east and 
texas the company owns i magnin and bullocks stores in 
california and the west it also owns specialty stores including 
charter club and aeropostale which are stocked with macys private

the house voted today to raise tariffs on 
chinese clothing toys and shoes by hundreds of millions of dollars 
to protest the military suppression of chinas prodemocracy 
movement last year 
in anticipation of a certain veto from president bush it also 
prepared a backup if contradictory measure that would condition 
continued open trade with improvement in chinas human rights 
records 
bush a former envoy to china has indicated he is prepared to 
veto both particularly if the milder version is amended later 
today to require the release of all protesters arrested after 
chinese authorities ordered the military to crush the studentled 
tiananmen square democracy movement in june 1989 
the united states suspended highlevel political contacts and 
cut off international loans to china to protest the killings of 
hundreds and possibly thousands of unarmed students and others in 
the military crackdown 
but bush decided in may to continue for another year the lower 
most favored nation tariffs that china has enjoyed since 1980 
raising them he said would only hurt the chinese people 
themselves 
the resolution disapproving bushs continuation of the lower 
tariffs was approved on a 247174 vote it now goes to the senate 
where majority leader george mitchell dmaine has introduced a 
similar measure 
under a new trade law enacted in august overturning bushs 
decision requires a majority vote of both the house and senate 
before saturday 
the resolutions author rep gerald solomon rny 
acknowledged that supporters lack the votes to override a 
presidential veto but said just passing it will sent a hell of a 
message to the peoples republic of china 
the administration estimates that the higher tariffs from 
suspending chinas mostfavored status would raise the price of its 
exports to the united states an average 40 percent 
for example a chinesemade sweater with an import price of 20 
now carries a tariff of 120 without mostfavored status its 
import price would be 32 
the united states imported about 12 billion in chinese products 
last year while sending china some 58 billion in us exports 
the bush administration and others supporting the continuation 
of mostfavorednation status say higher tariffs would hurt 
reformminded chinese seeking to keep china open to the rest of the 
world 
they argue that increased tariffs would also deal a severe blow 
to hong kong through which a large portion of chinas exports 
pass lead to chinese retaliation against american exporters and 
mean higher prices for american consumers

the new york times reported thursday 
the companies had been discussing the possibility of motorola 
using ibms technology for making 4millionbit chips the 
highestcapacity memory chips now in production 
international business machines corp entered into the talks 
earlier this year with the hope of establishing a stronger domestic 
semiconductor industry the times said ibm is the only domestic 
maker of 4millionbit chips 
the times which based its report on anonymous industry and 
government sources did not say why the talks broke off 
motorola has an agreement with toshiba corp of japan to make 
1millionbit chips and plans to use toshiba designs to produce 
4millionbit chips in the future the times reported 
ibm spokesman mike king said thursday the company never 
acknowledged such talks and so it had no comment on the times 
report a motorola spokeswoman said her company also had no 
comment 
ibm currently licenses its memory chip technology to micron 
technologies inc a chip maker in boise idaho ibm does not sell 
computer chips on the open market it uses its entire chip 
production in its own products 
a bit is the smallest piece of information used by a computer 
because of the way memory chips are designed new generations of 
chips increase in capacity fourfold

the price of michelin shares fell sharply thursday 
on the paris stock exchange as the worlds biggest tire 
manufacturer announced it expected a huge loss for 1990 
company officials told financial analysts that michelin expects 
to post a consolidated net loss of more than 231 billion francs 
or 440 million this year last year michelin had a net profit of 
2449 billion francs 
eric bourdais de charbonniere michelins finance director 
attributed the sharp erosion to the companys 15 billion takeover 
of uniroyal goodrich tire co last year weaker car and tire 
markets and the appreciation of the franc against the dollar and 
other currencies 
michelin shares were temporarily suspended from trading on the 
paris exchange after disclosure of the anticipated losses sparked a 
decline of nearly 10 percent in the share price the stock closed 
at 684 francs down from 745 francs at wednesdays close the 
dollar has been trading at about 506 francs 
michelins share price has been rising sharply over the past 
week on speculation that the company would make a favorable 
announcement at the analysts meeting 
the company said the exact amount of the 1990 loss will depend 
on the scope of yetundetermined restructuring charges it will take 
for the second half of this year 
the 1990 forecast is much worse than previous projections by 
market analysts who calculated that this years loss would reach 
between 1 billion and 15 billion francs 
company officials said michelin will remain in the red in the 
first half of 1991 but should return to the breakeven point later 
next year 
de charbonniere said it was too early to assess whether the 
tire and rubber group will break even for all of 1991 
company officials said that in order to be able to break even by 
the end of next year michelin will have to increase its cash flow 
by 25 billion francs they said the return to profitability will 
require cuts in oprrating costs that may involve steps leading to 
job cuts affecting production commercial and administrative 
employees 
carlos ghosn director of michelins north american operations 
said uniroyal goodrich is expected to report cash flow of about 55 
million but the unit will not make any positive or negative 
contribution to michelins consolidated 1990 earnings 
he said michelin intends to proceed with sales of certain of 
uniroyal goodrichs textile assets but didnt elaborate

primerica corp parent of the smith barney harris upham amp co 
brokerage reported earnings of 94 million or 82 cents a share 
up from 783 million or 80 cents a share a year earlier revenue 
totaled 15 billion up 2 percent from 147 billion 
primerica chairman sanford i weill said the companys consumer 
finance and insurance unit is expected to continue delivering 
sizable and growing earnings contributions which cushion the 
impact of the cyclical results in smith barneys 
businesses 
the companys insurance services operations which include al 
williams saw earnings rise 20 percent to 648 million on revenues 
of 5451 million 
but earnings slumped 43 percent to 155 million on 4132 
million in revenue in the investment services unit which includes 
smith barney primerica cited a decline in commissions amid weak 
volume on world stock exchanges and lower investment banking 
revenues 
weill said primerica will continue evaluating all our 
businesses in the difficult environment ahead and will make 
whatever adjustments become necessary to sustain profitabilty 
for the first nine months primerica earned 2741 million or 
238 a share up 42 percent from 1931 million or 198 a share 
a year ago when fewer shares were outstanding

71939 million in the third quarter of 1989

the board that makes the nations accounting rules has taken a 
major step toward changing the way retiree health benefits are 
reported by businesses which if approved could slash billions of 
dollars from corporate earnings 
diana scott a project manager of the financial accounting 
standards board said thursday that members voted 43 wednesday to 
order the boards technical staff to prepare a draft version of the 
rule change 
scott said the board expects to vote on the draft by 
thanksgiving and if approved the rule change would be promulgated 
by the end of the year and take effect starting in 1993 
the board based in norwalk conn is a federally sanctioned 
body that sets the standards for how companies report their 
financial condition in quarterly earnings statements and other 
documents 
since february 1989 it has been considering a retireebenefit 
rule change that would more accurately state a companys longterm 
liability in its financial reporting 
under the current rule most companies account for benefits to 
retirees on what is known as a payasyougo basis but under the 
change they would not be able to wait until the costs are 
incurred instead they would have to subtract from each years 
earnings a portion of the expected costs 
most companies have accepted the logic behind the change 
although they have said it could result in drastic reductions in 
their bottom lines over the past 20 months many lobbied 
successfully to soften some provisions of the proposal such as 
gradually implementing it over a few years 
some retiree benefits analysts have estimated the cost of the 
rule change to businesses could be at least 200 billion just for 
the largest us companies others have estimated the cost as high 
as 400 billion

surging oil prices drove imports to a new 
record in august and helped propel the us merchandise trade 
deficit to its highest level in seven months the government 
reported thursday 
analysts said that excluding the oil factor the trade picture 
actually improved as exports continued to grow moderately 
nevertheless soaring energy costs were adversely affecting the 
economy and driving up inflation 
in its first report on americas trade gap since iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 and disrupted international oil markets the 
commerce department said imports rose 18 percent to 420 
billion while exports gained 16 percent to 326 billion 
the difference meant a 93 billion imbalance up 24 percent 
from july and the largest since a 102 billion gap last january 
the nonoil deficit on the other hand fell from 54 billion in 
july to 50 billion the following month 
the previous record for imports was 416 billion in march this 
year 
if you throw out energy the trade picture shows gradual 
continuing improvement said donald ratajczak economist at 
georgia state university 
nevertheless the deficit is going to be plagued at least 
through the end of the year by increasing oil imports said 
economist mark m zandi of regional financial associates in west 
chester pa 
the volume of imported oil actually declined in august down 
103 percent to 795 million barrels a day but a hefty 348 
percent price gain to 1954 a barrel pushed overall petroleum 
costs up 209 percent to 48 billion and the price of oil has 
since doubled to nearly 40 a barrel 
bruce steinberg senior economist with merrill lynch capital 
markets in new york said despite the boost in the deficit the 
trade gap still could end the year under 100 billion for the first 
time since 1983 
for the first eight months of 1990 the deficit was running at 
an annual rate of 968 billion compared to 1107 billion during 
the same period last year 
zandi said the nations trade problems could benefit from a 
weakening us economy 
what we may see is that imports of automobiles and industrial 
goods will fall and offset the oil import bill he said 
however imports of foreignmade cars rose 21 percent to 339 
billion in august 
exports on the other hand rebounded from a 61 percent decline 
in july 
the good news is that the lower dollar is still helping on the 
export side and we saw at least a modest further increase said 
economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a new york 
securities dealer the hope is that modest growth in the export 
sector will help offset the weakness we see in all the other major 
sectors of the economy 
j antonio villamil commerce department chief economist noted 
that export growth has been the major contributor to the 
increases in overall economic activity during the year and said 
we expect this trend to continue 
indeed fully onethird of overall us economic growth for the 
last three years has been supplied by export sales they had become 
even more important recently as consumer spending has slowed 
but economists believe the oilprice shock is likely to further 
weaken the economy and drive it into a recession if it isnt 
there already 
as usual the biggest deficit was with japan a 38 billion 
imbalance up from 30 billion in july 
other deficits included taiwan 12 billion china 11 
billion canada 509 million south korea 518 million hong 
kong 397 million western europe 374 million and brazil 178 
million

americans spendin power sank again in 
september as the persian gulf crisis pushed prices up a sharp 08 
percent for the second straight month the government said 
thursday still inflation not tied to oil prices remained 
relatively mild 
if the labor departments consumer price index continued 
increasing at the september pace for a year it would produce an 
annual inflation rate of 95 percent 
most economists believe price increases absent the outbreak of 
a shooting war will return to a more normal level by the end of 
the year the oil shock nevertheless has added a new burden for an 
economy that was already on the brink of recession 
you take out energy and the numbers arent that bad but on 
the other hand people have to buy the energy and it gives you an 
annual inflation rate roughly double the rate of wage growth 
said economist donald ratajczak of georgia state university 
it means that people wont have a lot of money to spend on 
christmas he said 
the core inflation rate prices excluding food and energy 
was 03 percent in september down from 05 percent in august 
for the first nine months of 1990 prices increased at an annual 
rate of 66 percent well above the 46 percent increase for all of 
last year the rate for all of 1990 if it comes in close to 7 
percent as now expected will be the worst since 1981 when prices 
shot up 89 percent 
the pickup in inflation so far this year helped bring about the 
biggest boost in social security benefits in 8 years based on 
thursdays report the government announced a 54 percent rise in 
benefits beginning in january for the 40 million social security 
recipients 
in addition to boosting consumer inflation based on oil and 
various energy products the aug 2 iraqi invasion and its 
aftermath hurt the us merchandise trade deficit it rose 24 
percent to a sevenmonth high of 93 billion in august increasing 
oil prices pushed imports to a record high more than offsetting a 
modest rise in exports 
the stock market shrugged off the news with the dow jones 
average of industrial stocks advancing analysts said traders were 
doing some cautious buying in the belief that worries about the 
economy had gone to unjustified extremes 
in a separate report the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation increased 
04 percent in september still they were down 15 percent from a 
year ago 
in the inflation report energy prices in september jumped 56 
percent the worst rise on record since the department began 
tracking the sector in 1957 
gasoline soared 95 percent the largest increase in 17 months 
and fuel oil rose 159 percent for august and september together 
gasoline rose 179 percent and fuel oil was up 337 percent 
electricity and natural gas charges also rose but less steeply 
analysts expect the bad news to continue through november or 
december even if oil prices stabilize near where they are now 
around 40 a barrel double the july price 
in the next few months the oil shock probably will begin 
feeding through to chemicals airline tickets and other 
energyrelated products and services 
but it probably will not produce a permanent increase in the 
inflation rate said economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp 
co a government securities dealer in new york 
we simply dont suffer this time around from the same kind of 
inflationary psychology as we did during earlier oil shocks in 1973 
and 1979 in the 70s consumers were buying in anticipation of 
price increases now consumers are waiting for a bargain he 
said 
jones said recent increases in consumer prices are great enough 
to cause the federal reserve to be cautious about stimulating the 
economy with lower interest rates but not so great as to prevent a 
quarterpoint cut in shortterm rates if congress and president 
bush agree on a plan to cut the federal budget deficit 
in other details the labor department said 
food and beverage prices rose a moderate 03 percent last 
month the same as august 
medical care was up 07 percent bringing prices 93 percent 
higher than a year earlier 
clothing costs also were up 07 percent in september mens and 
boys clothing prices fell but womens girls and infants 
clothing costs rose as did the price of shoes 
new car prices edged up only 01 percent after remaining 
unchanged in august car dealers beset with lagging sales have been 
unable to wean the public from rebate programs and discounted 
financing 
housing costs were up 04 percent held back by a decline in 
hotel and motel costs which had been rising steeply earlier in the 
year 
the various changes put the index for all consumer items at 
1327 in september that means a hypothetical selection of goods 
and services costing 100 in the 198284 base period cost 13270 
last month up 770 from a year earlier

john w kluge a virginia billionaire listed by forbes magazine 
as the richest man in america said thursday he favors an increase 
in the nations top income tax rate if the capital gains tax is 
reduced 
i recognize that the budget deficit must be reduced and that 
issues of tax fairness are prominent in the minds of many 
americans kluge 76 said in a telephone interview with ap 
network news a broadcasting operation of the associated press 
to address both of those concerns i personally would favor 
raising the top income tax rate to 33 percent as a part of a 
package that included a meaningful reduction in capital gains 
tax kluge said 
for some time kluge said us businesses have been hampered by 
the high cost of capital especially when compared to businesses 
in japan and many european countries 
i believe that the most effective way to bring down the cost 
of capital would be to reduce the rate at which capital gains are 
taxed he said the president and many members of the senate 
and the house of reresentatives share that view 
kluge said tax laws should be written to foster and encourage 
the american genius for creating new businesses and new jobs i 
firmly believe that the best way to further that goal would be a 
lowered tax on capital gains for small and large businesses 
kluge said most people reinvest money from capital gains 
money just doesnt stay at the sidelines he said it 
seems to me that if one is to risk capital there has to be an 
incentive if there is no incentive to risk capital why even try 
to make an investment you might as well live off interest on 
money 
kluge pronounced kloogy owns a 10000acre farm near 
charlottesville va and is worth about 56 billion forbes 
estimated in its 1990 ranking of richest americans released earlier 
this month 
he was speaking from his office at metromedia co the business 
he founded and the basis for his fortune years ago he sold the 
companys radio and television properties for 465 billion and 
netted more than 16 billion 
since then kluge has invested his profits into other interests 
including cellular telephones and restaurants he owns the 
ponderosa steak house bonanza and steak amp ale chains he recently 
sold his new york cellular operations for more than 1 billion in 
cash and 850 million in stock

wheat futures prices were mostly higher but corn 
and soybean prices were off at the close thursday at the chicago 
board of trade 
wheat futures were supported by an increase in export business 
this week traders said 
analysts said severe weather moving into the midwest growing 
regions helped rally prices wednesday but now that the wintry 
weather was here there was nothing else to keep prices going much 
higher 
traders were unimpressed with the us agriculture department 
announcement overnight that the soviet union had purchased 350000 
metric tons of us corn 
theyre saying who cares said grain analyst mickey luth 
of shearson lehman hutton inc 
he said the purchase was a drop in the bucket compared with the 
16 million tons the soviets had bought a year ago 
luth also said that demand for soybeans are below what they were 
a year ago 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 264 cents a bushel corn

mobil corps chief executive officer 
tesifying in a wrongful firing suit said thursday that he knew 
nothing about an employee who said he was fired for not going along 
with an alleged coverup of environmental problems at a company 
plant 
we have too much to lose to defeat the law allen e murray 
told us district judge harold ackerman were not a 
flybynight business weve been around for 100 years 
the judge had ordered murray to testify in the case of an 
employee of mobil chemical co a division of mobil corp the 
employee valcar bowman contends he was fired in 1986 as the no 2 
environmental officer in that division because he blew the whistle 
on a coverup at a plant in bakersfield calif 
mobil says it fired the princeton njbased manager as part of 
a costcutting campaign the company later added that bowman was 
fired for insubordination and disobedience 
in a hearing last year judge ackerman noted that in 1986 the 
year bowman was fired mobil chemical had its best year ever with 
net earnings rising to a record 140 million a 164 percent 
increase from 1985 
during testimony murray touched directly on several of bowmans 
charges 
bowman insists that following a government search of mobils oil 
refinery in torrance calif the company ordered his staff to 
deliver all records that it could legally move from the 
bakersfield calif plant to the companys outside counsel 
bowman says the theory behind moving documents was that 
attorneyclient privilege would keep the documents confidential and 
out of the hands of investigators 
but murray said such moves are not unusual for a company the 
size of mobil the countrys second largest oil company behind 
exxon corp with about 150000 employees and hundreds of plants 
around the world 
records are moved around all the time he said and the 
company is not ready to tarnish its image for such a twobit 
item 
murray stressed that as mobils top officer he did not know 
about bowmans firing or operational details in the bakersfield 
plant murray noted that he is not the president of mobil chemical 
co the division bowman worked for and so was not concerned with 
such matters 
i wasnt aware of mr bowman at all murray said 
but bowmans attorney stephen b wiley showed murray a copy of 
a letter to murray that was marked with the chief executive 
officers received stamp and he asked if murray could still 
say he had never heard of bowman 
murray explained that he has two secretaries who handle the 100 
or so pieces of mail that enter his office each day the initials 
of another mobil executive at the top of the paper showed that his 
secretary had forwarded it to someone else murray said 
regardless of who eventually received the letter murray said 
he interpreted the document differently than wiley did instead of 
withholding information from top officials to protect them from 
knowing the facts murray said the letter indicated that results of 
a plant audit would be sent to those who needed the information 
i guess we just interpret this differently murray said 
the important thing to me is that nothing is being covered up

caterpillar inc reported thursday a 50 
percent drop in thirdquarter profits blaming the decline on 
higher material costs and rising wage and benefit increases 
quarterly earnings totaled 54 million or 54 cents a share 
compared with 108 million or 107 per share in the third quarter 
of 1989 
it was the sixth consecutive quarter in which profits at the 
worlds leading manufacturer of earthmoving equipment were less 
than the comparable period in the previous year 
however sales and revenue climbed 6 percent to 279 billion 
for the threemonth period ended sept 30 compared with 264 
billion a year earlier 
len kuchan caterpillar treasurer called the profit outlook for 
the remainder of 1990 gloomy despite the possibility that the 
75yearold company could eclipse its sales and revenue record of 
1113 billion achieved last year 
our general expectation is that we would always expect to earn 
a profit kuchan said based on what we see now we will make a 
profit in the fourth quarter 
were certainly not happy with record sales wed like to see 
record profits go right along with it 
kuchan blamed numerous factors for the depressed profits 
including higher material costs and wage and benefit increases for 
its employees 
the persian gulf crisis which sent oil prices soaring has also 
hurt caterpillar kuchan said 
higher oil prices have an impact on inflation and hold 
interest rates higher than they might be otherwise kuchan said 
we see a rough road ahead for the united states economy and the 
world economy and recognize the possibility of a recession 
the company announced plans in august to lay off 650 workers at 
its gosselies belgium facility by the end of 1991 
but no domestic plant furloughs or layoffs are anticipated at 
this time he said 
for the first nine months of the year caterpillars profits 
totaled 199 million down from 390 million last year profit per 
share was 197 compared to 385 for the first nine months of 
1989 
sales and revenue for the first nine months of year totaled 87

crude oil futures prices swung wildly thursday 
before settling slightly higher as tensions rose following a report 
that israeli soldiers wounded dozens of palestinians in clashes in 
the occupied west bank 
crude prices were sharply lower in the early going as the market 
reacted to wednesdays energy department report showing shortages 
created by the persian gulf crisis have been largely alleviated 
the nearterm contract for lightsweet crude the benchmark 
grade of oil initially plunged more than 225 a barrel on the new 
york mercantile exchange that extended wednesdays 217abarrel 
decline and was well off the recordhigh level of 41 a barrel 
registered earlier this month 
but prices reversed course following a midafternoon report that 
an attempt by the israeli army to establish a new post in a gaza 
strip refugee camp sparked hours of skirmishes and saw 35 
palestinians wounded by live ammunition and rubber bullets 
the the price of lightsweet crude for november delivery settled 
at 3680 a barrel up 8 cents on the mercantile exchangethe 
contract had traded as high as 3720 a barrel other contract 
months settled lower 
this just adds to the tension in the middle east jim 
fiedler a vice president at edf amp man international inc said 
of the israeli report the market reacted immediately to it 
fiedler said the market was concerned over the palestinians 
ability to drive a wedge into the unified front against iraq 
nonarab as well as some arab nations have harshly condemned iraq 
for its aug 2 invasion of kuwait and have been supporting a 
usled embargo against iraqi and kuwaiti crude oil 
israels killing of palestinians at the temple mount holy site 
earlier this month met with sharp criticism and fiedler suggested 
any further moves by the israelis against the palestinians could 
weaken the united states position as a leader against the iraqi 
invasion 
several traders said they were exasperated with the wide swings 
in crude futures prices 
since the persian gulf crisis erupted the band in which energy 
prices trade has widened considerably as long as the crisis 
remains unresolved many analysts predict crude prices will 
continue to swing between 34 and 41 a barrel 
higher oil prices were behind an 08 percent hike in the cost of 
living last month according to a labor department report released 
thursday it was the secondconsecutive month of bad us inflation 
and translates to a 95 percent annual rate 
crude prices have nearly doubled since the invasion largely on 
speculation that a war would disrupt critical supplies from the 
western worlds most important source of petroleum 
the market has been influenced by war jitters for weeks on 
little more than rumors but to date there have been no hostilities 
between iraq and a usled force deployed in the gulf 
some analysts also said an iraqi offer thursday to sell oil to 
anyone for 21 a barrel may have had a minor effect on depressing 
prices intially but others dismissed the gesture as propaganda 
posturing by iraqi leader saddam hussein to gain world sympathy and 
undercut the usled embargo 
prices for oil products declined home heating oil for november 
delivery lost 174 cents to 9651 a gallon several later months 
posted greater losses 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for delivery in november lost 44 
cent to 9296 cents a gallon with subsequent months dropping more

atampt said thursday its thirdquarter profit rose 
almost 2 percent despite the sluggish economy but earnings 
continued to be dragged down by processing costs for the phone 
companys highly popular new credit card 
for the three months ended sept 30 atampt said it earned 712 
million or 65 cents a share compared with 699 million or 65 
cents a share in the same quarter last year pershare earnings 
remained stable due to a higher number of outstanding shares in the 
mostrecent quarter 
revenue advanced about 5 percent to 936 billion from 89 
billion in the yearago quarter 
american telephone and telegraph co chairman robert e allen 
called the results by the nations largest longdistance phone 
company solid in the face of a softening economy 
industry analysts generally agreed 
richard toole of merrill lynch amp co called the earnings flat 
but good despite the economic downturn and drag from the atampt 
universal card they were able to overcome that and have an 
alltime record operating profit margin he said 
toole credited the companys cost controls and strong 
international sales of telephone equipment for the profit increase 
shares in atampt the nations most widely held stock rose 112 
cents to close at 32 on the new york stock exchange 
demand for the universal card a combination credit and calling 
card introduced in march has exceeded atampts projections causing 
greaterthanexpected processing costs the company said 
toole estimated the credit card processing costs cut earnings by 
5 cents a share in the quarter 
atampts total expenses rose 43 percent during the quarter 
reflecting increased marketing and advertising costs the company 
said in addition atampt said earnings were reduced by 4 cents a 
share due to higher income taxes resulting primarily from reduced 
tax credits 
but product sales including telephone network products 
computers microelectronic components and consumer products jumped 
almost 13 percent during the quarter to 308 billion 
service revenues which include longdistance service 
installation and maintenance of equipment and finance services 
rose 3 percent to 572 billion longdistance revenue itself grew 
15 percent as calling volume advanced 7 percent 
charles nichols an analyst at prudentialbache securities inc 
said the 7 percent increase in calling volume shows that atampt has 
become more effective in stemming marketshare erosion to mci 
communications corp and us sprint 
toole said atampt apparently continues to lose longdistance 
customers in the residential and international markets but in the 
highly profitable business market theyre holding their own or 
maybe even winning back a little 
atampt has about 65 percent of the overall longdistance market 
nichols said he was pleased by the companys earnings growth and 
agreed that it was doing well in light of the economic decline he 
called the continued earnings drag from the universal card a 
shortterm negative longterm positive since the card should 
increase earnings in the future 
but pat jurczak another merrill lynch amp co analyst projected 
the card would continue to lose money for two years 
the real concern is that we are moving into a slowing 
economy he said they have to keep the bad debt low they have 
to make sure they have the right customers 
while international equipment sales were strong atampt said sales 
of communications systems to large business customers were flat and 
sales to smaller businesses declined slightly 
for the first nine months of the year atampt earned 204 billion 
or 187 a share up 25 percent from 199 billion or 185 a 
share in the same period last year 
revenue totaled 2727 billion up almost 2 percent from 2681 
billion in the yearago period

losses at rh macy amp co inc more than tripled 
in the companys 1990 fiscal year a source familiar with the 
national retailer said thursday 
the companys losses totaled 2153 million for the year that 
ended july 28 compared with a loss of 63 million the previous 
year said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
sales rose 42 percent to 727 billion from 697 billion a 
year earlier 
the closely held company is still paying down big debts rolled 
up in a 1986 managementled buyout and faces grim predictions for 
the christmas shopping season 
macys earnings before interest taxes and depreciation the 
key figure for a company trying to reduce debt from a socalled 
leveraged buyout totaled 721 million in fiscal 1990 down from 
9261 million the year before 
the 1990 figure fell short of the 7432 million projection made 
by macy last spring but the source attributed the gap to a 30 
million accounting adjustment 
macy had been expected to post disappointing results since it 
announced earlier this year that it had a disastrous 1989 christmas 
season the results were expected to be released publicly later 
this month 
the upcoming christmas season is expected to be sluggish for the 
entire retail industry and macys showing during the summer has 
raised concerns among its bondholers and suppliers about how the 
company will fare during the holidays 
macys august sales fell 5 percent from a year earlier the 
source said 
but macy said it is prepared for a poor christmas james 
fingeroth a macy spokesman noted that the retailer is carrying 
560 million less in inventory than it had a year ago has 
controlled other expenses and is planning for a very sluggish 
environment going forward for the forseeable future 
tom razukas an analyst with fitch investors service inc said 
the companys results do not change his assessment of the retailer 
or its prospects macys extremely conservative approach to this 
christmas is a good way to be he said 
last week macy announced it was selling its credit operations 
to ge capital corp macy said the move would reduce its 48 
billion debt load by 15 billion 
the company has also said it is buying back some of its bonds 
including some of its 16 billion in junk bonds as another means 
of lowering its debt and a 595 million annual interest bill macy 
has sold equity stakes to help finance the buybacks 
besides its flagship macy stores located mainly in the east and 
texas the company owns i magnin and bullocks stores in 
california and the west it also owns specialty stores including 
charter club morgan taylor and aeropostale which are stocked with 
macys private label apparel brands

the dollar finished sharply weaker against most 
key currencies thursday reflecting what money dealers called a 
loss of confidence in the us governments ability to adopt a 
deficitreduction package 
gold prices rose while silver prices were mostly unchanged 
the dollars decline was particularly acute against the german 
mark falling through a psychological barrier of 150 marks to 
14970 in new york down from 15125 wednesday 
the dollar is weakening said william sterling an 
international economist with merrill lynch capital markets 
foreigners are increasingly coming to believe that the us 
government is incapable of delivering a competent fiscal policy 
traders said treasury secretary nicholas bradys comment earlier 
this week that he wasnt overly concerned about the dollars

in tokyo the dollar fell to a closing 12440 japanese yen from

wednesday in new york it cost 19710 to buy one pound more 
expensive than wednesdays 19615 
lamakers were working late again thursday mindful of president 
bushs promise to let the government shut down again saturday 
when its authority to spend money expires unless congress seems 
near a budget he likes 
but traders said the prolonged political stalemate in washington 
over the deficit considered a major drag on the us economy was 
causing foreign investors to lose confidence in the dollar and in 
the federal governments ability to function effectively 
sterling predicted the dollar would weaken further if congress 
misses the latest deadline 
they ought to meet the deadline sterling said if a 
budget is delayed and the government has to shut down again all of 
that would leave the dollar twisting in the wind

the federal agency disposing of failed savings 
and loans is selling its smallest properties in the next few months 
in order to free employees to concentrate on the largest 
properties 
were much better off administratively if we can sell them 
smaller properties off fast and reduce the bookkeeping and number 
of people needed to manage them l william seidman chairman of 
the resolution trust corp said in a telephone interview thursday 
we want to use our people to move on big assets he said 
the rtc was created by last years sampl bailout law by early 
this month it had taken over 492 failed thrifts with assets of 
258 billion it has disposed of 286 of those sampls but has had less 
success in selling the assets owned by the institutions 
in early august seidman announced a great fall inventory 
clearance sale to move more than 50 billion in assets by the end 
of the year 
he said thursday that effort had been set back by the 
cancellation of an auction via international satellite scheduled 
for november but that the agency still might reach its goal 
seidman first disclosed the rtcs strategy shift toward 
disposing smaller assets in a speech wednesday to the washington 
analysis corp a subsidiary of national westminster bank 
he said more than 76 percent of the 40000 real estate parcels 
in his agencys possession had values of less than 100000 
it also has a large number of delinquent loans wih book values 
of less than 50000 each most of the loans will be packaged and 
sold to the highest bidder at auctions he said 
in the januarymarch quarter the agency will conduct a series 
of auctions and accept sealed bids for almost all real estate 
properties valued at less than 100000 he said sealed bids will 
be used in a program aimed at providing homes to poor people 
the faster disposition of these small assets will maximize 
returns by freeing up our staff to concentrate on large sales where 
the real dollars are recovered seidman said

recessionary pressures hare said 
hog futures have gone the other way recently after a supportive 
hog inventory report at the last month prices have fallen back due

lowercost macntoshes said apple spokesman christopher escher 
after several years of rapid growth apples sales have slowed 
recently with critics blaming the companys woes on the high price

line the least expensive the macintosh classic has a suggested 
retail price of 999 the first time apple has produced a computer

mobil oil corp agreed thursday to a 
sevenyear phaseout of deadly hydrogen flouride at its refinery 
here and to submit to review by an independent safety advisor 
the agreement settles a lawsuit by the city of torrance alleging 
that use of the toxic cloudforming acid endangered thousands of 
residents living nearby in the los angeles coastal suburb the case 
was scheduled to go to trial nov 5 
city officials called the agreement a landmark settlement but 
warned that they expect a continuing battle over safety at the 
refinery 
a trial would have shown the world how dangerous hydrogen 
flouride is and how poorly managed the plant was operated said 
councilman dan walker i think were going to have to fight every 
inch of the way to meet the goals of the settlement 
the lawsuit filed early this year stems from a november 1987 
explosion and fire that ignited when hydrogen flouride overflowed 
into a tank and mixed with another chemical 
the blast caused some 17 million in damage and left four 
workers and six bystanders injured 
used to manufacture highoctane gasolines hydrogen flouride 
forms a heavy cloud when exposed to open air city officials feared 
an accident or leak at the refinery could send such a cloud 
drifting into residential neighborhoods 
under the agreement mobil would be allowed to develop and use a 
derivative of hydrogen flouride that would not form a cloud 
refinery manager joel maness said he expected the settlement to 
end several years of acrimony between the city and mobil he said 
he had no concern about permitting an outside inspector to review 
the plants operations 
we feel strongly that we have a safe operation maness said 
but i never mind having another set of eyes take a look at our 
operations and our procedures 
the inspector who will advise the plant on safety 
considerations will be chosen by joint agreement between mobil nd 
the city and bill be paid by the company court documents said 
the advisor will report to retired superior court judge harry v 
peetris who will act as an arbitrator of future disputes over the 
phaseout program peetris also will be paid by mobil
