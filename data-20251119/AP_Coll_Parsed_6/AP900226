a portrait of a beardless abraham lincoln the 
first portrait ever painted of him has been discovered by a 
collector of lincoln memorabilia american heritage magazine 
reported 
the portrait appears in the magazines march issue 
it was painted from life in 1856 by dr philip o jenkins a 
physician and amateur artist before lincoln was nationally known 
collectors james l swanson and lloyd ostendorf said 
lincoln became president in 1861 
swanson tracked down the portrait in the illinois home of an 
86yearold distant relative of the artist 
there at the end of the parlor was abraham lincoln 
sixteenth president of the united states he writes 
but this was not bearded father abraham the great emancipator 
and civil war president swanson said it was the image of 
another man abe lincoln of illinois prominent lawyer and 
ambitious politician 
the canvas captured lincoln as he would have looked in his 
office in court or at a political event on any day in the 1850s 
cleanshaven wearing a dark frock coat white shirt and tie 
the article describes the processes swanson went through to 
verify his finding

inside the former local communist party 
headquarters 17 opposition groups work under the same roof but 
with different visions of how to rebuild east germany after the 
nations first free elections next month 
environmentalists feminists the wellknown new forum and even 
a lone conservative group all rent office space from the communists 
in the neogothic building renamed democracy house after the 
communists moved out in january 
its a little chaotic here campaign worker jana reuter of 
new forum said friday its taking a while to get the hang of 
things 
others praise the camaraderie and conveniences of similar groups 
working under one roof 
for groups that work together being in one building has big 
advantages said thomas voit of the leftistoriented party 
democracy now its easy to meet quickly and exchange ideas or 
discuss campaign details 
with less than three weeks to go before the march 18 elections 
democracy houses winding halls are buzzing with commotion 
on the third floor friday night the conservative party 
democratic awakening was having an organizational meeting one 
floor higher leaders of the east german greens gathered 
it sometimes seems theres a party or group for everyone 
the social democrats want to follow in the footsteps of their 
western counterparts led by willy brandt they are leading in the 
polls 
there are christian democrats free democrats and the 
communists although the latter have changed their name to the 
pleasantsounding party of democratic socialism as they seek to 
break from their stalinist past 
but there are others as well including the united leftists the 
independent womens association and the initiative for peace and 
human rights 
under present laws in east germany a political organization 
does not have to be a party to run for or hold office 
some have warned that the splintering could lead to an inability 
to govern 
west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has cautioned 
the united states that difficulties are expected in forming an east 
german government 
it is conceivable that there will be no more east german 
government after march 18 the bonn daily newspaper die welt on 
friday quoted schaeuble as saying 
some groups in democracy house say they are aware of the 
confusion but dont know how else to manage given the brief time 
until the elections and the pressing problems east germany must 
begin solving 
throughout east germany groups and organizations have been 
running campaigns from makeshift offices many of them lacking 
essentials like typewriters to say nothing of photocopying 
machines 
were not pleased to have to work under so much pressure with 
so little time said pastor rainer eppelmann himself one of the 
founding members of the prodemocracy movement and a minister in 
the current caretaker government 
his democratic awakening party has helped lessen the splintering 
somewhat by forming an election alliance with two other 
conservative parties the alliance is supported by west german 
chancellor helmut kohls christian democratic union 
the alliance favors establishing a marketoriented economy 
monetary union and unification with west germany as soon as 
possible socialism never again is one of its slogans 
three leftistoriented groups in democracy house also have 
formed an alliance new forum and the initiative for peace and 
human rights have teamed up with democracy now to form buendnis 90 
alliance 90 
a marketoriented economy yes but not as a dismantling of 
social security unification yes but not as annexation 
alliance 90 says in a campaign paper 
the heady rush toward democracy in east germany has forced the 
emerging political groups to learn about democracy on the run 
from the point of view of party organization it would have 
been better to hold the elections later eppelmann said with a 
sigh but considering the dynamic rate of developments here the 
march 18 date is a good thing

the romanian revolution has been the 
bloodiest and most chaotic of the upheavals in the soviet bloc 
some of the turmoil seems to stem from the nations history of 
brutal authoritarianism but government critics say mistakes by 
romanias new leaders have also played a role 
two months after its anticommunist uprising romanias fragile 
governing coalition is struggling to keep the peace several 
violent demonstrations saw hundreds of people storm government 
headquarters 
on wednesday a national peasants party official said two party 
activists had been killed in recent weeks apparently for political 
reasons in may elections that traditionally anticommunist party 
will likely prove the strongest challenger to the national 
salvation front 
the front took power after the overthrow and execution of 
president nicolae ceausescu and has since added other parties to 
its provisional government 
none of the other five rapidly democratizing countries in the 
east bloc have seen the violence romania has hundreds perhaps 
thousands are thought to have died in revolutionary battles 
pitting revolutionaries against ceausescu 
no other country however had a ceausescu under a 
quartercentury of his rule romanias 23 million people slid deep 
into economic misery and suffered political repression unmatched 
elsewhere in the bloc 
before ceausescu romania was under the control of one dictator 
or another for most of its 2000year history save for 60 years of 
political pluralism at the turn of the century 
the effect of the long period of despotism was to rob romanians 
of even the slim experience with democracy that many other eastern 
european countries had 
after world war ii under ceausescu the communist dictators 
repression of government opponents wiped out any major opposition 
leaders who could fill the power vacuum after his downfall dec 22 
other eastern european nations had at least some strong dissidents 
who survived their communist regimes 
ceausescus disastrous political legacy is still haunting 
us octavian paler a leading writer and editor of the newspaper 
romania libera said in a recent editorial we must pay a high 
price for the lack of a noncommunist opposition suspicion fear 
and little democratic tradition historically 
after the revolution rivalries broke out between supporters of 
the national salvation front and its opponents 
a loose grouping of excommunists technocrats and former 
dissidents the front ran the country alone for a few weeks but 
its initial reluctance to share power enraged major opposition 
parties and wide sectors of the population who feared the 
relatively high proportion of communists in its ranks made it a 
possible vehicle for a new totalitarian takeover the front was 
eventually forced to share power with nearly 40 new political 
parties 
suspicion of front motives increased after interim president and 
front leader ion iliescu said the group which most people viewed 
as only an interim government would take part in the may 20 
elections initially it had said it had no plans to do so 
following a violent profront demonstration jan 29 several 
opposition parties accused the front of communist tactics such as 
busing in truckloads of supporters blaming the other parties for 
violence and buying support with money and whiskey 
the front moved to redress many grievances during its sixweek 
tenure as the countrys sole government 
it replaced ceausescus most hated laws opened the borders for 
romanians to travel allowed protest demonstrations lifted 
censorship and released political and ordinary prisoners 
but even those moves drew criticism 
they let free the thieves and ordinary criminals and now its 
dangerous to move around freely after sunset said marin stelian 
a bucharest typographer 
adding to the distrust is fear that vestiges of the horrible 
past continue to exist 
a group of 46 intellectuals expressed worry in early february 
that securitate secret policemen who terrorized the country under 
ceausescu still wield secret power 
in an open letter to the new council of national unity which is 
to act as a parliament until the elections the intellectuals said 
nobody can talk about the victory of the revolution when fear 
physical and psychological threats go on 
the depth of concern about the future was evident in remarks 
made by iliescu in the wake of the feb 18 demonstration in which 
some soldiers attempting to keep the mob away from government 
headquarters were injured 
if the army and police dont have the legal ability to 
maintain order people will feel it necessary to defend themselves 
we could become like lebanon and anarchy could lead us to total 
chaos he said in a public address 
romanias only previous brush with democracy occurred in a 
60year span that began in the 1880s political parties were 
allowed to operate under a constitutional monarchy but even then 
the king remained the main figure in decisionmaking until the nazi 
takeover in 1940 and full totalitarianism

bt collins says hes living proof that 
malathion poses no health risks to southern californians whose 
neighborhoods are being sprayed with the pesticide to wipe out the 
cropdestroying medfly 
as head of the california conservation corps during a 1981 
medfly infestation collins was so sure malathion was safe that he 
drank a diluted glass of it in front of corps members wary about 
picking malathionsprayed fruit 
i offered to do it again said collins now an 
aliveandwell state chief deputy treasurer i dont think the 
citizens in los angeles have a clue as to how disastrous it could 
be if that fly gets to bakersfield at the foot of the 
agriculturallyrich central valley 
perhaps the state should consider taking him up on his offer 
little else has persuaded southern californians that aerial 
malathion spraying should continue to protect agricultural areas 
from the mediterranean fruit fly 
as one city after another joined the revolt last week against 
the aerial spraying state officials were faced with a severe 
credibility gap and no apparent sign of converting the dubious 
critics and supporters of the spraying say the public relations 
effort has suffered from a late start some bad press a 
mediasavvy opposition and mixed and muddled messages from 
officials 
ill tell you they lost an enormous amount of credibility in 
pasadena said city director rick cole who complained the state 
broke its promise to finish spraying before commuters leave in the 
morning for work 
the department of food and agriculture ordered the spraying of 
400 square miles following the discovery of mediterranean fruit 
flies last august 
officials say the eradication program is needed to protect 
californias 165 billion agricultural business they also say the 
sticky mixture of malathion and corn syrup bait poses no health 
risk in small heavily diluted doses a third of an ounce of the 
mixture is dropped over an entire city block 
its safe its safe its safe weve been saying it over and 
over again said gera curry a food and agriculture department 
spokeswoman 
but southern californians arent buying the message 
a recent los angeles times poll found that 57 percent of los 
angeles and orange county residents want the spraying stopped and 
only one in seven strongly support it 
part of the problem critics said is that the state failed to 
spend enough time explaining its position on health risks and did 
not listen to concerns before the spraying began 
state officials said they had to move quickly because any delay 
in spraying even under court order could prove fatal for 
farming 
the medfly wont wait for a temporary restraining order 
said dr peter kurtz a senior medical coordinator with the food 
and agriculture department 
while the state hurried to spray opponents built momentum 
they were aided by media reports damaging the states position 
including charges by the coauthor of a state study who said it was 
edited to understate the health risks the report was often cited 
to support claims that malathion is safe 
in recent weeks a grassroots effort led mainly by concerned

despite ominous government warnings and a high 
police profile prodemocracy activists marched by the hundreds of 
thousands in more than 30 soviet cities to demand an end to 
oneparty communist rule 
the rallies sunday unprecedented in scope in the communists 
72year rule came a day after voters in the independenceminded 
republic of lithuania apparently stripped the communists of their 
parliamentary majority the day also saw republicwide elections in 
another restive republic moldavia 
a series of official warnings last week that extremists would 
provoke violence kept the turnout low in some cities sunday and 
prevented some protests altogether riot police dragged away people 
who tried to hold an unsanctioned demonstration in leningrad but 
there were no reports of major unrest 
we heard about tanks about police waiting with gas and 
shovels said a middleaged woman who was not deterred from 
demonstrating sunday in moscow along with more than 100000 people 
thousands of uniformed police and internal security troops 
guarded the authorized march route in moscow sandfilled dump 
trucks water trucks and snowplows blocked all approaches to the 
kremlin about 17000 police and interior ministry troops stood by 
with nightsticks and water cannons eventually relaxing and 
stashing their riot gear 
all was against us gavril popov a member of the congress 
of peoples deputies told the crowd in moscows zubovsky square 
he accused the communist party and state apparatus of 
engineering a campaign of fear not seen since stalin in an attempt 
to thwart the outpouring of popular sentiment for a swift change to 
democracy 
demonstrators demanded democratic reforms ranging from direct 
popular election of the president to the establishment of private 
property and creation of a multiparty system 
one demonstrator charged that the sunday morning broadcast of a 
polish sciencefiction film called the sex mission with 
nudity rare on soviet tv was a deliberate attempt to entice 
people to stay home 
the protests were planned after a successful feb 4 
prodemocracy rally in moscow in which about 200000 people 
demanded the communist party give up its monopoly on power 
party leaders voted to do so shortly afterward but the day when 
the communists must compete with other parties for the right to run 
the country appears far off to many soviets the communists with 
their longestablished omnipresent patronage system still firmly 
control the government and economy nearly everywhere 
reports from police local activists interviewed by telephone 
and staterun media indicated as many as 276000 people took part 
in protest rallies in 32 cities outside moscow from 
petropavlovskkamchatky in the soviet far east to leningrad on the 
baltic sea coast 
in moscow red blue and white flags of czarist russia fluttered 
along with red and black flags of anarchists and the skyblue cross 
on a white background of the memorial society which is dedicated 
to remembering stalins victims 
general are you with the people shouted a woman in the 
crowd to a stocky interior ministry officer directing crowd control 
at gorky park one of the gathering points for the march 
sure i am replied maj gen georgy postoyuk contrary to 
widespread rumors that authorities planned to provoke violence to 
justify a crackdown he said officials worked closely with rally 
organizers and the result was a very good orderly meeting 
speakers urged demonstrators to endorse progressive candidates 
running in march 4 parliamentary elections in the russian 
federation and demanded the ouster of members of the ruling 
politburo and council of ministers as well as kgb chief vladimir 
a kryuchkov 
with a show of hands the crowd voted in support of a platform 
presented by historian and parliament deputy yuri afanasyev that 
proposed a direct presidential election the establishment of 
private property and turning over state media from party control to 
editorial collectives 
were fed up with how we live said one demonstrator 
celestine langovaya a music teacher in her 50s when mikhail 
s gorbachev first came to power i believed in him but things 
have gotten worse for millions of people 
the novosti press agency said 100000 people gathered in minsk 
the byelorussian capital for the largest turnout reported outside 
the soviet capital 
only about 8000 demonstrators showed up at the officially 
authorized rally site in leningrad the nations secondlargest 
city leaders of the proindependence peoples front movement there 
had urged followers to boycott the event because authorities would 
not grant permission to demonstrate on a downtown street 
riot police far outnumbered a small group that did try to 
demonstrate in downtown leningrad without official permission 
officers broke up the attempted protest and dragged demonstrators 
aboard waiting buses 
authorities in the southern russian city of rostovondon 
refused to allow rallies and about 100 dismayed activists gathered 
near the local communist headquarters to hand out leaflets the 
official tass news agency said 
military authorities in azerbaijan banned all demonstrations 
fearing a renewal of the nationalist violence that led to ethnic 
warfare between armenians and azerbaijanis in january 
about 2000 were said to have gathered in the central siberian 
city of krasnoyarsk but activists there said many people went to 
the wrong places because statecontrolled media had refused to 
report plans for the rally 
elsewhere local activists said 50000 people rallied in 
georgias capital of tbilisi and 12000 in the large siberian city 
of novosibirsk another 18000 people attended two rallies in the 
urals city of sverdlovsk they said 
demonstrators in tbilisi tore down street signs of a street 
named after lenin and renamed it for a georgian dissident killed in 
a car crash last year a political activist said 
about 50000 ukrainians gathered in kiev said victor 
linchevsky a spokesman for the grassroots organization rukh 
on saturday lithuanian voters appeared to have chosen the 
countrys first legislature not dominated by communists 
unofficial returns showed that of the 90 races decided 
candidates endorsed by the sajudis reform movement took 72 seats 
and nonsajudis candidates took 18 said rita dapkus head of the 
sajudis information agency 
moldavians voted sunday in their first free elections under 
soviet rule and expressed hopes their new parliament would be able 
to win greater sovereignty from moscow

bt collins says hes living proof that 
malathion poses no health risks to southern californians whose 
neighborhoods are being sprayed with the pesticide to wipe out the 
cropdestroying medfly 
as head of the california conservation corps during a 1981 
medfly infestation collins was so sure malathion was safe that he 
drank a diluted glass of it in front of corps members wary about 
picking malathionsprayed fruit 
i offered to do it again said collins now an 
aliveandwell state chief deputy treasurer i dont think the 
citizens in los angeles have a clue as to how disastrous it could 
be if that fly gets to bakersfield at the foot of the 
agriculturallyrich central valley 
perhaps the state should consider taking him up on his offer 
little else has persuaded southern californians that aerial 
malathion spraying should continue to protect agricultural areas 
from the mediterranean fruit fly 
as one city after another joined the revolt last week against 
the aerial spraying state officials were faced with a severe 
credibility gap and no apparent sign of converting the dubious 
critics and supporters of the spraying say the public relations 
effort has suffered from a late start some bad press a 
mediasavvy opposition and mixed and muddled messages from 
officials 
ill tell you they lost an enormous amount of credibility in 
pasadena said city director rick cole who complained the state 
broke its promise to finish spraying before commuters leave in the 
morning for work 
the department of food and agriculture ordered the spraying of 
400 square miles following the discovery of mediterranean fruit 
flies last august 
officials say the eradication program is needed to protect 
californias 165 billion agricultural business they also say the 
sticky mixture of malathion and corn syrup bait poses no health 
risk in small heavily diluted doses a third of an ounce of the 
mixture is dropped over an entire city block 
its safe its safe its safe weve been saying it over and 
over again said gera curry a food and agriculture department 
spokeswoman 
but southern californians arent buying the message 
a recent los angeles times poll found that 57 percent of los 
angeles and orange county residents want the spraying stopped and 
only one in seven strongly support it 
part of the problem critics said is that the state failed to 
spend enough time explaining its position on health risks and did 
not listen to concerns before the spraying began 
state officials said they had to move quickly because any delay 
in spraying even under court order could prove fatal for 
farming 
the medfly wont wait for a temporary restraining order 
said dr peter kurtz a senior medical coordinator with the food 
and agriculture department 
while the state hurried to spray opponents built momentum 
they were aided by media reports damaging the states position 
including charges by the coauthor of a state study who said it was 
edited to understate the health risks the report was often cited 
to support claims that malathion is safe 
in recent weeks a grassroots effort led mainly by concerned 
homeowners has grabbed attention by recruiting famous faces such 
as most of the cast of televisions cheers 
politicians responded by holding public hearings on malathion 
spraying and scientists countered the official line that malathion 
is absolutely safe 
i think that aerial spraying in densely populated areas is 
absolutely ridiculous said dr donald dahlsten a university of 
californiaberkeley entomologist in testimony before the los 
angeles city council

the key index on the tokyo stock exchange took its 
secondlargest tumble ever monday representing to many dealers the 
beginning of an anticipated collapse of artificially high stock 
values here 
the 225share nikkei stock average shed 156910 points or 45 
percent to fall to 3332187 at the close of the trading day this 
was the indexs second largest decline in points and the lowest it 
has fallen since july 5 1989 when it closed at 3330971 points 
volume was light at 400 million shares on the first section 
the markets main index dropped 256935 points or 686 
percent last week and 40249 points or 1034 percent since the 
beginning of the year until monday 
in washington a us official said sunday night that the 
treasury department and federal reserve were monitoring the 
situation on the tokyo stock exchange but that no special actions 
had been taken by us authorities 
kazuhiro nomura of new japan securities co said the stock 
markets plunge in the last week showed that the bubble 
phenomenon had finally burst 
stock purchasing by investors on borrowed cash at low interest 
rates had inflated share values he said 
but a sharp rise in interest rates last year spelled an end to 
obtaining easy cash the bank of japan the nations central bank 
raised the key discount rate three times last year and it now 
stands at 425 percent 
ken schoenholtz an economist for solomon brothers asia ltd 
said share prices have been out of line with the higher interest 
rates instituted by the bank of japan last year 
the decline in the nikkei shows the market getting adjusted to 
high yields that are likely to stay schoenholtz said 
the benchmark 10year japanese government bond was at 7 percent 
at midday up slightly from its 698 percent opening 
with the dollar trading at 14845 yen we expect a further 
decline in bond prices especially with an auction coming up 
tomorrow said doug schumway a trader at jardine fleming 
securities in tokyo 
trading was light the possibility of a substantial decline 
schumway said would depend on the volatility of the foreign 
exchange market 
dealers have also attributed the continuing fall in the nikkei 
to fears of an additional interest rate hike by japans central 
bank and a wave of computeraided selling by arbitrageurs 
they said an increase in the bank of japans discount rate is 
expected shortly because of higher inflation in recent months and 
rapid growth in the money supply 
japanese market participants have also singled out the growing 
usage of program arbitrage trading by foreign securities companies 
as contributing to increased market volatility 
in arbitrage trading dealers profit from differences in prices 
for the same security in different markets for instance the spot 
and future markets 
some dealers have even singled the two us securities firms 
solomon brothers and morgan stanley as the principal users of 
arbitrage trading in japan 
but solomons schoenholtz disagreed that program selling was 
responsible for the fall in the nikkei 
i doubt that youd see such extreme market movements that 
werent related to the fundamentals he said 
schoenholtz said the decline represented that compression of the 
earnings yield gap between the equity and bond markets 
as of the middle of last week he said the yield on stock 
issues averaged 15 percent whereas the yield on bonds was as high 
as 7 percent 
three percent gaps in yield have been sustained for a 
considerable amount of time but 5 percent have not he added 
on the foreign exchange market the dollar was quoted at 14850 
yen up 203 yen at 1229 pm after opening at 14750 yen the 
currency moved between 14772 yen and 14870 yen 
participants have no confidence in buying the yen because of 
negative factors involving the currency said junichi kodama a 
trader with chemical bank in tokyo political uncertainties and the 
tokyo stock exchanges crash of last week are the major reasons 
that many investors are staying away from the japanese currency he 
added 
the bank of japan bank was seen monday morning making a 
dollarselling intervention in the sydney market before the tokyo 
market opened in an attempt to support the declining yen the 
amount of selling was not clear because the bank does not comment 
officially on its monetary activities

president bush and west german chancellor 
helmut kohl following extraordinarily frank talks at camp 
david say the world has nothing to fear from a united germany and 
promise it will stay tethered to the western military alliance 
emerging sunday from two days of talks at the presidential 
retreat bush and kohl sought to allay fears from moscow to warsaw 
to london that the two germanys are marching to the altar too 
rapidly 
bush said they shared a common belief that a unified germany 
should remain a full member of the north atlantic treaty 
organization including participation in its military structure 
but with a special military status for the territory of what is 
now east germany 
kohl without mentioning nato by name said the alliance of 
free democracies in europe and north america are of fundamental 
importance for peace and security this is true now this will be 
true in the future 
kohl also ruled out a warsaw pact connection for the new 
germany saying a united germany cannot belong to two different 
pact systems he added we will have transition situations 
which will have to be negotiated 
the soviets now have 380000 troops stationed in east germany 
which holds parliamentary elections march 18 that are expected to 
speed the union of east and west germany 
kohl reiterated that a neutral germany is out of the question 
neutralism would be a very false solution said kohl adding 
that his country learned that lesson the hard way after world war 
i the isolation of the weimar republic was followed by the terror 
and militarism of hitlers third reich 
poland decimated by the nazis in world war ii has expressed 
fear a united germany might demand old lands back 
on that score bush said the united states regards the current 
european borders including germanys long border with poland as 
inviolable 
kohl said the border question will be settled definitely by a 
free elected allgerman government and a freely elected allgerman 
parliament he said he cannot speak now for what the german state 
will decide 
but kohl emphasized nobody has any intention of linking the 
question of national unity with changes in existing borders 
bush said the us position is not to be afraid of german 
reunification but to understand the longing of the german people 
to end the artificial division imposed after world war ii 
weve already crossed that bridge we welcome reunification 
but its not for the united states to set a timetable its not for 
us to say how fast said bush who acknowledged that events are 
moving faster than we expected 
he called the talks with kohl extraordinarily frank both 
leaders said they saw no need to add poland to the group of four 
nations that will discuss reunification with the two german states 
poland like east germany has abandoned its communist monopoly 
government 
the allies which defeated germany in world war ii the united 
states soviet union great britain and france have agreed to 
convene meetings that are likely to lead to a unified germany 
perhaps as soon as this year 
bush and kohl fielded questions from reporters for nearly an 
hour in a recreation hall at camp greentop just down the road from 
camp david atop the catoctin mountains of maryland 
kohl said west germany had proven its commitment to democracy in 
the last 40 years as a loyal and reliable partner in human rights 
and the defense of freedom he said he had put his own political 
existence on the line in supporting the deployment of us pershing 
missiles in west germany in 1983 
kohl also noted that he favors the political union of europe 
and ceding more authority to the european parliament 
in other words we want this united germany to be ever more 
embedded in an integration process with its neighbors so nobody 
needs to be afraid said kohl 
bush asked what he would do if soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev refused to allow a united germany in nato said we 
will do what lyndon johnson did we will reason together and it 
will all work out 
the white house also announced over the weekend that bush will 
meet with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu on friday and 
saturday in palm springs calif kaifus liberal democratic party 
won a vote of confidence from the japanese people in last weeks 
parliamentary elections 
its very important now that hes solidified his position to 
hold such talks bush told reporters sunday night at a dinner for 
governors

erin donnell has flown on airliners four times 
in six months and shes never had to buy a ticket shes also never 
had a seat of her own during takeoff or landing shes 6 months old 
but if airlines have their way erin wont be allowed to fly in 
her mothers arms between washington and rochester ny 
the airline industrys air transport association last week 
joined calls from members of congress consumer safety groups and 
flight attendants for a rule requiring safety seats for all 
passengers under 2 years old 
if safety seats are made mandatory erins mother judy donnell 
of alexandria va might have to buy a 130 ticket for a seat 
where she could strap in the child restraint 
some travel agents say many travelers cant afford the extra 
expense and a federal aviation administration official said the 
proposal likely would do little to improve infant air travelers 
safety 
the proposal would affect the 5000 to 10000 babies who fly 
each day in most cases the same safety seats that states now 
require for infants riding in cars can be used in a jetliner 
the faa proposes only to require that airlines offer use of 
safety seats as an option to travelers as most airlines do now 
but the agency is seeking public comment on the tougher proposal 
mrs donnell said she would be willing to pay the extra cost 
but she has never considered buying a ticket to guarantee her baby 
a seat 
its really mindboggling that they think a baby is going to 
be safe not secured she said adding that she sometimes straps 
erin into an extra seat during flight but holds her unsecured 
during takeoff and landing 
other passengers apparently are not so content with the prospect 
of having to carry a safety seat and buy a ticket for a child under 
2 
people are mostly concerned about having to pay said doris 
davidoff a bowie md travel agent whose firm books 10000 
tickets a year theyd like to have a choice and dont want it to 
be mandatory 
i really dont think it would be fair given the really low 
percentages of injuries or deaths involved to force the many many 
parents traveling with infants to pay these fares said mrs 
davidoff 
a passenger flying roundtrip between baltimore and los angeles 
at full fare could have to pay up to 1246 on a heavily booked 
flight to guarantee a seat for an infant if the ticket were bought 
far enough in advance at a discount the cost still would be at 
least 406 unless special childs fares were in effect 
the faa also is concerned about the burden such a rule would put 
on travelers 
the number of accidents is statistically low to begin with 
and there has been no indication that a great many children have 
been killed said faa spokesman fred farrar 
we dont think there is any safety justification for either 
requiring the airlines to give up a seat for free or for requiring 
a parent to purchase a seat if they dont want to farrar said 
the problem is that in an air crash a baby becomes a 
ballistic said sen christopher bond rmo cosponsor with rep 
jim lightfoot riowa of legislation to force the faa to require 
safety seats 
much of the new concern was prompted by the death of 
23monthold evan tsao in the july 19 crash of united flight 232 in 
an iowa cornfield 
the boys mother sylvia tsao survived the crash while the 
toddler died of smoke inhalation proponents of the seat rule say 
he might have lived if hed been strapped in next to his mother 
a harvard medical school study in the early 1980s estimated that 
three infants might be saved over five years if all children used 
safety seats on airliners no group has come up with statistics on 
injuries to unsecured infants 
airline representatives say mandatory seats wouldnt necessarily 
mean the end of free flights for babies and it could lead to more 
family discount packages last summer several airlines offered 
free seats for up to two children under age 18 traveling with an 
adult 
each airline will handle it differently but id be amazed if 
anybody gives away those seats said david brown spokesman for 
southwest airlines

dr elizabeth morgan embroiled in a child 
custody battle that now spans two continents wants a judge to 
return her passport so she can travel to new zealand where her 
exhusband arrived today for family court hearings 
morgans attorney stephen sachs said he would file court 
papers today asking dc superior court judge herbert dixon to 
return the passport 
it was dixon who ordered morgan a 42yearold plastic surgeon 
jailed for 25 months for civil contempt of court for failing to 
obey his order to reveal the whereabouts of hilary foretich now 7 
hilary who became the focus of an intensive 2year search by 
her father eric foretich was found living with her maternal 
grandparents in christchurch new zealand this weekend 
the child was sent underground amid allegations by morgan that 
foretich sexually abused their daughter he has adamantly denied 
the allegations and no court has sustained morgans assertions 
sachs said he questions whether morgans passport was legally 
seized in 1986 and said it should be returned 
it the passport should have been returned said sachs 
there was no lawful basis to keep it even before the child was 
discovered in new zealand 
elaine mittleman foretichs attorney said sunday she would 
oppose the motion to return morgans passport 
why should she have her passport returned when shes still in 
contempt of court in the district of columbia said mittleman 
meanwhile foretich arrived in new zealand from washington today 
and was traveling to christchurch for a court hearing 
certainly were going to do what we need to do to rescue my 
daughter the new zealand press association quoted him as saying 
morgan filed a civil suit in federal court in august 1986 
against foretich and his parents claiming that the grandparents 
also had abused the child the grandparents filed a counterclaim 
for defamation after a lengthy trial the jury ruled against each 
sides claim 
later that month judge dixon conducted a hearing on continued 
allegations of abuse he then ordered morgan to jail for refusing 
to allow foretich to visit their daughter morgan was released 
after three days by the dc court of appeals which required that 
she surrender the deed to her home as bond and turn over her 
passport 
from february 1987 to august 1987 morgan complied with the 
court order and allowed her husband a series of supervised visits 
with hilary sachs said 
she did comply with the thenexisting order for supervised 
visitation sachs said she purged herself of that 1986 
contempt claim for several years theres been no lawful basis 
to hold her passport 
the court of appeals first asked that judge dixon consider the 
passport issue in the summer of 1987 he said 
but by that time she was jailed for the contempt again and 
our job was to get her out of jail sachs added 
sachs said since morgan was released from jail in september 
1989 he has sent two letters to dixon requesting the passport be 
returned but the requests had gone unanswered

hampden county sheriff michael j ashe 
had been known best for innovative programs like a jail garden 
teaming inmates and senior citizens 
then came the day he seized a national guard armory to house 
inmates from his overflowing jail 
the move by the mildmannered softspoken lawman with a 
masters degree in social work has been applauded by guards 
judges and even prisoners hes become a hero on radio talk shows 
and hes been catapulted into a confrontation with state officials 
but ashe who never misses a wake or a wedding and once sneaked 
off to a mcdonalds to fill up after a dinner at the white house 
says he has never fancied himself a rebel 
ive always been a team player he said for the past 15 
years ive been here weve worked very very hard in a professional 
way to try to manage the severe overcrowding 
weve looked in closets in the garage and under the stairs 
and weve had prisoners in all those places but there comes a 
point where you run out of a little magic and you just have to 
go into the ring he said 
ashe reached the end of his patience after he had jammed 726 men 
into space built for 279 inmates following more than a year of 
turning loose hundreds of prisoners to try to meet a 500inmate 
limit established by a federal judge 
it came down to a moral and ethical thing ashe said he 
said he could no longer live with the fear of having one of the 
prisoners he released kill or maim 
the system had collapsed and someone had to do something 
he acknowledged the timing of his move on the armory the day 
before the threeday presidents day weekend began was calculated 
he installed 15 prisoners in the armory and had public opinion 
solidly in his corner before stunned state officials could respond 
state officials said late last week they would not challenge his 
occupation of the armory for at least two weeks while they look for 
other housing 
for more than a decade ashes knack of mixing toughness and 
progressive social programs has kept a lid on the centuryold 
lockup 
he believes inhumanity and coddling arrive at the same 
point jail spokesman richard mccarthy said in no way is he 
going to allow anyone to lay in a cell all day 
whatever they decide on in consultation with their social 
worker whether it is one of the vocational programs or working in 
the kitchen the men have to answer the bell every morning just 
like john q on the street and just like they will have to do when 
they get out mccarthy said 
one of ashes first efforts on taking over the jail in 1975 was 
to turn his jail quarters into a 60bed prerelease center where 
inmates with only six months to serve get extensive vocational 
substanceabuse and other counseling 
in 1986 he added a day reporting center one of the first of 
its kind in the country where inmates with four months left to 
serve can be released on a electronic monitoring program that lets 
them live at home as long as they report in several times a day 
more than 1500 inmates who have passed through his jail have 
earned high school equivalency diplomas he also started one of the 
few job programs to operate in a county jail last year office 
furniture manufacturing returned 200000 in profits to the county 
mccarthy said 
before he became sheriff ashe and his wife barbara a high 
school sweetheart were the first in a program started by the 
catholic church to help homeless children they have five sons and 
one daughter

frigid weather chilled december shipments a 
little but 1989 still was the secondhottest farm export year on 
record thus adding further stature to trade policy debate on 
capitol hill 
overall the agriculture department tallied farm export values 
at just under 40 billion up 77 percent from 1988 that was the 
best dollar performance since 1981 when export values were a record 
433 billion 
exports in december remained strong but did drop 94 million 
from the november level 
unusually cold weather contributed to the decline the usda 
reported decreases in corn soybeans meat rice fruits nuts 
and tobacco more than offset increases in wheat animal feeds 
soybean meal cotton vegetable oils barley and cattle hides 
although the tabulation was for the calendar year the 
department bases its annual forecasts and most analysis on figures 
for the fiscal year which runs from oct 1 through the next sept 
30 
in the last fiscal year for example farm export values totaled 
about 397 billion also the most since 1981 the forecast for the 
198990 fiscal year is for exports to decline to around 38 billion 
the report last week by the departments economic research 
service did not include a forecast for calendar 1990 
but in reviewing what happened in 1989 the agency noted that 
last years commodity export value represented the third 
consecutive yeartoyear increase since exports bottomed out at 
262 billion in 1986 the low point for the 1980s 
exports have been recognized for many years as vital to american 
farmers and are a central issue in the bush administrations 
strategy for 1990 farm legislation 
ongoing multilateral uruguay round negotiations under the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade are aimed at reducing 
barriers that impede exports and imports 
meanwhile several usda programs notably the export enhancement 
program or eep have been used to boost us shipments into 
selected countries where foreign competitors mainly the european 
economic community have been selling products at subsidized 
prices 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter told the house agriculture 
committee last week that the 1990 farm bill should extend export 
programs that have helped boost us exports since the current farm 
law was approved in 1985 
but yeutter added that after completion of the uruguay round 
all programs will be reassessed 
yeutter said the administration wants to continue eep which 
offers designated us commodities to selected target countries at 
subsidized prices but he said the program should be reauthorized 
without mandated levels or programming requirements 
we want our competitors especially in the european community 
to know that we stand ready to use this program to the maximum 
extent he said we want them to phase out their export subsidy 
practices which have severely distorted world markets for many 
years

americans are smoking fewer cigarettes but an 
agriculture department economist says demand continues to grow in 
the rest of the world 
last year the per capita use of cigarettes in the united states 
was estimated at 2936 pieces or fewer than 149 packs of 20 
cigarettes each down about 5 percent from the 1988 rate 
the per capita use has declined for 16 straight years said 
verner grise of the departments economic research service at its 
peak in 1963 use averaged 4345 cigarettes or more than 217 packs 
per capita consumption is based on all persons 18 or older 
smokers and nonsmokers alike it does not indicate actual smoking 
habits and is used by the agency for yeartoyear comparisons 
but world cigarette trade increased about 12 percent grise said 
in the march issue of farmline magazine 
shipments from the united states west germany the 
netherlands hong kong which is also an importer and the united 
kingdom were up while those from bulgaria and belgiumluxembourg 
were down he said together these seven countries account for 
about 84 percent of total world exports 
among the cigarette importing countries the most important 
markets are the soviet union france japan italy hong kong and 
turkey 
during the first nine months of 1989 us cigarette exports 
were up 16 percent from a year earlier with all the major markets 
buying more grise said in the relatively small markets sales

in this city where the communists 
seized power seven decades ago about 8000 people ignored rumors 
of impending violence and rallied to demand that the people be 
allowed to choose their leaders 
at a second rally on sunday riot police dragged away several 
prodemocracy protesters who tried to gather in the citys center 
without official permission 
the authorized demonstration was part of nationwide protests 
demanding radical political and economic reforms 
a resolution passed by a show of demonstrators hands and a 
resounding da said the president should be chosen by the 
people not the party apparatus and urged voters in russian 
parliamentary elections next sunday to vote in prodemocracy 
candidates and tear power from the apparatus 
in february 1917 we started on the road to democracy in 
october we got dictatorship now there is a similar situation 
ilya konstantinov a candidate for parliament told the crowd 
outside the lenin sportsconcert complex 
leningrad the site of three uprisings while it was capital of 
the russian empire has been dubbed the cradle of revolution 
in 1905 czarist forces fired on demonstrators demanding democratic 
reforms in a clash known as bloody sunday 
sunday was the anniversary of another uprising the 1917 
february revolution in which bourgeoisdemocratic forces seized 
power and forced czar nicholas ii to abdicate the bolshevik 
communists led by vladimir i lenin took over eight months later 
an hour before the rally at the sports complex about a dozen 
activists in the democratic union a radical group fighting to end 
the communist partys hold on power gathered on a square 
as about 100 police surrounded the crowd and kgb plainclothes 
agents stood by an officer shouted through a megaphone that no 
demonstration was authorized 
a dozen riot police wearing white helmets and green bulletproof 
vests then dragged away several of the activists who had no 
protest posters and had not made any public statements 
the activists were loaded onto buses for detention a 
parliamentary candidate and associated press photographer dominique 
mollard also were taken away but later released after their 
identification documents were checked 
one activist climbed atop a yellow construction crane and 
unfurled a cloth banner that referred to next sundays elections 
boycott its your first step to freedom it read 
five riot police mounted the crane and dragged down the 
protester 
leaders of the peoples front leningrads biggest prodemocracy 
group decided to boycott the authorized rally because they feared 
retaliation from either the government or rightwing groups 
but dissenting peoples front members showed up and harshly 
condemned their leaders decision 
writer mikhail chulaky a peoples front member told the crowd 
that the communist partys decision earlier this month to end its 
monopoly on power was overdue and added the party of genocide 
must be disbanded like germanys nazi party was disbanded by 
nuremberg 
under stalin thousands of political opponents were murdered 
several speakers attacked president mikhail s gorbachevs 
proposal to strengthen his powers as president again they are 
wrapping a dictator around our necks said nikolai ivanov a 
parliamentarian from leningrad whose crusade against official 
corruption has made him popular 
a protest banner equated the presidency with fascism a powerful 
comparison in a city where 600000 people were killed by the nazis 
in world war ii 
police and plainclothes kgb agents did not interfere in the 
second rally

violeta barrios de chamorro the 
underdog in sundays election was showing surprising strength and 
could upset president daniel ortega according to a polling expert 
for the los angeles times 
the times was conducting a quick count of a representative 
sample of precincts nationwide for the presidential race 
shes showing surprising strength and there exists the 
possibility of an upsetsaid ia lewis the times polling expert 
lewis refused to release any details or figures of the poll he 
spoke as concern rose about the extremely slow reporting of 
election figures by the nations supreme electoral tribunal 
mrs chamorro candidate for the usbacked opposition 
coalition trailed ortega of the leftist sandinista party in polls 
conducted before the election 
but those polls were not considered a sure indicator of victory 
because nicaragua is a rural country where polling is difficult 
nicaraguans are reluctant to tell strangers what they think after 
45 years under the somoza family dictatorship and 10 years under 
the highly disciplined sandinistas 
the los angeles times conducted a quick count by selecting a 
representative sample of precincts and having results from those 
precincts telephoned to a central office in managua 
the precinct sample indicates the possibility of a dramatic 
upset said lewis

getting agreement in washington on the need 
for a civil rights bill is proving almost ridiculously easy but 
its a little tougher to find an accord on what the measure should 
say 
i dont believe we have to overhaul the american legal system 
to ensure equality says sen orrin hatch rutah 
he and other conservatives say the sweeping proposal backed by 
the civil rights community to remedy workplace bias against 
minorities and women goes too far and needs to be limited in scope 
and yet civil rights supporters say the supreme court itself 
overhauled much of the us civil rights law last year in a series 
of rulings on job bias cases 
civil rights forces say those decisions from a supreme court 
whose conservatism deepened considerably in the reagan era 
represent the most severe setback in years for civil rights in the 
workplace they say the bill they support would merely restore the 
previous legal standards 
the supreme court rulings came at a time when opinion polls show 
an easing of worry about civil rights among white americans and 
that may in part explain the bills popularity on capitol hill 
it has gained broad sponsorship in both the house and senate 
including more than a smattering of republicans 
critics contend the measure is guaranteed to usher in racial 
hiring quotas an idea that would be much harder to sell in 
congress but sponsors declare that nothing in the bills language 
requires hiring quotas 
almost everyone agrees change is needed i have no doubt that 
more needs to be done to combat the evil of discrimination in our 
society says hatch as a senior member of the senate labor and 
judiciary committees he could play a pivotal role in any eventual 
negotiations on the issue 
the bush administration already is recommending a bill that 
would overturn two of last years decisions but that does not 
satisfy sen edward m kennedy dmass and other bill sponsors 
the administration cannot stop there or its response will be 
inadequate says kennedy 
the administration and the bill sponsors agree that something 
must be done about the supreme courts decision in the socalled 
patterson case 
the case concerns brenda patterson a former credit union filing 
clerk from winstonsalem nc she said her bosses harassed her and 
discriminated against her for a decade because she was black 
i was actually told to dust and sweep the office even though 
we had a janitor every day and no white employees were ever told to 
do this she said 
the court ruled that the alleged harassment and discrimination 
was not against the law and that a civil warera statute under 
which she had brought suit did not apply in the case the reaction 
against the decision has been so overwhelming that it appears all 
but certain the law will be changed 
but other cases are more complex 
the lorance case involves discrimination in company seniority 
plans the martin vs wilks decision focuses on courtapproved 
fairhiring agreements 
civil rights forces and conservatives may be most at odds over 
whether changes are needed as a result of the wards cove case 
which involved alleged hiring bias at an alaska salmon cannery 
before the supreme courts decision employers defending 
themselves in hiring discrimination cases had to be able to prove 
they based their actions on business necessity 
now however those who file such lawsuits must prove that the 
employer did not act out of business necessity 
by shifting the burden the supreme court has made it far more 
difficult and expensive for victims of discrimination to challenge 
the barriers they face declares kennedy 
harvard law professor charles fried however says kennedys 
proposed remedy is itself flawed 
first an individual filing such a suit would not be required to 
pinpoint which of the employers hiring practices was the source of 
the discrimination fried says that would encourage lawyers 
representing alleged bias victims to unfurl a long list of 
practices and thus force the employer to defend all of them 
also he adds the bill would require the employer to prove that 
each practice was essential for staying in business that could 
prove too difficult says fried im afraid theyre going to say 
gee we dont want to fuss with this well just hire by quota 
he said

city officials have a tough sell when they try 
to convince governors to loosen their grip on federal funds for 
combating drugs 
i strongly support the idea that some of the federal dollars 
go directly to some of our larger cities mayor richard l 
berkley of kansas city mo told governors sunday 
in his appearance at the annual midwinter meeting of the 
national governors association berkley was careful to emphasize 
he was talking about only some dollars and some cities 
but an associated press survey of governors found them almost 
unanimous in their opposition to relinquishing their hold on the 
flow of federal funds to their states 
they were equally united in praise of president bushs effort to 
help them combat drugs particularly his willingness to sharply 
increase his budget request for the effort 
president bushs drug program is a bold attempt to deal with 
this menace in a comprehensive way said republican gov james 
martin of north carolina 
gov robert casey of pennsylvania a democrat said the 
presidents program is beginning to provide states with the help 
they need 
one of the few dissenters was democratic gov neil goldschmidt 
of oregon who said the presidents program supplies the guns we 
need in the war on drugs but not enough bullets for them not 
enough resources are being dedicated to any one of the areas 
i would oppose sending federal money directly to local 
governments said gov william donald schaefer of maryland a 
former mayor of baltimore the problem is not confined just to 
our larger cities 
gov tommy thompson of wisconsin said that while some cities 
might benefit from direct funds more cities would benefit from 
having the states administer grant awards 
the states direct involvement in the allocation of dollars 
promotes coordination and avoids duplication of efforts said 
gov james thompson of illinois 
appearing with berkley were mayors wilson goode of philadelphia 
sue myrick of charlotte nc and maureen oconnor of san diego 
goode said cities often must wait months from the time federal 
funds are allocated for drug programs to the time when they 
actually receive the money 
get those federal dollars where theyre needed most he said 
we mayors want direct funding for cities because it doesnt 
always get down to us said myrick oconnor put the waiting 
period at anywhere from 12 to 18 months 
gov carroll campbell of south carolina said cities were out 
of line in assuming they have a far greater need for drug funds 
than rural areas 
we have a terrible problem outside the cities campbell said 
gov buddy roemer of louisiana was a little more sympathetic to 
the mayors 
that is a valid complaint if state government is going to 
ignore the cities ignore their wishes and not work with them hand 
in glove he said 
however he added that its invalid in the sense that the drug 
problem is nationwide statewide and not just citywide and there 
needs to be some coordination 
gov evan bayh of indiana said direct funding to the cities 
makes it difficult to coordinate either the state or local 
effort 
virginia gov l douglas wilder rejected sending money directly 
to cities because the problem is so pervasive that the state has 
a responsibility

reducing us defense spending will have no 
more impact on the economy than cutting money for education health 
and other programs says a report issued today 
using previously published data economist david gold concludes 
that on average over the past four decades defense spending has 
been a relatively neutral feature of the american economic 
landscape 
golds findings differ from the accepted belief that reducing 
the defense budget which in the latest bush administration 
proposal totals 292 billion for fiscal 1991 will generate revenue 
for other programs and trigger economic growth 
cutting the defense budget will have no more of an impact on 
us investment research and development innovation 
productivity international competitiveness and economic growth 
than will cutting other forms of spending both public and 
private gold said in the report 
the economist who works for the united nations centre on 
transnational corp conducted the study while serving as 
consultant for the defense budget project the nonprofit think 
tank released golds report 
the report challenges the conventional wisdom on both sides 
regarding the impact of defense spending said gordon adams 
director of the defense budget project 
the report said cuts in defense spending may provide funds for 
other programs and if properly handled the economy could benefit 
however ld questioned the argument that the defense budget should 
be cut to promote economic growth 
the defense budget may lie elsewhere in such problems as 
wastsmanagement and in the debate over the actual requirements for 
military forces in a rapidly changing world gold said 
gold also disputed the claim that defense requirements for 
research and development talent have weakened productivity in the 
private sector according to the report the number of scientists 
and engineers who have left civilian work for the military sector 
has declined in recent years despite the defense buildup of the 
1980s

former president reagan supporting former 
aides john poindexter and robert mcfarlane in videotaped testimony 
says he didnt think letters they sent to congress about us aid 
to the contras were false 
in his testimony for poindexters upcoming trial the former 
president said he instructed that whatever we did to maintain 
the nicaraguan contras should be done within the law 
but reagan said he was unaware his own tower commission 
concluded three years ago that oliver north was giving military 
assistance to the contras and reagan said he did not know that 
mcfarlane had pleaded guilty to withholding information from 
congress for denying norths role 
i have a great deal of confidence in the man who was quoted as 
sending these letters mcfarlane reagan testified i have 
never caught him or seen him doing anything that was in any way out 
of line or dishonest 
do you remember that mr mcfarlane has pled guilty in open 
court to withholding information from congress in connection with 
his written denials to congress asked irancontra prosecutor dan 
webb 
no i was not aware of that replied reagan 
mr president did the tower commission not tell you that 
oliver north and your national security council were involved in 
1985 and 1986 in assisting the contras militarily asked webb 
i dont recall that said reagan 
poindexter facing trial march 5 on charges of conspiracy 
obstructing congress and making false statements sent responses to 
congress in 1986 that embraced mcfarlanes letters of the previous 
year 
in his videotaped deposition released last thursday reagan 
asserted that he didnt think poindexter had obstructed congress 
did you ever give authority to john poindexter to make any 
false statements to any congressional committee asked webb 
no replied reagan and i dont think any false statements 
were made 
reagans comments on behalf of poindexter were blunted in part 
by the written answers he gave two years ago to irancontra 
investigators the responses provided to a federal grand jury 
conducting a criminal investigation of the affair depicted a 
president who had been misled by subordinates 
in those answers reagan said he had heard allegations in the 
press that north was assisting the contras militarily during a 
congressional ban on us military aid but that he understood the 
allegations were incorrect 
who told you that the allegations in the press about north 
being involved in assisting the contras was false or incorrect 
webb asked reagan during the videotaped deposition referring back 
to reagans written answers 
it could have been the late bill casey from cia said 
reagan it could have been admiral poindexter it could have been 
some people from the defense department or all of the people that 
were involved in some way in seeking support from congress for 
the contras 
the former president supported the mcfarlane letters on six 
different occasions in his videotaped testimony 
i understand exactly what he mcfarlane is saying here 
said the former president and i think it is in agreement with 
what reagan said were his repeated admonitions to his aides that 
they comply with the law 
one of the mcfarlane letters stated that none of us at the 
nsc facilitated contacts with prospective donors or otherwise 
organized or coordinated the military or paramilitary efforts of 
the resistance 
after reagan repeatedly appeared unable to understand that 
mcfarlanes letters were false us district court judge harold 
greene interrupted webb and tried to explain the matter to the 
expresident himself 
mcfarlanes letter could be interpreted that other way as 
being false reagan finally conceded but the former president 
added that he had not interpreted it as being false 
poindexter is accused of lying to congress on nov 21 1986 by 
saying that no one in the us government knew that a november 1985 
shipment to iran contained hawk missiles until after the weapons 
were delivered however documents at norths trial last year 
showed that north helped arrange the shipment and kept poindexter 
informed of its progress 
reagan announced on nov 19 1986 that all information will 
be provided to the appropriate members of congress about the iran 
initiative 
you agree with that statement webb asked reagan 
yes replied reagan except that i cannot recall 
whether there were things that then came up that made us have to 
hold our revelations to protect the lives of us hostages held 
in lebanon and iranians with whom the us government was dealing 
there were times and experience that told us that congress was 
not in many instances capable of the kind of security that we 
required he said

perez a teacher at the illinois state university childcare 
center to play lincolns ghostwriter and answer the queries from 
students in kindergarten through second grade

radios or nintendo or computers ms perez lincoln had to ask

since the illfated challenger mission 
launch director bob sieck informed the launch team that we are 
scrubbing for the day lisa malone launch control center 
commentator said at 231 am there is no hope that the weather 
will clear in time to support a launch today 
before the mission was scrubbed forecasters had said there was 
only a 40 percent chance the shuttle could be launched early monday 
the mission was postponed until at least wednesday morning 
because the numerous delays had left both the crew and the launch 
team fatigued nasa said 
as launch time approached wind gusts up to 31 mph buffeted the 
launch pad about 1 mph above the usual allowable limits winds 
that were too high might have blown the shuttle into the launch 
tower destroying the spacecraft 
at about 1240 am sieck called for an extended hold hoping 
that the winds would subside before the available launch period of 
about 90 minutes expired 
while that determination was made clouds moved over the runway 
where atlantis crew would attempt an emergency landing in case of 
a problem shortly after liftoff mission control said the clouds 
were unacceptable for launch 
the allmilitary astronaut crew arrived at the launch pad 
shortly after 10 pm just as they did before saturday nights 
mission was scrubbed 
the launch already had been delayed four times by a combination 
of bad weather a cold that felled atlantis commander navy capt 
john o creighton and a faulty computer that halted the count just 
31 seconds before liftoff on sunday 
the five delays were the most in a shuttle launch since the 
challenger which was postponed seven times and launched on the 
eighth try to explode shortly after liftoff jan 28 1986 killing 
all seven astronauts 
despite the gloomy forecast shuttle managers in midafternoon 
had given the goahead for the launch team to pump 528000 gallons 
of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into atlantis cavernous fuel 
tank for another try 
contributing to the decision to load fuel was the fact that 
monday offered the best weather odds of the next three days the 
odds drop to just 20 percent on tuesday and wednesday forecasters 
said 
clouds could block a spectacular view of the liftoff for 
residents on the east coast as far north as new jersey in clear 
weather they could see the shuttles fiery exhaust climbing on a 
course a few hundred miles off the coast 
bad weather and the illness of atlantis commander resulted in 
postponements thursday friday and saturday the weather was 
perfect early sunday before liftoff was halted by the computer 
problem with 31 seconds to go 
the computer is one of two used by the air force to provide 
information on the shuttles course after liftoff if the vehicle 
strayed off track and threatened a populated area a range safety 
officer would send a radio signal to blow it up so pieces would 
fall harmlessly into the atlantic 
mission rules require that both computers be operating for a 
launch with the one that failed serving as a backup 
capt ken warren an air force spokesman reported sunday that 
the trouble had been traced to bad software 
the computer is up and were ready to support a launch 
warren said 
the astronauts who spent three hours in the spacecraft before 
sundays scrub went to bed about noon 
the commander is navy capt john o creighton who was felled 
two days last week by a sore throat and nasal congestion his 
allmilitary crew is air force col john h casper the pilot and 
mission specialists marine lt col david c hilmers air force 
col richard mullane and navy lt cmdr pierre j thuot 
because the mission is classified neither nasa nor the pentagon 
will identify its purpose 
but sources who spoke on condition of anonymity reported that 
the astronauts were to deploy on the second day a 37300pound 
500 million satellite capable of taking supersharp photos and 
listening in on military and diplomatic communications around the 
world 
in covering most of the soviet union the satellite would be 
important in verifying soviet compliance with current and future 
arms agreements 
nasa and the pentagon planned to maintain a news blackout 
throughout the flight unless there was a major problem 
two announcements were planned one about three hours after 
liftoff to report that orbit had begun and another 30 hours into 
the flight with the date and time of landing 
the flight was expected to last four days with landing at 
edwards air force base calif

more people convicted of felonies by state 
court juries wind up in prison and stay there longer than those 
found guilty by judges according to a new report 
the justice department analysis issued sunday also found that 89 
percent of convicted felons plead guilty and that they spend less 
time in prison than those who go to trial and are convicted by a 
judge or jury 
the penalties of life in prison or death are meted out to 47 
percent of those convicted by juries of murder or nonnegligent 
manslaughter meanwhile only 15 percent of those who pleaded 
guilty to such charges and 12 percent of those found guilty by a 
judge received those penalties said the report by the departments 
bureau of justice statistics 
it is unclear why defendants convicted by juries were more 
severely punished the study said but it noted that a higher 
percentage of the convictions by juries were for violent offenses 
it said defendants in serious cases violent and nonviolent may 
have been less willing to plead guilty because they expected severe 
penalties in addition prosecutors may have recommended and 
judges may have imposed shorter sentences for those who pled 
compared to those found guilty by trial it said 
the study based on information from 100 counties in 37 states 
regarding all convicted felons sentenced in 1986 cautioned that 
the findings should be considered preliminary because of the 
limited sample size the next survey is to cover 300 jurisdictions 
of the estimated 583000 people convicted of a felony in state 
courts in 1986 89 percent pleaded guilty 8 percent were convicted 
by a jury and 3 percent were found guilty by a judge the report 
says 
but many of the guilty pleas were for lesser offenses with 92 
percent of the larceny convictions and 90 percent of the burglary 
convictions based on guilty pleas but only 58 percent of the 
murder convictions and 68 percent of the rape convictions based on 
such pleas 
felons convicted by a jury were sentenced to an average of 159 
months in prison compared with 103 months when felons were 
convicted by a judge and 72 months for those who pleaded guilty

the number of people on earth will double in 
39 years unless birth control becomes available to everybody by the 
end of the decade according to a new study 
this is a preventable disaster said sharon l camp vice 
president of the private population crisis committee a 
washingtonbased advocacy group that released the report sunday 
we have what it would take the financial resources and the 
know how to solve the problem and to do so in our childrens 
lifetime but we have to act immediately we cannot dither away 
another decade 
there are about 53 billion people in the world a figure that 
the united nations says could rise to 14 billion before stabilizing 
in the next century the committee said todays population could 
double in 39 years and reach 27 billion by the end of the 21st 
century if present birth and death rates continued unchanged 
stopping population growth at about 9 billion to 10 billion 
people would require use of contraceptives by some 75 percent of 
couples the study estimates but to accomplish that the products 
would have to be available to everyone by the end of this century 
so the average family size could fall to about two children per 
couple early in the 21st century 
the report goes on to estimate the cost of such an effort 
105 billion per year by the year 2000 currently 32 billion is 
spent on family planning in developing countries where most 
population growth is taking place 
universal family planning is a bargain compared to the costs 
of delaying world population stabilization camp said

cambodias warring factions gathered 
today for talks on ending their 11yearold conflict the 
vietnameseinstalled government bolstered by battlefield victories 
against noncommunist guerrillas 
the three days of talks were expected to focus on a possible 
role for the united nations in reaching a settlement with little 
else on the negotiating table asian diplomatic sources said the 
meeting would be a success only if the un role were approved at 
least in principle 
a ceremonial opening was planned in the evening after the 
arrival of foreign minister roland dumas of france a cohost with 
foreign minister ali alatas of indonesia 
a 19nation peace conference in paris last summer opened with 
high hopes only to deadlock largely on the question of how power 
would be shared by the hanoibacked government of premier hun sen 
and the threemember guerrilla coalition 
hun sen has said he would allow the united nations to organize 
elections but not administer the country until polling takes place 
his government has opposed un participation in peace efforts in 
the past because the world body recognizes the guerrilla coalition 
as the legitimate government of cambodia 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 ending nearly four years 
of rule by the khmer rouge which killed hundreds of thousands of 
peopl as it tried to turn the former french colony into a radical 
agrarian commune 
the vietnamese claim to have pulled all their troops out of 
cambodia in september 
the khmer rouge is the strongest member of the guerrilla 
coalition and there are fears of a recurrence of brutal rule if its 
fighters were to topple the hun sen government 
representing the guerrilla coalition at this weeks talks are 
prince norodom ranariddh on behalf of the faction of his father 
former head of state prince norodom sihanouk khmer rouge vice 
president khieu samphan and former premier son sann head of the 
khmer peoples national liberation front 
also on hand are hun sen vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co 
thach and representatives from laos and the association of 
southeast asian nations brunei indonesia malaysia the 
philippines singapore and thailand 
as the participants gathered news reports quoted noncommunist 
guerrilla commanders as saying they suffered major battlefield 
losses at the hands of the phnom penh army they blamed a halt in 
arms supplies from china for their predicament 
china has been the main supplier of arms to the three guerrilla 
factions it was unclear whether the interruption confirmed by 
western diplomats in bangkok was due to logistics or a policy 
decision 
the guerrilla commanders said that because of their inability 
to stop a government counteroffensive in northwestern cambodia 
thousands of civilians under their control were moving closer to 
the thai border 
the soviet union has been the main supplier of weapons to 
vietnam and the cambodian government 
khieu samphan said in a statement sunday that more than 20000 
vietnamese troops had been sent back into cambodia since hanoi 
announced that all of its troops were withdrawn in september the 
vietnamese troops wore the uniforms of hun sens army he said 
khieu samphan repeated a previous demand for a complete 
withdrawal to prepare for a comprehensive solution asked if he 
thought the talks might be successful he said it would depend on 
vietnam 
vietnams government radio today quoted dumas as saying france 
is significantly expanding economic relations with vietnam largely 
isolated for a decade because of its invasion of cambodia 
dumas who was in vietnam over the weekend said in a joint 
communique that france will give 8 million to vietnam up from 
870000 last year

violeta barrios de chamorro the 
steelhaired symbol of democracy claimed victory monday over 
president daniel ortega and the leftist sandinista party that has

managua with people burning many of the thousands of sandinista 
banners that had been draped across managuas streets 
however the celebrations appeared to die down quickly and only 
a few fires were set

not since george washington led a surprise 
attack on the hessians in 1776 has there been such a stir over 
crossing the delaware river 
pennsylvania and new jersey are bickering over control of two 
toll bridges linking the states 
the dispute pennsylvania officials argue is about independence 
and sovereignty and taxation without representation and other 
principles associated with the revolutionary war 
officials with the burlington county bridge commission in new 
jersey say its all much simpler than that federal law gives them 
jurisdiction over the bridges the commission needs more money to 
repair or replace them and its fairest to get the money from the 
travelers who use them 
so at the start of the year the commission doubled the tolls to 
50 cents on the taconypalmyra and burlingtonbristol bridges 
spanning the delaware river the commission also moved ahead with 
plans to replace the 59yearold burlingtonbristol span 
the moves drew the ire of lawmakers across the river 
us sen john heinz rpa said the dispute may not dissolve 
our union but he warned the commission had better consult 
pennsylvania citizens if it plans on replacing the 
burlingtonbristol bridge 
we are a nation of many sovereign states heinz said in a 
recent speech on the senate floor although we like to think of 
ourselves as a perfect union there are times when the sovereignty 
leads to fragmentation divisiveness and threats upon the very 
notion of federalism 
the senator also said that raising the tolls amounted to 
taxation without representation 
heinz this month introduced a bill in the senate that would 
require cooperation between both states on any bridge project over 
the delaware river the senate has taken no action on it 
j garfield demarco chairman of the bridge commission did not 
return a reporters telephone calls but stephanie miller a public 
relations consultant for the bridge commission said pennsylvanians 
have been consulted about the bridges and should have nothing to 
complain about anyway 
even at 50 cents miller said the bridges were a bargain 
compared with the two other major delaware river spans where tolls 
are 90 cents 
miller said the commission is using the extra money for 
desperately needed bridge maintenance 
she said a new bridge if finally approved by various state 
agencies would likely be financed by a bond that could be repaid 
by another toll increase but she said that is at least several 
years away 
while it may be unusual for a singlestate commission to have 
such authority over interstate bridges miller said the federal 
general bridge act of 1946 left little doubt about the commissions 
right to replace the burlingtonbristol span 
with two lanes and no median strip the bridge is a real pain 
for commuters miller said you drive by a truck and you feel 
youre going to get blown over its very rickety

the big three international observers 
dashed around in motorcades through the predawn hours today racing 
from the president to a challenger who suddenly looked like an 
upset winner 
the men one sandinista adviser once called the holy trinity 
were reluctant to comment on the delicate situation 
i really dont want to characterize it at all said former 
us attorney general elliot richardson head of the 240member 
un observer mission 
early returns suggested publisher violeta barrios de chamorro 
could score a stunning upset and the question of the hour was how 
president daniel ortega and the sandinistas might take defeat after 
more than a decade in power 
youll have to ask him said former president jimmy carter 
the meeting between ortega and the umpires hed invited 
anticipating victory ended abruptly said a witness 
lets just wait for the rest of the results ortega said 
turning his back on the distinguished guests 
carter richardson and organization of american states secretary 
general joao baena soares then sped off each in his own 
motorcycleled motorcade to mrs chamorros house 
carter is telling her that she had won one of mrs 
chamorros closest advisers emilio montalban alvarez told the 
associated press 
baena soares also asked mrs chamorro not to claim victory until 
all the returns were in according to a highranking source inside 
her fragile coalition the united national opposition mrs 
chamorro apparently ignored the request claiming victory with 306 
percent of the vote counted 
lights flashing and tires squealing the three umpires returned 
to election central 
throughout the bitter campaign opposition vice presidential 
candidate virgilio godoy had said the sandinistas would cheat 
rather than lose 
but baena soares said the count one of the most closely 
monitored in history appeared clean so far no problems he 
said as he hustled into the counting center no problems 
the ballots were being counted twice once at each polling place 
and again at regional election centers the results were being 
telegraphed to the capital and compiled by the supreme electoral 
council 
international observers more than 3000 of them were present 
at hundreds of local polling places as the ballots were tallied and 
in all nine regional centers more than 175 million people had 
registered to vote in the nations 4394 polling places and the 
turnout appeared high 
key observers said the voting had been clean and peaceful 
richardson said none of the un observers had reported any 
irregularities in the voting it was essential here to convince 
skeptics that the vote could be conducted without fraud 
the sandinistas had been counting on an internationally endorsed 
victory to pave the way for improved relations with the united 
states they were not prepared for defeat 
nicaragua was the first nation ever to invite the united nations 
to monitor its election the leftist sandinista government had also 
invited the organization of american states oas former president 
carter and hundreds of smaller groups 
observers from smaller missions also said they were impressed 
with how the vote was carried out 
people were very serious about it said erin saberi of the 
southwest voter registration project she and other observers said 
they were warmly treated by voters and election officials alike 
the only observers other than party poll watchers allowed to 
watch the actual counting were from the united nations the oas and 
the carter group 
the un and the oas which deployed 430 observers have been in 
nicaragua since august monitoring virtually every step of the 
electoral process from voter registration to campaign rallies 
while none called the campaign perfect all agreed a free and fair 
election was possible 
both teams included everything from political analysts to 
statisticians to communications technicians drawn from their staffs 
and from member nations 
both teams were doing their own partial counts a statistical 
sampling of returns aimed at detecting any fraud neither planned 
to release the results 
the supreme electoral council said it had issued credentials for 
more than 3000 international observers from hundreds of groups 
which meant one official watcher for every 550 or so voters or 
about the same number of observers as contra rebel fighters 
believed to be in the country 
the oas was everywhere guatemalan lawmaker edmond mullet 
said after a daylong tour of the provinces sunday 
mullet was one of 20 observers from the washingtonbased center 
for democracy which monitored the 1986 elections in the 
philippines and the 1989 elections in panama for the us senate 
carter played a key role in panama denouncing fraud while the 
votes were being counted the discredited election in that country 
was part of the bush administrations explanation for the december 
invasion that ousted strongman manuel antonio noriega 
carters observer mission is also considered crucial because it 
includes a dozen senators and congressmen many of them members of 
key committees such as intelligence and foreign relations 
carter richardson and oas secretary general joao baena soares 
had praised the the antifraud safeguards in place for the voting 
many of which were adopted with input from the big observer 
missions

groups representing teachers probation 
officers and washingtonbased liberals are joining in a campaign to 
derail the bush administrations nominee as head of 81 million in 
juvenile justice programs 
we vehemently oppose his appointment says kenneth f 
melley the national education associations director of 
governmental relations 
the dispute centers on the nomination of robert sweet a senate 
republican policy committee staff aide to be administrator of the 
justice departments office of juvenile justice and delinquency 
prevention conservatives praise his record and say he has become 
the victim of an unreasonable attack on the part of liberals 
the agency funnels millions of dollars in federal grants 
designed to assist state and local governments in their fight 
against delinquency 
senate confirmation is required and that in turn has awakened 
memories of infighting between moderate republicans and movement 
conservatives at the education department in the reagan era 
among groups opposed besides the national education association 
are the american probation and parole association the commonwealth 
of virginia juvenile justice and delinquency prevention and 
advisory committee the american psychological association and the 
national pta 
some complain about his role in political turmoil at the 
education department seven years ago all say he lacks experience 
specified by law for confirmation as head of the juvenile justice 
agency 
perhaps the most active critic however has been people for the 
american way the washingtonbased liberal group that was prominent 
in the successful fight to block robert borks confirmation to the 
supreme court and skirmishes against an array of other conservative 
nominees 
that alone irks sweets chief defender sen gordon humphrey 
rnh 
i think clearly some of these leftwing groups are trying to 
ignite a bonfire but i dont see that its having any effect 
says humphrey i regarded their activities as an accolade in 
bobs favor 
sweet and his supporters say he received strong commendation for 
his work at the department and has experience in the education 
field if not directly in juvenile justice that meets the 
requirements of the law 
sweet 52 was involved in a painful episode in 1983 when he was 
executive director of the national council for educational research 
sweet sought to enlarge his power considerably by asserting 
control over the national institute of education the governments 
main educational research arm he based his claim on an 
interpretation of the law sharply rejected by terrel h bell who 
was secretary of education at the time 
in his memoirs the thirteenth man bell said that 
washington observers found sweets move uproariously funny 
i should have laughed too but i was too angry to do anything 
but alternately scream and smolder bell said he calls the 
affair an effort by movement conservatives to undermine his 
moderate rule at the department 
bell said he responded by demanding sweets removal the 
effort yielded quick results sweet was offered a job in the white 
house 
sweet nonetheless says he can prove that he was well regarded by 
bell when at the department secretary bell actually sent a 
personal note to me which ive kept complimenting me on how well 
id run the agency he said 
i really dont want to comment on secretary bell but i got 
along with him quite well him my tenure there he added 
sweet and humphrey scoff at the notion that he lacks requisite 
juvenile justice experience he says his background in education 
meets the requirements 
hogwash snorts melanne verveer executive vice president of 
people for the american way he was a biology teacher thats 
hardly a qualification for a job like this 
she says more expertise is needed at a time when young people 
are confronted by drugs and an array of complex other social 
problems 
some of the questions may be resolved march 1 when the senate

the widow of an astronaut killed in the 1986 
explosion of space shuttle challenger lambasted the television 
docudrama challenger saying it devastated her children 
how many kinds of death must ellison onizuka die how many 
deaths of him do my children have to overcome lorna onizuka told 
abc affiliate kitv in an interview broadcast sunday night the 
night abc aired the docudrama 
my youngest daughter said first they killed him and now 
theyre killing what i thought he was like she said how many 
times are they going to kill him mrs onizuka said in the 
telephone interview from her home near houston 
this production makes a mockery of my husbands life the man 
he truly was and the ultimate sacrifice he made for a country he 
believed in mrs onizuka said 
ellison onizuka of hawaii and six other crew members died in the 
explosion shortly after liftoff from cape canaveral fla on jan 
28 1986 
onizukas brother claude also objected to the movie 
i think it made him seem like he was an arrogant person which 
he wasnt claude onizuka said i think he was very humble he 
remembered his roots and how he got there 
claude onizuka was particularly upset with one scene that 
depicted the astronaut saying at a news conference that he would 
not mind a malfunction in space so he could put his emergency 
training to use 
he would have never said something like that claude onizuka 
said 
george englund sr the movies executive producer and writer 
defended the scene telling kitv it was taken verbatim from a news 
conference 
the docudrama also has been criticized by grace corrigan the 
mother of christa mcauliffe the new hampshire schoolteacher killed 
in the challenger disaster 
it started to upset me then i said no im not going to let 
it because it is only a video she said last week 
englund said he knew there would be mixed reactions to the film 
but defended it as sensitive in almost every aspect

smokers puffed away in airport terminals as they tried to figure 
out how to cope with a new ban on smoking on virtually all domestic 
airline flights nonsmokers breathed a bit easier 
dave noeth a traveler at la guardia airport in new york city 
said under certain circumstances he was prepared to violate the ban 
that took effect sunday 
if the plane starts to go down im lighting one up he said 
usair flight attendant kelly brown in atlanta said a colleague 
told her she had one man nearly miss his plane because he was 
just standing by the gate trying to finish his cigarette 
in seattle leo haag complained that the new law is not fair 
it doesnt bother me two or three hours flying without a 
cigarette but i dont think its treating everybody equally he 
said puffing on a cigarette in an airport terminal 
but nonsmoking travelers said air quality on sundays flights 
had improved and they were relieved not to breathe the smoke or 
have it foul their clothes 
its great said ron upham in newark he said he and his 
wife used to try to get seats far away from the smoking section 
but sometimes smelled smokers air anyway 
i feel like theyre inflicting something on me upham said 
the federal ban in force since 1988 on flights of less than two 
hours now applies to 998 percent of domestic flights only 
flights to alaska and hawaii of more than six hours are excepted 
overseas fights are not affected 
under the new law smoking is allowed on only 28 of the nations 
regularly scheduled 17000 flights every day said jeff boyer of 
the coalition on smoking or health in seattle 
passengers were told not to try smoking in airplane bathrooms 
tampering with smoke detectors in the planes restrooms is a 
federal offense punishable with a 2000 fine 
some smokers didnt resent the ban 
its probably going to add more years to my life said david 
r merkel as he waited for a flight at raleighdurham nc 
international airport but given my druthers id rather have a 
cigarette 
other smokers were unequivocal 
im going to go nuts said joseph golad of chicago resigning 
himself to a smokeless 2hour flight to dallas from ohare 
international airport 
to help passengers like golad the chicago lung association 
distributed smoker survival kits which contained sugarless 
chewing gum breath mints and tips on how to cope 
the association recommended passengers doodle to keep hands 
busy stay away from the common cigarette companions of coffee and 
alcohol and take a walk around the plane or go to sleep 
in seattle the coalition on smoking or health offered their own 
tips and gave away candy and pins that read im kissable i 
dont smoke 
a coauthor of the ban democratic sen frank lautenberg of new 
jersey a former 20year smoker said the measure was the most 
popular he had ever worked on 
its the most positive thing in terms of response that ive 
ever done he said 
lautenberg and rep richard durbin dill said they hope the 
law will be extended soon to airport terminals and train travel 
lautenberg was mugging for cameras in newark nj as joan 
dahmer arrived on a bumpy flight from dallas 
i dont think its right that we cant have a cigarette to 
calm us down dahmer complained 
but in denver frank mills an addictions therapist took the 
occasion to puff on what he said he hoped would be the last 
cigarette of an 18year habit 
i think its great mills said im ready to quit

growing discontent over austerity measures imposed to counter a 
10yearold recession

violeta barrios de chamorro publisher 
of the nations opposition newspaper led a 14party coalition to 
victory over sandinista rule despite political inexperience and a 
broken knee 
the nicaraguan people have shown that they want to live in 
democracy in peace and in freedom mrs chamorro told more than 
1000 cheering supporters at her election headquarters today 
i am very happy she said the people wanted a change 
as a girl violeta barrios wanted to learn to type and be a 
secretary when she grew up 
instead she married a man who became one of nicaraguas 
revolutionary heroes and was assassinated in 1978 as a grayhaired 
widow of 60 mrs chamorro found herself the political symbol at 
the center of an electoral storm 
mrs chamorro ran for president with gusto and a common touch 
dona violeta as she is called even by president daniel ortega 
said in in an earlier interview i am nothing 
but in this life you can learn anything she added 
an elegant woman with graceful manners mrs chamorros two main 
strengths are her martyred husband and her lack of alignment with 
any one political party 
that was enough to qualify her as a candidate for the disparate 
and fractious united national opposition a coalition of 14 parties 
known as uno 
the memory of pedro joaquin chamorro has been used by all sides 
even by mrs chamorros four children two of whom support ortega 
my fathers enemies are within uno wrote mrs chamorros 
eldest daughter claudia the phrase was used in sandinista 
campaign graffiti throughout nicaragua 
mrs chamorros late husband whose father started what is today 
nicaraguas sole opposition newspaper la prensa was shot down 
by assassins in january 1978 
the slaying believed to have been ordered by dictator anastasio 
somoza ignited the popular revolt that brought the sandinistas to 
power in july 1979 
mrs chamorro who still publishes la prensa became a member of 
the junta that took over from somoza but quit after nine months 
she has bitter memories of what she considers the sandinistas 
betrayal of her husbands democratic goals and her own faith in the 
revolution 
im not praising somozas government it was horrible but the 
threats that ive had from the sandinistas i never thought they 
would repay me in that way she said 
her pain as a widow strong religous convictions and loyalty to 
chamorros memory she pays weekly visits to his grave to leave 
fresh flowers made her a symbol of dissatisfaction with the 
sandinistas but there have been many drawbacks 
even after months of campaigning she stumbled over speeches and 
made baffling blunders last year during a trip to europe she was 
asked about unos government program 
its a secret she replied 
the sandinistas have tried to paint mrs chamorro as 
emptyheaded a progovernment newspaper runs a daily column where 
nearly every joke portrays her as slowwitted 
perhaps responding to this mrs chamorro told a rally early in 
the campaign i am not a dummy 
one of her top advisers is her eldest son pedro joaquin 
chamorro who returned from exile in miami where he had been a 
director of the usbacked contra rebels who tried to topple 
ortegas government by force 
the son feared his mother would be manipulated by vice 
presidential candidate virgilio godoy and top aide alfredo cesar 
two strongwilled politicians 
mrschamorro the eldest daughter of a landowning family was 
sent to us finishing schools to learn english 
with her fathers death in 1948 she returned to the family home 
in the southern town of rivas and married chamorro 
her political awakening came after years of being a housewife 
and mother 
on one of the various occasions chamorro was imprisoned by 
somoza mrs chamorro blew up at being kept in the dark 
there had been something political and they threw him in 
jail mrs chamorro said i asked pedro what was going on then 
i told him look lets make a deal from today on youre going 
to tell me all thats happening so i wont be caught unaware 
she has played the role of presidential candidate with gusto 
she broke her right knee in a fall dec 31 and was hampered 
during the campaign by a cast she campaigned from a wheelchair 
under a sun tent set up in the back of a pickup truck 
beaming smiles at peasants dona violeta was familiar and 
neighborly calling people papito and mamita 
i try to help to do good things for the country mrs 
chamorro said i am what i am

a day after voters in lithuania apparently voted 
the communists out of power moldavias restive citizenry cast 
ballots in their first free elections under soviet rule 
like the lithuanians to the north many ethnic moldavians are 
seeking sovereignty and hoped sundays balloting would bring 
victory to proindependence forces 
the weekend elections came amid nationwide prodemocracy rallies 
that demanded a swift end to the communist partys monopoly on 
power 
in sundays vote in moldavia a republic bordering romania the 
proautonomy moldavian popular front hoped to win at least half of 
the 380 seats in parliament from the communists 
we think part of the other deputies will come around to our 
side said yuri roshka a popular front leader and candidate 
one popular front voter 26yearold anatoly zhdanov said after 
voting we are learning democracy and we want to use the 
parliament as a peaceful way to gain our sovereignty 
others in a park in kishinev the republics capital agreed 
we want to be an independent republic not with the russians 
and not with the romanians and above all we want our 
sovereignty said anatoly goncharov listening to results of the 
lithuanian election on a radio 
the head of lithuanias sajudis popular front said sunday that 
independence from moscow might be attainable within months on 
saturday the republics voters appeared to choose the countrys 
first legislature not dominated by communists 
unofficial returns showed that of the 90 races decided 
candidates endorsed by sajudis took 72 seats and nonsajudis 
candidates took 18 said rita dapkus head of the sajudis 
information agency there are 141 seats and the rest were to be 
decided in runoffs march 10 
if that is not a landslide then what is algimantas 
cekuolis a sajudis officer told a news conference sunday in the 
republics capital vilnius it is a very clear indication of 
what the people of lithuania think 
sajudis gathered the election results by calling local election 
commissions and the tallies were believed to be reliable official 
results in lithuania were expected today as were unofficial 
returns from moldavia 
turnout among the 256 million eligible lithuanians was about 75 
percent officials said 
we have a common and very clear goal our clear goal is 
statehood and the independence of lithuania said vytautus 
landsbergis sajudis chairman this goal is achievable this 
year 
sajudis wants talks with moscow to prepare for an orderly 
secession which would break a 50yearold tie that began with 
lithuanias occupation by the red army in 1940 and its forcible 
annexation later that year 
the movement supports a neutral sovereign lithuania 
characterized by a market economy and guarantees for human and 
cultural rights 
the soviet communist party recently pledged to support 
legislation establishing a procedure by which republics could 
legally secede from the union 
although sajudis dominated saturdays voting landsbergis did 
not rule out a strong role for reformed communists in a coalition 
government selected by the new parliament he stressed the close 
ties between sajudis and reformminded communist party members 
reform communists won 22 seats on saturday 13 in districts 
where they were backed by sajudis the communist winners included 
the partys first secretary algirdas brazauskas who in december 
defied soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and led his party to 
split with moscow 
while lithuania enjoyed two decades of independence between the 
world wars moldavia a republic of 4 million people in the 
southwest corner of the soviet union has not known independence 
this century 
until the czarist empire fell apart in 1917 moldavia was the 
russian province of bessarabia after world war i it was ceded to 
romania with which it shares a nearly identical language and many 
historical and cultural heroes 
moldavias common heritage with romania was suppressed when 
stalin annexed it to the soviet union in 1940 but a halfcentury 
of soviet domination failed to diminish the desire of many of the 
estimated 3 million ethnic moldavians to reunite with their 
neighbor 
demands for unity surged in moldavia when romanias december 
revolution toppled communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
but the popular front says reunification should be put on hold 
for the moment in favor of rebuilding the republics economy and 
restoring moldavian culture stunted by decades of russification 
the popular front said it would press for the right to engage in 
direct economic relations with other countries a multiparty 
political system private property and a market economy 
parliamentary elections were also held sunday in the central 
asian republic of tadzhikistan recently rocked by ethnic unrest in 
which at least 22 people died 
reports from the capital of dushanbe monitored in london said 
voting was orderly official radio put the voter turnout at 64 
percent and attributed the low turnout to the 6 pm curfew that 
has been in effect since feb 12 to prevent more unrest 
a parliamentary vote also took place sunday in neighboring 
kirghizia a mountainous republic on the border with china 
the official tass news agency said official results in both 
elections were expected to be announced thursday

as prosecutors try to prove an inmate was not 
wrongly tried as an adult in an armed robbery a published report 
raised questions about whether he even committed the crime 
luan van hoang was 13 but claimed to be 17 and gave a fictitious 
name when he was charged in 1986 documents show the vietnamese 
refugee was convicted and sentenced to 38 years and since has been 
in a maximumsecurity prison 
last week district judge jack hampton ordered hoang returned to 
dallas for a hearing to determine his actual age he is believed to 
be 17 
luans age however no longer remains the only question about 
his conviction the dallas morning news reported sunday a 
transcript of testimony in his trial raises the issue of whether 
officials prosecuted the right person the paper said 
luan said he told authorities his name was michael nguyen and 
that he was 17 to avoid being returned to a youth detention center 
in california where he had spent eight months of a ninemonth term 
for joyriding and auto theft 
the boy said he believed vietnamese friends who told him that 
lying about his age would result in probation dallas county 
authorities accepted luans story and tried him as an adult 
in 1986 police portrayed luan as the ringleader of a youth 
gang that committed a series of armed robberies in dallas county 
luan was identified during his trial as a gunwielding robber 
but luan who did not testify in his trial and appeared with an 
interpreter said he waited outside the home of a vietnamese couple 
in carrollton a dallas suburb while they were robbed by four of 
his companions he said he did not enter the home use a gun or 
receive any of the proceeds from the robbery 
testimony in luans trial reveals several inconsistencies 
luan abandoned by his companions after the robbery was 
arrested less than an hour later at a car wash where police found 
a broken watch worth 50 and a costume jewelry pin worth 5 taken 
during the robbery a 1500 gold chain and 2000 in cash were 
among other items stolen in the robbery 
not explained in the trial the morning news said is why the 
alleged guntoting gang leader would be stranded by his 
subordinates and left with the least valuable items taken in the 
heist 
testimony showed that police were unable to find luans 
fingerprints at the robbery site the states case against luan 
hinged on the testimony of a victim who according to the police 
report was blindfolded during much of the robbery the newspaper 
reported 
prosecutors however have requested information from california 
authorities that they hope will challenge the growing number of 
records some of them sworn statements that show luan would have 
been 13 at the time of his trial 
luan was returned to dallas from the texas department of 
corrections last week after the newspaper reported that immigration 
and school records show he was born oct 10 1972 
the newspaper since has obtained two sworn court documents from 
california prosecutors and one from another immigrant who escaped 
with luan from vietnam in 1980 showing that luan would have been 
13 at the time of his conviction in dallas

rival christian forces skirmished in east 
beirut today while a mediation committee said it was determined to 
maintain its effort to stabilize a ceasefire despite persistent 
violations 
police said two people were killed and six wounded by sniper 
fire in various districts of embattled east beirut controlled by 
samir geageas lebanese forces militia and renegade gen michel 
aouns troops 
by police count the showdown for dominance of the 
310squaremile christian enclave has killed 693 people and wounded 
1921 since it broke out jan 30 
father boulos naaman a member of the threeman christian 
mediation committee said in an interview on geageas lebanese 
broadcasting corp television that his panel will not get fed up 
despite the difficulties we are facing 
the two sides began observing a ceasefire feb 17 after 
fighting each other to a standstill however they have been 
reinforcing their forces in east beirut and other districts of the 
christian enclave in apparent preparation for more clashes 
the mediation committee which called the ceasefire has been 
trying for three days to reopen roads linking areas controlled by 
the 6000member militia and aouns 19000strong army in an 
effort to buttress the truce and ease the plight of the population 
but a threehour shelling duel sunday prevented the committee 
from reopening a major road junction in east beirut 
in a related development the leftist newspaper assafir said an 
unnamed representative of syrianbacked president elias hrawi met 
geagea in east beirut and obtained from him a written pledge to 
accept bringing east beirut under government control if hrawis 
government intervened to stop the intrachristian showdown 
the report could not be immediately verified with the lebanese 
forces command 
hrawi was elected nov 24 in line with an arabbrokered peace 
accord to end lebanons nearly 15 years of civil war aoun has 
rejected hrawis election along with the peace plan which was 
worked out by lebanese legislators at the saudi town of taif last 
october 
he objects to the pact because it does not provide an explicit 
timetable for a full withdrawal of syrias 40000 troops from 
lebanon they have been in the country since 1976 under an arab 
league peacekeeping mandate 
aoun geagea and hrawi are maronite catholics the christian 
sect that has dominated political institutions in lebanon since 
independence from france in 1943 
also today two leading newspapers published letters addressed 
to american journalist terry anderson from his sister expressing 
hope that he and the other foreign hostages held in lebanon will be 
released soon 
you are all sent strength and love and hope do not despair 
for some day soon please god we will all be reunited peggy 
say said in her letter to her brother and all other hostages held 
in lebanon 
an arabic translation of the letter was published on the front 
page of the independent annahar and on an inside page in the 
leftist assafir 
a second message was signed by bill foley a friend of 
andersons in the name of the journalists committee to free terry 
anderson 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was kidnapped march 16 1985 in moslem west beirut he is 
the longest held of the 18 western captives in lebanon

a city proposal to tax research grants has 
angered college officials who say it would be unprecedented and 
could undermine the regions economic development 
ive never heard such a thing in pittsburgh the state or the 
country said louis popper chief general counsel at the 
university of pittsburgh frankly id be surprised if anybody 
ever has 
under the citys proposal research grants would be subject to a 
six mill business privilege tax a mill is a tenth of a cent 
if such a tax had been in effect last year it would have 
generated as much as 16 million 
the citys finance director ben hayllar said there are no 
immediate plans to impose such a tax but he said weve talked 
about it and will look at it 
thats enough to worry officials at both pitt and carnegie 
mellon university which both receive millions in research grants 
especially in medicine and computer science 
we are legally tax exempt and i would vigorously oppose any 
effort to cheat on that said carnegie mellon university 
president richard m cyert this kind of research is the key to 
economic development not only here but nationally 
the idea is taking a back seat to an effort to remove 
universityowned buildings from the citys list of taxexempt real 
estate but the taxing of grants could come up for serious 
discussion later in the year officials said 
pitt received about 143 million in grants in fiscal 1989 113 
million from federal state or local governments if all that were 
subject to tax the college would owe 859200 if only the private 
contributions were taxed the amount would be 111600 
carnegie mellon received a total of nearly 121 million in 
research grants during the same period including 19 million in 
private contributions its tax would be 724200 on everything 
113400 on private contributions alone

parliament confirmed ingvar carlsson as 
prime minister of a new social democratic government today 12 days 
after he resigned when his economic austerity policy was defeated 
the vote of 175101 with 59 abstentions came after carlsson 
revamped his proposals to rescue sweden from inflation climbing 
toward 9 percent amid stagnant growth fourteen legislators were 
absent from the 349member riksdag 
the new cabinet will be presented and installed on tuesday 
the vote ended the worst political crisis for the social 
democrats since they returned to power in 1982 after a sixyear 
hiatus the only time they had sat in opposition since 1932 
carlssons cabinet resigned feb 14 when the legislature 
rejected his emergency economic program he was asked to form a new 
government thursday after the centrist opposition parties failed to 
unite on a common policy 
the social democrats who control 156 seats won support from 
the 21member communist party when carlsson dropped a proposal to 
impose a twoyear freeze on wages and prices and to ban strikes 
the new 17point package would bnring in foreign workers from 
the soviet baltic states to alleviate an inflationboosting labor 
shortage and increase taxes on alcohol and tobacco 
two centerright opposition parties condemned what they called 
carlssons sham resignation and said they favored immediate 
elections 18 months ahead of schedule 
the government crisis looks like a piece of absurd theater in 
which many have been forced to play along said bengt westerberg 
leader of the liberal party 
carl bildt head of the conservative moderate party said we 
say no to the prime minister being allowed to return as if 
nothing had happened 
the opposition was given a chance last week to assemble a ruling 
coalition but the three nonsocialist parties failed to patch 
differences on economic and energy policy or overcome the socialist 
majority held by the social democrats and communists

east germany today began accepting 
applications for unemployment benefits for the first time in the 
communist nations 40year history 
also today an opposition party leveled new accusations of fraud 
against the communist leadership 
unofficial estimates contend that 70000 east germans are 
unemployed but labor ministry spokesman joachim guenter said the 
number of applicants was far lower than had been expected 
authorities speculated about 4000 people would seek the new 
insurance 
while the number of unemployed is relatively low among east 
germanys 9 million workers the figure is expected to shoot up to 
as much as 15 percent after competitive western practices are 
introduced 
west germany has offered an economic bailout of east germany in 
return for a wholesale conversion to capitalism and eventual unity 
in the latest accusations against the embattled communists a 
littleknown political group the independent peoples party filed 
a complaint in the nations high court alleging communist party 
leader gregor gysi manipulated financial records for 1989 east 
germanys adn news agency reported 
the communists previously controlled most of the nations 
wealth and numerous accusations have been made against the former 
party leadership for allegedly skimming funds for personal use or 
misstating the partys wealth to avoid having to turn over assets 
gysi took over the party leadership in december and declared it 
a reformed organization free of corruption 
the complaint seeks to have gysi jailed pending investigation 
no immediate action was taken by judicial authorities on the 
peoples party appeal 
there also was no immediate reaction from the communist party 
on sunday east german premier hans modrow gave the communists a 
last chance for political survival by agreeing to lead his party in 
march 18 elections the reformist premier made the announcement at 
a political rally 
although modrow remains the most popular politician in east 
germany the communists are expected to poorly in the balloting 
because their forerunners are blamed for leading the nation to the 
brink of collapse 
modrows decision to stand by the party could draw enough voter 
support for a parliamentary presence

the texas primary isnt until march 13 but 
balloting has begun under the states new no excuse absentee 
voting system which politicians say has made big changes in the 
way they campaign 
this is the first governors race under the 1987 extended voting 
law which lets texans cast ballots during a period that began 
wednesday and ends march 9 
before 1987 absentee voting was allowed for about 10 days and 
voters needed a valid excuse to cast an absentee ballot a trip 
out of their home county for instance now voters just have to 
show up at select polling places such as county courthouses and 
cast their ballots 
in the 1988 presidential primaries ballots cast before election 
day more than doubled compared with the 1984 primary results 
showed 
george bayoud texas secretary of state said the new law gives 
voters no excuse not to vote in the primary 
those old excuses about being turned off by having to stand in 
long lines or having to take off work on a weekday are no longer 
valid he said 
bayoud planned to vote absentee and make several public 
appearances to tout the new law 
his spokesman mark toohey said this will be a bellwether 
this will be a good test to see how many people this attracts to 
the polls 
the relaxed requirements pose new challenges for candidates 
said diane sheridan president of the league of women voters 
the extended absentee voting creates a need for extended 
information ms sheridan said 
ed martin executive director of the texas democratic party 
agreed saying candidates must have television ads going and 
mailouts arriving each day of the absentee voting period or they 
stand to lose a certain number of voters 
most of the gubernatorial candidates have developed strategies 
aimed at absentee voters republican rancher and oil man clayton 
williams notified 100000 potential supporters of absentee voting 
locations and times 
it will be too little too late for candidates who dont 
have successful absentee voting programs said williams state 
cochairman roy barrera jr 
the new law means more campaign spending in a state with 17 
million people and 21 television markets the seven major gop and 
democratic candidates already have spent 20 million and analysts 
say the final tab could reach 50 million 
it forces the candidates to stretch out their media dollars 
and not just concentrate at the end of the campaign said 
political consultant george christian of austin 
christian said probably 40 percent of the primary voters will 
cast absentee ballots there are approximately 82 million voters 
registered for the primary election 
democratic and republican party officials say they will lead 
absentee voting drives during the november general election 
campaign but are letting the candidates handle the effort for the 
primaries 
although absentee voting was not reported separately until last 
year election officials have tracked absentee voting patterns in 
major cities and believe the extended noexcuse law has boosted 
voter turnout in other races 
for example in san antonio 8218 walkin absentee ballots were 
cast in the 1984 presidential primary after the new law was 
implemented 41262 people voted absentee in the 1988 presidential 
primary 
in houston absentee votes increased from 4683 in the 1984 
presidential primary to 7082 in 1988 absentee voting also jumped 
in dallas from 1492 to 9571 in the two presidential primaries 
and in fort worth from 3099 to 8822 
but christian said there is no proof the law has increased 
overall turnout just that a larger portion of the voters have cast 
early ballots

a colombianamerican group organized a 1000car 
caravan that rolled through john f kennedy international airport 
to protest the circumstances surrounding the crash of avianca 
flight 52 
the group colombianos unidos de america called sunday for the 
release of all the facts about the flight which apparently ran out 
of fuel before crashing on new yorks long island killing 73 
people 
demonstrators charged that air traffic controllers had displayed 
bias against the flight because it was colombian making it circle 
the airport when it was low on fuel 
theres obvious discrimination against all flights from 
colombia fernando oliver who said he was a lawyer for survivors 
of two crash victims told the new york times he added that the 
plane had not been allowed to land at another airport because 
drugsniffing dogs were already in place at kennedy 
thats not the case at all said kathleen bergen a 
spokeswoman for the federal aviation administration the plane 
made an approach to kennedy and missed and it was coming around to 
make a second approach i think that speaks for itself 
sgt pete berry a police spokesman said the protest caravan 
started at shea stadium at about 1130 am and proceeded to the 
airport which is about five miles away berry said the caravan was 
orderly and created no traffic problems 
the first 73 cars displayed the names of the crash victims 
others carried placards and cards criticizing the air controllers 
flight 52 crashed jan 25 in cove neck an affluent suburb on 
long island sound the crash is under investigation by the national

into an environmentally sensitive marsh coating at least three 
birds with oil

covered with oil not members of endangered species were taken to 
be cleaned said gary gorman director of the huntington beach 
wetlands conservancy 
there is a minor threat there gorman said the conservancy

the supreme court today refused to force the 
cia to release its documents on the 1985 sinking by french 
government agents of the greenpeace ship rainbow warrior 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that the spy 
agency may withhold the documents from a houston lawyer who is 
seeking them under the freedom of information act foia 
greenpeace an international environmental group had been 
preparing to monitor and protest a scheduled french nuclear weapons 
test when its vessel exploded and sank in the auckland new 
zealand harbor july 10 1985 
the french government two months later admitted that two of its 
intelligence agents acting on orders from senior officials had 
attached explosive devices to the ships hull 
houston lawyer john r knight asked the central intelligence 
agency in october 1985 for all documents in its possession dealing 
with the rainbow warrior sinking his request was based on the 
foia enacted in 1966 to curtail government secrecy 
the cia refused to disclose any documents and knight then filed 
an foia lawsuit 
in resisting disclosure cia officials said the documents knight 
sought are matters that are specifically exempt from 
disclosure by statute enpowering the cia director to protect 
intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure 
us district judge gabrielle k mcdonald ruled for the cia and 
her ruling was upheld by the 5th us circuit court of appeals last 
may 
the appeals court relied heavily on a 1985 supreme court 
decision that gave the cia unlimited power to conceal from the 
public not only the identities of secret agents but also all 
sources of intelligence information classified and unclassified 
given the supreme courts broad holding in 1985 we conclude 
that the cia must prevail here the appeals court said the 
documents are exempt from foia disclosure this is so because the 
director of central intelligence determined with full authority to 
do so that the release of the documents could compromise 
intelligence sources and methods 
the 5th circuit court added in the absence of bad faith or 
some other compelling showing that he has abused his broad 
discretion his determination may not be secondguessed by the 
courts 
the case is knight vs us central intelligence agency 89878

a california businessman sentenced to 15 years 
in prison and fined 66 million for selling two airplanes to libya 
lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment let stand edward elkins conviction 
and sentence for conspiracy and violating us export restrictions 
elkins who owned a santa maria calif company that made 
armored products was convicted in a 1987 federal trial in georgia 
of selling the planes for 87 million to a west german company 
owned by libyans elkins made a 7 million profit on the sales 
prosecutors said elkins first tried unsuccessfully to get state 
department approval to sell a lockheed military transport plane to 
a libyan dealer 
after that failed prosecutors said elkins succeeded in getting 
an export license from the commerce department for two other 
lockheed planes both l10030s 
the government said the libyans were told the l10030 planes 
could be modfied to permit midair refueling so they would be 
suitable for military use 
elkins never informed lockheed or commerce department officials 
that the planes were to be modified prosecutors said prosecutors 
said he also told the federal agency the planes were destined for 
the tiny nation of benin 
investigators said one plane eventually was found in cairo 
egypt with an operations manual indicating it had been used by the 
libyan air force 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals last september upheld 
elkins conviction and sentence 
the appeals court rejected arguments that elkins was convicted 
improperly under a federal antifraud law the appeals court also 
upheld instructions the trial judge gave the jury to break a 
deadlock and it ruled that elkins sentence was not excessive 
the case is elkins vs us 891206

clashes in southeastern natal 
province left at least 13 people dead authorities said today 
despite a plea by nelson mandela for warring black factions to 
throw their weapons into the sea 
mandela in a speech sunday in durban to about 100000 people 
said the black factional fighting in natal hindered the battle 
against apartheid south africas policy of racial segregation 
my message to those of you involved in this battle of brother 
against brother is this take your guns your knives and your 
pangas and throw them into the sea mandela said pangas are 
similar to machetes police say the violence has claimed about 
3000 lives over the past four years 
police with shotguns killed two protesters and wounded four more 
today when they fired on a crowd attacking a community center in a 
black township near the central town of kroonstad police said 
two policemen were fatally shot near pietermaritzburg in natal 
province late sunday and two other officers died in separate 
attacks nearby police said 
three men died and two were injured in clashes sunday in natal 
between rival factions police said warring groups burned houses 
and huts in two areas of natal during the fighting they said 
the main combatants in natal are the african national 
congressaligned united democratic front and inkatha a relatively 
conservative zulu political group headed by mangosuthu buthelezi 
the zulu leader is a staunch oppenent of apartheid but he 
differs with the anc over the best way to fight it 
the anc favors sanctions boycotts strikes and guerrilla 
attacks to put pressure on the government buthelezi does not 
endorse any of these actions and is a proponent of capitalism in 
contrast to the socialistoriented anc 
in the black homeland of venda two people where killed when 
police dispersed a rally saturday in honor of mandela the 
independent south african press association said in a report that 
quoted a witness 
also police said two men were burned to death in soweto 
outside johannesburg the men had car tires placed around their 
necks and set alight a form of attack known as the necklace 
police said they did not know the motive for the killings 
in cape town police arrested 25 people demonstrating outside 
parliament in support of relatives at the nearby robben island 
prison jailed for politically motivated acts police declared the 
protest illegal and forced the demonstrators mostly women into 
vans 
the antiapartheid mass democratic movement said 343 men were 
participating in a hunger strike at the prison the prisons service 
said only that a number of inmates were not eating 
the hunger strikers consider themselves political prisoners who 
should be freed under reforms initiated by president fw de klerk 
the mass democratic movement said 
de klerk has said his government will release people convicted 
of belonging to previously outlawed groups that he legalized feb 
2 however the government has refused to free activists convicted 
of violent crimes 
de klerk legalized the african national congress and other black 
opposition groups and released mandela in a bid to start talks on 
ending whiteminority rule and sharing power with blacks 
mandela today resumed his busy schedule of meetings at his 
soweto home 
he held talks with helen suzman an antiapartheid politician 
who retired last year after 36 years in parliament and gavin 
relly chief executive of anglo american the worlds largest gold 
mining firm 
mandela who favors state control of the mines said afterward 
nationalization of the mines is the policy of the anc and it is 
a step which is perfectly logical 
relly told reporters he did not discuss nationalization with 
mandela but said such a policy was not practical to make modern 
economies work 
he leaves tuesday for the ancs exile headquarters in zamiba 
his first stop on an 18day fournation tour

for a decade nicaragua has been a troublesome 
hotpoint for a succession of three american presidents now with 
the stunning election outcome in nicaragua the region is being 
framed as an overnight success for democracy 
in fact no matter who had won in nicaragua sundays balloting 
would have struck a key blow for democracy thats what president 
bush had in mind sunday when he held out an olive branch to the 
winner so long as it was a fair and free election 
and bush was quick this morning to signal that the us 
challenge to nicaragua was about to end morning news of the 
election of violetto chamarro and the defeat of daniel ortega and 
his sandinista regime spread through washington like welcome 
wildfire 
in this year of remarkable political change said secretary 
of state james baker iii freedom i think its fair to say won 
another victory yesterday in nicaragua the white house said it 
was considering an end to economic sanctions that helped dampen the 
nicaraguan economy the sanctions along with military and 
political efforts by the united states bedeviled the sandinista 
government in its effort to establish popular support 
central america looked far less promising for the administration 
just 10 weeks ago panama was still under the rule of gen manuel 
antonio noriega and there were widespread predictions that the 
sandinista government would either win an outright majority in 
nicaragua or might steal sundays election rather than accept 
defeat 
the us military ouster of noriega was achieved at a far lower 
cost to the administration than many had predicted and in 
nicaragua an outcome that few had anticipated a victory by 
chamorro and a promise by president ortega to honor it actually 
has come to pass 
ortega may have lost the election but he proved many in 
washington wrong on several counts during the 1980s he was 
widely perceived here as an antidemocrat intent on touching off a 
regionwide revolution that could extend up to the texas border 
instead he oversaw a fair campaign and a free election the first 
in nicaraguas history and has said hell abide by the will of the 
voters 
secretary of state james baker iii commended ortega in the same 
breath as his praise for mrs chamarro though he was quick to 
provide a pointed reminder that the international community will 
insist that the decision of the nicaraguan people be respected and 
that full civil and military power be transferred to the newly 
elected government 
central america is still on the administrations agenda the 
most serious unresolved problem is the continuing war in el 
salvador but the sandinista defeat is bound to have a demoralizing 
effect on the leftist fmln rebels who are now more isolated than 
at any time since they were formed a decade ago 
beyond that if administration allegations about sandinista arms 
shipments to the fmln are true mrs chamorros victory would 
appear to add to the insurgencys problems since they will no 
longer have nicaraguan support 
all this has the eventual potential of returning central america 
to the relative obscurity the region experienced for the first 
century and a half of its independence 
it was an area to which the united states used to pay almost no 
attention former secretary of state george p shultz said one of 
his predecessors told him he doubted that he spent more than three 
minutes on that issue during his entire time in office 
with the sandinista triumph of 1979 followed in short order by 
the election of a us president ronald reagan with a well 
known aversion for leftists central america suddenly was a big 
item on washingtons agenda 
it proved to be one of the most divisive issues of the reagan 
presidency but now it appears those titanic confrontations with the 
congress over aid to the contra rebels are now history 
the one immediate concern of the administration is the 
disposition of the 70000 member sandinista army a force whose 
loyalty lies with the sandinista front and not to the nicaraguan 
state 
that could create a situation common elsewhere in latin america 
a military establishment which acts as an independent force 
beyond the reach of the elected authorities 
globally sundays election constitutes for leftist forces yet 
another in a series of setbacks that began last year in eastern 
europe a decade ago in this hemisphere the left was in power in 
cuba nicaragua grenada and suriname now only cuba is left

over the states system of reimbursements for medicaid services 
under the social security act 
us district judge sylvia rambo in 1988 ruled that the 
pennsylvania reimbursement system violated federal law and ordered 
the state to develop a new system 
she also ordered the state to pay 500000 in lawyer fees 
incurred by the hospital including 104000 for expert witnesses 
who testified about deficiencies in the payment system for 
outofstate hospitals 
the philadelphiabased 3rd us court of appeals last sept 5 
set aside that portion of the award representing most of the 
reimbursement for expertwitness fees 
the appeals court said congress in passing the law providing 
lawyerfee awards did not intend to allow reimbursements for 
expertwitness fees 
other federal appeals courts have ruled that congress did intend 
to include reimbursement for such fees 
the 3rd circuit court noted that federal court rules provide for 
the losing side in some cases to pay up to 30 a day for expert 
witnesses employed by the winning side 
the appeals court said the wvu hospital could not be awarded 
more than that daily 30 
in the hospitals appeal acted on today its lawyers relied 
heavily on a supreme court decision last year that said lawyerfee 
awards could take the work of paralegals into account 
just as paralegals assist in the preparation of an attorneys 
work product experts educate counsel and preclude the need for the 
attorney to educate himself which would obviously require more 
time and run up an attorneys fees even more the appeal said 
the case is west virginia university hospitals inc vs casey

twelve tugboats raced against 
time today to shepherd the burning usflagged tanker surf city 
out of the persian gulf to the indian ocean shipping executives 
said 
the move was ordered because of fears the tanker could explode 
off the coast of the united arab emirates and set nearby offshore 
oil terminals ablaze or could sink clogging the vital gulf 
shipping channel 
flames intensified over the weekend when more of the volatile 
cargo of naphta and diesel fuel began spilling into parts of the 
81823ton tanker that were ablaze following an explosion thursday 
the tugboats are blanketing it with foam and water as it 
moves and the southtonorth wind is also helping cool the 
tanker a gulfbased shipping executive said on condition of 
anonymity 
he estimated the tanker would need at least 10 hours to go 
through the strait of hormuz and into the open sea where any 
threat to installations on shore would be eliminated 
an internal explosion thursday aboard the surf city a 
kuwaitiowned tanker flying the us flag set the ship alight and 
killed two of its 25 american crewmen the cause of the explosion 
has not been determined 
the us navy missile frigate uss simpson rescued 23 crewmen 
from lifeboats and 22 were flown from dubai to the united states 
over the weekend one earl washington 41 of louisiana remained 
in a dubai hospital for treatment of firstdegree burns 
the american warships kept a watchful eye on the vessel 
under tow and radioing warnings to other shipping to steer four 
miles clear the shipping executives said 
it was unclear why the cargo tanks 70 percent of which were 
reported late saturday to be still intact had begun leaking and 
feeding the fire later 
unfortunately the fire on board the surf city has 
continued and somewhat intensified said a statement issued by 
the chesapeake shipping inc the company that operates surf city 
and other kuwaiti tankers reflagged in the united states 
the surf city is one of 11 tankers that kuwait reregistered at 
the height of the iraqiran war to entitle them to us navy 
protection

poor weather forced the launch of 
shuttle atlantis secret military mission to be scrubbed today for 
the fifth time the most delays since the doomed challenger 
nasa set the next attempt for early wednesday 
peekaboo clouds and erratic winds tantalized nasa with possible 
launch opportunities for almost two hours early today and officials 
kept atlantis and its fiveman crew poised and ready for any 
momentary break in the weather 
but the break never came at 232 am launch director robert 
sieck abandoned the launch attempt and announced nasa would not try 
again until early wednesday 
experts saw little chance that launch weather would improve 
later in the week 
were just in kind of a stalemate because of the weather 
said tom strange an air force weather forecaster he said there 
was only a 20 percent chance of favorable weather on wednesday and 
a 40 percent chance on thursday 
winds and clouds early today were on the very edge of acceptable 
limits and nasa extended a pause in the launch countdown in hopes 
that the weather would improve eventually the winds calmed enough 
for launch but a cloud cover hung on stubbornly and sieck decided 
to give up 
nasa spokesman kyle herring said exhaustion among the 
astronauts launchpad technicians and engineers played a role in 
the decision to delay the next launch attempt until early wednesday 
we just want to give the crews a rest herring said 
atlantis commander navy capt john o creighton said in a 
statement today that the crew was disappointed but we are 
convinced that the launch team and the mission management team made 
the correct decision we are looking forward to the next 
opportunity 
creighton and two of his crew members air force col john h 
casper the pilot and marine lt col david c hilmers planned to 
fly back to the astronaut training base in houston later today to 
practice in a shuttle simulator 
the shuttle mission originally was scheduled to begin last 
thursday two launch attempts were abandoned after creighton 
developed a sore throat and head congestion an attempt early 
saturday was blocked by unacceptable weather conditions 
early sunday with clear skies and ideal weather nasa counted 
down to within 31 seconds of launch and then had to call it off 
when a computer broke down 
this mission has been postponed more times than any shuttle 
flight since challenger which had seven delays and then blew up 
shortly after liftoff on its eighth try on jan 28 1986 all seven 
crew members died 
atlantis flight is a classified military mission as a result 
the precise launch time and length of the flight are secret 
however sources said the spacecraft is to be launched just 
before 1 am est on wednesday is to fly about 4 days and will 
land at edwards air force base in california 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be named said 
atlantis cargo is a 500 million spy satellite capable of taking 
highresolution reconnaissance photos and listening in on 
electronics communications all over the world atlantis is to 
deploy the satellite in an orbit that will carry the craft over 
more of the soviet union than any satellite previously launched by 
a shuttle 
the other crew members are mission specialists air force col 
richard mullane and navy lt cmdr pierre j thuot 
the atlantis flight is to be the 34th shuttle mission the sixth 
classified military flight and the fourth afterdark shuttle 
launch

the supreme court today left intact the us 
militarys general ban on homosexuals serving in the army and navy 
the court without comment rejected appeals by a woman denied 
reenlistment in the army reserve in wisconsin because she is a 
lesbian and a california man released from navy active duty because 
he is gay 
the action today was not a ruling on the legality of the 
military ban but simply a summary rejection of the appeals the 
justices did not preclude the possibility that in some future case 
they will agree to review the policy toward homosexuals 
in other actions the supreme court 
said it will decide whether a federal law that requires some 
losers of lawsuits to pay the winners lawyer fees also covers fees 
for expert witnesses 
refused to force the cia to release its documents on the 1985 
sinking of the greenpeace ship rainbow warrior by french government 
agents the justices let stand rulings that the spy agency may 
withhold the documents from a houston lawyer who is seeking them 
under the freedom of information act 
let stand the 15year prison sentence and 66 million fine of 
a california businessman convicted of conspiracy and violating us 
export restrictions by selling two airplanes to libya 
army reserve sgt miriam benshalom 41 is stationed in 
milwaukee and has been allowed to remain in the military pending 
the outcome of her appeal on the homosexuality issue 
ms benshalom joined the army reserve in 1974 and was 
discharged in 1976 because she is an acknowledged lesbian the army 
policy at the time barred anyone who evidenced homosexual 
tendencies desire or interest even though never having engaged 
in any overt homosexual acts 
a federal judge ordered ms benshalom reinstated and she 
served out an enlistment that ended in august 1988 
she then was prohibited from reenlisting under an amended army 
regulation 
the new policy says homosexuality is incompatible with 
military service and bars persons who engage in homosexual 
conduct or who by their statements demonstrate a propensity to 
engage in homosexual conduct 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals last august upheld the 
revised policy 
the appeals court although acknowledging there never has been 
any complaint about ms benshaloms performance of her military 
duties said the army has acted to protect morale discipline and 
the effectiveness of our fighting forces 
judges should not put the armys interests at risk by imposing 
change with possible consequences we cannot safely evaluate 
the appeals court said 
james m woodward of spring valley calif challenged the 
navys general ban on homosexuals 
he enlisted in 1972 for a sixyear hitch in the naval flight 
officer candidate program 
he was allowed to enter the naval reserve program even though he 
had answered yes to a questionnaire that asked whether he was 
sexually attracted to men or desired sex with men woodward 
answered no to a question whether he had ever engaged in 
homosexual conduct 
he completed flight school training and was commissioned as an 
ensign in the naval reserve 
woodward was serving in an air squadron stationed in the 
philippines when in 1974 he was seen in the subic bay officers 
club sitting with a sailor who was to be discharged for homosexual 
conduct 
the navy generally bars homosexuals but has retained some 
when questioned by his commanding officer woodward acknowledged 
his homosexual tendencies after woodward refused to resign the 
commanding officer recommended to the chief of naval personnel that 
woodward be discharged 
in a letter to that official woodward said for the good of 
both the navy and myself i respectfully request the chance to 
contribute to the defense of the united states as an honest open 
gay officer 
the navy did not discharge woodward but released him from active 
duty and assigned him to the naval air reserve staff in san diego 
he served there until 1978 when he was discharged after completing 
his sixyear military obligation 
woodward sued in 1976 alleging that he had been unlawfully 
separated from active duty the suit sought back pay and 
reinstatement 
the us claims court dismissed woodwards suit and the us 
court of appeals for the federal circuit upheld the dismissal last 
march 29 
woodward was not discharged for homosexuality rather he was 
considered for reassignment but because of his mediocre record as 
an officer and his homosexuality he was ultimately released from 
active duty the appeals court said 
bush administration lawyers urged the high court to reject the 
appeals by woodward and ms benshalom 
the cases are woodward vs us 89344 and benshalom vs 
marsh 89876

the human rights situation in romania has improved 
markedly since the revolution that toppled nicolae ceausescu but 
fear suspicion and distrust linger on according to a un report 
released today 
the report mentioned death threats against politicians and wide 
concern that the securitate ceausescus repressive secret police 
may be still active although the new leadership says it has been 
disbanded 
it also said the problem of ethnic minorities in romania will 
require close examination and adequate measures and that the 
launching and distribution of printed media is not yet fully 
assured 
the report was compiled by swiss jurist joseph voyame under a 
1988 mandate from the 43nation un human rights commission 
voyame spent five days in romania earlier this month on an 
invitation from the new leadership 
he was barred from romania while ceausescu held power and a 
first report based on sources outside romania was dated dec 18 
shortly before the dictator was deposed and later executed 
his frenchlanguage update prepared for the un commissions 
current session said human rights in romania have not yet been 
fully restored but that the situation has considerably 
improved it stated however the climate of suspicion and 
fear that prevailed under ceausescu was likely to vanish only 
gradually 
in the meantime the manipulation of public opinion remains to 
be feared the report said 
voyame cited testimony that a member of the national peasants 
party was slain in the town of bacau and that there were several 
cases of violent death among members of the hungarian minority 
in the report voyame said he was also informed that a critic of 
the national salvation front the new leadership was killed in a 
car accident under circumstances that are still unclear 
in addition to these signs of physical violence certain 
measures of psychological intimidation are said to continue he 
said numerous persons have informed the special investigator of 
death threats against themselves against members of their 
families or against people they know 
voyame said witnesses from nonofficial circles criticized the 
fact that there is no precise information on how the problem of the 
securitate has been resolved

the supreme court today agreed to hear an 
appeal by the mother of a seaman stabbed to death aboard a ship in 
what was described as a vicious attack by another crew member 
the court said it will use the case from new orleans to consider 
increasing the damages ship owners and possibly unions may be 
forced to pay to parents and other heirs of slain sailors 
the issues are whether the heirs are entitled to damages for the 
dead seamans lost future wages and compensation for parents 
loss of society 
the case stems from an incident aboard the archon during its 
maiden voyage while the ship was docked in washington state on july 
18 1984 
the victim ludwick torregano 24 a stewards assistant was 
stabbed or cut at least 62 times by fellow crew member clifford 
melrose 
melrose later was convicted of seconddegree murder in clark 
county wash 
torreganos mother mercedel miles sued the ship owners and 
operators in federal court in new orleans 
ms miles administrator of her sons estate was awarded 
140000 for the pain and suffering torregano endured before his 
death and 7800 for the loss of her sons support 
but the jury refused to order additional damages for the loss of 
torreganos future income or for loss of society by either ms 
miles or the seamans father joseph o torregano 
loss of society is defined as a broad range of mutual benefits 
family members receive from each other including love affection 
care attention companionship comfort and protection 
the 5th us supreme court of appeals last september upheld the 
damages awarded by the jury 
the appeals court also ruled that under maritime law the archon 
was unseaworthy because melrose was among its crew 
the savagery of melroses attack itself leads us to conclude 
that melrose has an especially dangerous disposition the appeals 
court said melrose failed to measure up to the standard of his 
calling and rendered the vessel unseaworthy 
that opened the way for increased damages against the archons 
owners and operators but the appeals court then said that 
torreganos parents are not entitled to compensation for loss of 
his future wages or for their loss of their sons society 
only dependents are entitled to be compensated for loss of 
society when a seaman dies the appeals court said 
the number of plaintiffs who could allege a loss of love and 
affection as a result of the death of a dearly beloved seaman 
aunts and uncles nieces and nephews even friends and lovers 
necessitates that we draw a line between those who may recover for 
loss of society and those who may not the appeals court said 
the appeals court also ruled that the seafarers international 
union may be sued by the ship owners and operators for its role in 
permitting melrose to be hired as a member of the archon crew 
that means the union eventually could be forced to help pay any 
compensation awarded ms miles 
the case is miles vs apex marine 891158

twentytwo soviet tanks left 
this northern moravian city today beginning the red armys 
withdrawal from czechoslovakia nearly 22 years after moscow sent 
troops to crush prague spring reforms 
few people came to wave goodbye and those who did showed little 
emotion 
a brass band struck up the internationale the communist 
anthem during a brief ceremony inside the soviet base at frenstat 
that kicked off the first complete withdrawal of soviet troops from 
any of moscows allies 
the soviet troops entered czechoslovakia with a warsaw pact 
invasion that smashed the 1968 reforms but in november 1989 a 
peaceful revolution toppled the hardline communists and the new 
government immediately began talks on withdrawing all red army 
troops 
to czechoslovaks the soviet troops meant empty shelves in 
stores polluted water an occasional fight in the pub and a 
reminder that we are not a free country said karel micek a 
spokesman for the civic forum movement 
withdrawal of the 73500 soviet troops stationed on czechoslovak 
territory is to be completed by the end of next year 
the withdrawal from frenstat pod radhostem 110 miles southeast 
of prague was accompanied by a parallel pullout from krnov on the 
czechoslovakpolish border 150 miles east of the czechoslovak 
capital they are to be completed by march 13 and march 25 
respectively 
this is our new peace policy in practice a retreat from 
the policy of confrontation gen vladimir malyshkievich deputy 
chief of the soviet contingent in czechoslovakia said during the 
ceremony 
it is only proper this process starts in the center of europe 
and on the day of the official visit of president vaclav havel in 
the soviet union he said 
havel flew to moscow today for two days of talks with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev just three days after returning 
from the united states where he met with president bush havel and 
gorbachev are expected to sign the agreement on troop withdrawals 
concluded in prague on feb 22 
the accord provides for a soviet pullout in three stages with a 
decisive part of the contingent leaving the country by the end 
of may the first free elections in czechoslovakia since the 
communists consolidated power in 1948 are due in june 
czechoslovakia originally demanded the withdrawal by the end of 
199o but the soviets citing administrative problems requested 
the deadline be extended until the end of 1991 
the first of the t62 tanks left frenstat by train in the 
afternoon en route to the soviet border 
most probably they will reach the border some time tomorrow 
said stanislav pohoral a defense ministry spokesman 
no official figures have been released on the number of troops 
affected by todays pullbacks but vadim pliska a soviet soldier 
posted in frenstat said some 2000 soldiers and approximately 9o 
tanks were stationed there 
moscow currently has 73500 soldiers 122o tanks 25o5 armored 
vehicles 77 combat aircraft and 146 helicopters stationed on 
czechoslovak soil

teachers want geography a distant subject to 
many young americans to be among the courses required for high 
school graduation according to a survey released monday 
the nationwide survey of 852 elementary and secondary school 
social studies and geography teachers found 86 percent favored 
changing requirements to require that high school students pass a 
geography course in order to graduate eightyseven percent want 
state governments to increase geography requirements 
the rand mcnally report on geography education in america 
conducted by ketchum communications research and measurement comes 
on the heels of the first study of geography education by the 
national assessment of educational progress popularly known as 
the nations report card 
that report said high school seniors have a gap in their 
knowledge of geography with only 37 percent able to find southeast 
asia on a world map the average student could answer just 57 
percent of the questions and the best score among more than 3000 
students tested was 59 percent the report showed 
nine out of 10 teachers polled by rand mcnally said the quality 
of geography education american children currently receive could be 
considered poor or only fair 
unless geography education improves 85 percent of the teachers 
said that us citizens will not be able to adequately understand 
the importance of present and future environmental issues and 83 
percent said that other countries with citizens educated in 
geography will have competitive business advantages over the united 
states 
the survey findings indicate that geography is not receiving 
ample time in the classroom because it is taught as part of a 
broader subject such as history or social studies said dennis 
decock of rand mcnally he said 90 percent of those surveyed said 
more classroom time should be spent on geography 
requiring high school students to pass a geography course to 
graduate is one of the keys to restoring geography teaching to its 
proper role the teachers said 
seventytwo percent of those surveyed said most teachers have 
not received adequate training themselves in geography and 
therefore do not teach it well or at all eightynine percent said 
teachers of geography should be provided supplemental geography 
education 
the teachers surveyed included members of the national council 
for the social studies and the national council for geographic 
education 
rand mcnally a leading producer of maps and geography teaching 
materials said it has established an awards program for teachers 
who display creative classroom approaches to teaching geography 
the program is cosponsored by the national council for geographic 
education and will feature a 10000 cash prize

the belgrade stock exchange the 
first of its kind in communistruled yugoslavia resumed trading 
today after a break of almost half a century 
the yugoslav capital market belgrade will be the first of 
three stock exchanges set up in yugoslavia this year said 
branislav cosic deputy manager of the new exchange the other two 
will open in the northern cities of zagreb and ljubljana he said 
without giving a date 
the belgrade exchange founded by four of yugoslavias largest 
banks initially will handle only government bonds but soon will 
start trading stocks issued by private companies cosic said 
in the first day no bonds or stocks offered by the four 
founding banks were exchanged cosic said he said today was 
just an experimental day for future activities but did not 
elaborate on the startup operation 
the belgrade exchange first established in 1886 folded in 
1941 when yugoslavia was occupied by nazi germany when the 
communists seized power in 1945 th americans are smoking fewer cigarettes 
but an 
agriculture department economist says demand continues to grow in 
the rest of the world 
last year the per capita use of cigarettes in the united states 
was estimated at 2936 pieces or fewer than 149 packs of 20 
cigarettes each down about 5 percent from the 1988 rate 
the per capita use has declined for 16 straight years said 
verner grise of the departments economic research service at its 
peak in 1963 use averaged 4345 cigarettes or more than 217 packs 
per capita consumption is based on all persons 18 or older 
smokers and nonsmokers alike it does not indicate actual smoking 
habits and is used by the agency for yeartoyear comparisons 
but world cigarette trade increased about 12 percent grise said 
in the march issue of farmline magazine 
shipments from the united states west germany the 
netherlands hong kong which is also an importer and the united 
kingdom were up while those from bulgaria and belgiumluxembourg 
were down he said together these seven countries account for 
about 84 percent of total world exports 
among the cigarette importing countries the most important 
markets are the soviet union france japan italy hong kong and 
turkey 
during the first nine months of 1989 us cigarette exports 
were up 16 percent from a year earlier with all the major markets 
buying more grise said in the relatively small markets sales 
also rose in south america but declined in australiaoceania and 
canada

the us trade embargo against nicaragua was 
first imposed by former president reagan on may 1 1985 and was 
continued by president bush last oct 25 
bush said at the time that nicaragua posed an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of 
the united states 
he added however that if nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
held fair elections and implemented democratic reforms the 
emergency that prompted the imposition of the trade sanctions would 
largely be resolved 
ortegas leftist sandinista government was defeated in sundays 
election 
the embargo bars imports from nicaragua and bans us exports to 
that country except to support contra rebels it also prohibits 
nicaraguan aircraft or boats from entering the united states

president bush told the nations governors 
today that adoption of national education goals was a new era 
with high expectations and results for the countrys schools 
bush met with the governors at the white house and hailed the 
the fact that for the first time in history we now have national 
education goals and objectives 
the six goals set for the year 2000 were set forth by bush in 
his state of the union address and endorsed over the weekend by the 
governors at their annual midwinter meeting 
were launching a new era in education reform the president 
said its focus high expectations its hallmark results 
gov booth gardner of washington vice chairman of the national 
governors association said the goals would changes the nations 
schools from being a place where people have an opportunity to 
learn to a place where we ensure that all students will learn 
the governors made only minor changes in bushs six goals their 
proposal to give education a share of any savings in defense 
spending was relegated to a resolution one democratic governor said 
was so bland that no one could object 
at a white house dinner for the governors sunday night bush 
toasted them and our commitment to work together toward an 
american education system that is second to none 
we came together not as republicans and democrats not as 
partisan competitors but as fellow chief executives with our 
hearts and minds focused on a single goal the future of our kids 
the future of our country said bush 
gov terry branstad of iowa chairman of the governors 
association said we all expect that theres a lot of work ahead 
of us 
bush outlined the six goals in his state of the union address 
last month the governors spent two days tinkering with the 
language before they approved the goals and added a list of 
objectives for attaining them 
the goals call for giving poor youngsters preschool services 
that include nutrition and health screening and making sure 
american students are competent in math science english history 
and geography 
attached to the goals is a document seeking a commitment to 
provide at least one year of preschool for all disadvantaged 
children it also said federal funds should target those 
students most in need of assistance due to economic disadvantage or 
risk of academic failure 
the resolution on defense savings called on the president to 
dedicate the peace dividend in a balanced manner among the federal 
budget deficit education and other domestic programs 
new jersey gov james florio said the language is so 
generalized i dont know how anybody can be unhappy with that 
the governors rejected a proposal by democratic gov roy romer 
of colorado urging the president to direct substantial federal 
resources from defense to educational needs and other productivity 
investments 
richard g darman the white house budget director gave the 
governors no promises and said any defense savings would be less 
than many are predicting 
delaware gov michael castle won adoption of a resolution 
calling on the governors to publicize the goals within their states 
i dont believe the mere announcement of these goals by the 
president or the governors in this country is going to change 
education as dramatically as wed like it to castle said its 
only going to happen if we now carry the word out 
education leaders generally favored the goals although some 
complained there was no clear resolution of funding or how 
students achievement would be assessed 
the goals are good ones they give us something to work for 
said keith geiger president of the national education association 
the difficult task now comes in determining whos responsible 
for implementing them how were going to put together a longrange 
plan on the federal role the state role and the local role 
timothy dyer the new president of the national association of 
secondary school principals said americas governors receive an 
aplus for rhetoric but fail economics their goals are lofty 
patriotic noble and certainly what we all would like however 
without resources they are merely wishes

president bush today hailed violeta chamorros 
upset election in nicaragua and called for peaceful transition 
to democratic rule administration officials said he would decide 
swiftly on lifting the economic sanctions that hindered the 
sandinista government 
bush said there was no reason at all for further military 
activity from any quarter for most of a decade contra rebels 
supported by the united states have waged war against president 
daniel ortega 
bush spoke as key members of congress said the united states 
should anticipate providing substantial economic aid to the new 
government in managua 
secretary of state james a baker iii embraced mrs chamarros 
triumph and praised the defeated nicaraguan president for carrying 
out a fair election he said he hoped the election would lead to a 
national reconciliation 
said bush for years the people of nicaragua have suffered 
and today the people of nicaragua have spoken 
the president said he had talked with venezuelan president 
carlos andres perez about appropriate trade and economic measures 
that we can take to support the new government of nicaragua 
bush didnt address the issue of sanctions directly but white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president would decide 
fairly soon on whether to lift them and there already were 
calls in congress for the president to do just that 
the united states employed a variety of military economic and 
political challenges to ortegas sandinistas over the past nine 
years and the sanctions were likely a factor in the weak nicaraguan 
economy 
we must provide her new government with aid and lets not kid 
ourselves it will take big bucks said senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan she needs our help and she deserves it he 
said of mrs chamorro 
nobody said democracy was cheap added foreign affairs 
committee chairman dante fascell dfla he said he was confident 
the commitment was there among lawmakers to provide financial 
help 
the trade embargo against the nation of 3 million was imposed by 
president reagan on may 1 1985 it bars imports from nicaragua and 
bans us exports to that country except to support the contra 
rebels fighting the leftist sandinista government it also 
prohibits nicaraguan aircraft or boats from entering the united 
states 
the challenge to ortega was a controversial hallmark of the 
reagan years but last year bush abandoned his military support of 
the contra rebels 
in brief comments to the nations governors gathered at the 
white house bush offered congratulations to mrs chamorro on her 
victory and to ortega for permitting the fair elections to be held 
he said there is space in a democratic nicaragua for all 
political points of view 
fitzwater addressed the question of lifting sanctions when he 
spoke with reporters two hours before the president made his 
comments 
the president is beginning a series of meetings this morning 
to consider all these questions coming out the election 
fitzwater said the sanctions fitzwater added are a matter of 
first consideration 
we certainly would like to lift the sanctions fitzwater 
said 
its a time of celebration said sen richard lugar rind 
the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee 
in this year of political change democracy won another 
victory bush said in an earlier written statement i am most 
pleased that there has been a free and fair election in nicaragua 
and that the results are being accepted by both sides 
fitzwater was asked if bush had been surprised that ortega whom 
the president last october had ridiculed as an unwanted animal at 
a garden party had accepted the outcome so graciously no 
the spokesman said he said that ortega beforehand said that if he 
lost he would help with a transition thats smooth and 
effective 
baker went out of his way to commend daniel ortega and the 
sandinista government for carrying out his commitment to conduct 
elections under international supervision 
bush said that in addition to his talks with venezuelas 
president he would talk with other latin leaders concerning 
economic and trade issues mrs chamorro is expected to take office 
april 25 
fitzwater said the president was confident the international 
community will strongly support the results of yesterdays 
elections and will join in the effort to help all nicaraguans 
rebuild their country 
the white house spokesman said that the administration hoped 
that the ceasefire which ortega had declared an end to last fall 
will be reestablished immediately and respected by all sides 
he added we need a little time to absorb all the election 
process we intend to consider this in an orderly and methodical 
fashion 
we hope that all sides in this hotly fought contest will 
extend the hand of reconciliaton and cooperate together in 
rebuilding their country for the good of all nicaraguans the 
presidents statement said 
baker appearing at a meeting of the national governors 
association pointedly said the international community will 
insist that the decision of the nicaraguan people be respected and 
that full civil and military power be transferred to the newly 
elected government 
in this year of remarkable political change said baker 
freedom i think its fair to say won another victory yesterday 
in nicaragua 
we must show presidentelect chamorro and nicaragua and those 
elected with her that we are prepared to work with them to make 
certain the sanctions are lifted said lugar i would hope that 
the congress and the president will be generous with economic 
assistance to that torn country 
baker called for reinstating the ceasefire between the 
sandinistas and contra opponents which have continued their armed 
opposition we hope all sides in this hotely fought contest will 
extend the hand of national reconciliation baker said 
baker spoke shortly after the supreme electoral council 
announced in managua that with about 60 percent of precincts 
counted mrs chamorro had 459655 votes or 548 percent to 
ortegas 347778 or 415 percent eight other parties split what 
little remained 
on sunday relishing the very existence of elections in 
nicaragua bush told reporters if these elections are 
certifiably free and fair whoever wins the election will find a 
better climate in which to improve relations with nicaragua 
former president carter and thousands of international observers 
had closely scrutinized sundays peaceful balloting and carter 
proclaimed it fair the sandinistas took power during carters 
presidency in a revolution that toppled dictator anastasio somoza

lynn anderson and sissy spacek love him as do robert redford 
burt reynolds george strait tommy lee jones and romanian 
gymnastics coach bela karolyi countrywesterns michael martin 
murphy wrote a song in his honor 
hes made some investors instant millionaires and admirers are 
expected to risk 300 million on his performance this year 
at 5 feet tall he sounds a bit short and at 1100 pounds 
maybe more than a tad hefty but what the heck youd be husky 
too if you ate like a horse 
and thats what were talking about here horses quarter 
horses really 
the american quarter horse association founded here 50 years 
ago returns this week to celebrate its golden anniversary and 
honor what it calls americas horse 
thoroughbred breeders may lift a skeptical eyebrow but 
according to the association the versatile american quarter horse 
is 
skilled in disciplines ranging from cattle cutting to polo 
unequaled as a racehorse in sprint distances the horse got 
its name from its burst of speed in quartermile races down the 
dirt streets of early settlements 
the quickest horse in the world quarter horses are renowned 
for their lightning getaways bursting from a starting gate to 45 
mph in three strides 
the worlds finest roping reining and cutting horse 
the nations most popular breed and the only breed indigenous 
to this country 
the quarter horse even helped win the old west the real one 
not hollywoods version 
id agree with all those things said benny scott of fort 
worth former owner and publisher of quarter horse racing but if 
one word best sums up the quarter horse its versatility 
and theres no question about popularity because the breed has 
the most horses in its registry 
the quarter horse association claims the largest equine registry 
in the world nearly 3 million and the largest membership 
250000 including 17750 members in 62 other countries 
the growth of the american quarter horse in international 
markets is the most exciting development in the breed in the last 
decade said brad tate the associations president its as if 
investors and ranchers around the world have fallen in love with 
americas horse 
he said exports were up more than 20 percent in 1989 and the 
total export value grew to 26818000 
quarter horse racing is also increasing dramatically the 
amarillobased association estimates 16000 such races will be 
staged this year with purses totaling 60 million and wagering 
exceeding 300 million 
the labor day allamerican futurity crown jewel of quarter 
horse racing offers a 2 million purse 96909 per second over 
the quarter mile in 1988 the winner of the race at ruidoso nm 
covered the distance in 22 seconds and its owner earned 1 million 
on a horse purchased for 9000 
next year the association will open the american quarter horse 
heritage center and museum in amarillo to showcase the horses 
historical role and house the groups hall of fame 
this weeks anniversary celebration kicks off thursday at billy 
bobs texas with a reception honoring quarter horse owners from 
around the world 
billy bobs modestly bills itself as the worlds largest honky 
tonk and spokeswoman becky tillson likens the international 
reception to a united nations of horsemen in cowboy hats 
jabbering in german italian spanish and japanese 
horses are coming in from as far as new york montana and 
england 
a versatility challenge on sunday will match five of the 
nations top american quarter horses competing in a variety of 
categories for a somewhat token 5000 
spectators will have the rare opportunity of seeing in one 
arena the paragons of the breed in performance said tate

vulnerable older americans are being duped 
into buying expensive nursing home insurance policies that fail to 
deliver the promised protection against staggering longterm care 
costs a private advocacy group said monday 
the families usa foundation called for a government probe into 
what it said are widespread abuses in the longterm care insurance 
market including misrepresentations by insurance agents company 
refusals to pay benefits and extensive payment delays 
there is so much evidence of insurance industry abuse of frail 
elderly consumers that the federal trade commission should 
investigate said ron pollack executive director of the 
foundation the problems include toprated companies as well as 
flybynight operations the foundation said 
in one case it said an insurance agent visited a 74yearold 
widow in minnesota in the hospital to collect her first premium 
and later denied her nursing home benefits because she was 
hospitalized when she bought the policy 
in another an elderly iowa man was promised he need never worry 
about paying for a nursing home if he bought a policy that turned 
out to be so restrictive it would not cover 97 percent of the 
nursing home beds in iowa 
the health insurance association of america issued a statement 
in response that said it would welcome an ftc investigation 
because we are convinced it will reveal that abuses are the 
exception not the rule 
it said families usa was calling for a government inquiry in 
hopes of promoting an outdated biggovernment approach to 
longterm care 
families usa believes the best solution to the longterm care 
problem is a broadbased social insurance program akin to social 
security or medicare with private insurance playing only a 
supplementary role 
an estimated 40 percent of all elderly will spend some time in a 
nursing home with half of all stays lasting six months or less and 
the other half averaging 2 years according to the health 
insurance association 
longterm care insurance was virtually nonexistent before 1980 
but the market has grown rapidly in recent years because of rising 
concern about the high cost of nursing home care which averages 
more than 2000 a month more than 100 insurance companies now 
offer nursing home insurance and more than 13 million policies 
have been purchased 
families usa said it was asking congress to seek an ftc probe 
into alleged unfair business practices in the nursing home market 
the move was welcomed by two members by the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations which is 
conducting its own investigation into nursing home insurance 
rep john dingell a michigan democrat who chairs both the full 
committee and its oversight subcommittee said the foundations 
report was in line with what his investigators are finding 
when untamed avarice and constant prevarication become the 
trademarks of a product it is time for reform dingell said in a 
statement 
rep ron wyden dore also on the subcommittee said the 
report would provide added impetus for federal regulation of the 
nursing home insurance market it may well be necessary to have 
national minimum standards for private longterm care insurance 
wyden said 
currently roughly half of nursing home costs are paid by 
individuals and the other half by the government mainly through 
medicaid medicaid coverage of nursing home costs is available only 
after people become impoverished

as fast as you can repeat the following five times a potty 
parity proposal is pending in pennsylvania 
ok good if you dont feel just a little silly right now you 
may have what it takes to serve in your state legislature 
you could have the ability to keep a straight face while 
proposing laws to ban toad licking soothe nervous chickens pay 
people to vote keep cheerleaders off steroids exempt ostrich 
steaks from sales tax bring back the whipping post and castrate 
sex offenders 
or perhaps to give your state its own official state insect 
state marmot or state soil 
every one of the above has been introduced in at least one 
legislature around the country this year and thats not all 
west virginia legislators are considering a proposal to give 
lottery tickets to motorists who use their seat belts a tennessee 
representative has proposed a measure to encourage people to beat 
up flag burners he wants to reduce the penalty for assault in 
such cases to 1 
a state senator in new mexico has proposed creating a new county 
named after himself 
you might be tempted to believe that all is not sobriety and 
seriousness in americas legislatures but that would be ignoring 
some of the issues facing elected officials 
it turns out for instance that there are people who get their 
kicks licking toads according to the us drug enforcement 
administration south american cane toads secrete a hallucinogenic 
toxin that can get the licker as high as a tree frog 
legislators in georgia and south carolina have introduced bills 
to outlaw the practice 
they say these frogs grow to the size of a dinner plate 
said a horrified rep pat harris of south carolina i dont want 
to see somebody walk across the statehouse grounds with a frog on a 
leash and pick him up and lick him 
and consider the plight of the common chicken 
one of harris colleagues in south carolina rep larry koon 
has introduced a bill making it illegal to fire a gun within 300 
yards of a chicken coop 
the sound of a gunshot it seems can cause chickens to lose 
their vaunted composure jump into a pile and suffocate each other 
last year one of mr koons constitutents had chickens in a 
house explained rep tom rhoad someone had a dove shoot in 
the field right next to the chicken house and the guns fired and 
caused the chickens to huddle up in a corner and the farmer lost 
over 1000 chickens 
the potty parity bill in pennsylvania and a similar one in 
maryland are aimed at eliminating a serious even agonizing social 
problem the long lines that form outside womens restrooms in 
stadiums convention halls and other public places simply put the 
proposals require more toilets for women 
the list of official state stuff could be expanded this year to 
include the official state marmot of alaska the squirrelly 
senior hoary marmot at the anchorage zoo the state insect of 
colorado the yucca moth and the official soils of kentucky the 
crider soil series south dakota the houdek soil series and 
michigan the kalkaska soil series 
its getting to be all too much for some legislators among them 
rep bill lear of kentucky 
last week it was the official butterfly he fumed this 
week its the official soil and if we keep this up somebody will 
want a bill for frivolous conduct and that will be for the general 
assembly

president bush should assure the soviet union 
and other east european countries that they face no risk of 
aggression from a reunited germany west berlin mayor walter momper 
said monday 
the main achievement of the soviet union in the second world 
war was the security of their western flank momper told 
reporters if they really feel that they have lost this main 
achievement of the second world war i think soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev would get a blow that he really cant bear in 
his own country 
momper was to meet with bush on tuesday two days after the 
president met with west german chancellor helmut kohl at camp david 
to coordinate their approach to the reunification of germany 
there is some concern in the soviet union over what might 
happen to the soviet troops and to the security on their western 
flank and mainly the united states can help to assure the soviet 
union that there is nothing happening that might hit their security 
interests said momper 
he said bush also should reassure poland czechoslovakia and 
other eastern european countries 
momper called for east germany to dismantle its military and for 
britain france the soviet union and united states to extend their 
military control to all of east germany for a transition period 
before complete german unification 
the four powers which defeated nazi germany in world war ii 
have retained occupation rights in berlin for the 45 years since 
the war 
soviet troops should remain at reduced levels in east germany 
for an unspecified time to assure poland and the soviet union 
momper said

negotiations resumed monday on ending 
the decadeold civil war in cambodia with australias proposal for 
an interim un administration the main topic of discussion 
none of the parties directly involved in the talks registered an 
explicit rejection of the united nations playing a major role until 
elections are held said ali alatas foreign minister of indonesia 
attending the latest talks are representatives of the 
vietnamesesponsored government of cambodia the three guerrilla 
factions vietnam laos france australia and the association of 
southeast asian nations consisting of brunei indonesia malaysia 
the philippines singapore and thailand 
in an address opening the conference alatis said there was 
broad support for the australian proposal he said the five 
permanent members of the un security council the united states 
soviet union china britain and france had endorsed greater un 
participation 
no quick agreement was expected on the proposal especially 
after reports reached jakarta that thousands of vietnamese troops 
had secretly returned to cambodia to support premier hun sens army 
against the guerrillas 
vietman claimed all its force withdrew in late september after 
nearly 11 years of occupation but guerrilla leaders denied it 
three guerrilla groups are in an alliance led by prince norodom 
sihanouk the princes own followers and the peoples national 
liberation front of former premier son sann both noncommunist 
and the khmer rouge whose brutal regime was ousted by the 
vietnamese invasion of december 1978 
in jakarta son sann said of the vietnamese everybody knows 
they are still in cambodia and when phnom penh troops fight us in 
western cambodia there are many vietnamese troops among them 
khieu samphan nominal leader of the khmer rouge said 20000 
vietnamese troops had slipped back into cambodia the vietnamese 
refused to let the united nations verify their withdrawal in 
september 
we have returned home and never come back foreign 
minister nguyen co thach said monday in jakarta 
the latest conference is to run through wednesday 
foreign minister gareth evans said the australian plan for a key 
un role was an elaboration of earlier suggestions by prince 
sihanouk cambodias former ruler and rep stephen solarz dny 
who heads the house subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs 
foreign troops must leave cambodia and not come back the un 
can monitor and verify this evans said foreign arms supply 
and military assistance has to stop the un can monitor and 
verify this there has to be a ceasefire and associated measures 
so that hostilities do not start again the un can supervise 
monitor and verify this 
china arms the guerrilla coalition and the soviet union provides 
weapons to vietnam and the hun sen government the united states 
has shipped nonlethal supplies to the guerrillas led by sihanouk 
and son sann 
evans said the united nations should be involved in the civil 
administration of cambodia in the transitional period leading up to 
free and fair elections this central idea has been agreed by 
virtually everyone to whom we have spoken even that one cambodian 
party which has not accepted it has publicly stated that it has not 
rejected it 
his reference appeared to be to the khmer rouge 
in addition to un administrators evans proposed a supreme 
national council to be the repository of cambodian national 
sovereignty and national unity during the transitional period 
membership of the supreme national council could be made up of

the confession was supposed to be 
secret not even admissible in court but now people who follow 
the news know the name of a 13yearold who admitted molesting 64 
preschoolers 
the leak of david hawkeys confession and the resulting 
widespread publicity has seriously jeopardized his treatment say 
counselors at the youth home where he is undergoing courtordered 
therapy 
the boy now trusts no one and because of fear of harassment 
has been removed from the public school he was attending under 
supervision social workers say they dont know where he can be 
helped without being followed by the stigma of what he admitted 
the question becomes where can this child go now to get 
treatment are we going to have to send him out of state asked 
glenn demots associate executive director of bethany christian 
services in grand rapids 
the boy from fruitport a mostly rural community of 1100 
residents about 30 miles northwest of grand rapids has been at 
bethany since last summer after pleading guilty to seconddegree 
criminal sexual conduct for molesting one child while babysitting 
during services at fruitport bethel baptist church 
as part of his treatment he was urged to disclose the names of 
any other victims he admitted molesting 63 otherchildren between 
ages 1 to 4 years old during 198588 
he also implicated his 17yearold brother paul who was 
charged with one count of firstdegree criminal sexual conduct 
paul denies the charge 
david was told beforehand that any disclosures he made would be 
given to his case worker and police to ensure treatment for the 
alleged victims but otherwise the confession from patient to 
therapist is confidential 
but during the notification of congregation members the 
confession became public the story was first published 
identifying the hawkey boys in the muskegon chronicle on feb 4 
it wasnt long before the story was picked up nationally david 
has been labeled as potentially one of the worst child molesters in 
us history 
since the story broke muskegon county prosecutor tony tague has 
filed two additional charges of firstdegree criminal sexual 
conduct against david and said he expects more charges 
i wouldnt feel comfortable just taking his word for the 
number of victims so were trying to verify as many cases as we 
can tague said adding that detectives were still interviewing 
many of the children 
tague said he would like to see david incarcerated until his 
19th birthday the maximum penalty because of his age at the time 
of the alleged crimes 
media representatives have said the seriousness of the alleged 
abuse made identification of the boys inevitable 
if we didnt name them every person in fruitport with a 
13yearold neighbor is going to be looking sideways at him said 
chronicle editor gunnar carlson 
on the other hand there were dozens and dozens of people who 
already knew precisely who was involved so it certainly didnt 
come as any surprise to the congregation or to the extended 
family 
davids attorney gerald gibbs said he is worried the publicity 
has tainted the case 
i dont know what his chances are with all the publicity 
gibbs said its too early to know how seriously its disrupted 
his treatment but he already has a serious distrust of the system 
from all of this 
the pastor of the church said the publicity has drawn his 
congregation together 
i dont think the names should have been used but in some 
cases its been helpful for the victims and their parents to see 
the reports so they know the boy is being held and doesnt have 
access to them the rev billie anderson said 
bethany officials fear the publicity and the prosecutors 
aggressiveness may deter other young offenders from disclosing 
their crimes 
disclosure is the key to treatment clinical supervisor 
cindy lindstrom said this has created a lot of questions for the 
kids about what they should and shouldnt say im very 
concerned how it could affect the rest of the program

jesse l jackson said today he will not run 
for mayor of the nations capital in this falls election 
i want to continue to serve but not as mayor the civil 
rights leader and twotime democratic presidential candidate said 
in a statement prepared for a news conference 
jacksons political plans have been the subject of conjecture 
since he moved to washington in april 1989 the speculation 
intensified with mayor marion barrys arrest last month on a 
cocaine possession charge 
in his statement jackson did not address whether he would again 
seek the white house in 1992 
he said he plans to continue working to end the citys drug and 
crime crisis and to push for statehood for the district of columbia 
at present i believe that i may best serve by continuing my 
work on a national level to change the direction of this country i 
want to serve but not as mayor jackson said 
because this is an election year the mayors issue has grown 
with the crisis in the city and the tribulations of the mayor 
jackson said in his statement 
in recent weeks jackson has stressed repeatedly that 
championing the citys quest to become the nations 51st state 
would remain his priority through the election year 
barry is in a south carolina hospital for treatment for what an 
aide has called an alcohol problem city administrator carol 
thompson is in charge of the city in barrys absence 
jacksons decision comes amid growing signs that voters and 
politicians are wary of a jackson mayoral bid 
a washington post poll released thursday said jackson would 
trail barry if both were candidates in the september democratic 
primary 
the poll of 800 registered democrats in the district found barry 
was preferred by 25 percent of those surveyed while 19 percent 
said they would vote for jackson four other possible candidates 
split 33 percent of those polled while the remaining 9 percent 
were listed as undecided wouldnt vote or other 
if barry were not in the race jackson would receive support 
from 26 percent of those questioned compared with 19 percent for 
city councilman john ray the poll had a margin of error of 4 
percentage points 
in the past jackson refused repeatedly to rule out a run for 
barrys job saying he only would seek the office if barry a 
longtime colleague did not run for a fourth term 
since his arrest barry has been silent on his plans for 
reelection mayoral aides have said barry acknowledged privately 
the weekend after his arrest that he would not run again 
the prospects for a jackson candidacy had encountered other 
turbulence 
last fall the city council passed a bill sponsored by two 
announced mayoral candidates that limits outside income from 
honoraria and speeches for the mayor to 10000 per year 
jackson has said he earns about 200000 a year mostly from 
speeches and honoraria the mayors job pays 89500 a year 
in addition to ray there are three announced democratic 
candidates for mayor and one republican

opposition leader violeta barrios de 
chamorro defeated president daniel ortega in a stunning rebuke to 
10 years of leftist sandinista rule in this warweary nation 
election returns showed today 
sundays peaceful balloting the freest elections in nicaraguan 
history was closely watched by thousands of international 
observers and with more than threefourths of the vote in mrs 
chamorro was winning just over 55 percent 
earlier with more than half the results in ortega stopped 
short of formally conceding but said in a television appearance 
these numbers and these percentages form a tendency that cannot 
be ignored 
he said the precincts that had not yet reported held 50 percent 
of the vote but admitted a sandinista victory would break 
mathematical rules 
i want to tell all nicaraguans and all the nations of the 
world that the president of nicaragua and the government will 
respect and accept the popular mandate ortega added 
the sandinistas remain by far the largest single party the 
united nationalist opposition mrs chamorro heads is a fractious 
alliance of 14 parties ranging from far right to far left and it 
was unclear how power would be transferred 
defense minister humberto ortega the presidents brother has 
said that if mrs chamorro won she would still have to deal with 
me and that the army might disobey orders it considered unsound 
whether he commands that kind of loyalty remains to be seen uno 
has said it will eliminate the draft and greatly reduce the size of 
the army the largest in central america 
another question is how uno whose members only common interest 
was getting rid of the sandinistas could form a government strong 
enough to stand up to the sandinista bureaucracy 
ortega 44 had branded mrs chamorro the 60yearold publisher 
of the opposition newspaper la prensa an instrument of us policy 
and had hoped to capitalize on nicaraguan pride at standing up to 
the colossus of the north 
but the voters rejected ortegas oneparty rule which led to 
economic decline that the sandinistas blamed on the ussupported 
contra insurgency and a us trade embargo 
under the sandinistas nicaragua became a selfproclaimed 
revolutionary state and adopted portions of marxist and leninist 
ideology to remake its economic and social structures it won 
strong support from the soviet union and cuba and was accused by 
the united states of trying to foment communist revolution in 
neighboring el salvador 
the sandinist loss to the uno which says it favors 
westernstyle representative government followed by just a few 
months the restoration of democracy in a series of sovietaligned 
nations in east europe and moves toward democratization in the 
soviet union itself 
the nicaraguan people have shown that they want to live in 
democracy in peace and in freedom mrs chamorro told more than 
1000 cheering supporters if her victory is confirmed she will 
take office on april 25 
in washington president bush hailed the upset victory in 
nicaragua as another victory for democracy in a remarkable 
year his spokesman said a lifting of economic sanctions would be a 
first consideration 
he said he spoke with venezuelan president carlos andres perez 
about appropriate trade and economic measures that we can take to 
support the new government of nicaragua 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the international 
community would insist full civil and military power be 
transferred to the newly elected government 
honduras said chamorros victory would pave the way for improved 
relations with its neighbor the countries have quarreled over 
usbacked contra rebel bases in honduras 
the supreme electoral council said that with 777 percent of 
precincts counted mrs chamorro had 618699 votes or 552 
percent to ortegas 457870 or 409 percent eight other parties 
split what little remained 
ortegas speech was filled with sadness and seemed at times 
almost like a valedictory tracing the course of the sandinista 
party from the time it led the revolution that toppled president 
anastasio somoza in 1979 
just as we managed to defeat somocismo so we also managed to 
defeat the counterrevolution and to indict before the world those 
who launched a policy of death against the people of nicaragua 
he said referring to the united states 
we were sure that this electoral process would bring all 
nicaraguans that peace and stability we need so much ortega said 
at times ortega looked pained and it seemed as if he simply 
could not bring himself to say flatly that the party had lost 
flanked by top aides and his commonlaw wife who looked pale 
and shaken ortega told nicaraguans he was proud in any case that 
the sandinistas had brought a democratic election to nicaragua 
aristides sanchez a contra leader called the election result 
a triumph of the people 
all nicaraguans must now back the new government and attempt 
to achieve a national reconciliation he said in a telephone 
interview from miami 
the united states ended military aid to the contras in february 
1988 but at bushs urging congress has continued to supply the 
ontras with nonlethal aid to pressure the sandinistas into holding 
free elections 
mrs chamorro was asked as she left her house for campaign 
headquarters if she thought a transfer of power after 10 years of 
sandinista rule would be smooth thats the commitment we want 
peace and reconciliation 
as they battled the contra rebels the sandinistas muzzled 
dissent for years most preelection polls said mrs chamorro was 
trailing ortega but many nicaraguans were afraid to reveal their 
true feelings outside a truly secret ballot box 
under the sandinistas the centrally planned economy was wracked 
by inflation and mismanagement 
celebrations began breaking out in various neighborhoods of 
managua before dawn with people burning some of the thousands of 
sandinista banners draped across city streets however the 
celebrations appeared to die down quickly 
a midnight celebration at sandinista headquarters had been 
canceled 
turnout was heavy in what was considered nicaraguas freest vote 
ever with people lining up for as much as four hours to cast 
ballots and more than 3000 international observers monitoring the 
peaceful election 
voters also selected 90 national assembly members and 
representatives to 146 regional city and town councils 
the electoral council was extremely late in reporting votes and 
opposition officials initially said they believed the council 
hadnt expected a sandinista loss and was withholding announcement 
because it didnt know what to do 
after the polls closed former president jimmy carter head of 
one observer group called the ballot very fair about 175 
million of nicaraguas 35 million people were registered to vote 
a festive mood prevailed at the headquarters of mrs chamorro 
early today while at the sandinista party headquarters the mood 
was funereal with long faces and few smiles 
mrs chamorro favors marketoriented reform but the sandinistas 
recently softened their socialist line promising a mixed economy 
and saying they would no longer expropriate private property they 
also released political prisoners 
inflation which ran 1700 percent last year and the draft were 
on the minds of many voters barely a nicaraguan family has escaped 
losing a member to the war with the contras which has claimed 
30000 lives

israeli foreign minister moshe arens 
arrived monday for a fourday visit during which full diplomatic 
relations with poland are to be restored after a 23year break 
arens meets tuesday with his polish counterpart foreign 
minister krzysztof skubiszewski to sign the protocol establishing 
the ties broken by poland after the 1967 middle east war 
he also has appointments tuesday with prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki and president wojciech jaruzelski 
the foreign ministers first day was spent in emotional visits 
to memorials to polands oncevibrant jewish community reduced to 
a few thousand from 35 million before world war ii 
every jew who comes to poland must remember the tragedy of the 
holocaust that the jewish nation went through on this land arens 
said the official pap news agency reported 
he paid homage at the monument to the warsaw ghetto uprising of 
1943 when jews held in a walledin section of the city to face 
starvation or deportation rose up against the nazi occupiers 
arens stood in silence at the monument at umschlagplatz the 
depot where 300000 warsaw jews were loaded on trains to the nazi 
concentration camps he went to the jewish cemetery where acres of 
overgrown graves testify to the obliteration of later generations 
he laid a wreath at the polish tomb of the unknown soldier and 
visited the majdanek concentration camp near lublin in southeastern 
poland 
arens on wednesday will go to the auschwitz death camp in 
southern poland where the presence of a roman catholic convent in 
a former nazi warehouse strained jewishpolish relations and 
stirred international controversy 
construction of an interfaith prayer center to house the nuns 
farther from the camp began last week a year after the passing of 
the deadline for moving the convent set in an accord reached by 
jewish and catholic leaders in geneva 
polish press coverage of the arens visit has focused on the 
solidarityled governments position acknowledging the error of the 
decision to sever ties and the acts consequences including an 
antisemitic purge in 1968 
poland apologizes to israel and return to normalcy were 
among the newspaper headlines monday the daily zycie warszawy said 
the breaking of ties could have looked spectacular then and 
could even seem justified but in fact it brought about more losses 
than profits 
poland with the rest of the warsaw pact except romania cut 
relations with israel after the 1967 war hungary in september 
became the first nation to restore ties and czechoslovakia was the 
second on feb 9 
from 350000 to 500000 israelis were born in poland the 
newspaper noted including the first israeli prime minister david 
ben ben gurion and the present one yitzhak shamir 
polishisraeli relations have steadily improved since 1986 when 
each country established an interest section in the others capital 
polands new government however also has sought to establish 
evenhanded relations with arab states and has not changed its 
position in support of the palestinian nations right to a homeland 
arens is accompanied by a delegation of business leaders and has 
talks scheduled with polish finance minister leszek balcerowic who 
drafted polands radical shift toward a marketdriven economy 
poland is seeking western investment and officials have said 
they hope the improved relations will increase polishisraeli 
trade estimated at 60 million last year

the nations top business economists believe 
the economy will avoid a recession for the next three years and 
break the record expansion set in the glory days of the 1960s 
according to a survey released on monday 
but the poll by the national association of business economists 
indicated the economy is in a danger zone and is likely to grow 
only a sluggish 17 percent this year before accelerating to a 25 
percent rate next year 
the 65 professional forecasters also saw little sign of 
significant progress over the next two years in achieving the zero 
inflation goal set by the federal reserve 
in fact they predicted prices would rise 42 percent both this 
year and next down slightly from 1989s 46 percent rate the rate 
was 44 percent in both 1987 and 1988 
nevertheless the survey showed that 606 percent believe the 
economy will avoid a recession through 1993 statistically 
unchanged from a 621 percent finding late last year 
james f smith the associations president and finance 
professor at the university of north carolina said the biggest 
news in the survey is its confirmation of the seachange of 
optimism found among participants in december a survey last may 
found 63 percent of the economists expecting a recession this year 
still nearly 462 percent in the latest survey said the risk of 
an economic downturn increased in the fourth quarter of 1989 of 
the 394 percent who thought a recession would occur in the next 
three years 181 percent believe it started in the last quarter or 
will begin sometime this year 
a survey summary contended the economy is in a danger zone 
it said the probability of recession is not trivial and almost 80 
percent of respondents think it has risen or remained the same over 
the last quarter 
only 215 percent said they believe the recession risk has 
decreased 
we all know we have not repealed the business cycle there 
will be a recession some day smith said but our members are 
confident that we will shatter all records for the us economy 
with the current expansion now in its eighth year 
when we get to october 1991 we will tie the glory days of the 
1960s and break the 19611969 expansion he said 
smith credited fed chairman alan greenspan and other members of 
the federal open market committee for the relatively confident 
outlook 
in our latest policy survey an astounding 72 percent of the 
nearly 300 respondents said what the fed was doing was about 
right smith said now anything that gets almost three out of 
four economists to agree with it must be either tremendously good 
or tremendously bad in this case we would assume tremendously 
good 
the fomc comprised of the fed governors and district 
presidents sets monetary policy and for more than a year has been 
trying to drive down inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit 
the bush administration and many economists have urged the fed 
to ease credit and thus permit lower interest rates in an attempt 
to stimulate the economy which slowed from a 3 percent growth rate 
in the third quarter to 05 percent in the fourth 
however greenspan indicated to congress last week the central 
bank would keep interest rates high and in their survey the nabe 
economists expect little movement in interest rates over 19901991

the giant hull of the exxon valdez was 
gashed twice as the tanker lumbered over one set of jagged rocks 
and grounded on another on bligh reef a witness testified today 
george greiner jr formerly of the coast guard showed jurors 
elaborate sets of charts graphs and photographs of the ship in dry 
dock in san diego 
greiner said he tracked the ships course from a number of logs 
kept by the crew and found that its damage was intensified by the 
dramatic shifting of tides in prince william sound as the 987foot 
tanker sat grounded on the reef 
he said the rising tide caused a crushing effect adding to 
the damage 
greiner testified as the trial of joseph hazelwood entered its 
fourth week with prosecutors planning to rest their case against 
the skipper tuesday 
the prosecution claims that hazelwood skipper of the crippled 
ship was reckless in trying to drive it off the reef after the 
march 24 accident 
hazelwoods lawyers contend he never attempted the risky 
maneuver of backing off the reef but was trying to stabilize the 
vessel by moving forward 
prosecutors say that if hazelwood had succeeded in moving it off 
the reef the exxon valdez would have capsized spilling even more 
oil and possibly killing crew members 
the tanker spilled almost 11 million gallons of oil killing 
countless birds fish and other wildlife and blackening hundreds of 
miles of rocky shore 
in addition to greiner prosecutors plan to call experts to 
testify about the effects of alcohol on the body and the figures 
reflected on bloodalcohol tests administered to hazelwood after 
the accident 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with second degree 
criminal mischief a felony and three misdemeanors reckless 
endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent 
discharge of oil if convicted on all counts he could face a 
maximim of 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
hazelwood was not on the bridge when the tanker grounded during 
a tricky passage into scenic prince william sound a third mate who 
was in charge has blamed the accident on the helmsmans failure to 
steer properly 
a key issue in the case is whether hazelwood was drunk when he 
boarded the ship he had spent a day in the port city of valdez and 
was seen by witnesses drinking at a bar called the pipeline club 
but in his first postaccident interview with the coast guard 
played for jurors on friday hazelwood denied drinking anything 
stronger than beer and said he drank nothing at all at the pipeline 
club

christian forces skirmished in east 
beirut on monday deadlocking mediation efforts to end the power 
struggle between rival christian leaders and sending hundreds of 
frightened civilians fleeing 
two people died and 10 were wounded in the daylong exchanges of 
sniper fire police said 
that raised the casualty toll to 693 killed and 1925 wounded 
since fighting broke out on jan 30 between the lebanese forces led 
by samir geagea and the army troops of gen michel aoun it is the 
worst fighting between christian factions in the nearly 15yearold 
civil war 
a threeman mediation committee of independent christian leaders 
was unable to stop the shooting and faced major difficulties in 
arranging an overall settlement a police spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity 
the snipers didnt stop shooting although the committee 
members were repeatedly informed by the two headquarters that 
orders had been issued to halt the exchanges the spokesman said 
the committees failure to stabilize a repeatedly violated feb 
17 ceasefire heightened concern that a new round of fighting is 
likely between the factions vying for control of the christian 
enclave north of beirut 
the spokesman said the committee couldnt proceed with its 
plan to reopen roads inside christian east beirut because of the 
clashes 
the committee arranged for some main roads to reopen sunday but 
so far that has been all the mediators have achieved 
the mediation deadlock drove hundreds of christian civilians to 
cross beiruts dividing green line into moslem west beirut and flee 
to eastern and northern lebanon 
the police spokesman said there was a sharp increase in the 
number of evacuees in the afternoon after radio stations reported 
the committee was making no progress in ending the bloodshed 
at least 110000 civilians have fled the 310squaremile 
christian enclave since jan 30 35000 of them since the fragile 
ceasefire began 
lebanons national carrier middle east airlines has scheduled 
eight extra flights a week to cyprus for the fleeing christians it 
normally flies to larnaca on the east mediterranean islands south 
coast four times a week 
christian sources said on condition of anonymity the committee 
could not get aoun and geagea to agree on its plan to stabilize the 
ceasefire 
one source close to the mediators said geageas command proposed 
a disengagement of forces as a necessary step to normalize the 
situation before continuing with the plan to reopen roads 
geagea the source said believes that reopening roads without 
separating the forces will only jeopardize civilians who might get 
caught in the cross fire of any renewed fighting 
the source said aoun rejected the disengagement proposal and 
wanted a political agreement reached with the lebanese forces 
before the committee continues with its plan for reopening roads 
stabilizing the ceasefire without a political agreement would 
undercut aouns declared objective that the lebanese forces should 
disband and become a political organization geagea refuses to 
break up his military force 
geageas fighters control twothirds of the christian enclave 
including its three main ports and two isolated pockets on the 
northwestern edge of beirut 
aouns army holds beiruts southeastern districts eastern 
suburbs and the metn mountains to the northeast 
shaker abu suleiman a member of the committee said the 
mediators are the thin thread that is preventing a new 
conflagration 
well maintain our mission regardless of the difficulties 
because we do not want the population partitioned he said 
the leftist assafir daily based in west beirut said geagea 
has signed a written pledge to accept the authority of 
syrianbacked president elias hrawi in east beirut if hrawis 
government intervenes to halt the christian feuding 
hrawi elected nov 24 is recognized by geagea but rejected by 
aoun who considers himself the sole legitimate authority in 
lebanon the syrians have 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 
arab league peacekeeping mandate aoun considers them an occupation 
army 
in september 1988 aoun the army commander was appointed head 
of an interim military cabinet by outgoing president amin gemayel 
after parliament failed to elect a successor 
when he took office hrawi fired aoun as army chief and 
caretaker premier but the general refused to step down alleging 
hrawis election was unconstitutional 
aoun geagea and hrawi are maronite catholics the main 
christian sect that has dominated lebanon since independence from 
france in 1943

a brass band struck up the 
internationale on monday as the red army began leaving 
czechoslovakia 22 years after it arrived to crush a reform movement 
karel micek of the civic forum said the presence of soviet 
troops had meant empty shelves in stores polluted water an 
occasional fight in the pub and a reminder that we are not a free 
country 
their main problem was that they were here said micek 
whose group played a central role in the peaceful revolution that 
ousted the communist party from exclusive power in november 
twentytwo soviet t62 tanks loaded on flatcars left the 
northern town of frenstat beginning a negotiated threestage 
pullout of the 73500 soviet military personnel scheduled for 
completion next year 
a second train laden with 33 armored vehicles left a few hours 
later from the domasov nad bystrici station near a red army base at 
libava in eastern czechoslovakia 
it is the first time the kremlin has removed its soldiers from 
the territory of a warsaw pact ally 
hungary is near agreement with the soviets on a similar accord 
but no deals have been struck with poland and east germany the 
other soviet allies in europe that are hosts to red army troops 
soviet soldiers remained in czechoslovakia after a warsaw pact 
invasion crushed the reformist prague spring of 1968 they 
entered hungary in 1956 to put down an antistalinist uprising 
before the withdrawal began the soviet union had 1220 tanks 
25o5 armored vehicles 77 combat aircraft and 146 helicopters in 
czechoslovakia in addition to the 73500 soldiers 
soon after the first train rolled toward the border the 
official news agency ctk reported that sovietczechoslovak military 
maneuvers would be held next month 
the czechoslovak peoples army and the central group of troops 
of the soviet army will be held march 14 in western and northern 
bohemia march 14 it said quoting the defense ministry 
it was not clear whether the announcements timing was a 
coincidence or meant as a signal that czechoslovakia remains a 
dependable soviet ally despite the withdrawal and a government 
dominated by noncommunists 
another ctk dispatch quoted deputy foreign minister evzen vacek 
as telling a parliamentary committee the pullout would be completed 
by june 30 1991 no specific date had been mentioned previously 
ceremonies at frenstat were simple and brief the departure from 
the base 110 miles southeast of prague is to be completed march 13 
and red army troops are to be gone from libava 180 miles east of 
the capital by march 25 
the withdrawal agreement was initialed feb 22 in prague and is 
to be signed in moscow this week by presidents vaclav havel and 
mikhail s gorbachev 
havel flew to the soviet capital monday three days after 
returning from the united states and talks with president bush 
under the withdrawal agreement a decisive part of the 
soviet force is to be out by the end of may a month before the 
first free elections in czechoslovakia since the communists 
consolidated power in 1948 
this is our new peace policy in practice a retreat from 
the policy of confrontation gen vladimir malyshkievich deputy 
chief of soviet forces in czechoslovakia said during the frenstat 
ceremonies it is only proper this process starts in the center 
of europe and on the day of the official visit of president havel 
in the soviet union 
no official figures have been released on how many soldiers left 
monday vadim pliska a soviet trooper at frenstat said 2000 
soldiers and about 90 tanks were stationed there

the slumping new england economy is 
taking its toll even on this exclusive little island where 
corporate officers rock stars politicians and stockbrokers 
retreat for the summer 
the 4 million beachfront cottages are still being snapped up 
but economic and oceanic tides have washed away prospects for fast 
bucks from quickie developments this pleases nantuckets 
yearround residents who say all the new construction threatens 
the islands natural charm 
developers arent welcome here nantucket real estate agent 
david webster said flatly 
speculation builders came to the island from the mid1970s to 
mid1980s when new england banks were making jumbo loans for 
developers who then bought land and built and built they turned 
miles of the islands moors and golden heathlands into subdivisions 
with asphalt streets and green lawns 
the real estate market already was pricy in nantuckets 
historic downtown colonial homes from the 17th century regularly 
sold for millions of dollars and prices escalated for properties 
along the ocean 
you take a house that runs 700000 inland here webster 
said if its within sight of water the price can go to 15 
million if its on the beach its up to 3 million 
about 600 new housing units a year were built on nantuckets 
30000 acres during the peak years of the mid1980s webster says 
now he adds about half that number are built each year 
when i was a kid it used to be beautiful out here webster 
said driving through an area dotted with new twobedroom 
developments there even used to be sheep grazing out here 
the sheep are gone but now so are the developers when the 
stock market crashed in 1987 the bottom started to fall out of the 
new england real estate market 
some developers were stuck with highpriced mortgages on lots 
and buildings 
webster mentions one who is taking a bath after building a 
100room motel that has no renters 
theyre paying 100000 a month on the mortgage webster 
said they cant pay it back and what does the bank do they 
dont want it 
what economics havent accomplished nature has erosion on the 
islands windy southern and eastern coasts is eating away at 
beachfront lots holding houses that once sold for millions 
on the south side of the island beachfront properties are 
going for 300000 that would go for 12 million on the north 
side webster said people simply arent building on the south 
side of the island anymore 
such developments please islanders who have established 
commissions to preserve the islands historic downtown and the 
countryside 
a land bank levies a 2 percent fee against all real estate 
transactions the money is used to buy and administer land to be 
preserved 
there was a feeling that if the people didnt do something 
the land wouldnt be saved said dawn darbey director of the 
land bank

new grammy award winners with new orleans 
roots met monday for an extra awards ceremony at city hall and said 
the world is finally waking up to the new orleans sound 
i dont think were doing anything differently i think the 
world is just catching up to us said mac rebennack better known 
as dr john who won a grammy last week with rickie lee jones for a 
jazz duet version of makin whoopee 
mayor sidney barthelemy recognized the prizewinning artists 
with certificates of merit 
three of the neville brothers winners for best pop instrumental 
with the song healing chant also were on hand 
art neville said national and world recognition of new orleans 
music with its jazz caribbean and african influences was long 
overdue 
charles neville said last weeks four grammy awards for new 
orleans recording acts are bound to help the citys musicians 
i think the big thing it did though was give more credibility 
to new orleans music he said well probably get regular air 
play now before this programmers said new orleans music was too 
regional well its true it is regional but the region is the 
world 
aaron neville who also won a separate grammy for a duet with

it was hardly the fall of the berlin wall but the 
ceremony monday in the house of commons also was historic it 
brought irish and british lawmakers together as a joint 
parliamentary body for the first time in nearly 70 years 
in the jubilee room of the cavernous house of commons champagne 
glasses clinked in jovial harmony and irish and british voices once 
again discussed the question that has vexed the two island nations 
for centuries how to understand each other 
our two people have an infinite capacity for mutual 
misunderstanding former irish prime minister garret fitzgerald 
said in an interview and the opportunity to sit down and talk to 
each other know each other understand how each others minds work 
and dissipate some of the prejudices by undermining them i think 
is very important 
the britishirish interparliamentary body has no legislative 
powers and the job of its 25 irish and 25 british members will be 
limited almost entirely to talk 
but it is the first forum of its kind since ireland became 
independent in 1922 with its own parliament the dail and it comes 
at a time when cautious hopes are being voiced about settling the 
northern ireland conflict 
peter brooke britains top official in northern ireland has 
been talking about new possibilities of bringing feuding protestant 
and catholic leaders together irish prime minister charles haughey 
is to pay a rare visit to belfast in april and increasingly 
northern irelanders are asking what 20 years of bloodshed and 
nearly 3000 deaths have accomplished 
there is movement at the moment its slight i dont want to 
raise expectations but i do believe its real said irish deputy 
prime minister brian lenihan who will cochair the new body with 
his british counterpart sir geoffrey howe 
the reason lenihan told bbc radio is that the unionists 
northern irelands protestant majority are discovering that their 
refusal to negotiate with the catholic nationalist minority is 
getting them nowhere 
the unionists now see that the world is passing them by 
recent events in europe mean that northern ireland more and 
more is becoming a backwater said lenihan 
the unionists were offered two seats on the interparliamentary 
body but turned them down they see it as a byproduct of the 1985 
angloirish agreement which they believe undermines their union 
with britain by giving the irish government a say in the running of 
britishruled northern ireland 
their boycott represents a reversal of history for once it was 
the irish nationalists who refused to have any dealings with 
london as far back as 1843 daniel oconnell the great irish 
nationalist warned his people never to expect anything except 
injustice from an english parliament 
those suspicions linger on the british side theres an 
insensitivity and on the irish side theres a certain 
prickliness said austin currie a northern ireland catholic who 
is a member of the irish dail and belongs to the new body and if 
we recognize the insensitivity and the prickliness thats the way 
to make progress 
its historic there is no way that 20 or 15 years ago any 
group of irish parliamentarians could have come here in the way 
that they have today said merlyn rees a former northern ireland 
secretary and now an opposition labor party lawmaker 
he pointed to the staircase leading to the room where the 
inaugural cocktail party was going on and said where were 
standing now there was an ira bomb in 1974 
fitzgerald argued it was the irish republican army through its 
bombing and shooting campaign to rid northern ireland of british 
rule which was chiefly responsible for creating the 
interparliamentary body 
the ira was as hostile to the irish government as to the 
british he said in an interview and this had forced dublin into 
coordinating strategy more closely with london 
the actions of the ira have so polarized opinion that the 
center of gravity of the irish approach has come closer to that of 
the british he said its the one positive contribution the 
ira have ever made 
the iras political wing sinn fein issued a statement hoping 
that members of the new body would press for an end to partition 
and the right of the irish people to selfdetermination

military officers showed monday how 
they had begun dismantling the telephonetapping centers of nicolae 
ceausescus secret police and said their work was proof the 
widespread eavesdropping was ended 
observe please that all the power boxes have been removed 
said maj gen nicolae cerbu deputy of the army signal corps 
gesturing at a bank of cassette players in a listening center in 
bucharest 
ceausescus dreaded secret police the securitate tapped tens 
of thousands of telephones as part of its vast domestic spying 
apparatus the securitate was officially disbanded after the 
december revolution that ended the communist dictators 24year 
reign and led to his execution 
the military organized a tour of the listening centers for 
reporters in an apparent effort to counter widespread criticism 
that authorities had done too little to dismantle the securitate 
structures 
this is the proof that it bugging doesnt happen now said 
col mihai alexuta another signal corps officer 
military officers said that in bucharest the securitate 
maintained interception equipment at all 30 telephone exchanges as 
well as in factories hotels and military offices the signals were 
sent to two secret recording studios where the conversations were 
monitored and transcribed they said 
the first people to be targeted with these listening devices 
were in the army said cerbu who added that people generally 
were repulsed by this kind of activity 
the officers said they believed they had found all the bugging 
centers in romania but they declined to say how many there were 
all the eavesdropping had been stopped they said 
the equipment will be dismantled and the parts inventoried and 
then given to different ministries or military departments for 
their use cerbu said 
its a pity to destroy these things because they are 
expensive he said an amplifier could be well used in a small 
village where a ministry wants to set up telephones for people who 
dont have them 
in one of the interception centers a room about the size of a 
large broom closet located in a central telephone exchange the 
officers opened a few of 48 small gray drawers set into a metal 
frame inside were circuit boards covered with transistors 
the equipment was capable of intercepting 36 telephone calls at 
one time and could be used for 18000 different phones cerbu said 
in a nearby concrete building with bars on the windows which 
the officers said was a former securitate headquarters reporters 
were led up a narrow staircase to rooms filled with a series of 
cabinets each containing 12 small builtin cassette players in 
front were desks with switchboards 
in one room were desks topped with gray metal transcription 
machines attached to sets of headphones the fuses had been cut and 
some of the equipment was dismantled 
the officers said different departments of the securitate 
ordered the centers to monitor individuals then requested the 
tapes or manuscripts 
none of the cassettes had been found the officers said they 
said they did not know why 
cerbu said authorities had begun cutting power to the devices 
from the start of the revolution because we knew that with them 
the orders of commanders of troops in the revolution could be 
overheard 
the armed forces sided with popular demonstrators to oust 
ceausescu 
the military knew some of the listening rooms existed and 
technical staff at some of the centers alerted them to others he 
said 
the fate of the securitate is one of the most hotly discussed 
issues in romania only a handful of the 15000 fulltime officers 
of the secret police have been put on trial and officials provided 
few details on the dismantling of the security force in the first 
two months after the revolution 
in recent days however the defense ministry has said more than 
3500 senior members of the force have been dismissed and 
staterun tv has shown eavesdropping centers in various cities

a private florida school whose two owners paid 
themselves 12 million over four years was accused monday of 
doctoring documents in order to boost income from federal 
guaranteed student loans 
the staff of the senate permanent investigations subcommittee 
found evidence suggesting intentional abuse of the guaranteed 
student loan system by american career training school said 
chief investigator david b buckley 
joseph a calareso president of acts located in pompano beach 
fla was subpoenaed to testify before the subcommittee but refused 
to answer all but preliminary questions on grounds of possible 
selfincrimination 
investigators said the school was targeted only because it had a 
substantial number of student loans 
im afraid they are just scratching the surface of a 
mountain of problems in the aid programs said sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the subcommittee 
buckley and investigator grace t mcphearson said their analysis 
of acts records showed that in 1986 through 1989 90 percent of 
students at the school including some who did not meet federal 
requirements received federal aid but that only 16 percent 
completed their courses 
during that time 150 million in loans were guaranteed for 
60000 acts students calareso and his brother james who own the 
school paid themselves 12 million in salary and stock dividends 
investigators said 
the eightyearold school offers training for people aspiring to 
careers as travel agents motel operators and other travelrelated 
jobs it uses a combination homecampus system involving 20 mailed 
lessons and a threeweek stint on campus 
in 1985 the first year it was eligible to participate in 
federal studentloan programs the schools revenues increased by 
800 percent to 55 million investigators testified revenues 
reached 345 million in 1989 
brenda ann brandon completed the fiveweek acts program before 
going to work for the school once the school was certified for 
participation in federal studentloan programs she was put in 
charge of student aid 
we the employees of the financialaid office were instructed 
by joseph calareso to contact every new student even cash 
students and try and get them to finance their education through a 
guaranteed student loan mrs brandon said 
this way the school was guaranteed to receive the full 
tuition up front she continued if a cash student is on a 
payment plan there is a lower probability that the school will 
receive all of the tuition because the majority of the students 
enrolled never complete the course with a loan the school gets 
the money early on 
during her time as an employee of the school she quit in 1988 
mrs brandon said there was never a review of records by state 
federal or outside agencies that was based on accurate information 
mrs brandon and subcommittee investigators said the school also 
submitted loan applications on behalf of students who were not 
qualified by education to receive federal aid 
angela m jones of swansea sc said that in 1987 she applied 
for admission to acts and soon received a 2415 student loan 
check she said she was told to endorse the check and return it to 
the school and was assured that it would never be deposited she 
later received a second check to cover her oncampus training 
ms jones said she was never able to complete the course because 
the school failed to mail books and half her correspondence 
lessons but the school insisted she still was liable for the full 
cost

until recently the army has kept quiet about a 
scientists success in engineering the gene for spider silk into a 
bacteria that produces a fiber stronger than a silkworms silk 
indeed far stronger than steel 
now the secret is out 
the military hopes to use the new fabric for bulletproof vests 
helmets parachute cords and other strong light equipment and the 
folks on new yorks seventh avenue may want to take notice silk 
stockings may come back too 
the silk industry has long relied on the costly and 
timeconsuming farming of silkworms a cultural and commercial 
tradition in china and japan where the creatures have been 
domesticated for centuries 
but the mass production of spider silk may someday mean a 
decline in the cost of commercial silk according to stephen 
lombardi the 28yearold civilian molecular biologist credited 
with the invention 
right now theyre still using the old way of doing it with a 
lot of man hours spent babysitting silkworms lombardi said 
this process is very simple and cheap our intent was to mass 
produce large quantities of silk cheaply and theres no reason why 
the general public shouldnt have access to the technology 
that technology refers to lombardis success in isolating the 
gene that produces silk in the golden orb weaver spider and 
engineering the gene into bacteria the bacteria in turn produces a 
spider silk protein 
until now spiders have never been an efficient source of silk 
production unlike silkworms they have not been domesticated and 
rarely can be kept alive long enough to produce quantities of silk 
but with lombardis process no spiders are needed 
jack shamash president of the new yorkbased shamash and sons 
the countrys largest silk importers says the idea that spider 
silk could replace silkworms is a lot of nonsense 
the united states has virtually no silk production and therefore 
lacks the needed network of factories and weavers to transform 
available spider silk into fabrics he said 
youll have to build a whole billiondollar industry said 
shamash i very much doubt it could displace silk on the open 
market 
lombardi countered that his method of producing spider silk 
involves sophisticated biotechnology but wouldnt require new 
factories or weavers existing fiberspinning technology could be 
used on the spider silk he said 
lombardi who works at the armys sprawling research laboratory 
in natick south of boston devised his method of replicating 
spider silk last spring he presented a brief report last week at 
the american association for the advancement of science convention 
in new orleans and will detail his discovery at an american 
chemical society meeting here in april 
lombardi said scientists have studied spider silk for years in 
an effort to produce it in greater quantities natives of new 
guinea and madagascar have used spider silk to make fishing drop 
lines for centuries the covering of a hot air balloon on display 
at the worlds fair was made of spider silk 
spider silk has five to 10 times the tensile strength of steel 
and can be stretched about 18 percent without breaking because of 
its toughness spider silk is likely to replace kevlar as the 
militarys choice for bulletproof vests lombardi said 
spider silk is also envisioned for parachute cording light 
tents uniforms and even some fiber optic material and while silk 
bulletproof vests may not sound very macho to the average american 
soldier lombardi said they will be more lightweight and even more 
effective 
remember there are species of spider in madagascar that have 
ensnared small birds he said its a tough fabric

a powersharing agreement forced upon the 
evenly divided republicans and democrats in the indiana house is 
breaking down into bickering and rules fights and may be heading 
for a messy divorce 
it isnt working because apparently there is a basic lack of 
trust said state rep stephen c moberly a republican who for 
years had warned his colleagues about the potential problems in a 
house without a clear majority 
the republicans dont trust the democratic speaker and the 
democrats dont trust the republican speaker because both can 
manipulate the rules to help their party and their agenda said 
moberly 
under the powersharing agreement approved in november 1988 
after an election produced the halfandhalf split the 100seat 
house has republican and democratic speakers who preside on 
alternate days and each house committee has a chairman from each 
party 
that agreement takes a twothirds vote to change and remains in 
effect despite the defection monday of rep frank newkirk from the 
democratic to republican party which gave the gop an edge in 
voting 
legislative leaders boasted at the end of the 1989 session that 
the arrangement worked far better than many had predicted but this 
year the same leaders concede the setup is showing signs of strain 
over the last couple of days its degenerated republican 
house speaker paul s mannweiler said last week i think its 
just sort of unraveled 
democratic speaker michael k phillips isnt as pessimistic but 
concedes the system has its problems 
the arrangements working smoothly we just disagree on the 
process said phillips still nobodys jumped over the front 
desk to try to take over the speakers chair 
both speakers du jour agree there have been problems in 
recent days although neither is willing to share the blame 
mannweiler believes the problems began when the 13 democrats on 
the 26member house ways and means committee refused to attend a 
weeks worth of committee hearings recently because the democrats 
didnt want to consider republicansponsored bills 
that doomed most of the bills except one that republicans 
forced out of committee by using a rarely successful blast motion 
to remove a welfare caseworker bill from the committees 
jurisdiction and send the measure directly to the floor 
mannweiler also faults phillips for failing one day last week to 
hand down 21 committee reports on republican bills that delayed 
consideration of the bills so they couldnt be amended by the full 
house on a day when mannweiler was presiding 
at the same time democrats maintain a list of alleged misdeeds 
by republicans 
last week after democrats blocked a republican bill to cut the 
auto excise tax the gop retaliated with a rare maneuver in which 
they called back for consideration a democratic bill that had 
already been amended on the house floor and removed their 
opponents excise tax proposal from the measure 
phillips protested charging mannweiler with an unprecedented 
and clearly erroneous interpretation of the rules and precedents 
of the house 
democrats also accused republicans of vultureous conduct 
claiming the gop was taking advantage of a temporary 5049 
numerical edge resulting from the death last week of rep g edward 
cook whose successor will be chosen march 4 that margin grew to 
5148 with newkirks defection 
the republicans continue to think they can rewrite the rules 
to satisfy their needs said phillips i also think they would 
not even be attempting this if ed cook were alive and in his seat 
democrats also criticized republicans request last week for an 
attorney generals opinion to determine if 50 votes instead of the 
normal constitutional majority of 51 would be enough to pass a 
bill while the house temporarily has 99 members 
the maneuvering and rare uses of house rules have created an 
uneasy atmosphere house members can regularly be seen flipping 
through the chambers 88page rule book to determine if one side is 
taking advantage of the other 
that is likely to continue during the final six working days of 
the session which must be completed by march 15 
phillips threatened retaliation last week 
you live by the rules you die by the rules he warned 
republicans

czechoslovak president vaclav havel said he and 
president mikhail s gorbachev established a new basis for 
relations monday and said all soviet troops would be withdrawn from 
czechoslovakia by july 1 1991 
havel the playwright and opposition leader who scripted his 
countrys peaceful return to democracy late last year met with 
gorbachev after arriving on his first official visit to the soviet 
union since he was elected dec 29 as his countrys first 
noncommunist president in 41 years 
the visit coincided with the start of the withdrawal of 73500 
soviet troops still in czechoslovakia 22 years after moscow sent 
its military forces to crush the prague spring reforms 
havel flew to moscow for talks with gorbachev just three days 
after returning from the united states where he met with president 
bush 
at a news conference following the kremlin meeting havel called 
the joint declaration he had signed earlier with gorbachev a very 
important document that would pave the way for a new kind of 
cooperation 
the declaration calls for relations to be developed on the 
basis of equality and complete mutual respect for each others 
state sovereignty tass reported 
gorbachev and havel looked on soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and foreign minister jiri dienstbier of czechoslovakia 
signed the agreement concluded in prague on feb 22 outlining the 
troop withdrawal 
havel said he hoped all of the troops would return to the soviet 
union within one year but that the agreement stipulated they must 
be gone by july 1 1991 
soviet troops spearheaded the 1968 warsaw pact invasion that 
crushed the reforms 
moscow has 73500 soldiers 1220 tanks 2505 armored vehicles 
77 combat aircraft and 146 helicopters stationed on czechoslovak 
soil 
havel said czechoslovakia had offered to help the soviet union 
with the withdrawal by providing free rail and water transport of 
men and equipment and assistance in constructing housing for the 
soldiers in the soviet union where there is a chronic shortage of 
apartments 
economic issues were also raised at plenary talks between 
officials of the two countries and havel said that czechoslovakia 
should not renew cooperation agreements that had been concluded by 
the previous communist government however economic matters were 
not the focus of the trip 
in addition to havel and dienstbier the czechoslovak delegation 
includes defense minister miroslav vacek and interior minister 
richard sacher who is interested in reducing the links between 
officials of his ministry and those of the soviet kgb operative on 
czechoslovak soil 
havel who spent five years in prison for his political 
activities against the totalitarian state an experience that is 
the source and strength of many of his writings appeared to be 
adjusting well to the role of a world statesmen 
he seemed at ease at the news conference and said that during 
his talks with bush and gorbachev that both leaders had recognized 
the special role that czechoslovakia had to play in the center of 
europe 
the czechoslovak model of a peaceful recovery of democracy has 
also won admirers among opposition movements from the soviet 
republic of moldavia to the three baltic republics which are 
pressing for independence from moscow 
during his meeting with gorbachev havel touched on the rapidly 
changing political situation in europe last week in washington he 
had called on the united states to support moves toward democratic 
reform in the soviet union as a contribution to stability in europe 
however he said that he had no specific message from bush for 
gorbachev 
the two leaders also discussed the rapid rapprochement of the 
two germanys 
havel said he told gorbachev the reunification of germany should 
be conducted in a way that would not complicate the whole 
european unification process but would rather service as a motor 
for that process 
on tuesday the former dissident is scheduled to meet with 
yelena bonner widow of andrei sakharov the nobel peace prize 
winner who was a source of inspiration for a generation of 
opposition activists in eastern europe

jesse l jackson announced monday he will not 
run for mayor of the dispirited nations capital but he refused 
to rule out a third bid for the democratic presidential nomination 
in 1992 
i want to continue to serve but not as mayor jackson said 
at present i believe that i may best serve by continuing work at 
a national level to change the direction of this country 
you have to almost predict a rerun of 88 said john white 
a former national party chairman who advised jackson in the late 
stages of his 1988 presidential bid 
jacksons political plans have been the subject of much 
conjecture since he moved to the district of columbia last april 
speculation about a jackson mayoral candidacy increased after mayor 
marion barrys arrest last month on a cocaine possession charge and 
subsequent enrollment in a substance abuse treatment program 
jackson said he would continue to support the districts efforts 
to become a state but he also said his rainbow coalition would 
press for action on issues at the national level including changes 
in federal tax law increased voter registration and expanding the 
federal governments housing programs 
jackson did not rule out another bid for the white house in 1992 
its premature said the civil rights leader we wont 
rule it in but its not the season for it 
a top jackson aide who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
suggested jacksons current plans could provide a springboard for 
another presidential effort 
its too early to tell too early to tell the aide said 
but if we pull statehood these other things together it gives 
us a lot of ways to jump and another national campaign is 
certainly one 
jackson said his decision not to run was made difficult by the 
respect we have for the many people who have encouraged us to 
run 
the district is divided and dispirited jackson said i 
want to be a part of the healing process my desire is to serve and 
uplift 
one local supporter said the twotime democratic presidential 
hopeful became convinced that a jackson mayoral campaign might not 
have widespread voter support 
jesse wasnt convinced that there was a unanimity of support 
for him a groundswell the supporter said he became aware 
that more and more people were thinking of him as something of an 
interloper 
a washington post poll released last week found barry was 
preferred by 25 percent of those surveyed while 19 percent said 
they would vote for jackson 
if barry were not in the race jackson would receive support 
from 26 percent of those questioned compared with 19 percent for 
city councilman john ray the poll based on interviews with 800 
registered voters had a margin of error of 4 percentage points 
ray a leading contender for the job said jacksons 
announcement takes a major player out of the race 
barrys reelection plans remain on hold as the mayor battles an 
eightcount indictment on cocaine possession and perjury charges 
filed against him earlier this month 
walter fauntroy the districts democratic nonvoting delegate 
to congress has said he will announce saturday whether to enter 
the mayoral race

former us officials who helped mount 
military and economic opposition to the nicaraguan government 
celebrated the defeat of daniel ortega on monday but credited the 
courage of the nicaraguan people as much as any us efforts 
the election triumph by violeta chamorro vindicates the 
struggle of many brave men and women said oliver north who had 
been a key figure in the reagan administrations effort to drive 
nicaraguas leftist government from power 
however former assistant secretary of state elliott abrams said 
that in a way we were totally responsible because we never gave 
up the struggle 
north the former national security council aide said of the 
nicaraguans without the bravery of those people the victory of 
democracy today would not have occurred this was an answer to 
the prayers of many people 
north who was convicted of three felonies for his role in the 
irancontra affair was a crucial figure in the reagan policy of 
providing military support for the contra rebels he was found 
guilty last year of shredding contrarelated documents and of 
concealing his role in aiding the rebels at a time when us 
involvement was barred 
veterans of the reagan campaign to support the contras were 
giddy on monday as they compared notes in phone calls to each other 
about what to many once seemed like a lost cause 
former assistant secretary of state elliott abrams joined two 
onetime aides otto reich and jonathan miller for a champagne 
lunch at an upscale restaurant to celebrate the news from managua 
more than most of his colleagues abrams credited american 
policy with the outcome 
asked how crucial the us role was abrams said in a sense 
we were totally responsible because we never gave up the struggle 
a lot of people wanted to give up but we never gave it up as soon 
as the nicaraguan people had a chance they got rid of their 
oppressors 
abrams predecessor at the state department tony motley said 
pressure from the contras as well as the us trade embargo 
contributed to the election result but through unwise policies he 
said the sandinistas showed themselves to be fully capable of 
screwing up the situation they inherited 
miller who served with north at the national security council 
said im just giddy more decisive than anything the united 
states might have done he said was the bravery and 
sophistication of the nicaraguan people 
said reich a former ambassador to venezuela we put some of 
our treasure and political prestige on the line but they the 
nicaraguans put their lives on the line this is a great day for 
democracy 
taking a different tack from the former reagan officials sen 
tom harkin diowa said the election results vindicated the peace 
plan drawn up in 1987 by costa rican president oscar arias a key 
element of that plan called for an end to us military aid to the 
contras 
sundays outcome he said offers dramatic proof of the 
success of the arias peace plan and the failure of the contra 
war six months after the peace plan was adopted congress agreed 
to cut off military aid to the contras ignoring reagan 
administration objections 
constantine menges a former latin america hand at the national 
security council said the courage and good sense of the 
nicaraguan people produced this result 
but he said the sandinistas should not be counted out yet he 
predicted government hardliners in managua will try to maintain 
dominance through use of the secret police the military and the 
party bureaucracy

riot police used tear gas and stun 
grenades monday to stop student protesters from reaching the 
presidential office where the government discussed an economic 
crisis that is provoking increased dissent 
president felix houphouetboigny chaired the meeting with 
workers and employers who reportedly reacted negatively to his 
proposals for more austerity measures 
a delegate at the meeting said houphouetboigny told them he was 
postponing a national council meeting to consider their response 
the council of 2000 delegates from organizations and interest 
groups including trade unions businesses and legislators 
originally was to meet monday 
the delegate who requested anonymity said the meeting was 
particularly disturbed by a proposal to increase a solidarity 
tax on income from 1 percent to 10 percent 
a foreign journalist watched a carload of policemen strew tear 
gas grenades along the route to the presidential palace before 
houphouetboigny drove up 
while they met about 200 students ran through downtown abidjan 
demanding the release of detained colleagues and freedom of 
expression they also demanded a meeting with the president 
riot police fired tear gas and hurled a stun grenade in a noisy 
explosion heard throughout the city center scattering the 
frightened protesters 
at the national university of ivory coast campus in cocody 
suburb students said police fired tear gas to disperse about 150 
students who were shouting slogans and demanding their right to 
dissent 
in the residential suburb of adjame police beat up students and 
children who set up a blockade outside the marketplace witnesses 
said 
witnesses said police also fired tear gas and hurled stun 
grenades at students in yopougon a working class suburb where the 
urest began feb 19 when they refused to board three buses going 
from their dormitories to the main university campus three miles 
away 
students said they were observing a boycott defying an appeal 
by the president sunday night for the unrest to end and classes to 
resume 
houphouetboigny made the call after he ordered the release of 
137 students who were beaten and detained saturday after they ended 
a 10hour occupation of st pauls roman catholic cathedral in the 
capitals center 
students say many more students remain in detention the 
government says all protesters have been freed 
the students said they are protesting social injustices best 
illustrated by the system of grants 
some cabinet ministers sons and other highranking 
government officials children who drive to the university in bmws 
are given grants we whose parents are poor farmers whose incomes 
have been halved do not get grants a militant student leader 
charged 
in october houphouetboigny was forced to halve prices for 
cocoa and coffee promised to ivorian farmers after years of 
subsidizing them 
in another telling sign of the cumulative effects of a 
10yearold recession the government slashed salaries of employees 
of staterun companies by 30 percent this month other government 
employees have suffered an eightyear wage freeze 
students are demanding that the salaries of cabinet ministers 
also be cut by 30 percent sources close to the government said 
monday that the president is considering their demand 
houphouetboigny has not been receptive to demands that he 
introduce a multiparty state in this west african nation that he 
has ruled since it became independent from france in 1960 
while other authoritarian governments close to the ivory coast 
have bowed to popular pressure and are introducing democratic 
reforms such as the military government of guinea 
houphouetboigny has insisted that a multiparty system encourages 
tribal divisions and endangers national unity

the postal service is not violating 
freespeech rights by banning everyone from the red cross to 
political extremists from soliciting donations outside most post 
offices the supreme court was told monday 
justice department lawyer john roberts jr representing the 
postal service said the area outside suburban or rural post 
offices is not a traditional public forum as is the city 
sidewalk outside an urban post office 
most of the nations 35000 post offices have their own 
sidewalks surrounded by parking lots this property is dedicated 
to the postal services use roberts contended its not just 
like a city sidewalk where freespeech rights must be considered 
but washington lawyer jay sekulow disagreed the right to 
solicit classic political speech is not subject to 
architectural design he said a moat cannot be created by this 
intervening parking lot 
at issue in a case from bowie md is a federal regulation 
banning soliciting electioneering collecting debts vending and 
advertising on postal service property 
a federal appeals court ruled in the bowie case that the 
regulation is unconstitutional but other courts have upheld it in 
other cases 
sekulows clients marsha kokinda and kevin pearl were arrested 
aug 6 1986 after they refused to stop soliciting contributions 
and distributing literature from a table on the sidewalk just 
outside the bowie post office 
the two are volunteers for the national democratic policy 
committee the political arm of an organization headed by political 
extremist lyndon larouche 
they were convicted of violating the federal regulation although 
there was no evidence they had blocked or interfered with people 
entering and leaving the post office about 30 patrons had 
complained about the couples presence 
would there have been any complaints if it were the red 
cross justice anthony m kennedy asked the justice department 
lawyer 
probably not roberts answered although adding that the 
blanket ban on soliciting prevents postal officials from favoring 
some groups over others 
roberts said the regulation is not being enforced against people 
who hand out leaflets seek petition signatures or picket but only 
against those who solicit immediate contributions 
its when you let them ask for money that the crowds come 
out he said 
but roberts said the postal service would not violate 
freespeech rights if it chose to banish from its property all 
activities not linked directly to postal business 
sekulow argued that the postal service never has elected to make 
its property an enclave immune from the first amendment 
when justice sandra day oconnor asked if the postal service 
must allow panhandling on its sidewalks sekulow said beggars have 
the same freespeech rights as anyone else subject to the same 
time place and manner regulations 
oconnor also asked roberts why such time place and manner 
regulations and not a total ban would not be an effective way 
to prevent congestion or inconvenience 
several other justices also voiced concern over the sweep of a 
blanket ban 
why isnt it the regulation overbroad justice byron r 
white asked 
and justice john paul stevens asked is there a history of a 
problem outside the buildings one might argue it the 
regulation is overbroad 
the case is us vs kokinda 882031

the united nations on monday released a largely 
inconclusive report on the human rights situation in iran based on 
the first visit by a special un investigator since it came under 
international scrutiny in 1984 
the 76page report compiled by salvadoran jurist reynaldo 
galindo pohl under a mandate from the un human rights commission 
cites evidence of torture and other gross violations along with 
denials 
but he concedes that in many cases it was not possible to 
conduct an indepth examination during the weeklong stay last 
month and suggests a renewal of his mandate and another visit 
the report lists the names of about 700 people allegedly 
executed in iran most of them in the past two years along with 39 
people alleged to have been executed by the iraqbased mujahedeen 
resistance iranian media reports have said that more than 1300 
were executed in iran in slightly less than one year and western 
human rights groups have carried much higher estimates 
galindo pohl said that barring specific proof he rules out 
allegations that political prisoners had been executed under false 
charges of drug trafficking 
he said there had been no public executions for five months 
although probably hundreds are still awaiting execution he 
added that he requested clemency for them and that he gained the 
impression that this harsh policy of executions could become a 
good deal less severe 
quoting testimony from several unidentified iranians the report 
refers to one witness who said five of his seven children were 
executed as suspected mujahedeen members in an alleged wave of 
executions of 20000 prisoners since the end of the iraniraq war 
two sons were still in prison one of them sick and the other 
paralyzed as the result of torture according to the witness 
but the report also notes that several people told the 
investigator that they had been wrongly listed by the mujahedeen as 
victims of executions it also included a list of various alleged 
acts of terrorism by the mujahedeen it said some witnesses said 
they had been induced to show selfinflicted marks of torture to 
enhance the false propaganda spread by the resistance 
the mujahedeen in a statement sent to news agencies denounced 
the report as the result of an ominous pact between the un 
center for human rights and the most abominable regime of our 
times galindo pohl the statement said takes the side of the 
executioner rather than the victim 
describing a visit to tehrans notorious evin prison galindo 
pohl said he was welcomed by a choir and a small band made up of 
prisoners in the presence of evin officials he talked to the 
former secretary general of the outlawed tudeh party who told of 
being tortured and showed his partially paralyzed hands and crushed 
fingers 
prisoners in the womens section told galindo pohl they had not 
been tortured or subjected to ill treatment 
in addition to the former tudeh leader the report lists six 
other witnesses as describing having undergone torture one said 
that about 90 percent of all evin prison inmates had been either 
severely tortured or submitted to treatment akin to torture 
but the report also listed four other witnesses in addition to 
the evin women prisoners who said they had never seen or heard of 
torture cases except occasional slapping

more than 20000 people chanting 
democracy and liberty massed in the capital monday in a 
rally against the ruling communist party 
the peaceful demonstration was the second in two straight days 
at least 150000 people gathered sunday in sofia chanting down 
with the communist party in the largest rally since the toppling 
of hardline leader todor zhivkov in november 
during mondays protest the crowd which carried lighted 
candles and jangled their keys gathered again in the square in 
front of the communist party headquarters in response to an appeal 
of the union of democratic forces grouping major opposition 
movements 
both rallies were staged despite decisions of the partys 
supreme council on friday to ban communist cells at the workplace 
postpone general elections from may to june the opposition had 
sought a delay until november to give it time to prepare and call 
foreign observers to monitor the voting 
while professing a commitment to democracy the communist party 
is in sole control of government and appears less willing to 
compromise with opposition forces than sister parties in soviet 
bloc countries further on the path to pluralism 
participants at the monday rally said the opposition planned to 
continue to organize such demonstrations as a way to pressure the 
communist party into accepting its demands for full democracy at 
talks between the two sides that opened in early january 
also monday a congress of the bulgarian communist youth union 
decided to split into three groups with the majority of the 
delegates voting for the setting up of a new independent youth 
organization called bulgarian democratic youth 
a second splinter group announced plans to form another 
independent organization called the youth confederation while 
a third smaller group said it wanted to form a youth forum for 
socialism which would maintain its links with the ruling 
communist party

violeta chamorros presidential victory in 
nicaragua brought elation on capitol hill on monday but also 
heightened congress problem of finding foreign aid money for new 
democracies 
we must provide her new government with aid and lets not kid 
ourselves it will take big bucks said senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan she needs our help and she deserves it 
nobody said democracy was cheap added foreign affairs 
committee chairman dante fascell dfla 
house speaker thomas foley dwash while not mentioning a 
specific aid figures said the united states might start by sending 
amounts similar to past aid to the antisandinista contra rebels 
estimates ranged from 100 million to 300 million as the us 
share of a multilateral package that could provide 1 billion for 
nicaragua 
but others cautioned that with a growing line of potential new 
foreign aid recipients poland hungary czechoslovakia panama 
and others it would be difficult to promise new money when the 
budget already is falling short 
its not realistic to expect the result of all this is going 
to be a tripling of foreign aid said rep mickey edwards 
rokla the senior gop member of the foreign aid subcommittee 
the american people arent going to support it 
this year the united states will send about 98 billion in 
military economic and development aid to several dozen friendly 
countries around the globe the lions share 51 billion goes to 
israel and egypt as a reward for entering into the camp david peace 
process the bush administration has asked for a slight increase in 
the total to 101 billion for 1991 
rep stephen solarz dny said he hoped the united states 
could come up with 200 million to 300 million as a contribution 
to a billiondollar international emergency aid program for 
nicaragua similar to those aiding the philippines and emerging 
democracies in eastern europe the money should be taken out of the 
us defense budget he said 
dole used the occasion of chamorros win over leftist sandinista 
president daniel ortega on sunday to renew his proposal to alter 
the nations foreign aid priorities beginning with the two largest 
recipients israel and egypt 
the only way were going to pay for new aid to nicaragua 
panama czechoslovakia is to look to the foreign aid budget that 
now exists and make some tough calls dole said in a senate 
floor speech 
but that proposal has so far met with stiff opposition and 
foley cautioned that nicaragua should not automatically be given 
priority over current recipients of us aid 
lawmakers overwhelmingly supported president bushs call for a 
speedy lifting of trade sanctions and many called for the 
immediate sending of a us ambassador to managua the sanctions 
were imposed in 1985 and the american ambassador was sent home in 
1988 
many of the legislators observed that chamorros win had 
accelerated an already breathtaking downfall of communism around 
the world 
asked his reaction edwards said it was astonishment its 
happening from one end of the world to the other the tyrants are 
being swept out 
it is yet another example of the desire for democratic 
government that is being courageously expressed by people 
throughout the world living under totalitarian regimes said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
several members of congress also noted that the demise of the 
sandinista government could have an added benefit in nearby el 
salvador where leftist fmln guerrillas fighting the elected 
government have relied on managua for weapons and support 
at the same time the lawmakers warned that chamorro faces a 
difficult road in rebuilding her nations economy moving her 
country out of war and maintaining her political coalition 
much remains to be done before democracy can be said to have 
been established in nicaragua said house minority leader robert 
michel rill but this victory is a splendid beginning 
from the other side of the political spectrum rep sam 
gejdenson dconn called the outcome an amazing step forward 
for the western hemisphere and long overdue 
gejdenson a member of the house foreign affairs committee 
attributed chamorros victory to her call for an end to the 
military draft the countrys economy devastated by a decade of 
civil war and us economic sanctions and a popular belief that 
she could best demobilize the antisandinista contra rebels

new york mayor david n dinkins pronounced 
conservatism dead monday saying that as communist governments fail 
worldwide the far right has no reason to exist 
the crest of the conservative flood has passed dinkins a 
democrat said in a speech to the national press club the 
republicans still occupy the white house but the conservative 
coalition has lost its way 
dinkins acknowledged that reporters may not believe him and 
may not be ready to report what ive said as fact but hopefully 
soon you will recognize that what i say is true 
in a sometimes poetic speech that compared conservatives to 
holograms images of bent light that vanish as we walk by and 
their cause to a spent volcano dinkins argued that revolutions in 
eastern europe and the soviet union herald the death of communism 
that in turn mean the end of us conservatives he said 
without communism they have no enemy and without an enemy 
they have no energy he said 
dinkins pointed to his own 2monthold administration as 
evidence that government can be sensitive to the needs and 
aspirations of all our people 
he also predicted that the political right will not be able to 
win office by running as antiabortionists citing as proof his 
election and alluding to the elections of new jersey gov james 
florio and virginia gov douglas wilder 
who would have thought a year ago that even the chairman of 
the republican national committee would claim to be agnostic on 
abortion he asked the effort to make god a partisan political 
being has failed she will judge our performance later 
dinkins was noncommittal about the rev jesse jacksons 
announcement monday that he will not run for district of columbia 
mayor

the drop that has rocked the tokyo stock 
exchange during the past few days has so far caused little more 
than a ripple on wall street 
analysts see plenty of cause for caution about the us 
financial outlook as a result of the japanese markets slide which 
intensified monday with its secondlargest point decline ever 
but the worries of many us observers have been tempered by a 
belief that the selling might prove to be primarily a 
correction of speculative enthusiasm that has been unique to 
tokyo trading for years 
with a 45 percent decline monday the nikkei average of 225 
japanese stocks extended its fall since the start of 1990 to more 
than 14 percent 
in new york by contrast the dow jones average of 30 
industrials rose 3829 points to 260248 on monday narrowing its 
loss for the year to date to 55 percent 
the comparatively better performance by american stocks during 
that period is something of a rarity 
two decades ago the leading indexes of american and japanese 
stocks stood at about the same absolute level by the end of 1989 
riding the crest of their countrys long industrial and commercial 
boom japanese prices were about 12 times higher than their us 
counterparts 
along the way shares in tokyo reached levels considered 
outlandish by traditional wall street standards such as the ratio 
of stock prices to the earnings per share of the companies involved 
recently priceearnings ratios in japan have been as high as 60 
to one compared with about 12 to one in the united states despite 
numerous arguments that the figures arent directly comparable and 
that japanese business has earned the extra recognition many us 
analysts have remained unconvinced 
american investors have thought for at least five years that 
the tokyo market was grossly overvalued said robert stovall 
president of the new york money management firm 
stovalltwentyfirst advisors 
the drop in tokyo has been accompanied by a fierce debate over 
the computerdriven strategies known as program trading with 
expectations increasing that japanese officials will soon move to 
curtail this type of activity 
thats all too familiar to participants in the american markets 
where similar trading which critics say makes stock prices more 
volatile has stirred similar controversy for several years 
i think its exactly the same thing said suresh bhirud an 
analyst at oppenheimer amp co in new york 
many american analysts acknowledge that us views of the 
japanese market are influenced by a streak of international 
competitiveness if not jealousy they also point out that as 
japanese stocks have slumped the dollar has risen in value against 
the yen in world currency markets 
its good for the dollar and its good for the american 
psyche stovall said the japanese are proving to be human 
whatever emotional satisfaction it may offer in american 
financial circles however there is also widespread concern that 
the tokyo decline may have a widening negative impact if it 
continues much longer 
for starters a pinch on japanese investors could induce them to 
pull money out of markets around the world such as the us 
treasury bond market where they have been playing an active role 
in addition analysts say the drop in the tokyo market has been 
prompted by rising interest rates in many of the worlds financial 
capitals that may be increasing the odds of a worldwide recession 
thom brown an analyst at rutherford browth amp catherwood inc 
in philadelphia says it would be reckless to ignore trouble 
warnings about the japanese market simply because they have proved 
incorrect so far 
to reiterate this warning does sound like crying wolf he 
said but remember the fable the wolf finally arrived

a vial containing krypton 79 gas that 
was to be injected into a nuclear reactor accidentally broke but no 
employees were contaminated officials reported monday 
nine people were in the confinement dome of the creysmalville 
reactor sunday when the vial of radioactive gas broke the central 
ionizing radiation protection service a government agency said

infirmary showed the slightest contamination and these people 
resumed their work normally monday morning the agencys 
statement said

the head of the food and drug administration 
said monday the agency has taken steps to minimize the chances that 
faulty medical devices ever reach consumers 
we believe that the agencys procedures have matured 
significantly over the last decade since the fda approved a 
mechanical heart valve made by shiley inc that later was removed 
from the market after reports of fatal malfunctions said acting 
fda commissioner james benson 
this maturation minimizes the possibility that faulty devices 
can reach the market he told members of the house energy and 
commerce investigations subcommittee 
but rep john dingell dmich chairman of the panel said 
we have no assurance that the conditions at the fda which 
permitted this valve to enter the market and stay for far too long 
have been corrected 
he charged that the fda moved too slowly against the heart valve 
and exposed hundreds of patients to unnecessary risk 
among the steps the fda said it has taken are stronger criteria 
for approving implantable devices better scientific analysis in 
the approval process and an improved earlywarning system for 
detecting problems with devices already on the market he said 
a report by the subcommittees majority staff raised quesions 
about the fdas willingness and ability to fulfill its regulatory 
mandate to protect public health and charged that shiley owned 
by pfizer inc misled the agency and failed to keep the fda 
informed of malfunction reports 
pfizer officials denied those charges robert fauteux a 
spokesman for the company said we met the obligations under the 
law 
republican members of the subcommittee while concerned about 
the shiley valve said they were also concerned that report failed 
to recognize the inherent risks of medical devices and that the 
heart valve has saved the lives of tens of thousands of patients 
the risks of the shiley valve must be considered with a great 
deal of caution said rep thomas bliley rva we must to 
everything possible to avoid alarming patients who are living 
with the device 
shileys convexoconcave 60degree heart valve approved in 
april 1979 has been implanted in 85000 people including about 
40000 in the united states after reports of malfunctions and 
product withdrawals shiley removed it from the market in november 
1986 
about 4000 of shileys 70degree valves have been implanted in 
patients overseas that device was never marketed in the united 
states 
shiley has reported to the fda a total of 295 fractures of the 
60degree valve with 178 deaths resulting and 94 fractures and 70 
deaths involving the 70degree valve according to the 
subcommittees report 
the valve consists of a disc inside a metal ring covered by a 
teflon sewing ring that is sutured to the heart to hold the valve 
in place the disc pivoting on two thin metal struts opens to 
either a 60degree or 70degree angle to allow blood to flow 
through and then closes 
the fractures have occurred in the struts when a fracture 
occurs the disc escapes from the ring allowing an uncontrollable 
blood flow through the heart 
benson said that when the fda approved the mechanical valve 
agency officials were aware of the strut fracture problems with the 
shiley valve but they believed it produced fewer lifethreatening 
bloodclot complications than oldermodel valves on the market 
after evaluating the clinical data submitted by shiley the 
agency concluded that this advantage outweighed or at least 
balanced the strut fracture problem benson said 
but in june 1984 the fda performed its own analysis and 
determined that the shiley valve did not decrease bloodclotting 
complications 
responding to criticism that the fda notified physicians rather 
than patients about the risk of strut fracture in the valves 
benson said the agency continues to believe the informing 
physicians is most appropriate since they can judge the extent to 
which a warning causes anxiety in a patient 
however frederick barbee of minong wis whose wife died after 
her valve fractured said that if he had known about the risks he 
might have been able to get his wife appropriate medical care 
faster and save her life

you dont get a pep course before becoming a parent and kids

to your kids when to listen where to draw the line and when to 
get help

enforcement all can help us turn the tide on drug and alcohol 
abuse but none can take a parents place drug education must 
begin at home and in the neighborhood long before the classroom 
i want to urge parents everywhere to read growing up drug 
free said bush who was also joined at the publication ceremony 
by secretary of education lauro f cavazos 
katie bell and most of the other children were from oakview 
elementary school in fairfax county va

several thousand east germans applied monday 
for the first benefits their government has ever given the 
unemployed whose ranks may swell dramatically as the nation moves 
toward capitalism 
labor officials said the number of applicants was much smaller 
than anticipated but noted that economic reforms expected to cost 
hundreds of thousands of jobs have yet to be made 
at the moment east germany has a severe labor shortage because 
skilled workers continue leaving for west germany industrial 
production has slowed and the nation is threatened with financial 
collapse 
west germany has offered to bail out the east germans by making 
its strong deutschmark the currency of both countries but only on 
condition east germany adopt a market economy 
no final decision on monetary union and the economic reforms is 
planned until after east germanys first free elections march 18 
but a decisive shift toward western economic practices is expected 
soon afterward 
economists say more competitive western methods will force many 
east german factories to close or lay off employees which could 
increase unemployment among the 9 million workers to 15 percent 
within months 
finance ministry officials proposed monday that laws be altered 
to create more incentive for private enterprise by reducing income 
tax rates that require entrepreneurs to pay up to 95 percent of 
profits to the government 
lower taxes also would encourage formation of small and 
mediumsized businesses which could help reduce unemployment 
meanwhile the east german news agency adn reported only about 
10000 people took part in regular monday demonstrations in leipzig 
that started the motor of east german reform in october with more 
than 100000 marchers weekly 
the numbers of monday demonstrators have dwindled in recent 
weeks as campaigning for march 18 elections has gotten under way 
at the weekly negotiations with opposition groups defense 
minister theodor hoffmann said reducing the size of east germanys 
army would only increase the number of unemployed 
neues deutschland the communist party newspaper proposed 
monday that compulsory military service be ended in both germanys 
and that a reunited germany be demilitarized 
east germany has experienced some unemployment throughout its 
40year history but authorities would not acknowledge the problem 
because it contradicted communist ideology 
on monday labor agency offices began taking applications for 
financial aid to the unemployed under regulations adopted feb 9 
they provide monthly payments of threequarters of previous 
income made up of 500 east german marks about 100 at the 
official exchange rate from the government and a contribution from 
the applicants last employer 
labor agency statistics indicate 7500 east germans are out of 
work but unofficial estimates put the number at 10 times that 
about 25000 people lost their jobs when the government disbanded 
the secret police under pressure from prodemocracy groups 
officials said they were not certain how many east germans 
applied for jobless benefits monday since people must apply at 
local offices hroughout the country 
only a few dozen applicants were at the east berlin office on 
rosa luxemburg street in contrast with the 4000 the labor 
ministry had expected 
we are completely surprised that so few have come said 
joachim guenter spokesman for the labor and wages ministry 
brigitte schneider a 52yearold teacher said she had been 
denied work in her profession because she was considered a 
traitor for not returning from a visit to west germany in 1988 
she came back later that year but was forced to take a job with 
a music publishing enterprise she quit in january 
im trying to get a little money as i dont know how else i 
will get by she said ms schneider said she was living off 
savings and now i have to worry about surviving 
although the official unemployment rate remains below 1 percent 
tens of thousands of people are in jobs that will be made obsolete 
by better technology and others probably will be victims of more 
efficient operating procures 
the flight of 340000 people to west germany last year and more 
than 100000 more since jan 1 1990 has transferred the immediate 
unemployment problem to west germany where more than 2 million 
people are out of work 
a report monday by the west german institute for labor market 
and employment research said the continuing influx of east germans 
and ethnic german refugees would keep unemployment high despite an 
economic boom expected to bring 4 percent growth this year 
east german immigrants have been accepting jobs spurned by 
unemployed west germans contributing to growing problem of 
longterm joblessness

business executives told congress on monday 
that president bushs proposed increase of 500 million in spending 
on head start is a good first step but the administration should 
fully fund the preschool program 
the administration is calling for 19 billion for head start in 
the fiscal year beginning oct 1 an increase over the 14 billion 
appropriated last year 
but a representative of the national alliance of business told a 
house panel that the 25yearold program should have enough money 
to serve all eligible lowincome children 
to fully fund an enriched head start program that could serve 
3 4 and 5yearolds funding by the end of the decade would be 
in the range of 6 billion to 7 billion said william h 
kolberg president of the independent nonprofit alliance 
frank p doyle a senior vice president at general electric and 
a member of the committee for economic development stressed the 
importance of early intervention programs that better prepare 
lowincome children for the rigors of school 
we should attack the causes now rather than pay for the 
consequences later said doyle who called for not only 
increasing the number of slots in the program but improving the 
salaries of head start instructors and raising the programs 
overall quality 
rep james h scheuer dny chairman of the house joint 
economic subcommittee on education and health said head start was 
the pearl of the 1960s antipoverty program and bush realizes 
that is the case 
the president said in his budget submission for fiscal 1991 
research shows that head start children experience substantial 
immediate gains in cognitive growth school readiness and 
achievement 
but scheuer faulted the president saying the proposed funding 
did not match the rhetoric 
the democratic congressman noted that bushs defense budget 
includes more than 12 billion for the strategic defense 
initiative the b2 stealth bomber and moving the multiplewarhead 
mx nuclear missiles from fixed silos to railroad cars 
national security doesnt seem to mean having an educational 
society scheuer said 
the congressman suggested that businesses which spend about 30 
billion to 40 billion a year training employees might join with 
state and local governments to fund head start programs 
but that plan drew little support from the business executives 
im courageous but not foolhardy said kolberg who 
emphasized that the programs should continue under government 
control 
doyle said current training and health programs grab a major 
share of his companys spending and he was unsure whether the 
funds would be available for head start

government of angola said monday that violeta chamorros victory 
over leftist daniel ortega in nicaragua underscores the need for 
free and fair elections in his own country

denied the right of free and fair elections jeremias chitunda 
vice president of unita said in an interview 
chitunda in washington for meetings with bush administration 
officials and members of congress said that the results of 
sundays election in nicaragua underscores the fact there is no 
more reason why the marxists in angola should resist this 
process he said their friends have submitted to free and fair 
elections in nicaragua 
unita the national union for the total independence of angola 
has been fighing to force the government in luanda to share power

legislators from the baltics and other 
independentminded republics denounced a draft law monday that 
would let the kremlin take over their governments by declaring a 
state of emergency 
several deputies said the proposal is even more dangerous 
because another bill on strengthening the presidency would permit 
the nations leader to declare a state of emergency on his own 
president mikhail s gorbachev wants the legal authority to push 
through his program and halt the riots and ethnic strife that 
threaten his reforms 
some legislators said such laws must be drawn carefully to 
prevent a repetition of totalitarianism as legislator yuri 
afanasiev put it during sundays huge prodemocracy demonstration 
in moscow 
the emergency bill is among dozens proposed in the current 
twomonth session legislators said they have no legal guarantee 
only gorbachevs word that peaceful demands for reform will not be 
crushed 
under the proposed law the presidium of which gorbachev is 
chairman could suspend republican parliaments and city councils 
cancel decisions of local governments and take over an area in 
cases of mass disorder 
tass said legislators were expected to consider on tuesday the 
bill to expand presidential powers 
interfax a news service of moscow radio said a draft calling 
for election of a president by universal direct and equal suffrage 
had been submitted to the legislature 
aides to gorbachev had said earlier the first election would be 
held in the congress of peoples deputies at a meeting scheuled to 
start on tuesday the session has been postponed indefinitely 
interfax said a candidate would need a majority of the popular 
vote to win and the term would be five years the president would 
have broad powers including the right to declare war 
the contents of the bill reported by interfax could not be 
confirmed independently 
legislators said the emergency legislation presented by the 
council of ministers on monday was too broad 
a mechanism for preventing any groundless declaration of a 
state of emergency and abuse of power must be added said 
estonian legislator marju lauristin according to a tass report on 
the session in the council of the union one of two houses of the 
supreme soviet legislature 
vaidotas antanaitis a legislator from lithuania said such 
powers conflict with kremlin promises to give more autonomy to the 
republics and he demanded the draft be changed to say that their 
governments must agree with the imposition of a state of emergency 
the baltic states of lithuania latvia and estonia have been 
careful to avoid any violence that could be used as an excuse to 
crack down on their strong mass movements for independence they 
have used their parliaments to pass constitutional amendments 
allowing them to suspend national laws on their territories and 
latvia and lithuania led the union in legalizing multiple political 
parties 
but the balts demand for autonomy is hampered by the fact that 
azerbaijani authorities in january refused to agree to imposition 
of a state of emergency in their capital of baku even though 
rioters were killing dozens of armenians and forcing thousands 
others to flee for their lives gorbachev eventually ordered troops 
into the city in the face of strong local resistance and more than 
200 people died in the unrest in the southern caucasus 
the draft allows authorities during a state of emergency to hold 
troublemakers without trial for up to 30 days ban strikes and 
demonstrations fire the directors of factories and institutions 
limit the use of communications and movements of citizens place 
people under house arrest expel nonresidents and abolish 
unregistered organizations 
authorities could also protect key sites and order a curfew 
the draft law includes a clause allowing the presidium to give 
additional powers as needed to special administrative bodies of 
power set up during the state of emergency 
the kremlin took over the local government of nagornokarabakh 
from the republic of azerbaijan in january 1989 in hopes of halting 
months of ethnic violence in the disputed territory occupied 
largely by armenians but the kremlin committee was unable to solve 
the problems and the supreme soviet legislature last fall ordered 
the administration of the area returned to azerbaijan 
since then the entire republic of azerbaijan including 
nagornokarabakh exploded in ethnic and nationalist violence it 
remains under a state of emergency with soviet troops maintaining 
order 
legislators also discussed a proposed law that would transform 
the interior ministry troops who have been called out to halt 
ethnic violence in several republics in the last year into a 
volunteer force of professional troops the interior ministry now 
receives the majority of its soldiers from the red army draft and 
tass said the higher salaries required would quintuple the cost of 
the interior ministry forces 
reformers say an experienced force could be better trained to 
halt civic strife 
the draft also would allow interior troops to shoot armed 
opponents who refuse to drop their weapons and anyone using combat 
weapons to endanger the lives of citizens or the soldiers tass 
said interior troops are barred from shooting without warning and 
officials have said this restriction is too dangerous as violence 
grows 
legislators in the other house the council of nationalities 
reviewed the latest version of a draft law delegating to the 
republics more control over the economy including the right to set 
their own budgets regulate investment and conduct foreign trade 
tass said the draft already has been rejected twice for leaving 
too much power in the hands of moscow bureaucrats 
tass quoted valerian advadze of georgia as saying the republics 
should be deciding which powers to delegate to the national 
government not the other way around

britain and spain agreed monday to extend 
two treaties on criminal extradition and drugtrafficking to 
include gibraltar but remained stuck on the problem of sovereignty 
over the british colony at the southern tip of spain 
spain had claimed that britain turns a blind eye to 
tobaccosmuggling drug trafficking and moneylaundering in its 
225squaremile colony 
but british foreign secretary douglas hurd said after meeting 
with foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez of spain that 
fernandez ordonez offered no hard evidence of illegal 
activities 
hurd told reporters spain also was worried about gibraltars 
emergence as an offshore financial center with 25 banks and 3 
billion in deposits according to figures provided by the local 
government 
he said he explained that what gibraltar was doing was 
perfectly legitimate provided this was done under strict 
regulation as the key component and that regulation is being 
imposed by the gibraltarian authorities 
in a joint statement britain and spain said they agreed to 
extend their 1985 extradition treaty and their 1989 treaty on the 
prevention and suppression of drugtrafficking to gibraltar 
it said both parties expressed their wellknown positions on 
the question of sovereignty an indication little headway was 
made in the fifth round of talks since britain and spain agreed in 
november 1984 to discuss sovereignty 
spain had to cede gibraltar to britain under a 1713 treaty after 
losing the war of spanish succession and wants the limestone 
landmark back 
hurd said britain must respect the wishes of about 25000 
gibraltarians who voted overwhelmingly to remain under british 
control 
there will never be an adavance on gibraltar until sovereignty 
is returned to spain fernandez ordonez said

in a rare public reference to the israeli 
nuclear weapons program deputy prime minister shimon peres on 
monday cited the dimona nuclear reactor in the southern negev 
desert as one of israels strategic assets 
israeli leaders are usually tightlipped about israels nuclear 
capabilities saying only that israel will not be the first country 
to introduce nuclear weapons in the middle east 
referring to israels strategic position monday peres said 
we have everything that a small nation can have tell me are 
there any other countries that produce a plane of our own a 
missile of our own a tank of our own a missile boat of our own 
and we have something in dimona which is called textile 
industry he said jokingly dimona is the site of israels 
nuclear reactor 
there have been frequent reports in the past about israels 
nuclear capabilities including the development of nucleararmed 
intermediate range missiles 
peres leader of the centerleft labor party made the remarks 
in a question and answer session with members of the conference of 
presidents of major american jewish organizations 
in 1986 former dimona technician mordechai vanunu revealed 
details of israels nuclear program to the sunday times of london 
scientists questioned by the newspaper said vanunus information 
showed israel possessed the worlds sixth largest nuclear arsenal 
vanunu was seized in italy by israeli agents and brought to 
israel for trial he was sentenced to 18 years in prison after 
being convicted in 1988 of treason and espionage 
a report issued in 1987 by a major israeli research institute 
said that israel is far ahead of the arab countries in terms 
of the capacity to achieve a military nuclear capacity 
the report by tel aviv universitys jaffee center for strategic 
studies said that israel indeed does not possess nuclear 
weapons 
on the other hand and in view of its ongoing nuclear effort 
it has positioned itself to be capable of producing nuclear weapons 
in less time than it would take an arab country to do so the 
report concluded

president bush on monday invited 
representatives of the worlds largest industrial nations 
including the soviet union to a midapril conference in washington 
on global warming and other environmental problems 
the conference scheduled for april 1718 will be devoted to 
science and economics issues involved in the controversy 
according to a white house statement 
bush whose stance on global warming has been derided by 
environmentalists as too proindustry had promised such a session 
after his december meeting in malta with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
about 20 nations were invited to the conference including the 
worlds major industrial powers and several nations such as 
brazil with large land masses aides said 
the administration considers the conference a vital next step 
in a joint international approach to address possible changes in 
the global environment the white house statement said 
during his 1988 presidential campaign bush cited increasing 
evidence that the earths atmosphere was heating up because of 
the socalled greenhouse effect and promised to convene a 
global conference to find ways of dealing with the problem 
more recently however bush has softened his approach saying 
that the problem needs further study 
in a speech that provoked widespread criticism from his 
audience bush told an international conference on climatic change 
earlier this month that our policies must be consistent with 
economic growth 
he suggested that in some areas of the debate politics and 
opinion have outpaced the science 
white house spokesman stephen hart said that the april 
conference was an attempt to find some common ground among 
scientific environmental and economic interests and not the 
envirnomental summit bush had called for in his campaign 
the white house statement said bush had designated as 
cochairmen of the conference william reilly administrator of the 
environmental protection agency michael boskin the chairman of 
the white house council of economic advisers and dr d allan 
bromley the presidents science adviser 
hart said that invited nations were asked to send their leaders 
own top environmental scientific and economic advisers to the 
conference 
the global conference bush had advocated during his campaign 
would have included both the soviet union and china while the 
soviet union is on the list of those invited to the april 
gathering china is not 
we would have obvious problems in terms of inviting china 
because of the current political situation said a white house 
aide who asked for anonymity this conference is not 
allinclusive its just a cross section 
officials from several european countries including norway 
denmark and sweden have argued that enough scientific knowledge 
has been accumulated about the causes of global warming to warrant 
a commitment from industrial nations to at least stabilize carbon 
dioxide pollution at current levels over the next decade 
like a greenhouse such pollution traps heat and reflects it 
back to earth causing a warming of the atmosphere while there is 
little dispute that greenhouse gases are increasing there remains 
disagreement within the scientific community as to how severe the 
warming will become and what effect it might have on the earth

israel under pressure from 
the united states and the european community said monday it will 
reopen arab community colleges that had been ordered shut during 
most of the palestinian uprising 
but the army kept a closure order on six palestinian 
universities with an enrollment of more than 22000 students 
in the occupied west bank three arabs were shot and wounded by 
israeli troops during stonethrowing clashes in the town of 
tulkarem arab reports and israel radio said 
the most violent confrontation in the occupied territories in 
three weeks occurred in the gaza strip where arab reports said 
soldiers shot and wounded 28 palestinians with lead or plastic 
bullets including 22 in rafah 
un relief workers said 38 other palestinians from rafah were 
treated for lesser injuries from rubbercoated metal pellets and 
about 100 people sought help for teargas inhalation after army 
helicopters sprayed the crowd 
some wounded were taken to nearby khan yunis to nasser 
hospital where squads of soldiers searched for suspects chasing 
some patients through the halls a hospital official said on 
condition of anonymity 
the rafah clash broke out after youths defied an army curfew and 
gathered at the home of a palestinian man who died late sunday 
after being shot in the back in a confrontation with troops arab 
reports said 
the army confirmed at least 15 palestinians suffered gunshot 
wounds and said it was checking further it declared the rafah area 
a closed military zone preventing 50000 palestinians from leaving 
the town 
the death sunday raised to 659 the number of palestinians killed 
by israeli soldiers or civilians in the 26monthold uprising 
against israels occupation another 189 palestinians have been 
slain by fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with 
israeli authorities and 43 israelis have died 
in israel meanwhile thousands of israeli arabs staged a 
oneday strike to protest inadequate government funding for their 
town and city councils 
the arabs who comprise about 17 percent of israels population 
are angered by the governments failure to implement an agreement 
to write off about 50 million of their municipal debt 
about 4000 israeli arabs led by four arab members of 
parliament marched through downtown haifa to press their demands 
the order allowing community colleges and vocational schools to 
reopen will affect 16 west bank schools with an enrollment of about 
5000 students according to shmuel goren coordinator for the 
israeli military government 
but goren speaking in ramllah at the military governments west 
bank headquarters said the army did not lift its order closing six 
palestinian universities and one polytechnic center 
all of the schools were order closed in january 1988 after the 
army declared they were hotbeds of violence 
goren said the community and vocational colleges were reopened 
to bring about some change in the climate and feelings in the 
territories 
when we reach the conclusion that the universities will really 
be a place for study we will reopen them he said 
the european parliament voted last month to freeze scientific 
and technical cooperation with israel until the universities are 
reopened and at least two planned israelieuropean community 
conferences have been postponed indefinitely 
the united states criticized continued closure of the 
universities in its annual human rights report last week 
as goren spoke with reporters a group of palestinian professors 
and students held a separate news conference in jerusalem to demand 
the universities be reopened immediately and to ask for western 
support 
inam labadi an economics student at bir zeit university said 
western nations were doing nothing while israeli authorities 
committed a crime against academic freedom and against the 
simplest human rights 
mrs labadi whose husband brother and brotherinlaw have been 
deported during the uprising said the university closure is only 
aimed at imposing ignorance on our people 
gahbi baramkeh a bir zeit university vice president said 
european sanctions on scientific cooperation with israel were a 
highly appropriate response to continued closure of the 
universities

manuel antonio noriegas top aides gave him 
false reports about the possibility of american military 
action but us forces were caught off guard too by the strength 
of the panamanian resistance the general who led the military 
operation said monday 
in the two weeks preceeding operation just cause they never 
gave him an accurate assessment of us military activities army 
lt gen carl stiner said of noreigas intelligence staff 
stiner said us forces were surprised by two developments 
what proved to be poor intelligence about the power of noriegas 
socalled dignity batallions and stifferthanexpected 
resistance from the panamanian defense forces 
we didnt have the intelligence we should have had on the 
dignity batallions stiner said they were stronger and more 
formidable to deal with because they just faded back into the 
population he said of the paramilitary noriega supporters 
dressed in civilian clothes and armed with automatic weapons 
stiner who offered his assessment of the military operation to 
reporters said the strong resistance came because the pdf 
apparently was tipped off to the operation just hours before its 
start at 1 am on dec 20 
stiner said he tried to move the hhour forward in order to 
maintain the surprise nature of the massive operation and minimize 
the casualties the general said he was able to advance it only by 
15 minutes because of its complexity 
more than 12000 us troops were airlifted into panama in an 
attempt to smash the panamanian defense forces and seize noriega 
who later surrendered to us authorities and was brought back to 
the united states to face federal drug charges 
stiner reported that overall 23 us servicemen were killed 
and 324 were injured 
it was compromised stiner said of the operation we know 
it was compromised 
this allowed some panamanian officers to prepare their soldiers 
for the possibility of a us attack and that meant 
heavierthanexpected resistance at some of the landing zones where 
the airborne forces encountered live fire the general said 
stiner said that at 1000 pm the pdf radio networks carried 
such reports as they are coming the ball game is at 100 in the 
morning report to your units immediately and draw your weapons 
and prepare to fight 
the general said there were several possiblities for the leak of 
information but that he had no independent confirmation what 
exactly tipped off the pdf 
yet the general said the operation an unqualified success and 
so much so that the commanders didnt learn a single lesson 
from the endeavor 
the threestar general said the misleading information handed 
noriega was discovered in documents captured during the december 
operation and that it was provided to noriega by his key staff 
his key henchmen 
stiner identified two of them as col nivaldo madrinan the 
chief of noriegas investigations department and capt eliezer 
gaytan chief of security 
they were giving him false reports they were submitting 
reports to him that everything was fine stiner said 
asked if the misleading information indicated norieaga was being 
set up by his cohorts the general said he did not know if that was 
the case 
stiner said he also couldnt say exactly what information 
noriega was given in the hours just prior to the operation 
the panamanian general was able to elude us forces for days 
until he sought refuge at the vatican embassy 
stiner who is the commanding general for the 18th airborne 
corps at fort bragg nc said his troops had practiced jumping 
from 800 feet but that they actually dropped into the landing 
zones from 500 feet 
with the live fire coming at them from the ground some of the 
men in the excitement of being shot at forgot to drop their 
100 pound packs ahead of them and broke their ankles because of the 
heavy load 
stiner said commanders usually have a 6 percent injury rate in a 
training mission and the injury tally in panama wasnt much more 
than that

a teenager who pleaded guilty in the 
shotgun slayings of his father mother and 8yearold brother was 
sentenced monday to a minimum 25 years in prison 
brian britton 17 who prosecutors claimed had a fascination 
with the rambo movie character portrayed by actor sylvester 
stallone showed no emotion when sentenced to 25yearstolife 
imprisonment on each of the seconddegree murder counts 
britton who pleaded guilty jan 3 also was sentenced to serve 
between 8 13 to 25 years for the attempted murder of his sister 
during the march 1989 rampage at the familys home in poughkeepsie 
judge judith hillery ordered the sentences to run concurrently 
under new york state law britton must serve all of his minimum 
sentence 
hillery rejected a plea for leniency from public defender john 
garrity jr who argued that britton had been abused at home by an 
alcoholic father and an overbearing mother garrity claimed that 
britton had suffered cracked ribs and a broken nose as the result 
of confrontations with his father 
pamela sackett of the dutchess county coalition against child 
abuse said she was disappointed the sentence was not reduced 
saying it was very clear child abuse played a significant role 
in the slayings 
assistant dutchess county district attorney thomas dolan said 
there was no reason for the slayings other than the outrageous 
rage of a young man he called britton a calculating killer 
britton gave rambo as his nickname when booked by 
authorities after the shootings prosecutors claimed he was 
fascinated with the guntoting vietnam veteran in the rambo 
movie series and also kept a range of military paraphernalia in 
the house including army fatigues canteens and soldier of 
fortune magazines 
garrity argued that britton had been forced by his father to 
watch violent shows on television especially about war

president bush offered high praise monday to 
the nations governors for their work on education and pledged to 
keep the subject in the forefront of americas agenda but some 
governors emerged from the white house meeting complaining that the 
president didnt back his words with money 
he seemed unaccountably reluctant to make any commitments 
said gov richard celeste of ohio chairman of the democratic 
governors association 
bush met with the governors the day after the state officials 
adopted six education goals that followed closely those outlined by 
the president in his state of the union speech last month 
we are launching a new era in education reform said bush 
its focus high expectations its hallmark results 
bush told the governors gathered in the east room that for the 
first time in americas history we now have national education 
goals and objectives goals that pave the way to a decadelong 
commitment to excellence in education for all americans goals that 
will guide us on the journey toward an american renaissance in 
education 
in a private luncheon with the governors bush hinted that there 
may be some resources available in coming years to address the 
education goals according to massachusetts gov michael s 
dukakis the vanquished democrat in the 1988 presidential election 
bush said defense spending may be cut further 
with communism seemingly in retreat around the world several of 
the governors asked bush who was the enemy dukakis said he 
said the enemy is instability ok fine but then he said 
look weve already cut the defense budget substantially below 
projected levels and he said its probably going to be cut even 
futher 
bush thanked the governors for their superb cooperation in 
the effort that began last fall at an education summit in 
charlottesville va the president and the governors agreed that 
adoption of the goals for improving american education over the 
next decade was only the beginning of a difficult process 
we all expect that theres a lot of work ahead of us said 
gov terry branstad of iowa chairman of the national governors 
association 
adoption of the goals was the top item on the agenda of the 
ngas annual midwinter meeting the four day conference ends 
tuesday 
the goals call for giving poor children preschool services that 
include nutrition and health screening and making sure american 
students are competent in math science english history and 
geography they also call for increasing adult literacy and making 
schools drugfree 
attached to the goals was a document seeking a commitment to 
provide at least one year of preschool for all disadvantaged 
children it also said federal funds should target those 
students most in need of assistance due to economic disadvantage or 
risk of academic failure 
in the budget he sent congress this year bush proposed a 500 
million increase in federal funds for the preschool head start 
program 
but when governors asked at the white house about funds for 
other educational programs the president offered no encouragement 
to the extent that the federal government doesnt propose more 
funds they the goals may not be reachable said gov l 
douglas wilder of virginia 
republican gov james thompson of illinois backed the 
presidents reluctance to offer a greater federal commitment 
the money is going to come primarily from states and local 
governments and thats where it should come from said thompson 
gov carroll campbell of south carolina who was cochairman of 
the governors education task force noted that the federal 
government pays only about 7 percent of the cost of public schools 
were going to have to carry the bulk of this we and the 
local communities said the south carolina republican 
were not looking for change in that ratio said roger 
porter white house domestic affairs adviser referring to the 7 
percent federal share 
the governors also adopted a resolution urging the president to 
consider education among the areas that might get additional funds 
from any peace dividend or reduction in defense spending 
because of reduced international tensions 
gov mario cuomo of new york said that resolution was an 
acknowledgement not as bold a commitment as a lot of us would 
want but at least an acknowledgement that there is a federal role 
of some kind when it comes to revenue 
i dont think the white house is prepared to offer the 
governors any more in the way of funds than are in the budget 
said celeste i am a little disappointed 
bush pledged to do everything i can to provide the national 
leadership and energy to keep education in the forefront of 
americas domestic agenda

the governors of delaware maryland virginia north carolina 
pennsylvania and new jersey as well as the city of philadelphia

this is a good initiative said maryland gov william donald 
schaefer the regulations in one state should be as similar as 
possible to those in the next state 
representatives of each state will meet tuesday to begin 
deciding how to develop consistent policies on acid rain as well as 
on emissions of ozone toxic chemicals and volatile organic 
chemicals that send vapors into the air 
already delaware maryland and new jersey have laws restricting 
the vapors emitted by gasoline similar legislation is pending in 
pennsylvania and philadelphia according to phillip retallnick 
director of delawares division of air and waste management 
schaefer suggested the idea of regional cooperation could be 
extended to other environmental issues he said midatlantic 
governors might join forces on plastics recycling while virginia 
gov douglas wilder said he could foresee them acting together to 
solve problems of solidwaste disposal

police killed five procuban guerrillas in the 
central highlands and rebels belonging to the fanatical shining 
path movement painted red antigovernment threats monday on inca 
ruins above cuzco authorities said 
a police patrol clashed sunday evening with a column of rebels 
belonging to the tupac amaru revolutionary movement near jauja 100 
miles east of lima killing five guerrillas while suffering no 
police casualties police said 
in cuzco 355 miles southeast of lima fighters of the maoist 
shining path daubed threats on the huge stone walls of 
sacsayhuaman an inca fortress on a hill overlooking the city 
which is a popular tourist site 
police said about 15 hooded rebels tied up the two guards at the 
ruins before dawn monday and then used red paint to write warnings 
against voting in presidential and general elections set for april 
8 
the signs also said long live president gonzalo the name 
used by shining path leader abimael guzman 
on feb 8 the body of an american tourist shot in the head was 
found near the ruins and police have not determined whether he was 
killed by thieves or shining path guerrillas 
shining path rebels murdered seven foreign tourists last year in 
different parts of the highlands but cuzco had been relatively 
free of terrorism 
the government extended for 60 days on monday a state of 
emergency in a third of the nation giving the military broad 
powers to fight leftist guerrillas 
the measure affects eight departments apurimac ayacucho 
huancavelica junin pasco huanuco san martin and ucayali and 
one province ucayali in loreto department peru is divided into 24 
departments which are subdivided into provinces 
the areas are in the central and southern highlands and northern 
jungle 
the state of emergency puts the areas under military control and 
suspends individual rights such as unrestricted travel protection 
against arrest without a judicial order and prohibition against 
violation of residences without search warrants 
lima perus capital and home to a third of its 22 million 
people also is under a state of emergency but it is administered 
by the national police

researchers have approximately located the gene 
responsible for an inherited disorder that causes eye disease and 
hearing impairment a discovery they hope will lead them to the 
ailments cause and treatment 
defects in the gene cause a disease called type ii usher 
syndrome which is marked by retinitis pigmentosa and moderate 
hearing impairment according to an announcement monday by the 
national retinitis pigmentosa foundation in baltimore 
the foundation said the disorder afflicts an estimated 10000 
americans 
this finding represents the first localization of a gene 
associated with congenital hearing loss and is a significant 
advance in the molecular genetics of rp said dr alan laties 
chairman of the retinitis pigmentosa foundations scientific 
advisory board 
the discovery follows by less than a month the announcement that 
researchers had identified a genetic defect associated with another 
form of retinitis pigmentosa the socalled autosomal dominant 
form that form is not accompanied by hearing loss 
the team that made the discovery was led by william kimberling 
director of the center for hereditary communication disorders at 
boys town national research hospital in omaha neb 
the gene was found to be located on the long arm of chromosome 
1 one of the 23 chromosomes that carry human hereditary 
characteristics 
retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited disease that afflicts about 
100000 americans it begins with night blindness and gradually 
progresses to tunnel vision and total blindness these symptoms are 
caused by degeneration of the retina 
the cause of this degeneration is unknown but with the 
discovery of genes that trigger it researchers can begin to 
unravel the biochemical process that leads to the degeneration 
they can then use that knowledge to try to develop drugs or other 
treatments to counteract or prevent degeneration

tugboats towed the burning kuwaiti tanker 
surf city which exploded last week out of the persian gulf toward 
the indian ocean on monday 
several salvage tugs and at least one us navy warship 
accompanied the 81283ton vessel on a 10hour transit of the 
strait of hormuz gateway to the gulf military and shipping 
industry sources reported the tanker was imperiled by a resurgence 
of fires fed by leaks from its weakened cargo tanks 
officials said the surf city was taken out of the gulf to avoid 
the possibility of another explosion sinking it in busy shipping 
lanes or causing damage to terminal facilities off the united arab 
emirates 
the surf city was one of 11 kuwaitowned tankers reflagged by 
the united states in 1987 so the navy could protect them from 
attack in the iraniraq war 
a gulfbased shipping executive speaking on condition of 
anonymity said salvage tugs were spraying foam and water on the 
tanker as it was towed out 
he said a southerly wind was helping cool the ship but also 
would slow its progress 
the explosion on thursday killed the american captain and first 
mate and forced the other 23 crewmen all americans but one to 
abandon ship they were rescued by the missile frigate uss simpson 
patrolling nearby 
all were flown home later except boatswain earl washington 41 
of louisiana who remains in a dubai hospital with burns his 
hometown was not immediately known 
until the towing began the tanker had remained off the emirates 
while up to a dozen salvage tugs tried to contain the fires

the father of 7yearold hilary 
foretich whose mother went to jail for 25 months rather than 
disclose her whereabouts said monday that he had come to rescue 
his daughter 
my daughter deserves to come back and have a normal life 
said dr eric foretich 45 as he arrived in auckland 
the mother dr jean elizabeth morgan who claims her exhusband 
sexually abused the child accused him of hunting down their 
daughter like an animal 
foretich denies he abused the child last week the falls 
church va dental surgeon traced his daughter to new zealand 
where she has been living with her maternal grandparents 
hilary reportedly hasnt seen either of her parents in two years 
certainly were going to do what we need to do to rescue my 
daughter foretich said he met with his new zealand lawyers 
immediately upon his arrival 
morgan was released from jail in september after congress passed 
a law tailored for her that limited civil contempt imprisonment in 
washington dc to a year 
aided by private investigators foretich found that hilary was 
living in the south island town of christchurch 190 miles 
southwest of wellington 
the family court in christchurch granted an interim order friday 
giving the grandparents custody of the girl and on monday william 
morgan the childs grandfather vowed to call police if the father 
approached the girl 
hilary spoke to her mother for the first time in two years 
sunday and cried said antonia morgan her maternal grandmother 
morgan a 42yearold plastic surgeon in washington was jailed 
in august 1987 for refusing to say where her daughter was despite a 
us judges ruling for the former husbands unsupervised access 
the couple separated before hilary was born 
in an interview from the united states morgan accused her 
exhusband of seeking publicity and said he has hunted her down 
like an animal she does not want to see him and he knows that 
morgans attorney stephen sachs filed papers in washington 
dc monday asking superior court judge herbert dixon to return 
her passport so she can travel to new zealand she was forced to 
hand over the passport during the custody battle 
by continuing to withhold dr morgans passport this court is 
effectively preventing dr morgan from appearing in the new zealand 
proceeding to defend her interests and from responding to the 
request of hilarys courtappointed counsel that she participate in 
those proceedings the motion said 
dixon who jailed morgan in 1987 has scheduled a hearing for 
tuesday morning however the passport is in the custody of the 
dc court of appeals due to another ruling in the protracted 
case officials indicated that dixon could suggest to the appeals 
court that the passport be returned 
new zealands prime minister geoffrey palmer noting intense 
us media interest in the case said it was for the family court 
in christchurch not his labor government to rule on the matter 
the paramount consideration in those cases is one issue the 
welfare of the child palmer said 
hilary has spent the past two years in christchurch a famous 
cathedral town that is the staging post for operation 
deepfreeze as the us activities in antarctica are called

many government food products are unfit 
for needy indians who rely on them to survive a congressional 
committee was told monday as it examined smelly unappetizing cans 
of meat 
im not sure that id give this to a dog rep tony hall 
dohio said after examining the cans of beef and pork stamped 
usda approved from food packages the government distributes 
through indian tribes 
charles red gates the food distribution program director 
for the standing rock sioux tribe told the us house select 
committee on hunger the meats not only contain lard and animal 
veins but also are loaded with fat and sodium 
that compounds the unusually high rates of diabetes heart 
disease hypertension and infant mortality rates on north dakota 
indian reservations gates tribal officials and reservation 
residents said 
it was the first time the usda had heard such complaints about 
its meat commodities said usda spokeswoman darlene barnes beef 
and pork commodity products must meet certain specifications and 
are limited to 1 percent sodium and 1 percent fat she said 
among the 100 people attending the congressional hearing at the 
tribal council headquarters on southcentral north dakota 
reservation was diane ponga 38 a speech aide for the school 
district 
she told the committee that she and her husband who suffers 
from high blood pressure depend on commodity foods to feed their 
six children and two nieces she said the children range in age 
from 6 to 19 
but i dont let the kids see it or they wont eat it ponga 
said referring to the canned meat 
tribal officials asked the committee to push for higher 
nutritional and quality standards for commodity foods to ease the 
persistent health problems on the reservation 
its imperative the food provided doesnt contribute to health 
problems said twila martinkekahbah chairwoman of the turtle 
mountain band of chippewa indians 
terrence sloan director for the aberdeen area indian health 
service that serves north dakota south dakota nebraska and iowa 
said health and nutrition problems are disproportionately higher on 
the standing rock reservation than anywhere else in the nation 
the tribe includes 23 million acres in sioux county of north 
dakota and corson county in south dakota its enrolled population 
was 10300 in january 1989 
deaths from heart disease on the reservation from 1984 through 
1986 totaled 243 per 100000 people compared with 181 for all 
races in the united states sloan said an infant mortality rate of 
19 per 1000 live births was nearly double the nationwide average 
he said 
indians also have one of the highest diabetes rates worldwide 
sloan said 
these problems will accelerate unless changes are made in 
nutrition and fitness programs on the reservation he said 
he suggested making fresh fruit and vegetables available through 
the commodity distribution program providing delivery of food to 
the elderly and handicapped implementing information programs on 
nutrition and food preparation and reducing fat salt and sodium 
in food items 
sloan also urged that income guidelines for the food stamp 
program be revised 
a recent general accounting office study of four reservations 
including fort berthold in north dakota and pine ridge in south 
dakota showed some indians cannot qualify for food stamps because 
their cars are worth more than 4500 the 4500 limit was set in 
1978 
grocers also raise their prices on the days they know food 
stamps are being issued the gao found 
hall and rep byron dorgan dnd said they would support 
legislation to improve government nutrition programs 
its disgusting dorgan said weve got to do better than 
this

a former congressional official who had been 
the bush administrations leading candidate for chief regulator of 
the nations savings institutions said monday he has withdrawn his 
name from consideration 
frederick d wolf formerly the no 2 official at the general 
accounting office said he informed the treasury department last 
week he is no longer interested in being appointed director of the 
departments office of thrift supervision 
wolf a partner with the price waterhouse amp co accounting firm 
said treasury officials in late december asked him to apply for the 
job 
subsequently administration congressional and industry sources 
said wolf was the most likely candidate to succeed m danny wall 
who announced his resignation on dec 4 but continues to serve 
wolf said he was disturbed that two months after being asked to 
consider the job treasury officials had still not recommended his 
name to the white house 
he said he could only conclude that either the administration 
did not believe it was important to fill the job soon or did not 
favor his appointment 
in the meantime wolf said he was forced to suspend work for 
several of his firms clients in order to avoid a potential 
conflict of interest 
the inability of the administration to decide on walls 
replacement nearly three months after he quit was taken by 
analysts as another sign of disarray in the management of the 
savings and loan bailout 
last month daniel kearney alluding to differences with the 
treasury department resigned as the chief staff officer of the 
resolution trust corp oversight board the board sets the policy 
and controls the purse strings of the bailout 
i think this withdrawal is another black eye coming on top of 
kearneys resignation said bert ely a financial institutions 
analyst in alexandria va it is bumbling 
the failure to fill the post also likely will bolster the 
arguments of members of congress including house banking committee 
members reps charles schumer dny and jim leach riowa who 
want to abolish the thrift office and divide its duties among 
commercial bank regulatory agencies 
wall who had been under fire from congress for his handling of 
the collapse of lincoln savings and loan association irvine 
calif said he would like to leave the post soon 
i have indicated that is my wish but theres no date been set 
at this point he said i havent put any deadlines down 
wall said treasury is exploring the appointment of jonathan 
fiechter currently the offices senior deputy director as acting 
director 
however in a letter to president bush the us league of 
savings institutions said the appointment of an acting director 
could leave the institution rudderless 
it said its reading of last summers sampl legislation does not 
leave its lawyers confident that an acting director without senate 
confirmation could legally close failed sampls issue rules or 
exercise the other powers of the directors office 
art siddon a spokesman for the treasury department had no 
comment on the trade groups contention

nasa will wait until wednesday for 
the sixth attempt to launch shuttle atlantis on an undercover 
military mission but weather may again interfere 
forecasters said there was only a 40 percent chance the weather 
would be favorable at launch time expected about 1245 am 
the problem they said would be high winds and clouds the 
forces that combined early monday to halt the latest effort to put 
what sources said was a 500 million spy satellite in orbit 
the outlook remains the same on thursday 
after mondays scrub the fifth in five days shuttle managers 
decided to wait two days so that the five military astronauts and 
launch team could rest 
weve got a 48hour turnaround and its going to give us all 
a chance to get some rest said nasa spokesman bruce buckingham 
the astronauts were making use of the break to fly back to 
houston to use training facilities at the johnson space center 
they were due back by noontime tuesday 
the crew includes navy capt john o creighton the commander 
air force john h casper the pilot marine lt col david c 
hilmers the flight engineer and mission specialists air force 
col richard mullane and navy cmdr pierre j thuot 
we are disappointed we didnt launch but are convinced that 
the launch team and the mission management team made the correct 
decision creighton said in a statement we are looking forward 
to our next opportunity 
the astronauts boarded atlantis about 2 hours before mondays 
scheduled 1254 am liftoff the countdown was put on hold but a 
break in the weather never came and at 232 am the launch was 
abandoned 
sundays liftoff was halted by a computer problem with 31 
seconds to go the two previous launches were delayed due to 
weather while the first attempt on thursday was scrubbed because 
creighton had a cold 
so far the delays have cost the national aeronautics and space 
administration 275 million in fuel labor and materials 
the mission is nearing a record for postponements due to weather 
and mechanical problems 
columbia was launched jan 12 1986 after six such delays 
challenger launched 16 days later on the illfated flight that 
killed its seven astronauts also had been delayed six times but 
only three of those came during countdown the others were the 
result of columbias delays 
because atlantis flight is a classified military mission nasa 
is withholding details surrounding the length and purpose of the 
flight 
however sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
atlantis cargo is a 500 million spy satellite capable of taking 
highresolution reconnaissance photos and listening in on 
electronics communications all over the world 
the mission is to be the sixth classified military flight of 34 
shuttle missions

fed up with war and poverty and 
liberated by a secret ballot nicaraguans unceremoniously dumped 
the ruling sandinista party as soon as they had the chance 
the sandinistas lost and lost big despite their tight 
organization and militant workers despite plastering managua and 
the country with daniel presidente tshirts baseball caps and 
posters despite a campaign that spent 7 million in a mediapoor 
country despite polls that showed 15point leads 
i think when people went to the polls they voted with their 
stomachs and i think they thought about the empty stomachs of 
their children said paul reichler an american lawyer and close 
adviser to president daniel ortega 
the sandinistas blamed their economic problems largely on the 
united states and the united states certainly did its worst it 
sponsored a guerrilla war and imposed an economic embargo 
but in the end the excuses didnt matter people wanted a 
change 
they had 10 years and could not do it was the slogan of the 
juryrigged opposition coalition led by newspaper publisher violeta 
barrios de chamorro 
she hammered away at the sandinistas for their dogmatic 
marxistoriented policies and statecontrolled economy 
it was a shocking fall for the young revolutionaries who entered 
managua as heroes on july 19 1979 after toppling the 45year 
somoza dynasty 
but then they began to antagonize the church restrict civil 
liberties muzzle news media and install a generally repressive 
regime that critics said was a copy of the cuban system 
nicaraguans fled their country by the hundreds of thousands 
some compared sandinista experiments to those of children who 
just got a set of toy trains for christmas 
the sandinistas eventually tried to change admitting errors 
promising a new mixedmarket economic system freeing the press and 
making possible the freest election in nicaraguan history 
but with an economy in shambles a costly war that killed more 
than 60000 people and the prospect of more poverty as its eastern 
european allied regimes crumbled the sandinistas were left 
vulnerable to an electorate that lost its fear in the words of 
a sandinista journalist 
it is to their credit that they created the atmosphere for a 
clean election said truck driver ramon mendoza as he came out of 
a polling booth where there were no soldiers or other symbols of 
intimidation 
but i could not vote for the frente the sandinistas a vote 
for the sandinistas would mean that i am voting for higher 
inflation for things to be more expensive every day for my 
children to be drafted into the army and sent to war 
we did not vote for violeta he added referring also to his 
wifes vote we voted for a change 
we did not have the best candidate and we did not run the best 
campaign said a close adviser to mrs chamorro the newspaper 
publisher who was a symbol more than a leader of an opposition 
coalition that included parties from the extreme right to the 
extreme left 
i think they overestimated themselves said luis guzman 
leader of a social christian faction in the opposition coalition 
they thought they could go for a plebiscite and win pinochet 
made the same mistake they decided to run the risk now their only 
option is to accept what happened 
the reference was to lameduck president augusto pinochet of 
chile 
the sandinistas in another example of growing maturity as a 
party appear to have accepted their fate 
some of their own foes thought it was sad the sandinistas got 
the boot from an irate populace with short memory of the 
contributions the sandinistas made in getting rid of dictator 
anastasio somoza and in the areas of health and education 
we thought it would have been better to try to change the 
sandinistas from within said mauricio diaz vice president of 
the social christian party 
people identified the problems with the sandinistas they do 
not think that part of the problem was caused by the united 
states 
the sandinistas remain the largest single party in the national 
assembly and still control many labor unions making them an 
important political force 
the army is known as the sandinista army and is closely 
identified with the party 
the new government will have to deal with the army very 
carefully said social christian presidential nominee erick 
ramirez a clear loser in this election because he gambled on 
staying out of the united national opposition coalition that he 
thought would fall apart 
the army is commanded by gen humberto ortega daniel ortegas 
brother 
many of the sandinistas achievements have left a deep imprint 
in nicaraguan history they confiscated land as part of agrarian 
reform and distributed it to landless peasants formed farming 
cooperatives organized a giant literacy campaign and improved 
public medical services 
but their economic policies and their confrontation with 
washington forced them eventually into regional isolation 
the united states financed the contra rebels that at one time 
numbered 15000 and the sandinistas had to raise an army to fight 
them 
if we had to make some changes we would change some of the 
economic policies of the past 10 years campaign manager and 
sandinista directorate member bayardo arce told journalsits three 
days before the election 
the sandinistas obviously thought they would win buoyed by 
polls and a tremendous final rally that drew 300000 people 
but nicaraguans were afraid to tell pollsters the truth and the 
rallies were packed by government employees and labor unionists who 
felt compelled to attend 
in the secrecy of a voting booth that the sandinistas themselves 
arranged all that changed

the nicaraguan elections were hailed worldwide monday as a model 
of democracy and a step toward peace in a country that has been 
mired in civil war for a decade 
hundreds of international observers monitored the campaign and 
the sunday balloting in which opposition candidate violeta barrios 
de chamorro defeated incumbent sandinista president daniel ortega 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar welcomed the 
nicaraguan elections as a victory for democracy throughout 
central america he said he supported the process but remained 
neutral on the outcome 
honduras said mrs chamorros victory would pave the way for 
improved relations nicaragua and honduras have quarreled over 
usbacked contra rebel bases in honduras 
the united states the contras and others called for national 
reconciliation and a peaceful transition of power 
but nicaraguans living in the united states doubted the leftist 
sandinista leadership would give up power easily and european 
socialists blamed external forces for ortegas defeat 
the official soviet news agency tass carried a brief news story 
out of managua the capital of nicaragua headlined opposition 
leader wins elections in nicaragua there was no other soviet 
reaction initially 
us officials welcomed the result and began meetings to review 
policy on nicaragua besides aiding the rebels the united states 
imposed an economic embargo to undermine nicaraguas economy 
president bush said he spoke with president carlos andres perez 
of venezuela about appropriate trade and economic measures that 
we can take to support the new government of nicaragua 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush was sending 
messages to mrs chamorro congratulating her on her win and to 
ortega congratulating him on the conduct of the election and his 
stated willingness to abide by the results 
aristides sanchez a contra leader said all nicaraguans now 
must work for national reconciliation 
because of the international observers and attention this 
triumph has to be recognized by the sandinists and by all 
nicaraguans he said it is the first step to achieving a true 
democracy 
former president jimmy carter invited to monitor the balloting 
praised ortega for holding free and fair elections 
they had total control over the government over the electoral 
process carter told abc television i think ortega can go out 
of office in april with a great deal of satisfaction that he 
has indeed been instrumental in letting the people exhibit 
democracy and freedom in one of its finest ways in this 
hemisphere 
carter said ortega promised to abide by the results 
but nicaraguan us residents said they feared the army would 
reject the vote 
the results were good but its a lie said barbara zapata 
26 who left managua five months ago daniel ortega will not 
turn in the weapons 
edgar toruno raudales 27 said an opposition government was 
worthless if the army remains in control of the sandinistas 
there could be a coup at any time he said 
world leaders called for a peaceful transition of power 
president rafael leonardo callejas of honduras told a news 
conference he would establish appropriate mechanisms to achieve a 
concrete rapprochement with nicaragua 
argentine president carlos menem said the election strengthened 
democracy throughout central america 
chile said it would recognize mrs chamorros victory by 
inviting her to attend the inauguration next month of its new 
president patricio aylwin ortega had been invited as nicaraguas 
head of state 
former president ronald reagan who spearheaded antisandinista 
policy and support for the contra rebels asked that the fighting 
end 
now is the time for all parties to put down their weapons and 
join in a common pursuit of what is in the best interests of the 
nicaraguan people reagan said 
pierre guidoni of frances socialist party blamed reagan 
policies during the 1980s for the sandinista defeat saying 
the sandinistas had to concentrate their efforts on national 
defense against armed aggression supported by the united states 
they paid today by the ruination of their social project that a war 
economy could not support

in the end president daniel ortega 
lost the votes and won the hearts as observers opposition leaders 
and nicaraguans praised his gallant acceptance of defeat 
it was a noble attitude honest and genuine said joao baena 
soares secretary general of the organization of american states 
baena soares also praised the sandinista president for making it 
possible for the country to hold a clean demcoratic election in a 
peaceful atmosphere 
it was a responsible attitude said mauricio diaz leader of 
the social christian party he accepted reality the sandinistas 
defeated the contra militarily but they could not defeat the 
economic crisis 
edgar isaac aguirre a taxi driver who never liked the 
sandinsitas said of ortega it was an honorable attitude on his 
part the best thing he has done in 10 years of government 
hundreds of reporters international prosandinista solidarity 
workers and nicaraguan supporters gathered at the olaf palme 
convention center through the night awaiting definitive elections 
results 
when ortega arrived shortly after 6 am to concede defeat many 
wept 
at the end tears sparkled in his eyes and his wife rosario 
murillo hugged him from behind and kissed his cheek 
but with a stoicism that marked a dignified and reflective 
speech resembling nothing more than a valedictory ortega held back 
the tears 
the former guerrilla leader whose brother was killed during the 
insurrection against dictator anastasio somoza said quietly but 
firmly the president of nicaragua the government will respect 
and submit itself to the popular mandate that arose from the vote 
in these elections 
i believe that in this historic moment the principal 
contribution we sandinistas we nicaraguan revolutionaries can 
make to the nicaragua people is the guarantee of a pure and clean 
electoral process which warms our consciences ortega said 
would that this sun rising this 26th of february illuminate 
the path toward the consolidation of democracy of a mixed economy 
of a free nicaragua independent and democratic in peace not 
interfered with by any foreign power in which all nicaraguans 
would be able to demonstrate to the world that we can make these 
dreams and hopes come true 
it was a moment of grace deeply appreciated by listeners and 
followers in a country of guerrilla bravado and a region not used 
to graceful acceptance of electoral defeats 
only last year in neighboring panama the military regime of 
manuel antonio noriega annulled a presidential election because its 
candidate had lost it 
we must recognize daniels gesture said agustin jarquin a 
member of the executive committee of the political council of the 
united national opposition whose candidate violeta barrios de 
chamorro won the election 
the sandinistas must orient their followers so we can achieve 
national reconciliation 
while there were words of praise and thanks for his companions 
in the sandinista government he did not speak of his own political 
future or the partys future whether there would be an attempt at 
reconciliation or a clash 
nor did he mention the united states and its long record of 
hostility except as a sidelight and object of sandinista struggle 
he and his colleagues many with clenched fists raised withdrew 
from the hall to the strains of the sandinista hymn and the refrain 
free fatherland victory or death

a brawl broke out in the electoral college 
on monday the third in eight days when opposition members 
challenged the qualifications of some elderly colleagues from the 
governing nationalist party 
the protests are over the domination of the electoral college 
known as the national assembly and the legislature by aging 
nationalists 
on monday huang chaohui of the opposition democratic 
progressive party pushed fellow assemblyman hsiung chiho 76 and 
threatened to throw him out of the meeting 
nationalist assemblyman lee huayang grabbed huangs necktie 
huang punched back and the two rolled on the floor as others joined 
the pushing and shouting 
the 752seat national assembly includes 646 members who last ran 
for office on the chinese mainland shortly before 1949 when they 
fled here with the rest of the nationalist government after it lost 
a civil war to communist forces 
most of the senior members were runnersup in the mainland 
elections but filled seats vacated by the death of the original 
winner they have not faced reelection in taiwan because the 
nationalists claim to still be the legitimate government of all 
china 
opposition assemblyman tsai shihyuan challenged the 
qualifications of 15 assembly members he claimed did not 
participate in the mainland elections 
at one point opposition members tried to shove 80yearold 
assemblywoman liu hsiangku from the meeting room but stopped when 
she showed a certificate proving she was elected on the mainland 
opposition members who hold only 11 seats staged a violent 
protest on feb 19 when the electoral college began its onemonth 
session 
days later a riot in which scores were injured broke out around 
the legislature

it took three guys using a diamondedged 
power saw and a jackhammer to knock rocky balboa off his feet 
monday 
the crew worked for more than two hours to separate the 8foot 
bronze likeness of the citys fictitious boxer from the steps of 
the philadelphia museum of art which has repeatedly insisted it 
doesnt want the statue 
a lawyer for rocky creator sylvester stallone pledged to 
fight on to get the statue a movie prop a permanent home atop the 
museum steps 
in the original rocky which won best picture and best 
director academy awards in 1976 stallones balboa character ran up 
the museums stone steps in triumph while training for a fight 
the statue had been moved to the museum from the spectrum sports 
arena for the filming of stallones latest rocky movie rocky 
v since filming of rocky v ended here friday that cleared 
the way for the movie producers to move stallones likeness at the 
museums insistence 
using the power saw the crew from w cantano amp sons cut into 
the statues concrete base about 12 inches below rockys 22inch 
feet to get at four prongs anchoring the statue into the concrete 
after separating the 800pound statue from the base workers 
used a crane to lift it onto a truck the stub of the concrete base 
was to be removed within hours 
i feel kind of bad said bret carpin of cantano which has 
moved the statue four times in the continuing battle between art 
and fiction i hope he doesnt hold it against us 
the museum was closed monday as usual but the statue moving 
drew a crowd of television crews photographers curious museum 
employees and a few tourists 
amy crackel from decatur ill came with her aunt susan of 
wayne to see rocky it was neat to come the day theyre moving 
it she said adding she has seen all four rocky movies and plans 
to see the fifth 
the statue will be placed in storage at the spectrum until a new 
base can be built there said spectrum spokeswoman debbie albert 
stallones lawyer former state boxing commissioner james binns 
said the statues removal really has nothing to do with where the 
statue will end up permanently we will argue to have it moved back 
to the art museum 
fans protested the move even mayor w wilson goode supported 
leaving the statue at the museum 
but museum officials have noted the statues disproportionately 
large feet and overall small size relative to the museum in saying 
it was not an appropriate home 
the statue was first placed in front of the museum for the 
filming of rocky iii and left there after the movie opened in 
1982 museum officials then said stallone failed to remove it from 
their front steps as agreed and the museum had to pay 12000 to 
get it moved to the sports arena 
when museum officials were approached about returning the statue 
for the fourth sequel they demanded an agreement that the 
production company remove the statue when filming was over

when president daniel ortega admitted 
his defeat at the polls early monday most of those applauding him 
singing the sandinista front anthem and crying their eyes out were 
sandalistas 
sandalistas are the battalions of idealistic foreigners mainly 
americans and western europeans who came to nicaragua after the 
sandinista revolution of july 1979 
nicaraguans gave them their nickname because of their fondness 
for thick leather sandals part of a sort of uniform by which 
sandalistas can be recognized at a distance 
it was these foreigners who shouted catcalls and obscenities a 
few hours later in the same convention hall when former us 
president jimmy carter un observer mission chief elliot 
richardson and others held a news conference on the elections 
the us put the pressure on and the people had no choice 
but to vote for opposition presidential candidate violeta barrios 
de chamorro said monika von flotow 
ms von flotow 33 a physical therapist from santa rosa 
calif has been working for the past year in matiguas a small 
town deep in central matagalpa province 
it is in the midst of contra territory where people often are 
maimed by land mines or in skirmishes between rebels and soldiers 
i dont think people were proud of how they voted said ms 
von flotow her eyes red from weeping after ortegas moving speech 
margo malone 29 of bellingham wash climbed atop a desk to 
see ortega as he spoke 
she hugged a friend and sobbed as the last strains of the 
sandinista national liberation front anthem the one with a line 
calling the yankee the enemy of humanity filled the hall 
the united states has shown that it can destroy a really 
important process a really important revolution said ms 
malone who has been in nicaragua four months on her first visit 
not all sandalistas dress alike ms von flotow for example 
has a conservative unadorned look 
but by and large sandalista woman can be recognized by flowing 
indian print skirts and cotton tank tops the men by often frayed 
pants and ancient tshirts 
for both sexes however it is cotton everything a knapsack on 
every back a look of blissful wonder at the natives and for many 
a feeling that the united states is the enemy of humanity 
they often have little money for themselves but have organized 
a worldwide solidarity network that has raised millions of 
dollars for the sandinista government and organized pressure 
campaigns to bear upon the us congress and other governments 
nicaraguans have a low opinion of sandalistas because of their 
unquestioning idealization of the sandinistas and because many of 
them apparently have no little time to bath in nicaraguas tropical 
heat 
at a news conference by carter richardson and other invited 
election observers internationalistas as the sandinistas are 
also called created a spectacle 
they hammered on desks and booed at carter when he said i 
dont try to justify the actions of our government answering a 
question as to why washington continues supporting the contras 
richardson a former us attorney general was interrupted with 
obscene catcalls when he said he thought the united states would 
have normalized relations with the sandinistas had ortega won the 
elections

mozambican rebels claimed monday that 
government forces backed by zimbabwean troops and planes have 
launched a major offensive against guerrilla positions in central 
mozambique 
a statement distributed in the portuguese capital by the 
mozambican national resistance said 2500 mozambican and zimbabwean 
troops attacked rebel strongholds in the gorongoza highlands monday 
in sofala province 
the statement said the offensive was spearheaded by troops 
carried by zimbabwean transport planes and backed by sovietbuilt 
combat planes and helicopters 
the mozambican news agency aim reported saturday that government 
forces had destroyed four rebel camps the past week one in sofala 
and three in the south 
the aim report said 57 rebels were killed in the actions but 
gave no indication these were major operations aim made no mention 
of zimbabwean troops 
rebel leader afonso dhlakama is thought to have his headquarters 
in gorongoza 560 miles north of the capital maputo 
the rebels who are also known by the portuguese acronym renamo 
said a column of infantry and artillery was supporting the airborne 
troops there was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims 
the renamo statement said the attack showed the bad faith of 
zimbabwean president robert mugabe who together with his kenyan 
counterpart daniel arap moi has been attempting to mediate 
tentative peace moves to end 13 years of fighting in mozambique 
despite intermittent talks between renamo officials and 
mozambican church leaders in nairobi kenya since last july 
reports of violent clashes have continued 
earlier this month the government accused renamo of killing 
over 50 civilians in an attack on a train bringing mozambican 
miners from work in neighboring south africa 
the rebels have faced repeated accusations of civilian massacres 
since they launched their insurgency in 1977 two years after 
mozambique gained independence from portugal 
south africa formerly supported the rebels but since a 1984 
accord between maputo and pretoria no government openly backs the 
rebels

the chairman of the senate committee that 
oversees the tongass national forest in alaska said monday he plans 
fast action on legislation affecting timber deals and wilderness 
protection there 
sen bennett johnston dla said individuals might propose 
dramatically different solutions to the tongass issue but they 
almost all agree that what is needed most in southeast alaska is 
certainty 
the size of west virginia and delaware combined the forest is 
treasured by environmentalists as a habitat for grizzly bear and 
bald eagles and the largest spawning ground for salmon it is the 
last remaining temperatezone rain forest in north america 
to local residents it is the keystone of their economy through 
the timber it yields 
the jobsenvironment conflict has made the forest one of the 
most vigorously fought environmental issues in congress since 1980 
when alaska lands legislation established the current forest 
management regime 
during a hearing on legislation the house passed last summer 
johnston said he would have a senate bill ready for a committee 
vote next week and fast floor action in hopes of getting to 
conference with the house and resolving these issues once and for 
all 
the house measure would cancel 50year contracts with two timber 
companies who supportrs of the bill say stifled other competition 
while getting trees at bargain rates 
rep george miller dcalif who led the house debate for the 
bill called the contracts a raid on the taxpayers critics have 
claimed that the government in recent years has wound up getting 2 
in revenue for 100 in timber production costs 
miller and other supporters said the legislation would open the 
forest to other companies and make more money for the government 
it also strengthens restrictions on timbering in order to protect 
the wildlife habitat 
sen frank murkowski ralaska said he and the rest of the 
alaska delegation sen ted stevens and rep don young all oppose 
the house bill which he says would cripple the economy of 
southeastern alaska 
murkowski said the government is not losing money on tongass 
timber sales and expanded wilderness areas in the forest are not 
needed 
the purpose of our fight now is to maintain the viablity of 
alaska communities whose lifeblood is the resources produced on 
public lands said murkowski who has introduced a bill that 
preserves the 50year contracts with louisiana pacificketchikan 
and alaska pulp co a japanese firm 
murkowski said the committee should postpone action on tongass 
until june when the forest service will release a revised plan for 
the forest 
patricia kearney acting assistant secretary of agriculture for 
forests said the service spent 7 million and two years working on 
the plan and urged that it be considered before congress takes 
final action on how to manage the forest

the defense departments plan to buy 34 
additional helicopters for commando missions at an estimated cost 
of 532 million lacks a sound missionbased justification a 
congressional report said monday 
the defense department disagreed saying plans to cancel a new 
vertical takeoff airplane make the additional helicopters necessary 
the general accounting office said the army based its decision 
to buy 34 mh47e helicopters from the boeing cos 
philadelphiabased helicopters division in addition to its own 
needs of 17 on a may 1984 agreement between the army and the air 
force 
the accord said the air force would transfer the responsibility 
for providing helicopter support for commando operations to the 
army 
but in june 1987 the defense department told congress that it 
had revised its requirements and only needed 17 mh47e helicopters 
and 41 mh53j helicopters to fly these missions of about 265 to 
520 miles 
the armys reason for procuring an additional 34 mh47e 
aircraft is based on an earlier memorandum of agreement between the 
air force and the army which has been superseded by the 1987 
report the gao said 
therefore we believe that the procurement of an additional 34 
mh47e aircraft at a total cost of 532 million is not warranted 
and without sound missionbased justification 
sen william roth rdel who requested the gao report said 
the helicopters are needed to transport troops in and out of 
hostile territory but the gao was quite blunt in its 
conclusion 
the defense department in comments on a draft of the gao 
report disagreed with the agencys conclusion saying it needed 
the additional helicopters because of the bush administrations 
proposal to cancel the v22 osprey tiltrotor vertical takeoff 
airplane a joint project of boeing and bell helicopter textron

armored cars and troops were deployed 
in the center of the capital monday as student demonstrators armed 
with sticks and broken bottles forced newly reopened schools to 
close 
there were no immediate reports of serious incidents or injuries 
air traffic controllers went on strike during the day halting 
domestic and international flights postal and telecommunications 
workers and electricity workers also stopped work cutting 
telephone links in the capital and power supply to some quarters of 
gabon 
president omar bongo assailed by a failed coup attempt in 
october and violent student protests last month was meeting with a 
crisis committee formed last week to try to dissolve social tension 
that has mounted under a 17monthold austerity program 
the strikes and protests indicate dissatisfaction with major 
political reforms announced by bongo on friday including the 
creation of a social democratic assembly to replace his discredited 
democratic party 
bongo told the nation in a televised address friday that the new 
assembly would be open to all political ideas but it falls short 
of his earlier promises to consider transforming gabon into a 
multiparty democracy 
after a weekend respite from strikes and protests students took 
to the streets monday with broken bottles and sticks 
they forced newly reopened schools in the capital to close a 
panic ensued at one school and students scuffled but no injuries

12 suburb on the outskirts of the city where the national assembly 
is located as well as the homes of many diplomats and highranking 
government officials 
last week teachers doctors and nurses stopped strikes to 
protest poor salaries and working conditions after bongo promised a 
general review of government salaries at the end of the year 
under an austerity program imposed as a condition of further 
credit from western nations and institutions gabonese government 
employees were forced to take pay cuts averaging 3 percent in 
october 1988 other government spending also was reduced sharply 
including the budget for education and health

president bush hailed violeta chamorros upset 
election in nicaragua as a clear mandate for peace and 
democracy monday and his spokesman said bush wanted to lift us 
trade sanctions that have hobbled the countrys economy 
bush said the vote to oust leftist president daniel ortega 
moves us one step closer to the day when every nation in this 
hemisphere is a democracy he called for a peaceful transfer of 
power from the sandinista government that has ruled for 10 years 
in a message aimed both at the sandinistas and the 
ussupported army of contra rebels who tried to overthrow the 
government bush said given the clear mandate for peace and 
democracy there is no reason at all for further military activity 
from any quarter 
later monday the president phoned mrs chamorro to congraulate 
her on her victory the president said the election reinforces 
the nicaraguan peoples commitment to the peace process and towards 
building a free and open society said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
bush told mrs chamorro the election was a great day for the 
nicaraguan people fitzwater said 
the spokesman said bush also discussed the situation with a 
number of allied leaders 
there were immediate calls in congress for aid for mrs 
chamorros government which is to be inaugurated april 25 
we must provide her new government with aid and lets not kid 
ourselves it will take big bucks said senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan nobody said democracy was cheap said house 
foreign affairs committee chairman dante fascell dfla 
however others cautioned that with a growing line of potential 
new foreign aid recipients poland hungary czechoslovakia 
panama and others it would be difficult to promise any quick 
major grants 
mrs chamorros election was a sweet victory for the us 
government which had spent hundreds of millions of dollars in 
military and other assistance to arm the contras and keep them 
going and had also clamped economic sanctions on nicaragua 
in riverside calif vice president dan quayle praised the 
contras saying the contras were an important force throughout 
to bring democracy 
ortega was a major irritant to the white house and a frequent 
target of derision from presidents reagan and bush as recently as 
october bush ridiculed ortega at a summit of latin leaders in 
costa rica as this little man and as that unwanted animal at 
a garden party 
changing his tune bush publicly congratulated ortega monday for 
allowing a free and fair election and pledging to abide by its 
results moreover bush said there is space in a democratic 
nicaragua for all political points of view 
reagan whose administration played a major role in arming the 
contras said that the people of nicaragua and the cause of 
democracy have won an impressive and important victory and that 
now is the time for all parties to put down their weapons and 
join in a common pursuit of what is in the best interests of the 
nicaraguan people 
american supporters of the sandinista government expressed 
disappointment at the election outcome but also said that the 
election was fair 
the rev william sloane coffin said the vote was largely one 
to end the killing a vote for peace that the united states had 
shattered for years by arming the contras it was also a vote 
for food which our unilateral embargo had helped deny nicaraguan 
families 
secretary of state james a baker iii pointedly said the 
international community will insist that the decision of the 
nicaraguan people be respected and that full civil and military 
power be transferred to the newly elected government 
bush said we hope that all sides in this hotly fought contest 
will extend the hand of reconciliation and cooperate together in 
rebuilding their country for the good of all nicaraguans 
he said he had talked with venezuelan president carlos andres 
perez about appropriate trade and economic measures that we can 
take to support the new government of nicaragua 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush wanted the lift 
us sanctions as soon as it is feasible he said he expected 
there would be a decision fairly soon 
the sanctions will expire may 1 unless bush extends them some 
officials are recommending bush lift them much sooner if the 
sandinistas show a disposition to respect the election results 
these officials contend that early action on the sanctions would 
enable nicaragua to get a head start on economic recovery 
we certainly feel a special responsibility for the people of 
nicaragua and the courageous actions that they have taken to bring 
these elections about fitzwater said 
he also suggested the white house will seek more humanitarian 
aid for the contras many of whom are camped just outside nicaragua 
in honduras after their us funds run out this week 
the trade embargo against nicaragua was imposed on may 1 1985 
by thenpresident reagan it barred imports from nicaragua and 
banned us exports to that country except to support the contra 
rebels it also prohibited nicaraguan aircraft or boats from 
entering the united states 
mrs chamorro 60 the publisher of the opposition newspaper la 
prensa had been criticized by ortega as an instrument of us 
policy she headed the united nationalist opposition a fractious 
alliance of 14 parties ranging from far right to far left 
any friend of democracy can take heart in the fact that 
violeta chamorro won the election and the election process is 
a credit to the people of nicaragua who chose to determine their 
nations future at the ballot box bush said and that is a 
victory for democracy 
bush said for years the people of nicaragua have suffered 
and today the people of nicaragua have spoken 
the president learned of mrs chamorros victory in a 430 am 
telephone call from baker 
baker in turn had been called 15 minutes earlier by former 
president jimmy carter in managua where he was leading a team of 
election observers 
fitzwater said bush called british prime minister margaret 
thatcher french president francois mitterrand and mexican 
president carlos salinas to thank them for the support they had 
exhibited over the past months for the return to a democratic 
process in nicaragua 
and canadian prime minister brian mulroney called bush to 
discuss the election and to voice support for the transfer to 
democratic rule fitzwater said 
fitzwater said that bush in meetings through the day with top 
aides on the election outcome was very calm and concerned that 
we give full credit to the people of nicaragua

a us appeals court on monday upheld the 
conviction of a demonstrator who burned an american flag but the 
justices did not rule on the constitutionality of a new federal law 
outlawing flag burning 
a federal judge in seattle has ruled the law unconstitutional 
and the justice department said friday it would appeal directly to 
the supreme court 
the demonstrator in mondays case william charles cary jr was 
sentenced to three months in prison and fined 25 for his role in 
the flag burning during a march 18 1988 protest against us 
involvement in honduras 
the demonstration in minneapolis was outside an armed services 
recruitment center and the blazing flag was thrown into the 
occupied center the 8th us circuit court of appeals noted 
cary appealed challenging the constitutionality of the federal 
statute that prohibits flag burning which was passed after the 
us supreme court struck down a similar texas flag desecration 
statute as unconstitutional because it suppressed free expression 
in mondays 21 decision a panel of the 8th circuit said carys 
conviction was justified by the federal governments interest in 
halting and preventing further breaches of peace in front of its 
armed services recruitment center 
the court noted that it was not affirming the conviction on the 
same grounds that the lower court based its ruling on it said the 
lower court appeared to have upheld the constitutionality of the 
flag statute based upon a government interest in protecting the 
flag as a national symbol 
according to the 8th circuit opinion written by judge frank 
magill the demonstration in minneapolis attracted several hundred 
people opposed to the governments decision to send 3200 troops to 
honduras 
the court said the demonstration turned violent in front of the 
recruitment center as protesters broke windows and shot roman 
candles through them 
after cary lit the flag he threw it into an alcove of the 
recruitment center the court said several other people rushed to 
put it out because of fears that the flames might ignite the 
occupied building the courts opinion said 
carys conduct demonstrated an intent to convey his 
disagreement with american foreign policy in central america the 
court wrote therefore the court said carys conduct was in the 
realm of free expression protected by the first amendment 
however unlike the texas case the governments interest in 
preventing breaches of the peace is implicated by the facts in this 
case because of the ongoing violence there was an immediate 
threat that the burning would encourage the violence to continue 
the court wrote 
in his dissenting opinion circuit judge theodore mcmillian said 
he believed the case was controlled by the supreme courts decision 
in the texas case 
the first amendment prohibits the government from criminally 
punishing appellant for burning the flag of the united states as a 
means of politcal protest accordingly i would reverse the 
judgment of the district court he wrote

burt rutan who designed the revolutionary 
voyager airplane that circled the globe without refueling showed 
off his new hightech lowcost combat jet on monday and the air 
force was impressed 
more than 400 people turned out at mojave airport to watch the 
ares aircraft go through its paces after emerging from rutans 
scaled composites inc hangar in the high desert 
the lightweight easytomaintain plane proved its agility in a 
10minute demonstration flight that marked only the fifth time the 
sleek gray white and blue aircraft has been flown 
it handled real comfortably pilot doug shane said 
afterwards its very maneuverable extremely agile 
im interested in it from an innovative technology point of 
view said air force maj gen john schoeppner jr its quite 
fascinating im very excited about his design 
the twintailed aircraft is powered by a single turbofan engine 
and is made of composites nonmetallic materials such as graphite 
which are strong but are not as heavy as traditional aviation 
metals 
the planes most distinctive feature is a rutan specialty a 
canard or small wing emerging from the fuselage forward of the 
main wing 
possible uses for the plane which was three years in the 
making include stopping drug smugglers close air support 
operations and antihelicopter missions the aircraft is designed 
to be fitted with a 25mm gun or airtoair and airtoground 
missiles 
in a news release scaled composites said the jet can provide 
minimum complexity maintenance and acquisition costs to armies 
and air forces worldwide 
rutan refused to give a price for the plane i cant talk 
about potential customers he said 
the planes name comes from the greek god of war but is used as 
an acronym for capabilities and qualities the builder believes will 
sell it agile responsive effective support 
rutan gained fame for designing voyager the ungainly slender 
airplane that his brother dick and copilot jeana yeager flew 
around the world nonstop on a single tank of fuel 
rutan used lightweight composite carbonfiber materials a 
canard design and fuelstingy engines to allow voyager to stay 
aloft the nine days it took to complete the 25000mile flight in 
december 1986

a key codefendant of manuel noriega is negotiating 
a plea bargain that could put him on the stand against his former 
boss a defense attorney said monday 
the discussions are making good progress said samuel 
burstyn attorney for former panamanian army lt col luis del cid 
at some point the lieutenant colonel may be confronted with 
an option he cant refuse 
burstyn refused to reveal details except to say the proposed 
sentence would be far less than the 40 years del cid was offered 
when taken into custody on drugtrafficking charges and he added 
that the deal had not yet been signed 
assistant us attorney michael sullivan refused to comment on 
the possibility of a plea bargain 
noriega attorney steven kollin said the plea bargaining caught 
his defense team by surprise and refused immediate comment 
when he gets the plea then well worry about it said 
another noriega attorney david lewis 
a source involved in the case who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said one proposal would have del cid serving as little as 
two to four years in prison in return for cooperation against the 
ousted panamanian dictator 
if convicted of all charges in the february 1988 indictment del 
cid could be sentenced to 70 years in prison 
after his surrender in the wake of the december invasion of 
panama del cid was identified by the us government as one of 
noriegas righthand men 
burstyn would not confirm that del cid would take the stand 
against his former boss but noted that once he pleaded guilty he 
could not refuse a prosecution subpoena 
the indictment against noriega accuses del cid of accepting 
200000 in drug payoff money from the governments star witness 
pilot floyd carlton caceres the payoff came shortly after carlton 
and noriega fixed the price of a cocaine shipment they were making 
on behalf of the medellin cocaine cartel authorities said 
del cid also appeared in a photograph at the side of fidel 
castro and noriega in cuba a meeting prosecutors claim was to 
smooth relations between the panamanian leader and the colombian 
cartel after one of its laboratories was raided in panama 
confirmation of del cids plea negotiations came outside a 
hearing on the noriega case before us district judge william 
hoeveler the attorneys were trying to devise a way to handle 
classified documents expected to be at the heart of noriegas 
defense 
lewis a new yorkbased expert on the classified information 
protection act said the governments tough rules would classify 
material even when already printed in a book as in the case of the 
justpublished our man in panama by john dinges 
michael olmsted a washingtonbased justice department attorney 
said it makes no difference if information is widely known or not 
just because there was publication of a fact we consider 
classified does not make it unclassified olmsted said 
fellow prosecutor james mcadams of the us attorneys office in 
miami said prosecutors also are battling secretiveness 
we have intelligence agencies saying we know you have to try 
your case but youre not going to do it with our stuff 
complained mcadams 
on the other hand he said defense attorneys are trying to push 
the prosecution in an attempt to force the government to drop 
charges to avoid revealing secrets 
hoeveler noting the classifiedinformation complications said 
he hoped the trial would begin in november but said it would start 
no later than january 1991 
the judge also heard arguments by attorneys for the four 
remaining noriega codefendants in custody or out on bond 
requesting separate trials 
but prosecutors insisted the five be tried together 
hoeveler said he would rule later on the outstanding secrecy 
issues and the requests for separate trials 
a sixth defendant panamanian pilot eduardo pardo has pleaded 
guilty to flying drug proceeds from fort lauderdale to panama he 
has not been sentenced ten more defendants including medellin 
cartel boss pablo escobar gaviria remain at large

the election of violeta barrios 
de chamorro as president of nicaragua spells hope for peace and 
democracy in central america salvadoran leaders said monday 
mrs chamorro candidate for the united national opposition 
party alliance was the surprise winner of sundays race over 
incumbent daniel ortega head of the leftist sandinista party that 
has governed nicaragua since 1979 
armando calderon sol head of the ruling nationalist republican 
alliance party known as arena used the occasion to call for 
reopening of peace negotiations between the salvadoran government 
and rebels locked in a 10yearold civil war that has claimed 
72000 lives 
with the upset of the sandinistas democracy in the region is 
taking hold theres no call to go on killing in el salvador and 
we should facilitate dialogue calderon said 
this is a historic moment of reflection for the salvadorans i 
believe that now is when the salvadoran democratic process should 
open political spaces for the incorporation of the guerillas and 
seek social harmony he said 
the salvadoran government congratulated mrs chamorro in a 
statement issued by foreign vice minister ricardo valdivieso 
chamorros triumph opens broad hopes for nicaraguas social 
and economic development process and that of the whole central

of the popular social christian movement party and the democratic 
revolutionary front 
zamoras party and the democratic revolutionary front are 
politically aligned with the farabundo marti national liberation 
front guerrillas known as fmln 
calderon referring to rumors that nicaragua has sent weapons to 
the salvadoran rebels said the fall of sandinista government means 
the fmln is historically cut off 
col mauricio ernesto vargas military commander in four eastern 
provinces of el salvador said this means the fmln will have to 
change theyre going to lose the suupport they had from nicaragua 
for damaging the political economic and social system in el 
salvador he said 
peace is closer with the change in nicaragua said vargas in 
a telephone interview with the associated press 
salvadoran rebel leaders could not be reached for comment at

a pregnant cancer patient who refused 
chemical and radiation therapy so the fetus wouldnt be harmed gave 
birth to a boy and mother and child appeared to be doing well 
monday 
this baby is perfect linda babcock said from her room at 
st joseph medical center in this central illinois city to think 
that i might have aborted him i think i would have died too 
the clinton woman who has three other children ages 8 to 18 and 
said she was in her 30s was diagnosed last august as having 
inoperable form of lung cancer known as oat cell carcinoma 
untreated her chances appeared slim 
textbooks say untreated oat cell cancer patients will live two 
to four months said dr james wade iii director of medical 
oncologyhematology at decatur memorial hospital 
the chances of her being able to deliver the baby without 
treatment are slim he said during the pregnancy 
on friday dr harold a nord of bloomington delivered jesse 
warren babcock weighing 5 pounds and 6 ounces 
its pretty incredible that if she has oat cell carcinoma as 
the tests have shown that she went throughout pregnancy without 
her physical condition deteriorating nord said monday in 
fact in the last few weeks she seemed to be getting better 
i was amazed this is the first time ive had a patient 
who had this condition known to be fatal and survived said 
nord who has been in obstetrics for seven years 
mrs babcock said an xray was taken after the delivery and she 
was told her condition was unchanged it hasnt changed since the 
very first diagnosis she said 
but mrs babcock said she believes she no longer has cancer and 
will continue to do without normal therapy 
i feel so much better she said i can breathe i could 
tell it was there before it felt like something cutting off my 
air taking my life 
after the diagnosis last summer mrs babcock faced hard 
choices should she undergo conventional radiation and chemical 
cancer therapy which could extend her life but harm the baby 
should she forgo treatment and hope for the best should she have 
an abortion 
after agonizing about the choices with her husband george a 
control technician at a nuclear power plant mrs babcock decided 
no chemotherapy no radiation treatment no abortion 
she adopted a program based on nutrition lots of carrot juice 
organically grown vegetables and fruits plenty of purified water 
lots of vitamin pills and faith in god 
sometimes the art of medicine is not so certain nord said 
after the successful birth 
give god the credit mrs babcock said he guided me 
through people i met books i read so many people helped me 
prayed for me ill never be able to thank them enough 
mrs babcock and her baby are to go home tuesday 
im confident of living of beating the cancer she said 
the baby saved me from death as i saved him

colombia monday and she was found dead hours later in a parked car 
with eight bullet wounds most to the head police said 
the army reported that soldiers surprised leftist guerrillas 
preparing to blow up a section of the nations main oil pipeline on 
sunday and killed four rebels

five men subdued the bodyguard police assigned to her then 
forced the 31yearold woman into a car monday morning as she left 
her home in medellin bound for nearby apartado a police communique 
said 
it did not mention the fate of the bodyguard 
ms cardona a lawyer and member of the leftist patriotic union 
party was appointed mayor less than a year ago after another 
member of the party ramon castillo fled the country because of 
death threats 
police had said earlier they suspected leftist guerrillas in the 
kidnapping of the mayor 
rebels have never been to known to harm anyone from the 
patriotic union and the party is known to have ties to the 
revolutionary armed forces guerrilla group 
apartado is in the uraba region where authorities have blamed 
rightwing death squads for several massacres of peasants and union 
leaders

caribbean port of covenas previous bombings this year cost 40 
million in repairs and lost production said andres restrepo 
londono president of the state oil company ecopetrol

facilities in 1986 restrepo assessed total damage since then at 
512 million

the main street through south floridas largest 
nicaraguan neighborhood was closed to traffic monday night as 
thousands of jubilant exiles celebrated the upset victory of 
violeta barrios de chamorro over the sandinista regime 
an estimated 8000 nicaraguans and other hispanics converged on 
sweetwater to dance and sing patriotic anthems said charles 
toledo police chief of the community west of miami many however 
said they want to see the new government in action before deciding 
whether to return 
democracy is on its way back said a jubilant inez de 
gutierrez who nonetheless conceded she would not return 
immediately 
well just wait a while and see how things go in nicaragua 
politically and economically said mrs de gutierrez a 
31yearold cashier who has been in the united states for a year 
with her husband and young daughter 
the country is in ruins its in great poverty now 
police closed a fiveblock stretch of busy flagler street which 
was clogged earlier in the evening with cars blaring horns and 
filled with flagwaving nicaraguans many of whom did not sleep 
since voting began sunday morning 
many nicaraguan exiles elsewhere in the united states also 
expressed astonishment and joy at the election outcome but some 
were skeptical that the sandinistas would relinquish power 
in sweetwater a group of nicaraguan businessmen passed around a 
facsimile sent from managua showing a dart board superimposed over 
a drawing of sandinista leader daniel ortega 
ricardo teran whose family operates a retail and 
telecommunications conglomerate in nicaragua said he will return 
to nicaragua next week to assess prospects of relocating 
permanently 
up until five hours ago our total investment in nicaragua was 
zero the government had control of everything now were going to 
see if its worth starting to build up the business again he 
said 
renato salazar said he will not be ready to return to his 
homeland until the sandinistas relinquish control of the military 
and police forces 
democracy means total democracy not the government being in 
charge of one part and the opposition in control of the army he 
said 
more than 100000 nicaraguans have resettled in south florida 
since the sandinista revolution in 1979 
opposition leaders were also pleased but wanted to see what 
would happen next 
aristides sanchez a member of the contras ruling 
civilianmilitary commission appealed to all nicaraguans to back 
the new government and attempt to achieve a national 
reconciliation 
adolfo calero former director of the usbacked rebels 
predicted the return of exiles to nicaragua would be slow 
there are mass exoduses but no mass returns to a country 
said calero who now works with the nicaraguan american national 
foundation slowly the nicaraguan exiles will go back to the 
country im going back as soon as i get a passport from the 
country 
i think the armed struggle is over calero said the armed 
struggle was never an end in itself it was always a means to force 
the sandinistas into a political contest which the people won 
headed by violeta chamorro 
immigration attorney robert boyer who has been a legal adviser 
to nicaraguans seeking asylum predicted a high percentage of 
nicaraguans if they know that things will be safe and secure and 
will be able to establish themselves economically will go back to 
nicaragua 
in los angeles luciano cuadra 32 of the organization of 
nicaraguans in exile and a onetime sandinista intelligence officer 
said he had predicted sunday that the leftist government almost 
certainly would win 
i have never been happier to have been mistaken he said 
he said it could be months however before the world knows if 
the sandinistas truly have relinquished power 
up to this moment im still a skeptic he said 
at casa oscar romero a catholicfunded shelter for central 
americans near brownsville texas nicaraguans largely welcomed the 
election results but worried that the sandinista army will not 
respect the vote 
the results were good but its a lie said barbara zapata 
26 who left managua five months ago daniel ortega will not 
turn in the weapons

president daniel ortega said monday 
his sandinistas will honor the voters wishes and surrender power 
to a 6monthold opposition alliance that won an upset victory 
after a decade of oneparty rule 
we leave victorious because the sandinistas have sacrificed 
spilled blood and sweat not to cling to government posts but to 
bring nicaragua something denied since 1821 when it declared 
independence from spain he said in a dramatic dawn speech 
ortega spoke hours after it was clear the electoral tide was 
against him and violeta barrios de chamorro publisher of the 
opposition newspaper la prensa would be the next president of this 
battlescarred nation which has in the past decade become one of 
the poorest in the western hemisphere 
later monday ortega went to mrs chamorros home for a brief 
congratulatory visit ortega accompanied by several foreign 
observers including former president jimmy carter hugged mrs 
chamorro who called him my darling 
ortega replied you know that i respect you and that i love 
you and congratulate you on your victory 
in this election there werent any victors or losers what i 
want is that we all work for the reconciliation of nicaragua she 
said 
i am ready to contribute to the national reconciliation 
ortega said 
earlier as she headed for a victory celebration at her campaign 
headquarters mrs chamorro said simply people wanted a change 
with 82 percent of the precincts counted mrs chamorro had 
633357 votes or 552 percent to 468040 or 408 percent for 
ortega with the other 4 percent going to minor candidates the 
supreme electoral council said the coalition also won a majority 
in the national assembly 
mrs chamorro is to take office april 25 and the transition 
could be difficult given the bad blood between winners and losers 
on leaving office ortega is to become a member of the national 
assembly 
after a day of calm following the election there were at least 
two violent incidents after nightfall monday including rock and 
bottlethrowing between inebriated sandinista and uno supporters 
crowds of about 50 on each side were screaming insults at each 
other across a street in western managua only five or six actually 
tossed objects 
about 150 riot police called to the scene dispersed the crowd 
with tear gas and night sticks one person suffered a head injury 
in the provincial capital of leon sandinista militants attacked 
and occupied the local uno headquarters according to a sandinista 
party official 
the sandinista supporters left the uno house when sandinista 
officials went to the scene and asked the militants to accept their 
defeat with maturity 
there were no reports of injuries 
its going to be a bit harder than the normal transition 
said alfredo cesar one of mrs chamorros closest advisers and a 
former leader of the contra rebels that means the two sides 
will sit down and make sure the transition is accomplished in a 
peaceful manner 
there was elation at the white house in this year of 
political change democracy won another victory president bush 
said in a statement and officials said lifting the us economic 
embargo was under discussion 
ronald reagan in whose administration the contras were 
organized and went to war issued a statement saying the people 
of nicaragua and the cause of democracy have won an impressive and 
important victory 
in riverside calif vice president dan quayle praised the 
ussupported forces that tried to overthrow the sandinistas 
saying the contras were an important force throughout to bring 
democracy 
under the sandinistas nicaragua became a selfproclaimed 
revolutionary state and adopted portions of marxist and leninist 
ideology to remake its economic and social structures it won 
strong support from the soviet union and cuba and was accused by 
the united states of trying to foment a communist revolution in 
neighboring el salvador 
the sandinista loss to the united national opposition which is 
known as uno and favors westernstyle representative government 
followed by months the movement toward democracy in a several 
sovietaligned nations of east europe and democratization in the 
soviet union itself 
we have a whole new political landscape in central america 
today we have democracy on the march and dictators on the 
decline quayle said adding that the regions antidemocratic 
axis of cuba nicaragua and panama has been reduced to just cuba 
today we have democracy in panama yesterday people voted for 
democracy in nicaragua and now only one remains 
both ortega and mrs chamorro presented themselves as candidates 
of national reconciliation and economic recovery ortega because he 
believed the united states would recognize his victory and mrs 
chamorro because she had washingtons support 
she promised economic recovery to a nation that suffered from a 
decade of war a debilitating us economic embargo and poor 
management 
ortega and the sandinistas mounted a carefully orchestrated 
campaign that ended with a rally attended by an estimated 300000 
people the man who marched into managua as a victorious young 
revolutionary in july 1979 had not expected to lose and the first 
hours of the stunning upset were tense 
former president jimmy carter was among thousands of 
international election observers who monitored the voting 
defense minister humberto ortega the presidents brother and 
interior minister tomas borge who controls the police had 
suggested they might not give an opposition government control of 
those forces 
daniel ortega said he spoke for his party and government 
however in promising to honor the results 
i want to tell all nicaraguans and all the nations of the 
world that the president of nicaragua and the government will 
respect and submit itself to the popular mandate he said 
most polls had shown ortega ahead but the results always were 
in question because many people refused to express their opinions 
to strangers 
paul reichler an american lawyer and one of ortegas close 
advisers said i think that when people went to vote they 
voted with their stomachs and i think they thought about the empty 
stomachs of their children 
i think when it came right down to it nicaraguans has just 
suffered enough they had suffered too much 
in opposition the sandinistas will be the largest and 
bestorganized party in nicaragua 
its a hell of an opposition force in any democracy said 
cesar they are going to have their own rights their own space 
ortega will be treated as a former president with all the dignity 
that entails 
ortega said the sandinistas had created an independent 
dignified and sovereign nicaragua with economic and social 
development and with complete democracy 
throughout the campaign ortega equated the opposition alliance 
with the somoza dictatorship the sandinistas overthrew 
he and mrs chamorro served on the first junta after the late 
president anastasio somoza was ousted but she resigned after nine 
months and later accused the sandinistas of betraying promises of 
pluralism 
her coalition consists of 14 political parties and one native 
indian organization that span the poltical spectrum 
ortega called the election and invited the international 
observers that made it the freest in nicaraguan history and perhaps 
the most closely monitored anywhere 
the election was part of a central american peace agreement that 
also involves disbanding the contras

police profile prodemocracy activists marched by the hundreds of 
thousands in more than 30 soviet cities to demand an end to

those resolutions congress routinely passes to 
mark one occasion or another usually get about as much attention as 
confetti and have the same impact 
but there are exceptions even ceremonial measures sometimes 
echo far from the capitol 
thats why the senate has been snarled in a polite filibuster 
spending long hours in debate on a joint resolution that would 
designate april 24 as a national day of remembrance of the 75th 
anniversary of the armenian genocide of 19151923 
on one side of the issue stands sen robert j dole rkan the 
minority leader urging adoption of a resolution the republican 
administration opposes even though president bush endorsed a 
commemorative measure when he was a candidate in 1988 
on the other is sen robert c byrd of west virginia the senior 
democrat in the senate former majority and minority leader who 
insists that the measure is a pointless and potentially damaging 
condemnation of turkey and that approval could do serious harm to 
relations with a vital nato ally 
the resolution would have congress ask bush to issue a 
proclamation calling on americans to observe april 24 as a day of 
remembrance for more than 15 million armenian victims of 
massacres starvation and deportation in the waning days of the 
ottoman empire 
it doesnt blame modern turkey for what happened 70 years ago 
saying it was genocide perpetrated by the governments of the 
ottoman empire from 1915 to 1923 prior to the establishment of the 
republic of turkey 
but turkey has called the resolution offensive insulting and 
unwarranted 
the administration opposes it because of the potential 
diplomatic and nato problem dole has offered to revise his 
resolution and make it a purely congressional matter one that 
wouldnt require the presidents signature and wouldnt be a real 
law he said bush would support that version 
at the same time dole said turkey isnt going to risk 
undercutting its own interests and about 500 million in us aid 
because of the resolution 
commemorative resolutions usually pass with little debate and no 
dissent noticed only by the groups and interests that wanted them 
adopted in the first place but some do echo in foreign capitals 
a 1989 senate resolution criticizing yugoslavia for mistreatment 
of ethnic albanians was adopted with little notice and temporarily 
soured relations yugoslavias ambassador to washington was called 
home for consultations in a gesture of protest 
earlier measures on such matters as chinese actions in tibet and 
drug problems in mexico also have stirred protests in foreign 
ministries beijing bitterly opposed congressional sanctions 
stirred by its suppression of democratic dissenters even though 
bush promised to keep similar measures in force by executive order 
for years congress routinely adopted resolutions designating 
captive nation observances declaring that it would not recognize 
the soviet unions annexation of onceindependent states or its 
control in eastern europe that irked moscow but accomplished 
little else 
when former president gerald r ford tripped over the topic in 
1976 presidential campaign debate insisting that there was no 
soviet domination of eastern europe he was simply echoing the old 
captive nations resolutions he backed in his house days 
dole pointed to the china sanctions in accusing some opponents 
of his armenia resolution of adopting a double standard pushing 
for action to rebuke beijing while resisting the observance he 
seeks 
but there is a difference between a commemoration and an signal 
of opposition to current conduct 
what useful purpose can this resolution serve at this late 
date byrd asked historians and scholars should deal with the 
matter not politicians 
doles special concern about armenia traces in part to the 
armenian doctor who treated him for the serious wounds he suffered 
in world war ii combat he and his wife secretary of labor 
elizabeth dole traveled to what is now soviet armenia last august 
dole said he then had to scrounge around to arrange 5 million 
in us aid for an area devastated by an earthquake that killed as 
many as 50000 people and more recently menaced by ethnic 
violence 
byrd contended that the resolution could further inflame the 
ancient enmities behind that violence 
doles first attempt to crack the filibuster failed last 
thursday on a 4949 vote it takes 60 to halt debate and hes 
trying again this week 
no matter what happens on that vote the argument wont be over

the first order of business for the united 
states in the 1990s seems to be getting rid of the detritus of the 
80s 
that theme applies in literal terms to the pollutants garbage 
and deterioration left over from a long period of exuberant 
consumption and fast track living 
no coincidence then that environmental cleanup and waste 
management rank high on just about any forecasters list of growth 
industries for the new decade 
the principle also extends in a figurative sense to clearing 
away whats left of many financial and commercial ventures of the 
past 10 years that have either gone sour or simply worn out their 
welcome 
thus we have the governments program to try to sell assets of 
hundreds of failed savings institutions and the sudden departure 
of drexel burnham lambert from the wall street scene 
such spring cleanings in the economy are usually painful 
rancorous and expensive just ask the people who lose their jobs in 
the process or the taxpayers who often wind up footing the bill 
but if all goes according to plan they are supposed to produce 
beneficial results too 
thats the way it happened 10 years ago when the economy went 
in for its last fullscale overhaul 
then the primary target for purging was rapid inflation left 
over from the stagnant 70s the measures employed were drastic a 
new economic philosophy a new tax system and even the ouster of 
an incumbent president jimmy carter 
whether by chance or by design the effort succeeded opening 
the way for a durable economic boom 
now the chief villain almost everyone agrees is debt federal 
budgetdeficit debt corporate takeover debt illadvised bank 
debt real estate debt and consumer debt 
as the bill from the savings and loan debacle mounts in 
multimilliondollar increments observes economist edward yardeni 
at prudentialbache securities the financial system is a mess 
it remains to be seen just how difficult or maybe even 
dangerous the cleanup will be but there is abundant evidence that 
it already has begun with what rao chalasani an analyst at the 
investment firm of prescott ball amp turben inc describes as 
marketinduced credit rationing 
oncebold lenders of many types ranging from large banks to 
small investors eager to buy shares of junkbond mutual funds have 
turned very stingy with their money 
that point was driven home when drexel burnham one of the prime 
promoters and beneficiaries of the debt boom expired when its own 
supply of credit was cut off neither private financial 
institutions nor government regulators showed any interest in 
coming to the firms rescue 
credit rationing is a result of the abuses of the past and a 
needed cleansing process chalasani maintains it may well hurt 
economic output shortterm he says but it increases the 
longterm stability of the economy 
as in many another freemarket shakeup what looms as a crisis 
for many has also been perceived as an opportunity for others 
the rising star at a financial firm these days displacing the 
traders and dealbrokers of yore may be a workout specialist 
who tries to salvage something of value from a bad real estate 
investment or a failed business buyout 
martin sass president of a new york moneymanagement firm that 
bears his name sees a basic investment theme for the 1990s in 
distressed bonds and real estate properties that might sooner 
or later recover at least some of their lost market value 
though a strategy of that kind naturally involves risks he 
says with storm clouds looming as we head into the 1990s we 
believe the most timely and attractive opportunities are emerging 
from what might be termed the wreckage of the 1980s

its not every day you see 35 mandolin 
players performing ravel or a band called brave combo playing the 
doors people are strange in its own unique style of rock polka 
but thats part of the uniqueness of public tvs lonesome pine 
specials series 
the series coproduced by the kentucky center for the arts and 
kentucky educational television is a musical odyssey that looks at 
all forms of music and dance in different often whimsical ways 
the one on tap for saturday features the isobobs a combination 
of two fourmember groups the bobs new wave a capella singers 
and iso whose members are dancers and new wave vaudevillians 
lonesome pine which began its second pbs season in january 
might sound as if it got its title from an ode to a forlorn fir 
the name comes from a song written by sarah carter says 
richard van kleeck the series artistic director its a 
metaphor for a train a vehicle to take you places in the arts 
and to bring them to you 
the series which makes 11 shows a year at a cost of 50000 
each now is going abroad great britains channel 4 in london has 
bought it according to van kleeck who also is the shows 
coproducer 
begun four years ago by ket lonesome pine has featured such 
performers as veteran tap dancer howard sandman sims new 
orleans soul queen irma thomas and bluesguitar master walter 
wolfman washington and nigel kennedy the british classical 
jazz and pop violin virtuoso 
they might not necessarily be wellknown names but the series 
producers hope to change that 
our goal has always been to present artists that have been 
ignored by the media public television in particular says van 
kleeck some of these are actually old artists even legendary 
who have sort of been passed by and never got the notice they were 
due 
the ensemble performances have included masters of 
percussion with 12 drummers showing off the varied forms of the 
drum 
another show due in march strength in numbers will feature 
five top nashville studio session players playing violin banjo 
mandolin acoustic bass and dobro theyll perform what van vleeck 
describes as country and jazz chamber music 
on one occasion van kleeck has gotten in the act that was 
during the series 35mandolin extravaganza mando magnificat 
being sent again to pbs stations on march 24 
that show began with a single mandolin player when the 
mandolinists had multiplied to a full orchestra having played 
works ranging from classical to ragtime they got a conductor van 
kleeck a french horn player who studied at the new england 
conservatory of music 
the lonesome pine shows are taped at the kentucky center in 
july and august after that producerdirecter russ farmer and his 
staff start the editing mixing and dubbing that leads to the 
finished series 
farmer with ket for 16 years says the beauty of the series 
lies in its variety 
its like what they say about kentuckys weather he says 
if you dont like it wait a minute and itll change its 
such an eclectic series that theres got to be something there that 
youll like

the way a mother covers her babys bottom has 
become a matter of government concern legislation that would ban 
restrict or discourage the use of disposable diapers is being 
considered in a dozen or so states the environment is at stake 
proponents say mothers would be the big losers corn farmers 
perhaps the big winners 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was test marketed in 1961 in where else 
peoria ill 
and oh how it played 
the disposable diaper in the years since it has been improved 
elasticized legs gels super absorbency the anatomically more 
efficient his and hers versions 
it has become a 35 billionayear industry with 85 percent of 
americas mothers using them 
but the disposable diaper has become a prime target of angry 
environmentalists who consider it the very symbol of the ills of a 
throwaway society the problem is what to do with it once it has 
done its job throwaway diapers clog up the waste stream 
the way a mother covers her babys bottom has become a subject 
of hot debate in statehouses and city halls it has generated piles 
of studies reports and pamphlets who would have thought the 
manufacturers of disposable diapers would have to go to such 
lengths to defend such a wonder product 
bills either to ban restrict or tax disposable diapers are 
before the legislatures of about a dozen states 
on the other hand the controversy has breathed new life into 
the diaper service business and could prove a boon to corn farmers 
the rub is although disposable diapers account for only 2 
percent of the nations trash they will last 500 years in a 
landfill one proposed solution is the moreexpensive biodegradable 
diaper and thats where the corn farmers come in 
jeanne wirka a solidwaste reduction expert with the 
environmental action foundation says the disposable diaper is the 
largest single oneuse product for which there is a readily 
available alternative cloth diapers 
but the convenience factor is extraordinary many day care 
centers for example will not accept youngsters in cloth diapers 
and if everyone switched to cloth tomorrow there would be 
chaos there are not enough cloth diapers nor cloth diaper services 
in the country to accommodate them in environmentally hip 
washington dc 400 people are on the waiting list for the one 
diaper service in town 
the national association of diaper services after years of 
decline reports a 38 percent increase in business last year and a 
13 percent rise the year before the disposable diaper giants 
however say they see no blip yet on their sales screen 
the debate has produced strange bedfellows the six most active 
environmental groups and procter amp gamble co and kimberlyclark 
corp the disposable diaper manufacturers who control 75 percent 
of the market agree that biodegradable diapers are not the answer 
the environmentalists called for a boycott of degradable diapers 
in middecember saying their use only assuages the conscience of 
consumers who use them biodegradable diapers dont decompose in 
landfills because there is not enough moisture or oxygen they say 
taking an opposing view is the national association of corn 
growers based in st louis cornstarch is used in the degradables 
and this could open up a market of 150 million to 300 million 
bushels a year for the nations corn farmers spokesman tim draeger 
says 
so far the only state to enact any legislation has been 
nebraska which passed a law last session requiring the use of 
biodegradables by 1993 nebraska it might be noted is the 
nations thirdlargest corn producing state just behind iowa and 
illinois 
draeger argues that if the biodegradable diaper technology was 
improved it would mean america would be less dependent on foreign 
oil 
we are in the infancy of this technology he says we are 
at the model t level we have to learn to walk before we can run 
ms wirka says thats plain silly the amount of foreign oil 
in diapers is negligible and the socalled degradables also use 
some 
cincinnatibased procter amp gamble with a 165 billion slice of 
the disposable pie compared to kimberlyclarks 840 million 
has taken a much higher profile in its fight to keep babys bottom 
in pampers and luvs its products 
although closemouthed about the money it is spending on the 
diaper wars pampg is sponsoring two wellpublicized projects one in 
seattle demonstrating that plastic diapers can be recycled and 
another in st cloud minn showing diapers can be composted the 
seattle project is reputed to be a 500000 venture 
if you could throw that kind of money at every segment of the 
trash problem in america we wouldnt have a trash problem says 
jeffrey tryens of the council for policy alternatives a 
washingtonbased environmental group its just good pr for 
procter and gamble 
wirka however thinks the st cloud project may have some 
merit although she says that recycling project is just bogus 
procter amp gamble is in a difficult position they are always 
the target here and they are applying their corporate good guy 
image on something that is economically very dubious im more 
willing to say that the composting project is a more fruitful use 
of their resources 
pampg it should be noted has been a leader in recycling plastic 
bottles for its products selling refills for the same plastic 
bottle and marketing concentrates in smaller bottles where the 
consumer just needs to add water its soaps are also biodegradable 
since the diaper wars started making the nightly news shows 
politicians have gotten bolder tryens says he called a meeting 
about a year ago inviting legislators lobbyists 
environmentalists and others concerned about the issue 
at that time nobody even considered discussing a statewide 
ban he says the feeling was that no respectable politician 
would even propose such legislation and that it just wouldnt fly 
yet one year later the state of vermont is proposing just such 
legislation as part of a much larger environmental bill if passed 
no disposable diapers would be sold in vermont after 1993 
nancy alexander of new haven conn is one whos profiting by 
it all she started her own cloth diaper service in january and 
says clients are flocking to her door 
ive always wanted to go into my own business and this just 
sort of fell into my lap she says whats more is that all of 
my clients treat me like im some kind of a hero 
one of her clients with a newborn baby said her 4yearold was 
watching her change the baby with a disposable diaper and had a 
quizzical look on her face 
what is it asked the mother 
why dont they invent a diaper you could just wash and use 
over and over asked the child

bills to discourage the use of disposable 
diapers are being debated in the legislatures of a dozen states 
with an outright ban proposed in vermont 
but most of the proposed legislation is given little hope of 
becoming law at least this year in florida a bill was withdrawn 
for more study 
most of the proposals call for putting a tax on throwaway 
diapers except in corngrowing states where biodegradable diapers 
are being pushed because corn is used in their manufacture 
in colorado for instance a bill that would have taxed 
disposables onefourth of one cent per diaper was sent off to three 
committees usually the kiss of death 
that babys going to go down like a burning kite if i know 
the colorado legislature commented one veteran reporter 
he knew his legislature the bill was killed in its first day of 
hearings 
a bill in new hampshire cosponsored by deborah arnie arnesen 
a democrat from orford would put a 10centperdiaper tax on the 
disposables and no she doesnt think its going through this 
time 
this is a very industrial state says the mother of four 
procter and gamble could come in here and run for governor and 
win we dont even have a bottle law it would be almost irrational 
for something to pass the first time around there isnt enough 
time to assess the situation 
isnt a 10cent tax a little steep 
its politics she says you ask for the sun the moon and 
the stars and then you compromise down 
when it gets to the point that a family may save 15 a week by 
using a diaper service and when some good marketers come in here 
then maybe people will start to use cloth diapers at least part of 
the time 
ms arnesen says she would be the first to fight against a 
statewide ban 
you cant ignore the convenience factor she says when i 
brought my 5weekold daughter to the legislature with me i wasnt 
about to ask committee members to sit in a smelly room it was 
enough they put up with the baby 
other states that have or are considering legislation include 
new york connecticut oregon iowa pennsylvania washington 
hawaii ohio and kentucky

a study commissioned by the diaper service 
industry suggests disposable diapers may harbor bacteria that cause 
polio meningitis and hepatitis 
not so says t scott stewart chief spokesman for procter amp 
gamble a major manufacturer of disposble diapers 
stewart says the national association of diaper services paid 
15000 for that study and it has been discredited nonetheless the 
suggestion continues to crop up in news stories about the great 
diaper wars 
environmentalist jeanne wirka claims the report has not been 
discredited and research is continuing 
however stewart has on his side the fact that there is no 
evidence that any case of polio hepatitis or meningitis was ever 
caused by disposable diapers and some european countries have been 
using them for 50 years 
he also says there is 1000 times more pet fecal matter entombed 
in landfills than infant leavings on the disposable diaper

the massacre of six jesuit priests and educators 
in el salvador in november underscored the danger facing hundreds 
of clergymen and church workers of all denominations in the 
volatile central american country their work in the shantytowns 
and refugee camps has cast many of them in the role of enemies of 
the farright 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
their lives are in daily peril 
these men and women of various religious orders who work among the 
poor and disenfranchised on the fringes of el salvadors 10year 
civil war 
they are viewed as subversives at best by the military 
establishment and the conservative government 
to the extremists of the farright they are mortal enemies 
our only sin is opting for the poor serving the poor helping 
poor communities lutheran bishop medardo gomez said in january 
upon his return to el salvador gomez whose church works 
extensively with refugees and in shantytowns left the country in 
november as a huge guerrilla offensive by the farabundo marti 
national liberation front convulsed the capital 
gomez whose offices have been bombed twice during the past 18 
months received repeated death threats prior to his flight the 
rightist government of president alfredo cristiani deplored the 
threats but it also said it could not guarantee gomezs safety 
el salvador the size of massachusetts with 5 million 
inhabitants is overwhelmingly roman catholic protestant 
denominations have established congregations in recent decades and 
some churches including the lutheran baptist and episcopal 
administer programs on behalf of victims of the civil war 
the world was shocked on nov 16 by the massacre of six jesuit 
priests and educators the leadership of the prestigious central 
american university and the nucleus of el salvadors intellectual 
life the priests cook and her 15yearold daughter also were 
slain 
cristiani announced in january that government soldiers 
committed the murders perhaps the most heinous politically 
motivated crime of a civil war infamous for its heinous political 
crimes he identified four officers including a colonel and five 
soldiers as the alleged culprits eight of the nine were charged 
with premeditated murder and jailed one a soldier is a fugitive 
it is claimed that what happened was that a small group of 
members of the armed forces have stained the honor of the military 
institution monsignor gregorio rosa chavez auxiliary bishop of 
san salvador said in a recent interview we find that difficult 
to accept 
we do not think these are isolated cases of people who stray 
from the path of an institution rather we think they are the 
product of a way of thinking an education that views as subversive 
the work of people like the slain jesuits the work of church 
people committed to helping resolve the problems of the poor work 
on behalf of human rights 
this education in the final analysis teaches that we are the 
enemy he said 
the farright considers the jesuits to be marxist ideologues 
throughout the civil war the jesuits at central american 
university have maintained that the conflict arose from gross 
social injustice and that only by addressing its causes could it be 
resolved this angered the armed forces and the elite who 
contended the revolution was the result of international communist 
expansion 
the slaying of the jesuits was not the first murderous attack on 
a voice from the church 
a sniper killed catholic archbishop oscar arnulfo romero as he 
said mass on march 24 1980 the day after he issued an impassioned 
plea to army troops to disobey orders to kidnap torture or 
summarily execute suspected leftists 
the christian democratic government that handed power to 
cristiani last june said it had proof that top figures in arena 
cristianis party plotted the murder but the case became 
terminally bogged down in a judiciary notorious for its 
inefficiency 
prosecution of romeros killers is considered highly unlikely 
on dec 2 1980 national guardsmen kidnapped and killed three 
us nuns and a lay woman churchworker five soldiers were 
convicted of the murders but officers implicated in the crime were 
never prosecuted the convicted guardsmen said they had been told 
the women were involved in subversive activity 
all four women helped people displaced by the war two dorothy kazel 
and jean donovan worked with an orphanage 10 
miles south of san salvador 
the orphanage the oscar arnulfo romero community is home to 
154 boys and girls whose parents were killed inof them 
sister the war it 
represents in microcosm the oftenstrained relations between the 
government and armed forces on one side and a church that 
considers its mission more than purely pastoral 
the rev ken myers a diocesan priest and native of norwalk 
ohio founded the center in august 1980 
the project began with a dozen real sick orphan children from 
the refugee centers he said in an interview in his office at the 
orphanage just outside the small town of zahayward formed a 
nonprofit corporation to attract new industry to the area 
the resort association has written letters of support at the 
tribes request for various projects 
the tribe has offered to stock fish in offreservation lakes 
when its new hatchery is constructed 
the resort association donated 200 to help defray costs to 
send a delegation of wisconsin indians to germany last september 
teachers from public and reservation schools occasionally get 
training together at each others schools indian teachers have 
moved from the reservation schools into public schools 
paul demaine who owns a newspaper on the reservation said the 
two sides get along because the silent majority has been able to 
speak up here 
when racism started bubbling to the surface the nonindian 
community spoke up against it demaine said 
it wasnt always so peaceful toebe recalls 
equal rights for everyone a group opposed to indian treaty 
rights was active in the area for a short period its influence 
however waned after one of its leaders received less than 20 
percent of the vote in a 1986 run for the state senate in a 
campaign in which treaty rights was a big issue toebe said 
gaiashkibos said confrontations over treaty rights still could 
flare up in the hayward area because the players and personalities 
can change 
gaiashkibos plays down his role in fostering cooperation but a 
poster outside his office provides some insight into his 
philosophies 
it says we shall learn these devices the white man has we 
shall master his machinery his inventions his skills his 
medicine his planning but we will retain our beauty and still be 
indian

todays filmmakers are astonished to learn that film classics 
such as citizen kane casablanca and high noon were 
shot almost entirely on studio stages and backlots throughout the 
1930s and 40s a movie made on location was a rarity as films 
created a dreamlike world that enthralled entertainmentstarved 
audiences 
one of the many charms of the strangely titled joe versus the 
volcano is its otherworldliness the result of being filmed 
mostly within the confines of a studio there are a few cityscapes 
but the ocean scenes were shot on a studio tank and the south sea 
island is gloriously phony you keep expecting dorothy lamour to 
appear in a sarong 
joe versus the volcano is the first comedy hit of the 1990s 
tom hanks is bigger than ever if you liked meg ryan in when 
harry met sally youll like her three times as much in this 
one she plays three roles 
the brain behind the film is john patrick shanley whose 
moonstruck proved he knew how to write credible characters in 
hilarious situations this time he writes and directs assuring 
that his vision reaches the screen intact 
the physical vision has been realized by production designer bo 
welch starting with the zigzag pathway along which hanks and his 
fellow workers slouch to their abominable jobs in a pharmaceutical 
supply company home of the rectal probe 
hanks leaves his numbing job after being told by dr robert 
stack that he has a fatal disease he is enlisted by industrialist 
lloyd bridges to travel to the south sea island of waponi woo and 
act as a human sacrifice to appease the raging volcano bridges 
then hopes to gain a rare mineral for his superconductor business 
the latterday jack lemmon as portrayer of societys victim 
hanks is perfect for the role along the way he meets three women 
a downtrodden fellow worker the spacedout daughter of bridges and 
her halfsister who accompanies hanks on his voyage all are the 
incredibly inventive meg ryan 
joe versus the volcano was produced by teri schwartz with 
the team of steven spielberg kathleen kennedy and frank marshall 
as executive producers happily this is one amblin entertainment 
production that has wit as well as special effects 
the warner bros release is rated pg for minor swearing and

honey i shrunk the kids walt disney home video vhsbeta 
2299 rated pg 
 
how nice to see the silly and easy honey i shrunk the kids 
available to the video watcher its a light improbable adventure 
with lots of family and human values 
the movie stars rick moranis ghostbusters ii little shop 
of horrors as wayne szalinski a scientist whose inventions 
gather laughs rather than loot his latest is an incredible 
shrinking machine he presents it at a symposium but his colleagues 
only snicker 
meanwhile back at his chaotic home his son and daughter and 
the neighbors two boys accidentally find themselves in front of 
the machine which has been activated when a baseball crashes 
through the attic window poof the little tykes soon become just 
that inch tall 
dad returns in a bitter frenzy and smashes his invention glass 
flies everywhere and the wee ones run for their lives between the 
cavernous cracks in the floorboards then dad decides to neaten up 
a bit and sweeps the smashed machine and the kiddies into a plastic 
garbage bag and takes same to the trash cans on the street 
but this is a fearless foursome they cut themselves free with a 
sliver of glass and set out on a little adventure to return home 
suddenly an ordinary backyard becomes a jungle of unknown terrors 
the sprinkler system is like the hoover dam bursting open a 
scorpion is the same as facing down a tyrannosaurus rex during 
prehistoric times an ant is like a wild horse that is easily tamed 
and becomes a mascot a lego toy offers refuge and a stale cookie 
is a feast for millions 
the predicament brings out the best in the two sets of kids who 
before being zapped pretty much hated each other amy amy oneill 
and nick robert oliveri szalinski and ron jared rushton and 
little russ thomas brown thompson 
nick a young einstein and russ a rough and tumble real 
boy are the more endearing of the four amy has little to do 
except provide a love interest for the girlishlooking ron and play 
big sister to her little brother nick the acting is adequate but 
not exciting only brown and oliveri provide a spark 
as the father moranis is his usual nerdy but lovable self and 
his tenacity is rewarded marcia strassman as his wife diane is 
an afterthought the neighbors are matt frewer and kristine 
sutherland 
bad neighbors become good friends in the end bullies learn 
humility loners become team players and callous children learn 
the value of family and friendship 
the special effects are fun and the miniatures crew did an 
excellent job with models and sets 
buy this one your kids will love it and so will you

rigoletto opera in three acts by giuseppe verdi a two cd 
album london riccardo chailly conductor 
 
this recording of what many consider verdis breakthrough 
opera from his youthful period into a more mature style has a 
bright sound a thoughtful conductor riccardo chailly and about 
the best cast that could be assembled today 
by coincidence the three principals are the same singers who 
have just completed a series of rigolettos in a new production 
at the metropolitan opera house 
luciano pavarotti is in fine form as the womanizing scoundrelly 
duke a role he has been singing better than anyone else for two 
decades illadvised ventures into heavier parts have robbed him of 
some of the unforced freshness he had in his youth but pavarotti 
is still a model of stylishness and opulent sound he even musters 
a high eflat for the climax of his act 2 cabaletta possenti 
amor mi chiama 
as gilda the betrayed maiden who sacrifices her life for this 
cad soprano june anderson shows why she has generated such 
excitement in the operatic world of late she displays dazzling 
purity of tone all the way up to high e but more impressively she 
has a fullsize dramatic voice not the pipsqueak coloratura one 
often hears in this part comparisons with joan sutherland may be 
premature but one is eager to hear more 
in the title role baritone leo nucci sounds better than he did 
in live performance probably because the studio recording helps 
amplify a voice of only medium strength his interpretation is 
always interesting and often moving he seems to be living the 
character not just singing the notes 
as a bonus two relatively minor parts are cast with unusual 
strength bass nicolai ghiaurov sounds appropriately sepulchral as 
the hired assassin sparafucile and mezzo shirley verrett brings 
her usual regal presence to the part of his sister the sultry 
maddalena just to make it clear miss verrett is no supporting 
player the album carries a special note stating that she agreed 
to make a cameo appearance as a special favor to mr pavarotti

music man rca bobby ross avila 
 
on first glance bobby ross avila might seem an escapee from 
menudo 
this 13yearold however displays more talent on his debut 
album music man than those latin teenyboppers 
but whats going on here he is only 13 another babe in 
musicland he makes debbie gibson and new kids on the block look 
well adult at least hes got some years on old skull whose three 
members are around age 10 
so has mtv caused a rash of adolescent fameseekers is avila 
who goes by ross going to give the kids of america an 
inferiority complex because they too havent put out an album by 
their teenage years 
well maybe not avilas a different case he got into the music 
biz through his father bobby avila sr a veteran of top 40 and 
rhythm and blues bands 
unlike new kids and tiffany avila writes his own music plays 
keyboards and programs drum synthesizers 
his album is an upbeat collection of dance tracks freshened 
with some hiphopping beats and some rapping none of the songs 
break any new musical ground but they wont break any sensitive 
ears either 
avilas voice sounds something like the young michael jackson 
it also sounds like a 13yearolds 
he is a kid to win the hearts of not only young girls but also 
their mothers he makes several references to god in his liner 
notes and lyrics giving thanks for his musical ability and also 
does an antidrug song drugs aint my thang 
avila who cowrote the songs with his father and james felix 
also offers a few ballads theyre pretty sappy about what one 
might expect from a 13yearold

so whats so unusual about a german director 
and a german star making a film in stuttgart well it happens to 
be stuttgart ark 
the movie is rosalie goes shopping another collaboration of 
the idiosyncratic filmmaker percy adlon and his favorite actress 
marianne saegebrecht she recently was in los angeles to talk about 
how the film came about 
percy was making a trip from the east coast to the west coast 
and he came upon a place called stuttgart arkansas he found this 
very precious little city with its interesting buildings and 
factory and he saw this plane circling around he found the 
airport and he talked to the pilot and to his wife she said 
that was the beginning of the story having made a lot of 
documentaries he likes to use real people and real places 
adlon and cowriter christopher doherty devised a fanciful tale 
of an arkansas cropduster brad davis his german wife and their 
large brood to keep her family in luxuries the wife plays her 
credit cards with the skill of a las vegas blackjack dealer she 
breaks all the monetary laws plus the criminal code but amasses 
enough credit for a leveraged buyout 
when percy came to me with the script first i was shocked 
saegebrecht said i couldnt imagine playing this strong woman 
with a big ego and shes stealing and doing this and that i said 
no this is not for me 
percy said i wrote it for you you are in my mind because i 
discovered there is another part of you i said no he said 
think about it 
i was still against it i dont have to lie i dont have to 
steal i dont have the bad motherrelationship that she has but 
then i went into her background of why she wanted to get as far 
away from home as possible also when i went to arkansas i 
understood her much better 
adlon often gets his way with the actress though not always 
theirs is a symbiotic relationship that resulted in sugarbaby 
in 1984 and bagdad cafe in 1987 the director has remarked 
there is no facet of mariannes face which is not alluring when 
caught by the camera and she doesnt even realize it 
indeed saegebrecht seems ingenuous about her success though 
she retains the confidence of an experienced actress she is stout 
but moves like a petite woman her english comes in spurts with 
occasional transpositions of german rhetoric 
rosalie goes shopping continues her education in things 
american it began with visits to new york pennsylvania and los 
angeles then moved to the southwestern desert for the filming of 
bagdad cafe arkansas was a revelation 
the middle west my god what a difference she exclaimed 
there is a village and then it is very far to the next village 
the restaurants are closing at 9 its not allowed to drink 
alcohol it is allowed to buy it then they hide it in a bag all 
these things are completely different 
and its a mans mans mans world they all have guns not 
only one gun two guns three guns when you go on the highway all 
the cars coming by theres a gun in the window they like to hunt 
we were there during squirrel hunting later its duck hunting time 
but also i met beautiful people i walked around they were 
shocked that i would they were very communicative and helpful 
saegebrecht was born in starnberg bavaria in 1945 and started 
in show business by managing a cabaret revue with her thenhusband 
in 1977 she concocted something she called opera curiosa a 
touring revue with a cast including ballet dancers strip teasers 
clowns musclemen street singers and opera performers 
adlon cast her first in a television drama followed with a 
feature film the swing her appearances in his films have 
caught the attention of american filmmakers paul mazursky cast her 
in moon over parador and danny devito gave her a role with 
himself kathleen turner and michael douglas in the war of the 
roses 
more hollywood movies 
maybe so she said but my home will always be in munich

when georges seurat painted his famous work 
sunday afternoon on the island of grande jatte in the 19th 
century he could never have dreamed his depiction of a tranquil 
day in a park would someday be used to sell computer software 
nor could claude monet imagine his paintings of water lilies 
would be turned into posters adorning art students dormitory walls 
while art for arts sake is certainly big business us 
auction houses sold more than 15 billion worth of art last year 
chalking up their bestselling season ever art used for 
postcards calendars posters and advertising is becoming an 
increasingly important source of revenue for financially strapped 
museums 
and since museums often must hold legal rights on a work to turn 
it into saleable merchandise museums are becoming more willing to 
fight for copyrights and licensing privileges on the art they 
exhibit 
bostons museum of fine arts is locked in such a dispute with 
the center for creative photography at the university of arizona in 
tuscon the museum earned the centers ire when it printed a series 
of posters of edward weston photographs to accompany an exhibit of 
his work 
the center says it holds the copyright to reproduce all weston 
photographs and says the museum reproduced them without permission 
but the museum says the center is trying to place unnecessary 
constraints on the pictures and is suing the center to have the 
copyright declared invalid 
if someone has a valid copyright and doesnt want us to use a 
work well usually just drop it said carl zahn director of 
publications at the museum of fine arts but in this case we felt 
like we were being constrained from having this exhibit 
the suit is pending and in the meantime a us district judge 
has ordered that the show continue the posters can be printed 
using a limited number of weston images with a disclaimer that 
reads the arizona board of regents claims a copyright on these 
photographs of edward weston the museum of fine arts contests the 
validity of that claim 
center director terrence pitts said the museums right to hold 
the exhibit was never contested but he said the center wanted to 
ensure the photos werent used improperly 
we want to make sure these photos dont fall into the public 
domain where they can be used for commercial purposes pitts 
said commercialism isnt in the spirit of westons photographs 
but commercialism is exactly what elizabeth burke has in mind 
for many of the artworks housed in the art institute of chicago 
burke coordinator of reproductions and marketing for the 
museum oversees which artistic images the museum licenses for use 
in advertisements 
once advertisers came to museums cap in hand seeking the right 
to use masterpieces for advertisements now burke has turned the 
tables and is marketing the institutes works to advertising and 
publicity types 
its a lot like a stock photography service burke said 
advertising people dont know the resource they have in museums 
burke charges a flat fee for the use of images say 750 for 
the cover of a book last year such charges brought the museum 
85000 more than double the amount made just a few years ago 
but not all requests are granted burke recalls the german 
company that wanted to use edward hoppers nighthawks to 
advertise their fax machines 
they just wanted to use a blurry image from the painting 
burke said i felt that it was such a small part of the painting 
that it wasnt worth it i wanted hopper to rest in peace 
another request came from a fitness magazine that wanted to put 
american gothic grant woods famous painting of an american 
farming couple on its cover 
they want to put a jogging suit on the woman and make her 
sort of voluptuous they want to give the man a golf club and have 
him look sporty burke said were not sure about that one 
pat musolf director of marketing for the international museum 
of photography at the george eastman house in rochester ny said 
copyright disputes involving photographs seem to be coming up more 
and more 
a lot of people are claiming rights to licensing even if they 
dont really have those rights she said 
musolf said her museum recently got into a spat with the estate 
of fred astaire for distributing an edward steichen photograph of 
astaire without first paying a reproduction fee 
it hadnt even occurred to us wed have to pay she said 
it puts me on edge 
distributors often end up paying such fees to copyright holders 
even if theyre not sure the claim is valid since its cheaper 
than taking the case to court musolf said 
its almost a way of intimidating someone into paying a fee 
she said and the copyright laws are very hard to understand 
very confusing even the lawyers dont know half the time who 
really has the rights 
but burke said reproductions are often made without obtaining 
licensing rights with unsightly results 
we had a postcard company use one of our renoirs recently 
without permission burke said it turned out looking purple 
and theres no purple in the painting its hideous 
burke said museums are bound to hold more tightly to their 
licensing rights 
museums arent as rich as they once were and this is a source 
of revenue for us she said so were going to put out our 
necks to get them to stop using those images without getting the 
rights

when the roches sisters maggie terre and 
suzzy sing harmony their voices dont just join they overlap 
like hands clasped in support 
their records sound as spontaneous as singalongs in the 
backseat of the car as intimate as latenight talks around the 
kitchen table 
but doubts haunt these family hearttohearts on their seventh 
album speak question marks hang over declarations of love 
disappointments are grudgingly accepted as facts of life humor 
becomes a final defense against despair 
i think one of the reasons weve been able to keep a real 
intense sort of creative integrity going if i may be so bold is 
because we have the support of each other terre said of herself 
and her two sisters in a recent interview 
if i were one person dealing with business people and record 
people who are constantly giving feedback i wouldnt have been 
able to make it were constantly checking in checking the pulse 
of what were doing what we want to say 
music brings the good news on feeling is mutual the pace 
is relaxed easy the percussion gently keeping time the singing 
is assured even relieved the sound of three wise women gratified 
to still be together 
when youre listening to this record youre listening to 
people who have been basically singing together at least 20 years 
which is a very seasoned blending of voices suzzy said i 
think it would be hard to arrive at that without time 
the roches grew up in park ridge nj winning local talent 
shows and attracting enough attention for maggie and terre to tour 
folk clubs around the country younger sister suzzy at first 
staying behind 
avowed fans of paul simon upon learning that he had expressed 
interest in their singing backup on his 1973 album there goes 
rhymin simon the roches decided to accept his offer without 
bothering to tell him 
we kind of crashed the session terre recalled we had 
three days off because a gig had been canceled so we took the bus 
from pittsburgh down to muscle shoals ala and we just showed up 
at his studio and said we heard that you wanted us to sing 
there was a moment when we first arrived maggie added 
and they all had gone out to lunch the person didnt know who we 
were and we said were looking for paul simon and he sort of went 
into this get away from here mode 
only maggie and terre appeared on their debut album seductive 
reasoning in 1975 but suzzy permanently joined them for the 
acclaimed the roches released four years later 
i gotta dance to keep from crying smokey robinson once 
sang and the roches seemed to understand camping their way 
through lost love menial jobs and anxiety about health food the 
sound was all natural featuring acoustic guitars and proudly 
undubbed vocals 
a decade later the production is more polished and the only 
outandout laughs come on the antisex backlash of the 80s 
suzzys selected transcript of a conversation between her sisters 
otherwise the mood is more reflective sentimental as the roches 
sing of listening to rain falling in the darkness and proudly 
declare i love my mom 
i think people who tend to see what were doing as being 
humorous it always strikes me that theyre not looking at it 
closely enough terre said 
a lot of situations you run into the very edge of sadness or 
trouble usually sort of turns into something thats almost a 
grotesque kind of humor sometimes you see a terrible accident but 
youre inclined to laugh 
big nuthin recalls the early years when the roches seemed 
just a song or concert away from commercial success terre compared 
it to the poem in which a man sees a ball of gold in the sky and 
reaches for it when the prize is finally in his hands he 
discovers the ball of gold is merely a rock 
they learned to stop reaching in 1985 after parting ways with 
warner bros minus outside pressure the roches now signed with 
mca finally relaxed handling daytoday struggles with a 
resigned shrug of the shoulders 
in a very practical sense when we separated from warner 
bros the whole question of can we make a living without the big 
machinary was such a struggle suzzy said 
even though we have the creative freedom its a struggle 
constantly and i think we did a lot of soul searching during that 
time and really came out much better for it 
we sort of turned our back on the whole record thing terre 
recalled we said were just going to write songs and perform 
on the road and then all of a sudden a record deal came along 
like when youre not trying to fall in love with somebody you fall 
in love

ann beattie loves childrens drawings she finds 
them wonderful even radical and regrets that those qualities are 
usually lost in the art rooms of local schools 
her own work is a careful balance between the untutored joy of a 
nursery schoolers fingerpainting and the polished craft of a 
professional portrait its a twostep process the author says 
writing and editing the secrets and surprises of first putting the 
words on paper and the often chilly task of elimination and 
alteration that follows 
picturing will random house 1895 her first novel in 
four years is the final product of a frustrating juggling act that 
saw 15 chapters and several working titles lie crumpled in a nearby 
wastebasket the result of a creative process with several 
unexpected agonizing plot twists 
unless you intuit correctly whether as an adult or a child 
youve just got to revise it and fix it to make it a work of art 
explained beattie 43 whose work includes the novels chilly 
scenes of winter and falling in place and the shortstory 
collections the burning house and where youll find me 
i did intuit a lot of things that i gave the wrong form for 
for instance there were fairy tales in the first or second or 
third version of this book and they were totally inappropriate 
they were good writing so what there was no reason for them to be 
there 
the novel reads like an album of deepfocus photography with 
matters small and large in sharp detail a pair of red trunks seems 
as bright as the afternoon sun the breakup of a marraige is no 
clearer than the curve of a mans fingers 
time is accelerated and stretched out the narrative a montage 
of jump cuts and lengthy flashbacks years are compressed into 
paragraphs while beattie dwells on moments for several pages 
what is time beattie wonders in picturing will 
as the child experiences it it makes no sense at all 
children have little or no sense of what goes on behind the scenes 
so when things happen they seem just to happen suddenly 
considered from the childs perspective life is always 
speeding up or going too slowly the best ideas come at bedtime 
the circus ends too soon string beans take forever to eat 
like much of her fiction the plot is secondary as beattie 
probes the lives of a group of adults and the 5yearold boy 
will who brings them together 
picturing will is divided into three sections mother 
father and child with passages from a diary woven 
throughout jody is a photographer and like beattie a resident of 
charlottesville va wayne her exhusband now lives in florida 
and mel her boyfriend works in a new york art gallery 
when i caught on to what was going on it was happening on so 
many different levels that to realize the implication of all of 
them was extremely difficult the temptation was alweys to go for 
good writing not to go for something more haunting beattie said 
facts are not so much revealed as overheard like a child with 
his ear pressed against the kitchen door characters are seen up 
close and at a distance lost in their own thoughts and found in 
the thoughts of others 
one of the working titles of the book was triptych i was 
thinking about it the way a painter would think three parts all 
reflecting one another simultaneously beattie said 
a painting has an advantage you can look at it in the novel 
you have to read 230 pages to figure out whats going on it is the 
sort of book that makes you understand only in retrospect where a 
painting can make you understand instantly 
beattie who grew up in washington studied english literature 
at american university and 18th century literature in the graduate 
program of the university of connecticut 
her work appeared in the new yorker in 1974 and two years later 
chilly scenes of winter and the shortstory collection 
distortions were published simultaneously 
the first 50 pages of chilly scenes were thrown out and what 
remained seemed disjointed a muted symphony of unfinished thoughts 
and awkward silences beatties characters survivors of the 1960s 
counterculture drifted through a series of anticlimaxes 
a fathers death is confused with memories of the days 
groceries the reconciliation of the books young couple is 
followed by a crazy womans study of snowflakes 
it would seem to me to be unfortunately selfabsorbed to 
suggest in fiction something that isnt true in life which is when 
things reach a crescendo that is indeed neatly where things end 
beattie said 
i cant think of any event in my life or any event that i have 
observed where ive had the curtain drop at the moment when the 
significant line is uttered 
she rejects the term minimalist for her terse sentences and 
semiarticulate characters its an invention of the media she 
says and not reflective of her more recent work like the 1985 
novel love always beatties most humorous book 
all artists are involved in personal quests regardless of how 
well they seem to be investigating larger matters beattie 
writes picturing will is an open book the author insists and 
many of the thirdperson observations are really her own 
there are value judgments all over the place she said 
the process of selection the process of organization its not 
whats off the page between the lines and so forth its what is 
on the page with this book it would be extremely difficult not to 
know where i stand

randy travis might be a country music 
superstar but he hasnt forgotten those lean hard days when he 
made a living washing dishes and cooking catfish 
he has won more than 40 awards for his singing has sold 10 
million records and made such songs as forever and ever amen 
and its just a matter of time into hits 
so far in his short career the 30yearold travis has made 
three international concert tours performed on just about every 
network tv show that features live music and performed twice for 
president bush 
there have been changes in his life with success but hes still 
the same softspoken randy travis 
it hasnt changed me as a person he said in an interview 
its changed my lifestyle i live out of a suitcase on the road 
but i still enjoy doing the same things i always have i still 
enjoy the same people and the same music 
however he no longer has to work as a 200aweek cook and 
dishwasher 
about four years ago if the dishes werent piling up and the 
food orders were filled travis would step out of the kitchen and 
onto the nashville palaces cramped stage and sing for three dozen 
or so people 
it crosses my mind quite often he said of those days and 
nights at the grill i still have friends there i had good times 
there i didnt mind washing the dishes or cooking or whatever 
needed to be done 
i would go in and clean the place up a lot of days before the 
business opened i didnt mind it 
travis a native of marshville nc began singing country 
music and playing guitar at age 8 he moved to charlotte nc at 
age 16 and performed in nightclubs for five years 
he moved to nashville in 1981 and was signed by warner bros 
four years later after a warners executive heard him sing at the 
nashville palace restaurantnightclub 
his most recent album no holdin back has sold 1 million 
copies his lp always and forever is at the 3 million mark 
storms of life is at 2 million and old 8 x 10 chips is in 
with another 1 million sales of singles push the total past 10 
million 
its an amazing thought he said i didnt expect to have 
that kind of success ive been very shocked 
his top single record was forever and ever amen which 
appears destined to become a country classic 
it said something to everybody travis said the song said 
things people could relate to its been used at a lot of 
weddings 
his other hits include deeper than the holler on the 
other hand its just a matter of time promises is it 
still over honky tonk moon and i wont need you anymore 
travis believes hes been successful because the public was 
ready for his style of hardcore country music with his deep voice 
and acoustic instruments his song lyrics focus on such themes as 
romance and personal relationships 
the country music business had been the same people for a 
lot of years he said i think the music got boring for some 
reason the record companies werent signing new acts but then 
they went back to basic music 
then i was in the right place at the right time its funny 
because i got turned down for several years by every label in town 
there wasnt a place to put what i was doing i had to wait on my 
turn i guess 
he performed at president bushs inaugural gala a year ago and 
performed early this year at a celebration marking bushs first 
year in office 
its a very scary feeling travis recalled about 
entertaining the president its different than any other crowd 
you dont normally go to our shows and look out at tuxedos and 
evening gowns 
i got to go inside the white house this most recent trip and 
he bush was joking around he said he wished he had time to go 
play some randy travis cds it made me feel good it was a great 
honor

bonuses of 196 million in cash and 64 million in company stock 
less than reports that pointed to large payments prior to the

forbes magazine is the cornerstone of a forbes 
family empire that ranges from publishing to collections of faberge 
eggs a moroccan palace a south pacific island and acres of 
colorado ranchland 
malcolm s forbes made it all work in tandem through force of 
personality 
publishing executives and analysts said forbes magazine lost its 
its best salesman this past weekend with the death of its chairman 
and editor in chief 
forbes sojourns by motorcycle and hot air balloon through 
exotic locales and his lavish parties attended by heads of state 
celebrities and corporate bosses undoubtedly helped create 
excitement about his flagship magazine 
im sure that trickled down to advertising orders said 
magazine publishing consultant martin walker 
media analyst john reidy agreed that forbes style helped in a 
major way to bring in advertisers there was probably nobody quite 
like that before 
but the analysts said forbes also left behind a strong 
organization in which he gave increasing responsibility to his 
designated successor his oldest son malcolm forbes jr known as 
steve and that the company should thrive 
malcolm jr who has won four awards for economic forecasting 
from usx corp announced sunday he would take over as chairman and 
chief executive of the magazine and the familyowned company and as 
editor in chief of forbes 
three other forbes sons also have roles with the company 
while the death of malcolm forbes is a loss to journalism and 
certainly to the company he did so much to build one can fully 
anticipate that that his company will continue to do very well 
said marshall loeb managing editor of fortune a key competitor to 
forbes magazine 
forbes magazine was started two years before malcolm forbes was 
born 
his father scottish immigrant bertie charles forbes was a 
syndicated financial journalist for a new york newspaper and 
launched forbes in 1917 
malcolm forbes born aug 19 1919 became associate publisher 
of the magazine in 1947 when bc forbes died he was succeeded by 
his oldest son bruce and malcolm moved up to the posts of editor 
and publisher 
bruce died in 1964 and malcolm took the top jobs the magazine 
had about 800 ad pages a year and a circulation of 100000 at his 
death ad pages were over 3900 and circulation exceeded 735000 
forbes made his fathers magazine unique among the business 
magazines by providing a more personalized view of business 
than fortune and business week did according to the magazine 
analyst walker 
the magazine focused more on the strategies of individual 
entrepreneurs and corporate leaders rather than daytoday business 
news its big annual list was not of the top companies like the 
fortune 500 but the wealthiest 400 american individuals and 
families 
he forced the others to address business in a more human and 
personal way walker said fortunes loeb said he shook us all 
up 
last year the biweekly forbes ad pages were slightly ahead of 
the biweekly fortune at 3775 pages but behind the weekly business 
week at 4914 pages according to publishers information bureau 
figures for 1989 
walker said forbes circulation trails both fortune and business 
week which he said were at 783000 and 901000 respectively 
a few years after taking over the business forbes decided to 
diversify into other areas he purchased ranch land in colorado and 
land by lakes in missouri parts of which have been made available 
for sale 
the company acquired laucala one of the fiji islands in the 
south pacific where executives can go on retreats in keeping with 
his wishes forbes body will be cremated and the ashes buried on 
the island 
forbes invited dozens of bigwigs to his palace in tangier 
morocco last year for his 70th birthday party visitors to the 
forbes building in new york can see a collection of jeweled 
farberge eggs that were made in czarist russia 
forbes owns the old battersea house on the river thames in 
london which he used only last week for an international bridge 
tournament featuring some top corporate chiefs he was stricken 
only hours after his return from london early saturday 
his fortune has been estimated at between 400 million and 12 
billion 
all of these holdings helped forbes cultivate contacts with 
corporate executives which he hoped made them more disposed to buy 
advertising with his magazine indeed he initially suggested he 
might be able to write off the 2 million cost of his moroccan 
birthday bash as a business expense 
forbes also expanded his publishing holdings the forbes company 
owns american heritage magazine a monthly that specializes in 
stories about important historical events only a week ago forbes 
launched egg a magazine exploring the latest in fashion and food 
in new york and los angeles 
forbes also owns 12 weekly newspapers and two shopping guides in 
central new jersey where the forbes estate is located it owns an 
investment advisory institute that publishes a newsletter and 
offers educational programs

why is mickey mouse so short why doesnt 
disney hire kids to help develop projects isnt chairman michael 
eisner offended by bette midlers foul mouth 
of every five disney stockholders four own fewer than 100 
shares about half have 10 or fewer many own a single share and 
proudly possess certificates bearing the likeness of the worlds 
most famous rodent to prove it 
and as they did this past week thousand upon thousands throng 
to the disney shareholders meeting each year with attitudes so 
protective they might be worrying over a favorite restaurant 
changing its menu rather than an entertainment colossus that turned 
a 703 million profit last year 
a young boy timidly addressed the question about mickeys 
stature to disney chairman michael eisner and president frank wells 
at tuesdays annual meeting held in the cavernous anaheim 
convention across from disneyland 
eisner cupped his ear then glanced at wells as the boy repeated 
his question into a microphone 
he says why is mickey mouse so short wells said peering 
across the huge podium at eisner as 9000 shareholders looked on 
eisner shrugged and smiled well hes a mouse 
why dont kids help develop projects wells doesnt miss studio attraction 
in california like 
the one disney has opened to crushing crowds in florida forget it 
but check out hollywoodland coming to you at disneyland in 1996 
the vast majority of disney shares of course are held by 
bigtime private and institutional investors most notably texas 
bass brothers concerned with the bottom line that wells and eisner 
have nurtured so well since they were brought in to run the company 
in 1984 the share price is about eight times higher than then 
after adjusting for stock splits 
but meetinggoers are more likely to worry whether the company 
in its quest to conquer the worlds of entertainment and leisure 
has betrayed the grated youngatheart magic kingdom legacy left 
by affable old uncle walt 
particularly worrisome to many shareholders were fourletter 
words in movies from disneys touchstone studio with miss midler 
who has a multipicture deal with the studio singled out by name 
repeatedly 
there were many other concerns if the upcoming dick tracy 
with warren beatty and madonna would be a bloodfest its less 
violent than youd believe from the trailer eisner said if 
painting crews visible during day hours at theme parks might cost 
disney its razors edge at the parks if disney is ruining 
morale by underpaying workers 
eisner and wells dodged the bombs with aplomb for the most 
part and with a lot of help from megascreen video appearances by 
kermit the frog miss piggy disney bought muppets rights last 
year and naturally mickey himself 
free passes to disneyland didnt hurt of course 
and thank mary poppins no one brought up that nasty pr mess 
about the officer on the queen mary refusing to shave his mustache 
to conform to disneys tightship dictums disney bought the queen 
mary along with the spruce goose and the disneyland hotel from the 
wrather corp 
but eisner and wells will need all the pixie dust they can get 
in the future just wait till word filters down that the head of 
disneys startup record label hollywood records is the attorney 
for hide your ears minnie guns n roses the current 
foulmouthed champions of badboy rock

malcolm forbes the selfproclaimed capitalist 
tool of business publishing who used the world as a stage for his 
lavish parties and ballooning exploits was mourned as one who 
reveled in life and free enterprise 
death happens to everyone but we never believed it would 
happen to him he always defied the odds son malcolm steve 
jr who will succeed his father as head of the publishing empire 
said sunday 
what he wanted inscribed on his tombstone says it all while 
alive he lived 
forbes died of a heart attack while sleeping saturday at his 
40acre estate in far hills nj he was 70 
i feel like a great light has been turned off said 
elizabeth taylor a frequent companion of forbes he was one of 
the best friends i ever had 
i dont know anyone who enjoyed life so much or gave so much 
back said barbara walters who partied with billionaire 
developer donald trump chrysler chairman lee iacocca former 
secretary of state henry kissinger and some 1000 other guests at 
forbes 2 million 70th birthday bash last fall in tangier 
morocco 
various estimates placed the worth of forbes chairman and chief 
shareholder of forbes inc at anywhere from 400 million to 1 
billion 
whatever the amount forbes gleefully relished his riches 
he made the first free flight over beijing in a hotair balloon 
and set six world ballooning records he owned 68 motorcycles and 
made the first motorcycle tour of china he globetrotted with 
movie stars and heads of state aboard his goldfixtured 
helicopterequipped yacht the highlander 
but he also was gracious to everyday folks like libby rook a 
management consultant from vienna va who marked her 44th 
birthday aboard the highlander in 1987 after writing to forbes on a 
dare from coworkers 
its not how much money you have but what you do with it 
forbes once told the starledger in newark the joy of living is 
incredible we work hard at the things we have to do so why not 
take time to enjoy the things we want to do 
forbes was a tireless collector accumulating toy soldiers by 
the battalion and buying up a dozen faberge eggs the handcrafted 
artworks of imperial russia 
he was an enthusiastic champion of free enterprise and 
emblazoned his corporate slogan capitalist tool on his 
helicopters balloons even his clothing and luggage 
he was a real free spirit said opera star beverly sills 
who sang happy birthday at the moroccan party he had such a 
joy of life i think he would have had it if he had been a poor 
man 
malcolm forbes was someone who lived life to its fullest and 
in doing so made all of our lives a little more colorful said 
iacocca 
he was the quintessential american optimistic buoyant and 
lots of fun said kissinger 
forbes was born in englewood nj on aug 19 1919 two years 
after his father scottish emigrant bertie charles forbes founded 
forbes magazine 
he graduated from princeton in 1941 then published two weekly 
newspapers in ohio for a year he enlisted in the army in 1942 was 
wounded in combat and received the bronze star and purple heart 
forbes won a seat on the borough council in bernardsville nj 
in 1949 he served in the state senate from 1951 to 1957 and ran 
for governor of new jersey in 1957 losing to robert b meyner 
after his fathers death in 1954 he became publisher and editor 
in chief of forbes the biweekly magazine which offered a more 
personalized account of business news than its competitors rode 
the 1980s bull market and the probusiness reagan era to the 
greatest success since its founding 
experts valued the companys flagship magazine as high as 600 
million while its american heritage magazine suburban newspaper 
real estate and art holdings almost add 100 million or more 
he was a hell of a competitor and a promotional genius said 
stephen shepard editor in chief of business week magazine 
he was a worthy competitor certainly tough charming very 
very effective said marshall loeb managing editor of fortune 
he was unique and larger than life as a journalist 
entrepreneur and human being said warren h phillips chairman 
and chief executive of dow jones amp co which publishes the wall 
street journal 
malcolm forbes jr will succeed his father as chairman and chief 
executive of forbes inc and editor in chief of forbes magazine

father pop always looked to the future said malcolm jr 
he wanted this to remain a family business and it shall as he 
wished and as the family wishes i will succeed him as chief 
executive we will continue to move ahead as he was doing 
the younger forbes said his fathers body would be cremated and 
the ashes buried at the forbesowned pacific island of lucala in 
fiji in line with his wishes

malcolm forbes had strong opinions on most 
matters of policy and style and the perfect vehicle to flaunt them 
his wit and breezy writing style were displayed in the fact and 
comment section that led each issue of his magazine there forbes 
gave a highly personal account of everything from the key business 
and political issues of the day to pop culture favorite books and 
restaurants 
in the latest issue dated march 5 forbes opined that fiber 
optics and satellite technology were likely to overcome cable 
television urged the establishment of national standards on 
education to help the united states compete with japan and europe 
and applauded president bush for his personal diplomacy with major 
world leaders 
he may sound more cautious than those impressed by dramatic 
hipshooting would like but we are mighty fortunate that in 
situations of international inflammability he knows to whom to 
talk and knows what hes talking about 
forbes also put in a plug for his own personal diplomacy the 
lending of nine of his 12 faberge eggs to a kremlin exhibition 
carried to the heart of communist power aboard his own boeing 727 
emblazoned capitalist tool 
it is the first time in my life that i have really been 
wholeheartedly rooting for the stability and survival of the 
russian government as presently constituted at the least for the 
duration of the exhibit he wrote 
forbes spiced up his column with a sprinkling of witticisms 
which were collected in two volumes the most recent being the 
further sayings of chairman malcolm in 1986 
he had plenty of advice for his magazines target audience the 
nations corporate managers 
he who has the wheel determines the direction 
in management the staid seldom stay long 
if you have no critics you likely have no successes 
attention is to people what fertilizer is to flowers 
he also wrote frequently on wealth suggesting that anyone who 
strived hard could achieve it but that wealth alone didnt give a 
persons true measure 
money seldom changes people it just makes them more visible 
subtract a persons material worth and whats left is his real 
worth 
to be free one must have bread 
alchemy isnt a myth attitude and action can turn anyone and 
anything golden 
but some of his more memorable quips dealt simply with living 
something forbes sought to do in great style 
for enhancing any meal the only thing that beats good wine is 
a better one come to think of it even a poor one is better than 
none at all 
style is one thing fashion usually quite another 
if you dont enjoy the climb giving what it takes to get to 
the top isnt worth it 
criticizing doers is far less fun than doing 
as you get older dont slow down speed up theres less 
time left 
ironically his most recent book they went thataway 
described the extraordinary exits as he put it of 175 famous 
historical figures 
forbes said he wanted to satisfy an oftexpressed curiosity on 
the part of us the living when some wellknown name pops up in 
conversation how many times have we said whatever became of 
himher 
he denied having any morbid fascination with death itself 
though 
since its lifes only certainty and since being against it 
isnt apt to affect the result dwelling on death strikes me as a 
woeful wanton waste of time he wrote 
it seems to me life is for the living

nordstrom inc said today its earnings fell 34 
percent in the fourth quarter due largely to higher merchandise 
markdowns and a 15 million charge for estimated back wage claims 
by employees 
for the threemonth period ended jan 31 nordstroms profits 
fell to 314 million or 39 cents a share from 475 million or 58 
cents a share a year earlier revenues rose 12 percent to 8575 
million from 7651 million 
the upscale department store which recently came under fire for 
allegedly exploiting employees said it has responded to a 
washington state department of labor and industry ruling by 
implementing additional recordkeeping procedures to ensure all 
employee work is properly recorded and compensated 
the state labor agency ruled recently that nordstrom had a 
pattern of making sales clerks work during offhours and not paying 
them for it following a complaint by locals 367 and 1001 of the 
united food and commercial workers union it ordered the company to 
calculate and pay them uncompensated hours retroactive two years 
nordstrom spokesman john goesling said the company has 
established a 15 million reserve for back wage claims 
thats our estimate at the present time of what the back pay 
claims in washington state will be goesling said 
the union had estimated claims in washington could reach between 
30 million and 40 million 
the company also attributed the drop in fourthquarter net 
income to higher merchandise markdowns and shrinkage a 
euphemism for inhouse theft 
for the year nordstrom earned 1149 million or 141 a share 
down 7 percent from 1233 million or 151 a share in the previous 
year sales totaled 27 billion up nearly 15 percent from 23 
billion 
the company also said it has instituted a claims procedure for 
reimbursing back pay the claims forms have been sent to nordstrom 
sales employees in other states but not in washington where the 
forms must be reviewed by the states labor office and the two 
union locals 
the company is attempting to arrange meetings so that those 
forms may be mailed out in washington by the end of the week 
goesling said 
nordstrom also said that it also expects a class action lawsuit 
to be filed on behalf of certain shareholders such a suit if 
filed would allege that the company knew or should have known that 
unpaid work and overtime claims by employees would adversely affect 
the price of nordstrom stock and that the company should have made 
a disclosure to this effect the company said in a statement 
in a meeting last tuesday the board of directors voted to 
increase the quarterly dividend to 75 cents per share payable 
march 15 to shareholders of record march 5

the number of working us oil and gas rigs 
continued its first quarter trend and declined by 21 this week to 
897 baker hughes inc reported 
the yeartodate count however remains 19 percent above last 
years pace according to ike kerridge jr an economist with baker 
hughes this year the count has averaged 960 rigs while last year 
at this time the count averaged 806 he said monday 
kerridge said the rig count generally declines during the first 
quarter and is expected to bottom out in march or april although 
last year it bottomed out in may 
last week the rig count increased for the first time in 1990 
when it jumped by 19 rigs to total 918 a year ago the count was 
757 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures

the governing body of the european 
community monday criticized the united states for keeping it on a 
list of trade partners considered trade offenders in the 
telecommunications sector 
according to a statement by the ec commission the 12nation 
group made substantial progress in tearing down telecom trade 
barriers in 1989 and regretted that it had not been struck off 
the us list of telecommunications trade offenders 
the united states first put the european community on its 
socalled priority list in 1986 after us companies said european 
community governments had unfair procurement policies and 
complained they were locked out of the communitys telecom 
equipment and services markets 
according to ec officials us telecom exports to the european 
community rose to 788 million in 1988 from 569 million in 1987 as 
a result of the marketopening measures during the same period 
the european community exported 370 million worth of equipment to 
the united states up from 243 million 
under its trade laws the united states last week had to either 
impose countermeasures against the european community for its 
telecommunications policy drop its name from the list or extend 
its place on the list for another year 
the commission said the measures taken so far to open its 
telecom market justified being removed from the us list 
officials said the ec market for telecom equipment has been open 
since 1988 and argue that european community governments have 
agreed in principle to open telecom markets for services and in 
public procurement 
a us official who asked not to be identified said he was not 
surprised by the commissions reaction 
but he said that while progress has been made in opening up the 
market for telecommunications equipment advances so far in 
services and public procurement amount to preliminary political 
steps that could not justify removing the european community from 
the priority list of trade offenders

source perrier sa today said it was 
planning to restock its sparkling water on supermarket shelves in 
six to eight weeks following a worldwide recall due to benzene 
contamination 
the company from its headquarters in paris said it was 
implementing a series of stringent new inspection measures 
before production resumes including new monitoring and testing 
procedures and double filtering of the carbon dioxide gas that goes 
into its sparkling water from vergeze in france 
it said a timetable for reintroduction would be established when 
all tests are completed and the new procedures are in effect but 
estimated the familiar green bottles would be back on the shelf 
within two months 
perrier recalled 160 million bottles worldwide after benzene was 
found in some bottles overseas the company first recalled 72 
million bottles in north america attributing the problem to an 
employee who inadvertently contaminated a bottling machine by 
cleaning it with benzene 
the company later expanded the recall worldwide and acknowledged 
that benzene is found naturally in the carbon dioxide gas the gas 
is extracted separately from the spring water before the two are 
combined in the perrier plant for bottling 
perrier said the contamination occurred because workers failed 
to replace filters designed to remove the benzene from the carbon 
dioxide 
in a statement from paris where source perrier is located the 
company cited experts as saying the water source was pure and no 
ones health was ever at risk because of the benzene 
it said a small amount of minor elements is found in all 
naturally occurring gases and said all companies that use carbon 
dioxide in carbonated beverages filter the gas to remove small 
levels of such compounds 
all international medical experts and regulatory officials 
consulted on the matter confirm that the health of perrier 
consumers was never in danger the company said 
however source perrier said it was instituting new measures to 
assure the purity of its product it said the gas system would be 
checked twice a day both before and after the filtering stage the 
gas will be filtered twice and the company will conduct specific 
tests for hydrocarbonate compounds it also said backup 
verification would be conducted by an outside laboratory and a team 
of international experts 
perrier said its recall is 90 percent complete the 72 million 
bottles in north america will be destroyed and recycled in 
facilities approved by the us environmental protection agency 
several suits have been filed against perrier and its us 
affiliate perrier group of america inc of greenwich conn 
charging that customers have been damaged by the benzene 
contamination the suits filed in connecticut and pennsylvania 
seek class actions against the companies

vero beach fla cp financially troubled piper aircraft corp 
shut down its plant here for two weeks today and laid off more than 
threefourths of its workers a company spokesman said 
joe ponte director of marketing said the layoffs are the 
result of a severe cash crunch and that the company did not plan to 
seek protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy law 
its not chapter 11 just layoffs and a shutdown said ponte 
about 580 workers will be on an extended layoff he said the 
rest of the nearly 1100 employees will return to work march 12 
after the shutdown he said 
we have a tremendous backlog in aircraft on order ponte 
said in an interview 
about 300 people remain on the job to help deal with backlogs in 
aircraft deliveries he said 
piper which manufactures aircraft for general aviation was 
purchased by california investor m stuart millar from forstmann 
little and co in 1987 no purchase price was disclosed 
ponte said the company will go to a fourday work week after the 
shutdown to help the company get back on its feet 
he said the problems resulted from a rapid expansion of the 
company after stuart millar bought the company in 1987 
we tried to minimize debt and tried to fund rapid growth with 
cash flow and we really underestimated how much it would require 
ponte said 
ponte said piper had to take drastic action to deal with the 
problem he said people ordering aircraft and parts might 
experience delays but they will receive their products 
piper has had trouble competing with the giant cessna aircraft 
co which is controlled by general dynamics corp a us defense 
contractor 
cessna surpassed piper in 1967 to become the worlds leading 
aircraft manufacturer in total units sold

the tokyo stock exchanges main index suffered its 
second largest oneday fall today and exchange officials 
reportedly sought to restrict a form of computerguided trading 
seen as a major factor in recent declines 
the dollar closed sharply higher 
the 225share nikkei stock average plunged 156910 points or 
45 percent closing at 3332187 its lowest level since 3330971 
last july 5 
todays plunge was second only to the 383648 on oct 20 1987 
that fall of 149 percent however still was well below the 
previous days 226 percent on wall street on the black monday 
that triggered a global crash 
volume was a light 400 million shares on the first section 
analysts said stock bond and yen prices were driving each other 
down in a vicious cycle 
meanwhile stock prices rose new york with the dow jones average 
of 30 industrials up 2455 points to 258874 at 130 pm est 
share prices finished higher in london the financial timesstock 
exchange 100share index gained 126 points to close at 22493 
in an effort to stop the fall in stock prices the tokyo stock 
exchange asked that securities firms limit their index arbitrage 
selling to the beginning of the morning and afternoon sessions 
until march 8 kyodo news service reported without elaborating 
in arbitrage trading which also was cited as a cause for wall 
streets black monday crash investors profit from differences 
in prices for the same security in different markets for instance 
the spot and future markets computers spot the price gaps and 
guide the trading 
but arbitrageurs seen by many analysts as the key factor in the 
nikkeis 2570point loss for all of last week were not very 
active today as futures prices fell the maximum amount allowed 
during the morning session 
on the foreign exchange market the dollar rose 218 yen 
closing at 14865 yen it opened at 14750 yen and ranged between 
14742 yen and 14905 yen the dollar now has gained 413 yen in

slightly from its 698 percent opening 
at one point today the nikkei average fell to 3247746 points 
241351 beneath its friday close 
masahiro umemori an analyst for nomura securities said that 
about an hour before the markets close some investors began to 
feel stock prices were reasonable again the index climbed 84441 
points in the last hour 
because of overall light trading the few buy orders had a large 
impact on the index umemori added 
robert alan feldman an economist for salomon brothers asia 
ltd said such lastminute turnarounds were common on the tokyo 
market and did not signify that the markets fall had been stopped 
johsen takahashi director of mitsubishi research institute 
inc said the tokyo markets problem was cheap yen cheap stocks 
and cheap bonds the decline of each one has accelerated the 
decline of the other two 
in a vicious cycle analysts said the weakening of the bond 
market had reduced demand for the yen whose cheap value reduced 
the attractiveness of buying stocks 
takahashi said japan might be able to stem the stock markets 
decline by lowering interest rates but such action was unlikely 
because it might accelerate the countrys already overheating 
economy 
a rapidly expanding money supply as well as a tightening labor 
market have led to growing inflation in the country in the last few 
months 
japans domestic boom has been too good he said and this 
has led to an overevaluation of the yen as well as stock prices 
the bank of japan sold an estimated 16 billion in efforts to 
support the yen 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno said today he was concerned 
about recent changes in the stock bond and foreign exchange 
markets but saw no immediate need for changes in monetary policy 
we dont change monetary policy only because stock prices 
moved rapidly or the yen moved rapidly we base a change in 
monetary policy on an overall consideration of economic conditions 
prices currency rates money supply and others he said

waldenbooks is launching a new program that 
combines incentives to attract customers with a hightech purchase 
tracking system for use in individualized marketing to readers 
waldenbooks chief executive said monday 
the preferred reader program being rolled out friday is the 
latest step in waldenbooks campaign to promote itself as a 
serviceoriented retailer and distinguish itself from such 
competitors as b dalton or brentanos 
harry hoffman president and chief executive officer of the 
nations largest bookstore chain said waldenbooks will be the 
first in its field to use such a technologically sophisticated 
approach to monitor what customers buy 
we think this kind of program will build a loyal customer 
base increase our share of the market and provide people who like 
books with outstanding information and keep them more aware of 
whats happening in the book business on a monthly basis he said 
in an interview 
i think the ability to reach people who we know are interested 
in what we have is going to be a tremendous opportunity to get a 
better return from advertising than we had in the past he said 
a customer can sign up for the program in a store or by calling 
a tollfree number 
for a 10 annual membership fee preferred readers receive 10 
percent off every purchase and get back 5 for every 100 spent 
the membership fee will be cut in half to 5 during the march 
kickoff checks will automatically be accepted when shoppers show 
their preferred reader cards to cashiers 
each card will carry an individualized bar code allowing 
waldenbooks to record via computer what a customer buys the 
information will be used by waldenbooks which is based in 
stamford conn and owned by k mart corp to target specific 
tastes when sending news or special discounts by mail 
hoffman said every program member will receive a monthly 
brochure containing general information about books authors and 
similar topics 
inserts occasionally will be included science fiction fans will 
get advance notice of a pending title while mystery readers will 
receive coupons for discounts off future purchases of books in that 
genre for example 
the program being implemented at all 1250 waldenbooks stores 
eventually will replace the genre specific clubs the company has 
had for years said ron jaffe senior director of marketing new 
members no longer will be enrolled in the current clubs which 
cater to people with particular reading interests 
jaffe said in an interview that the existing clubs members of 
which will be offered free oneyear memberships in the preferred 
reader program have about 3 million people as active participants 
jaffe said the program is part of a 15 million campaign in 
waldenbooks repositioning we really hope that by doing this we 
become the bookstore of choice when someone is out buying books 
he said 
besides upgrading its use of database marketing jaffe said the 
chain over the past year or so has undertaken other changes store 
displays and category presentations have been redesigned to be more 
reader friendly and individual stores have greater flexibility 
to stock books that satisfy local market preferences 
among other benefits of the new preferred reader program 
members will be able to order books by telephone selecting from 
100000 titles available at the companys nashville tenn 
distribution warehouse operators will be able to search by 
computer for hardtofind books 
nonmembers also will be allowed to call the 800number but they 
wont be eligible for the discounted prices 
hoffman said waldenbooks will redirect a significant portion of 
its 10 million to 12 million annual advertising budget to support 
the program cutting back outlays on some conventional methods 
such as catalogs in magazines 
target marketing has advantages over the shotgun approach of 
running ads in newspapers said hoffman noting i think most 
retailers in the 90s are going to have to look at this type of 
program

the us dollar rose monday against other major 
foreign currencies in europe fueled by the tokyo stock markets 
steepest oneday decline since the october 1987 global crash 
gold prices were lower 
the dollar benefited from nervousness over the declines in tokyo 
stock prices last week and expectations that further weakness is 
likely said reijer groenveld a dealer with bank of america in 
london 
dealers said the drop on the tokyo stock market fortified 
perceptions that the bank of japan wont move quickly to raise 
interest rates even though officials say they are increasingly 
worried about the yens weakness 
the bank of japan repeatedly sold dollars for yen to boost the 
japanese currency dealers said but the largescale intervention 
was viewed as reinforcing speculation that the underlying trend in 
the yen is downward groenveld and other dealers said 
in tokyo the dollar rose to a closing 14865 japanese yen from 
14647 yen at fridays close later in london it rose to 14880 
yen 
in london the british pound fell to 16927 from 17090 late

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower monday on the chicago board of trade as old crop wheat prices 
posted gains while new crop futures fell 
march wheat futures prices rose on scattered commission house 
buying in anticipation that deliveries will be small because of low 
stocks analysts said 
the offer to the soviet union on friday by the us agriculture 
department of 1 million metric tons of wheat under the export bonus 
program had little influence on the market because it had been 
widely rumored last week analysts said 
the market now is waiting for an actual tender by the soviet 
union for direction 
pat oconnell an analyst for refco inc said the corn 
deliveries also are expected to small but the expectation of rain 
in western crop areas weighed on the market 
soybean prices were lower monday kept on the defensive by a 
rash of commission house and professional selling rain in south 
american crop areas also weighed on the soybean market 
at the close wheat was 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 396 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to a cent higher with march at 246 a bushel oats 
were cent to 1 cents lower with march at 136 a bushel

fashion retailer nordstrom inc said monday its 
fourth quarter earnings dropped 34 percent from a year earlier 
because of higher merchandise markdowns and a 15 million provision 
for estimated back pay claims 
separately the nordstrom workers union leader called the back 
wage provision inadequate and said the union planned to file a 
classaction lawsuit against the clothing store chain 
nordstrom acknowledged the threat of that suit and said it 
believed it also may face a classaction shareholder suit 
for the threemonth period ended jan 31 nordstroms profits 
fell to 314 million or 39 cents a share from 475 million or 58 
cents a share a year earlier revenue rose 12 percent to 8575 
million in the quarter from 7651 million 
in addition to the charge for back wage payments nordstrom 
attributed the drop in fourthquarter net income to higher 
merchandise markdowns industry analysts have said the company had 
to respond to aggressive pricecutting by its competitors during 
the christmas season 
for the year nordstroms profit fell 7 percent to 1149 
million or 141 a share from 1233 million or 151 a share 
in the previous year sales totaled 27 billion up nearly 15 
percent from 23 billion in the previous year 
nordstrom which has built a reputation for good customer 
service has been accused of allegedly pressuring employees to 
sometimes perform work without compensation 
following a labor union complaint the washington state 
department of labor and industry ruled earlier this month that 
nordstrom had a pattern of making sales clerks work during 
offhours without compensation and ordered the company to pay them 
for two years worth of uncompensated hours 
nordstrom said monday it had responded to the ruling by adopting 
additional recordkeeping procedures to ensure employee work 
properly was recorded and paid it also said it had instituted a 
claims procedure for reimbursing back pay 
the 15 million reserve for back wage claims represented the 
companys present estimate of claims for washington state said 
spokesman john goesling 
joe peterson president of united food amp commercial workers 
union local 1001 said the back wage fund is wholly inadequate 
it wont even cover claims of employees in washington state let 
alone claims in alaska utah oregon california and virginia 
nordstrom has 60 stores in washington oregon california 
alaska virginia and utah it plans 16 more including moving into 
illinois new jersey maryland minnesota indiana connecticut 
massachusetts and new york 
peterson said the union estimates nordstrom could be liable for 
up to 40 million in claims in washington and for more than 200 
million in back pay and penalties in california the union has not 
yet studied possible claims in the other states he said 
peterson also said the claims procedure was an attempt by the 
company to bargain directly with workers instead of the union over 
claims 
last week the national labor relations board complained that 
nordstrom had been improperly bargaining directly with employees 
over back wages rather than going through the union 
peterson said the ufcw could file its lawsuit this week unless 
the company showed a willingness to negotiate a settlement with the 
union 
nordstrom said it expects a classaction lawsuit to be filed on 
behalf of certain shareholders such a suit if filed would allege 
the company should have disclosed that unpaid work and overtime 
claims by employees adversely would affect the price of nordstrom

pfizer inc shareholders filed a lawsuit monday 
accusing company executives of withholding information about the 
financial impact of defects in a mechanical heart valve made by its 
shiley inc unit 
pfizer stock has been battered in recent days because of 
potential liabilities from defects in a heart valve product that 
was removed from the market after reports of malfunctions that 
killed patients 
the classaction lawsuit filed in us district court in 
manhattan was brought on behalf of shareholders who purchased 
pfizer stock between march 27 1988 and last thursday when a 
house subcommittee announced it would hold hearings on the heart 
valve 
the shareholders said the price of pfizer stock tumbled after 
the announcement of the hearing by the house energy and commerce 
investigations subcommittee which began monday 
they also claimed that pfizer without telling shareholders had 
settled numerous cases involving shiley heart valves out of court 
many for 1 million or more 
none of the information publicly disseminated by pfizer during 
the class period gave any indication of the true nature or extent 
of the problems experienced by the company with its shiley heart 
valve said the lawsuit 
the lawsuit names pfizer chief executive edmund t pratt jr and 
six other executives the shareholders are seeking unspecified 
damages for alleged losses 
there is no merit to the suit and we will vigorously defend 
it pfizer spokesman rick honey said pfizer is headquartered in 
manhattan and incorporated in delaware 
pfizer stock which has dropped about 14 in recent weeks in 
apparent anticipation of the congressional hearings lost another 
25 cents monday closing at 56 on the new york stock exchange 
the socalled 60degree shiley valve has been implanted in 
85000 people including about 40000 in the united states the fda 
approved the valve for us marketing in april 1979 but after 
reports of malfunctions and product withdrawals shiley removed it 
from the market in november 1986 
the valve consists of a disc inside a metal ring covered by a 
teflon sewing ring that is sutured to the heart to hold the valve 
in place the disc pivoting on two thin metal struts opens to 
either a 60degree or 70degree angle to allow blood to flow 
through and then closes 
about 4000 of shileys 70degree valves have been implanted in 
patients overseas that device was never marketed in the united 
states 
shiley has reported to the food and drug administration a total 
of 295 fractures of the 60degree valve with 178 deaths resulting 
and 94 fractures and 70 deaths involving the 70degree valve 
according to a report by the house subcommittee 
at the hearing monday rep john dingell dmich chairman of 
the investigations subcommittee said there has been no assurance 
that the fda procedures that allowed the heart valve to stay on 
the market so long have been corrected 
the democratci majority on the panel issued a report stating 
that shiley exploited the fdas honor system by failing to notify 
the agency of product changes and reports of malfunctions

june rothman said but there is little they can do about it 
short of raising interest rates

wall street shrugged off the latest bad news from japan and the 
us stock market closed higher monday despite the tokyo markets 
secondworst drop ever 
markets in london and frankfurt also showed strength following 
the latest plunge in tokyo where stock prices have been on a 
sustained decline from record highs reached in late 1989 
on monday the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 
3829 points to 260248 broader market indicators also rose with 
advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 to 7 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks 
earlier the key index on the tokyo stock exchange the 
225share nikkei stock average finished down 156910 points at 
3332187 
that loss was second only to the 383648point drop on oct 20 
1987 after wall streets black monday and gave the index a total 
loss of more than 14 percent since the year began 
but analysts said higher bond prices and the strength of the 
dollar in foreign exchange contributed to the resiliency of the 
us market they also said mondays rise shows the link between 
wall street and tokyo isnt as strong as once thought 
i think this is a continuation of what we saw last week 
said gordon l smith a managing director at alex brown amp sons 
inc a baltimore brokerage it looks like weve decoupled the 
markets at least temporarily 
two sharp drops in the tokyo market last week caused nervousness 
on wall street but no severe selloffs 
prices on other overseas markets generally closed lower monday 
in the wake of tokyos selloff however european markets recovered 
some of the losses suffered in early trading and britains market 
ended higher 
in london the financial timesstock exchange 100share index 
rose 126 points to close at 22493 dealers said the market was 
boosted by the strong showing on wall street 
share prices on the frankfurt stock exchange closed lower but 
well above their lows for the day when the market rebounded after 
an opening plunge earlier in hong kong share prices closed lower 
in thin trading 
ac moore research director for argus research in new york 
said the us markets were boosted by increased buying in 
stockindex futures related to the strong bond market 
the benchmark 30year treasury bond rose about 594 per 1000 
in face amount while its yield fell to 848 percent from 855 
percent late friday 
rising bond prices tend to induce buying in stock index 
futures and when stock index futures go up that makes underlying 
quality stock go up said moore 
moore said wall streets rally was surprising but said it may 
not last he said the us markets remain troubled by low corporate 
profits and high interest rates 
jack conlon jr a managing director at rothschild inc said 
wall streets performance monday demonstrates that the factors 
that are weighing the japanese market are applicable to the 
japanese market in itself 
among those he said are fear of higher japanese interest rates 
due to rising inflation and concern over domestic political 
uncertainties 
he also said japanese investors have been less of a factor in 
the us stock markets in recent years some observers had feared 
that with the tokyo market falling japanese investors would pull 
out of the us markets due to a cash crunch 
in japan top financial officials said monday there was nothing 
wrong with the nations economic fundamentals despite the market 
plunge 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno said he was watching the 
market developments with a sense of apprehension but at the 
same time with composure because japans strong corporate sales 
and earnings have not softened 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto told reporters that the 
plunge in stock prices and the depreciation of the yen against the 
dollar was due to speculation not worsening economic conditions 
the dollar finished up 218 yen at 14865 yen monday in tokyo 
its highest level in eight months 
low trading volume on the tokyo stock exchange and computerized 
index arbitrage trading which can involve rapid trading of huge 
amounts of shares have been blamed in part for the markets recent 
volatility 
kyodo news service said the exchange asked securities firms to 
limit their index arbitrage selling to the start of the morning and 
afternoon trading sessions until march 8 
traders involved in index arbitrage attempt to profit from brief 
discrepancies between the prices of stockindex futures and the 
prices of the stocks they actually represent

in tokyo as after the tokyo stock exchange dropped sharply the 
selloff in tokyo was the exchanges steepest oneday decline since 
the october 1987 global crash 
a lot of gold assets were being liquidated to meet margin 
calls said richard levine an analyst with elders futures inc in 
new york the selloff was particularly pronounced in platinum 
because that is a traditional precious metal for the japanese 
silver prices did not fall as sharply but approached low levels 
levine said 
the dollars strength made the precious metals less attractive 
to investors analysts said the dollar benefited from nervousness 
over the declines in tokyo stock prices last week and expectations 
that further weakness was likely

the offer to the soviet union on friday by the us department

bonus program had little influence on the market because it had 
been widely rumored analysts said 
the market now is waiting for an actual tender by the soviet 
union for direction

rash of commission house and professional selling rain in south

factors and said the severe cold in the northeast helped give 
heating oil a boost

the bush administration should examine why 
government officials stood by as nations savings and loans lost 
billions of dollars a group of freemarket analysts said monday 
sampl legislation passed last august requires the treasury 
department to study the deposit insurance system to determine 
whether it encouraged sampl executives to take unwise risks 
the report due a year from now is expected to form the basis 
of the next attempt by congress to reform the financial system 
but an outline of the study fails to recognize the critical role 
in the sampl collapse played by elected and appointed officials said 
the shadow financial regulatory committee a panel of 12 experts 
from universities banks and law firms 
officials allowed sampls to paper over their weaknesses with 
accounting gimmicks and postponed closing sampls when they failed 
worsening the problem and defering it to someone elses watch the 
group said in an informal position paper 
the current system confronts authorities with a painful 
tradeoff between protecting general taxpayers economic interests 
and incurring the displeasure of politically strong regulatory 
clients and their various political allies the committee said 
to counter the problem committee members recommended that 
members of congress be required to report all efforts to win favors 
for constituent firms that estimated sampl and bank losses be put 
into regulatory agencies budgets in the year they occur and that 
most most of the agencies discretion in enforcing regulations be 
removed 
on another matter they criticized the federal reserve board for 
lending more than 1 billion at below market rates to ailing 
commercial banks in new england 
such lending from the feds discount window can serve to keep 
institutions afloat that should otherwise be closed allowing 
uninsured depositors to withdraw their money the committee said

10 percent of its foce and shut down its plant for two weeks 
in addition 550 employees at the facility will be placed on a 
fourday 32hour work week when the plant reopens march 12 no 
return date is known for the other 125 workers affected by the 
shutdown 
joe ponte director of marketing said the layoffs are the 
result of a severe cash crunch and rapid expansion the past several 
years but he said the company does not plan to seek protection 
from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law 
piper which laid off 450 workers last month will keep about 
425 employees on the job during the shutdown to help deal with 
backlogs in aircraft deliveries he said 
piper which manufactures aircraft for general aviation was 
purchased by california investor m stuart millar in 1987 
piper president and chief executive officer ray johnson said 
there have been discusions by piper parent romeo charlie inc to 
open an assembly plant at vacant piper facilities in lock haven pa

the supreme court agreed monday to use an 
oklahoma dispute over mortgage insurance to settle the question of 
when a court judgment is final a recurring procedural issue in the 
federal courts 
the justices said they will consider reinstating a suit by 
firstier mortgage co against investors mortgage insurance co 
involving eight mortgage loans on buildings in elk city okla 
firstier accused investors of bad faith in failing to pay off 
insurance claims 
us district judge luther bohanon sitting in oklahoma city 
threw out the suit announcing from the bench on jan 26 1989 that 
the insurance policies were void because of fraud 
firstier then asked the 10th us circuit court of appeals to 
overrule the judge and revive the suit 
the appeals court said last september that the judges oral 
announcement was not a final decision and therefore the appeals 
court did not have authority over the case 
in appealing to the supreme court firstier said the judges 
ruling from the bench disposed of all claims in the case and should 
be considered a final decision 
all that remained was for the judge to put the details in 
writing and the lack of a written opinion should not make the 
appeal premature firstier argued 
the company said the 10th circuit court ruling is in conflict 
with rulings by other federal appeals courts 
the case is firstier mortgage vs investors mortgage insurance

a former congressional official who had been 
the bush administrations leading candidate to be chief regulator 
of the nations savings and loans said monday he has withdrawn his 
name from consideration 
frederick d wolf formerly the no 2 official at the general 
accounting office said he informed the treasury department last 
week he is no longer interested in being appointed director of the 
departments office of thrift supervision 
wolf a partner with the price waterhouse amp co accounting firm 
said in a telephone interview that treasury officials in late 
december asked him to apply for the job 
subsequently administration congressional and industry sources 
said wolf was the most likely candidate to succeed m danny wall 
who announced his resignation on dec 4 but continues to serve 
wolf said he was disturbed that two months after being asked to 
consider the job treasury officials still had not recommended his 
name to the white house 
he said he could only conclude that either the administration 
did not believe it was important to fill the job soon or did not 
favor his appointment 
in the meantime wolf said he was forced to suspend work for 
several of his firms clients in order to avoid a potential 
conflict of interest 
the inability of the administration to decide on walls 
replacement nearly three months after he quit was taken by 
analysts as another sign of disarray in the management of the 
savings and loan bailout 
last month daniel kearney alluding to differences with the 
treasury resigned as the chief staff officer of the resolution 
trust corp oversight board the board sets the policy and controls 
the pursestrings of the bailout 
i think this withdrawal is another black eye coming on top of 
kearneys resignation said bert ely a financial institutions 
analyst in alexandria va it is bumbling 
the failure to fill the post also could bolster the arguments of 
members of congress including house banking committee members 
reps charles schumer dny and jim leach riowa who want to 
abolish the thrift office and divide its duties among commercial 
bank regulatory agencies 
wall who had been under fire from congress for his handling of 
the collapse of lincoln savings and loan association irvine 
calif said he would like to leave the post soon 
i have indicated that is my wish but theres no date been set 
at this point he said in a telephone interview i havent put 
any deadlines down 
wall said treasury is exploring the appointment of jonathan 
fiechter currently the offices senior deputy director as acting 
director 
however in a letter to president bush the us league of 
savings institutions warns that the appointment could leave the 
institution rudderless 
it said its reading of last summers sampl legislation does not 
leave its lawyers confident that an acting director without senate 
confirmation could legally close failed sampls issue rules or 
exercise the other powers of the directors office 
art siddon a spokesman for the treasury department had no 
comment on the trade groups contention

they were in january according to a survey released monday

group said its consumer confidence index for february is 1054 
down 1 point from january 
nearly 25 percent of the respondents said current business 
conditions are good up from 23 percent in january in looking 
ahead to the next six months however more consumers than 
previously said they fear the general business climate will worsen 
respondents also are increasingly apprehensive about job 
prospects the conference board said 
the number of people who expect their incomes to rise in the 
near future was down three percentage points at 256 percent the 
survey of 5000 us households showed 
although the overall measure of consumer confidence did not

k mart corp said monday it would take a 
charge of 640 million against 1989 earnings to cover the costs of 
a 23billion program to modernize the nations secondlargest 
retail chain 
the discount retailer said it plans to close 30 of its 2194 
stores modernize or expand other stores and open new about 250 new 
k marts during the fiveyear program spokesman orren knauer said 
the company in november reported a 175percent drop in third 
quarter profits to 1041 million it blamed the decline from the 
yearearlier quarter on price cuts made to improve the companys 
market share 
knauer declined to estimate k marts 1989 earnings but analysts 
with seidleramdec securities inc of los angeles calif 
predicted k mart profits would be about 730 million before the 
charge in 1988 k mart earned 803 million 
k mart is taking a far more aggressive approach to modernize 
their stores than they were planning before said tom tashjian 
associate director of seidleramdec the walmart and target 
chains are clearly better at merchandise presentation than k mart 
at this time 
k mart is going to get it done quickly to keep a solid market 
share and keep themselves in a competitive position tashjian 
said 
but knauer said k marts decision which affects all but three 
of its us stores wasnt a reaction to competition 
we made the decision because of internal factors knauer 
said citing an 18month pilot project during which several stores 
were renovated or moved 
it was based on christmas sales and the success of stores 
where weve already made changes 
in the enlarged relocated and prototyped stores customer 
acceptance of the layouts fixturing and new merchandise 
assortments has been very good and sales results have exceeded 
expectations he said 
the program also includes moving about 280 stores knauer said 
the population base may have shifted if so well find 
property closer to the existing population base he said 
k mart chairman joseph antonini said in a statement that the 
store enlargements and relocations should be completed by 1993 and 
other refurbishments will be done by 1994 
tashjian said k marts profitability began lagging behind 
walmart and target because the latter companies expanded more 
recently 
all the companies are about 25 years old but k marts 
expansion was early on in that period tashjian said the 
others have expanded during the latter part of the 25 years so they 
have younger betterlooking stores target is much more fun to 
shop in 
k mart has 4171 outlets in the us puerto rico and canada 
including 2288 k mart stores 1258 waldenbooks 141 builders 
square and 282 pay less drug stores the troybased company also 
purchased pace membership warehouse inc for 322 million late last 
year 
the three stores that wont be affected by the program are newly 
built outlets in oak park mich and virginia beach va and a 
refurbished store in rochester mich

the united states and other leading countries 
have failed to agree on providing billions of dollars to the 
international monetary fund for lending to the third world and 
eastern europe 
the fund said monday it has put off a decision on new funding 
until the end of june in yet another setback for the agency 
the deadline had been set for march 31 after repeated 
postponements that date would have represented a twoyear delay 
over the normal timetable for reviewing fund resources decisions 
normally are taken every five years 
poland has recently won a 730 million loan from the fund and 
approval is reported to be near on a 213 million loan for hungary 
though small in comparison with the borrowing needs of eastern 
europe these loans are important in opening the way to lending by 
others governments and commercial banks take confidence from the 
strict economic measures that the fund requires countries to put in 
place before it lends money 
resources of the fund amount to the equivalent of 117 billion 
but much of that is in currencies of third world countries and is 
not in demand by borrowers 
managing director michel camdessus has asked that the total be 
doubled although he had widespread support among the 152 member 
governments the united states britain and saudi arabia demurred 
the united states has been reported ready for a 50 percent 
increase that would require it to put up nearly 12 billion as the 
largest source of the funds money the outlays would not count in 
the us budget because the money is considered still the property 
of the united states which receives interest on dollars that the 
fund lends out 
the united states itself could borrow other countries currency 
as it has in the past 
japan raised a problem when it asked to be the number two 
contributor instead of number five officials said this issue had 
been virtually settled with west germany as number three though 
the relative positions of britain and france are not yet clear 
the officials who spoke on condition they not be named said 
the us treasury is concerned about overdue payments to the fund 
from 11 third world countries which have reached nearly 48 
billion the fund has set up special arrangements for loans to the 
poorest countries on easier terms but those which have not brought 
their accounts up to date are not eligible to not take advantage of 
the offer 
treasury undersecretary david c mulford has been asked to 
testify thursday on the fund before a panel of congressmen the 
subcommittee on international development finance trade and 
monetary policy of the banking committee in the house of 
representatives
