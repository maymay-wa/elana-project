a man who returned more than 50000 after 
it fell from an armored car onto a busy highway said friday his 
good deed has paid dividends 
a lot of good tings have happened to me in the past couple 
years but im the same person i always was said melvin 
kiser i think people like to look at the positive and expand on 
that but im just average 
kiser was among honorees at a luncheon to mark the end of a 
14month campaign by the citys commission on ethics and values to 
make honesty a citywide policy 
kiser gained national attention after he returned money that 
spilled on interstate 71 near downtown columbus in october 1987 he 
even portrayed himself in a television advertisement for miller 
beer 
he said he returned the money out of his admiration for a famous 
good guy movie star john wayne 
i was always a fan of john wayne and still am said kiser 
an ohio bell employee 
kisers honesty was rewarded with more than fame the armored 
car company gave him more than 5000 and then theres pay for the 
miller ad 
miller spokeswoman beverly jurkowski said kiser didnt ask to be 
paid but had to be given a standard union rate for actors she 
said he made between 5000 and 10000 but was unable to give the 
exact amount 
he was a superb example of the miller high life campaign 
saluting people who do the right thing or make a decision in a 
difficult situation ms jurkowski said of kiser 
in the commercial kiser is seen shooting pool in a bar with 
friends while telling them about the armored car incident a man 
walks past him and a 20 bill falls to kisers feet kiser picks 
up the bill and asks why me 
the citys commission on ethics and values was formed after the 
rear door of metropolitan armored car inc truck swung open 
dumping an estimated 1 million on a downtown freeway police 
estimate some 200 people converged on the highway scooping up 
cash while the truck continued north 
several people returned money they found but police said 
kisers return of more than 50000 represented the largest single 
amount police refused to say exactly how much money was lost or 
returned 
the citys take an honest look campaign was headed by jeb 
stuart magruder the former watergate conspirator who is now a 
presbyterian minister in suburban marble cliff 
atlanta mayor andrew young a candidate for governor of georgia 
was the featured speaker at fridays luncheon 
at a news conference young said the honesty campaign was 
reaffirming and reminding us of those values that have really 
made this a great nation 
also honored at the luncheon were sandy pittman of columbus a 
bank employee who turned in a bag of unused state lottery tickets 
last july and six local students whose essays on honesty were 
judged best in a citywide competition

the government says it is ready to consider 
banning a dangerous breed of dog called bandog a cross 
between a pit bull terrier and a bigger breed such as a rottweiler 
the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
described the 130pound dogs as darwinian nightmares capable of 
killing any human being in a onetoone fight 
asked about a possible ban home secretary david waddington said 
friday im prepared to look at anything i think its a very 
very serious situation 
he said britain strengthened legislation governing dangerous 
breeds last summer so courts now can order dangerous animals 
destroyed 
but certainly one has got to look to see if the law is tough 
enough to give sufficient protection to the public against people 
who take around streets of the land these terribly fierce dogs 
he said 
he said there was a problem in naming certain breeds of dog in 
legislation because other breeds could then be developed

economic reforms and are debating political changes as well

five police intelligence officers were 
released early saturday after kashmiri moslem separatists pulled 
them from a jeep at gunpoint the day before a state governor said 
on friday a cabinet minister acknowledging the moslem 
rebellion had reached an unprecedented point said the 
government was opening negotiations with the separatists 
the governor said the five men were released unharmed after 
government loudspeakers blared allnight warnings that strong 
action would be taken if the kidnapped officers were not freed 
our approach of firmness in dealing with the terrorists 
worked said gov jagmohan of jammukashmir state he said the 
five men members of the jammukashmir state police intelligence 
branch reappeared before sunrise in the same area they were 
abducted friday night 
no claims of responsibility or demands were made on behalf of 
the abductors 
the five men had been in a jeep patrolling a congested 
residential area in the heart of srinagar core of the movement 
demanding mostly moslem kashmirs independence from predominantly 
hindu india 
a curfew was in effect but a crowd surrounded the intelligence 
officers jeep jagmohan said he said three young men took the 
officers from the jeep at gunpoint and set fire to the vehicle 
jagmohan had said friday that only four agents were missing the 
agency united news of india had said the missing agents working in 
security units for senior government officials 
earlier friday railway minister george fernandes told reporters 
the government was opening talks with the separatists 
it is too early to say what shape the dialogue will take but 
at least the process has begun he said 
fernandes selected by the government of prime minister vp 
singh to initiate the talks said he was meeting the right 
people through intermediaries but he said we have a tough 
job here 
islamic militants have been fighting for secession of 
jammukashmir state from india for the last four decades the 
latest round of violence began jan 20 after a government crackdown 
on the militants at least 173 people have been killed and hundreds 
injured since then 
a highlevel political delegation comprising leaders of all 
major parties visited srinagar on thursday to assess the 
situation the team returned to new delhi on friday but fernandes 
who was part of the delegation stayed back apparently to initiate 
the dialogue 
srinagar is summer capital of jammukashmir state 
the mood of the people is very obvious the campaign for 
secession has reached an unprecedented point he said friday 
it was not known who the government would negotiate with the 
militants said earlier they will not negotiate their demand for 
independence 
in neighboring pakistanheld kashmir about 500 demonstrators 
demanded selfdetermination for their brethren in india during a 
protest march friday to a pakistani military checkpoint along the

a presidential commission is trying to find 
out how many people changed travel plans when the us embassy in 
moscow disseminated a terrorism warning before the 1988 bombing of 
pan american flight 103 
two embassy witnesses testified under oath friday that a notice 
from the federal aviation administration of bomb threats against 
pan am flights en route to the united states was posted in several 
places around the diplomatic compound and outside and also was sent 
to soviet officials 
the state department previously acknowledged only that the 
notice was improperly posted in the embassy a week before flight 
103 blew up over lockerbie scotland killing 270 people on dec 
21 1988 
officials said the posting violated a policy against notifying 
government personnel when others are not told of a threat 
the embassy notice said employees were left to their own 
discretion on whether to change travel plans but it noted they 
still were required to fly on an american airline pan am was the 
only us carrier serving moscow although other airlines could be 
used from europe to the united states 
raymond f smith who was acting deputy chief of mission in 
moscow at the time told the presidential commission on aviation 
security and terrorism that he felt a moral obligation to let 
people know about the threat against pan am flights between 
frankfurt west germany and the united states 
i said to myself would i want my own family to take the 
information into account and the answer was yes smith said 
justifying the decision to inform all embassy personnel and other 
people who might fly of the threat 
smith said he knew of no other embassy that disseminated the 
notice publicly state department officials have said the threat 
turned out to be a hoax originating in helsinki finland 
embassy officials decided in a toplevel staff meeting to give 
the notice the widest distribution possible smith and embassy 
security officer mark a sanna testified 
at fridays hearing the commission disclosed a telex message 
from pan ams moscow office saying that 80 percent of the airlines 
moscow passengers were changing their bookings as a result of the 
posted threat 
but jennifer s young the airlines former moscow manager who 
sent the telex testified that she had no direct knowledge of any 
cancellations and used the 80 percent figure to give her telex some 
impact because she needed advice on what to tell travelers 
ms young said a parttime reservations clerk at pan ams office 
in the us embassy had told her there were several inquiries about 
the notice and she got the impression there also were cancellations 
commission chairwoman ann mclaughlin said the panel staff has 
yet to find hard evidence of any changes in bookings as a result of 
the threat but has asked pan am for passenger data and is 
continuing its investigation 
relatives of some of the victims of the flight 103 bombing have 
questioned the fact that the plane a boeing 747 jumbo jet had 
more than 160 empty seats even though the flight was during a busy 
holiday period they say they believe government personnel 
cancelled because of the selective warning

the state house approved a bill that would 
outlaw abortion as a method of birth control and provide the 
nations strongest challenge to a 1973 supreme court ruling 
legalizing abortion 
were really excited nancy myers a spokeswoman for 
national right to life committee in washington dc said after 
fridays 4736 vote we consider it to be extremely significant 
the measure was forwarded to the senate after more than three 
hours of debate before a gallery packed with activists from both 
sides of the issue 
the bill could come to a final senate floor vote as early as 
friday and opponents said it stood a good chance of passing the 
gop controls both houses of the legislature 
the bill like legislation rejected recently in minnesota and 
utah would outlaw abortion as a method of birth control it would 
allow abortions only in cases of rape incest profound and 
irremediable fetal disabilities or to save the life or prevent 
severe and longlasting physical health damage to the mother 
sponsors contend that would prevent more than 90 percent of some 
1600 abortions performed each year in idaho 
penalties of up to 10000 for a first offense 30000 for a 
second and 50000 for each additional violation could be assessed 
against any physician performing or attempting to perform an 
abortion women undergoing the procedure would not be legally 
responsible 
gov cecil andrus has yet to comment on the bill but he has 
come out strongly against abortion in most cases 
along with a 1989 pennsylvania law which has been partially 
blocked by a federal court injunction the idaho bill would be the 
most restrictive in the nation according to its sponsors and the 
national right to life committee 
im just so proud that idahoans are taking the lead in 
returning protection to our unborn children said kerry 
uhlenkott legislative coordinator for right to life of idaho inc 
the supreme court is inviting us to send up legislation and 
thats what were doing 
advocates of legalized abortion were disappointed that 
legislators ignored arguments the measure would fail to pass 
constitutional muster and that most idaho residents want the 
legislature to stay out of the issue 
i consistently heard the word morality used always ascribed 
to the life of the unborn said sally trott of freedom means 
choice i never heard it used in reference to the states 
obligation if its going to coerce a woman to carry a pregnancy to 
term 
on thursday the house approved and sent the senate legislation 
repealing the states controversial trigger law which sets 
criminal penalties including prison terms up to five years both for 
physicians and women receiving abortions 
the statute would have taken effect only if the us supreme 
court completely overturned its 1973 roe vs wade decision 
legalizing abortion during the first two trimesters of pregnancy 
after nearly 17 years of relative inactivity on abortion idaho 
got back into the fray after last julys us supreme court ruling 
in a missouri case webster vs reproductive health services which 
gave states greater freedom to set limits on abortion 
opponents of the bill cited richard wilkins a brigham young 
university law professor who advised the utah legislature against 
similar legislation 
wilkins opposes abortion but contends the birth control bill 
goes too far in challenging the supreme courts stand and would be 
found unconstitutional on a number of grounds including the test 
that state restrictions should not impose an undue burden on 
the mother 
i am honestly and genuinely convinced that if we pass this 
bill it will hurt the prolife movement that it will be struck 
down said democratic rep patricia mcdermott 
but the bills sponsors said it balances privacy concerns and 
the states responsibility to intervene 
how can any act that involves the consent of one party the 
participation of a second and the destruction of a third be a 
purely private matter asked house majority leader gary 
montgomery

the united states risks losing its 
international partners in the manned space station project if 
congress cuts back on the 26 billion requested for the project in 
1991 nasa administrator richard h truly says 
i think a major reduction would cause them to look very 
seriously at our commitment to the project truly told the senate 
science technology and space subcommittee friday 
the space station freedom is part of the bush administrations 
151 billion request for space programs in fiscal 1991 which 
begins oct 1 the project with european japanese and canadian 
partners has been called the largest international research and 
development enterprise ever undertaken 
relations with the project partners were strained by the united 
states decision last year to delay completion of construction for 
one year without consulting them 
the administration blamed the delay on congressional funding 
cuts and design changes even though the 200 million cut was half 
as large as the administration first alleged 
the european space agency complained that its projects were 
given a back seat in the new plans 
truly said the project scheduled for the first launch in five 
years and permanent manning capability in 1999 is critical for 
further exploration of space especially the moon and mars 
the national aeronautics and space administrations budget 
request is 23 percent higher than the 1990 spending plan and the 
administration expects to call for similar increases in 1992 and 
1993 
subcommittee chairman albert gore jr dtenn questioned the 
feasibility of getting that much money 
gore also suggested nasa might be biting off more projects than 
it can chew leaving many open to the risk of underfunding during 
critical years space projects tend to have lower startup costs 
the dollar amounts begin to balloon the farther along the projects 
get 
gore also raised the issue of the space station when he asked 
truly whether the foreign partners were willing to sit still for 
a further whittling away at the station project a reference to 
previous budget cuts 
the 1991 request for the space station represents a 36 percent 
or 699 million increase over the 1990 amount 
this is a critical time for the space station truly said 
the program is transitioning from the preliminary design to the 
fabrication and testing of development hardware 
he said all major contractors are on board as are many of the 
subcontractors 
addressing the overall nasa budget gore questioned the 
administrations economic assumptions behind it economic growth 
capital gains tax reduction more user fees and lower interest 
rates 
there is still an air of unreality in the administrations 
approach to the budget gore said

the senate is taking a weeklong respite from 
its cleanair debate as lawmakers and the white house try to work 
out an agreement on providing help to coal miners made jobless by 
stricter pollution controls 
unable to resolve the dispute majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine canceled plans friday to continue consideration of the 
clean air legislation into the weekend 
the senate instead adjourned for a previously scheduled recess 
until march 20 when mitchell said the bill will be the first 
order of business 
senate leaders had been prepared thursday to bring the coal 
miner amendment offered by sen robert byrd dwva to a vote 
but action was postponed when they grew uncertain about their 
strength to defeat the proposal 
the amendment is one of a string of proposed changes that would 
significantly alter the compromise reached between senate leaders 
and the white house in private negotiations senate leaders have 
said they would oppose any such amendments 
byrd described his proposal as a safety net for up to 5000 
miners who stand to lose their jobs because of tougher controls on 
acid rain pollution caused by emissions from coalburning plants 
it would provide miners with up to four years of full or part 
salary when their job loss is attributed to the new controls 
originally byrd had sought assistance costing nearly 14 
billion over six years but he then cut that in half in a bid to 
gain support nevertheless the administration told senate leaders 
the measure was still too expensive 
if this amendment is passed its over because president 
bush will not support a compromise bill that includes the coal 
miner provision senate minority leader bob dole rkan said 
during debate thursday night the administration doesnt like 
this amendment one bit and that would be an understatement 
mitchell said friday that negotiations were under way among 
senate leaders byrd and the administration to try to work out a 
settlement 
im willing to let the dice roll by putting the matter to a 
vote byrd said 
mitchell had threatened all week to hold the senators in session 
into today if necessary to work out key provisions of the clean air 
legislation but he canceled those plans friday because of the 
impasse over the coal miner assistance issue 
amendments still pending include several that would strengthen 
the pollution controls including those upon automobiles 
several of those measures especially a call for a second round 
of auto emission controls and broader alternative fuels programs 
are opposed by the administration 
mitchell said he hoped the senate could move swiftly when it 
returns march 20 because then we are going to stay on this bill 
until we finish it he said

the us military is widening its role in the 
war on drugs but critics say the pentagon may be battling a foe it 
cannot defeat 
american troops will be entering a quagmire more complex than 
vietnam said kevin zeese vice president of the drug policy 
foundation a washington think tank that emphasizes the economic 
and social issues behind the drug problem 
zeese commented after the defense department announced friday 
that it was adding warships aircraft radar equipment dog teams 
and other military resources in the atlantic pacific caribbean 
and along the southern us border 
the plan greatly extends the militarys involvement in efforts 
to stem the flow of drugs into the united states and to help 
colombia bolivia and other latin american countries combat their 
drug cartels on land sea and in the air 
deploying appropriate elements of the armed forces should 
over time help reduce the flow of drugs into the country 
defense secretary dick cheney said in a written statement 
cheney who did not attend a news briefing on the program made 
clear in his statement that the impetus for wider military 
involvement in the drug war came from the white house not the 
pentagon 
president bush gave the defense department a clear set of 
marching orders when he issued his national drug control strategy 
last september cheney said these plans carry out those orders 
the pentagons civilian and military leaders had resisted 
diverting military forces to the drug war during the reagan 
administration 
cheneys announcement won praise from some members of congress 
rep charles b rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics applauded cheney for providing an assurance 
that no military people or resources would be used in a latin 
american country without that nations approval 
i am extremely pleased the military is becoming a full partner 
in the war on drugs as directed by congress rangel said 
stephen m duncan cheneys coordinator of drug enforcement 
policy said the drugfighting plan would cost nearly twice the 
450 million appropriated by congress for pentagon antidrug 
efforts this year he said the services would have to cough up 
out of their hide the extra funds 
the administration has asked congress to approve 12 billion in 
pentagon spending on the drug war next year 
duncan outlined the following plans for increased military 
action in the drug war 
four or five naval ships are being used exclusively for 
tracking and stopping drug traffic in international waters in the 
caribbean and atlantic none had been dedicated to this use before 
this year more of the air forces airborne warning and control 
systems or awacs surveillance aircraft also will be used in the 
atlantic 
the us atlantic and pacific commands each plan to use more 
than eight classes of aircraft and six classes of ships for the 
druginterdiction strategy the aircraft include p3 orions f4 
phantoms and f14 tomcats ships include destroyers frigates 
aircraft carriers and amphibious and logistic support ships 
the north american aerospace defense command will use a network 
of 44 ground radars designed to warn of highaltitude penetrations 
of us airspace it also will increase its patrol of the us 
southern border and coasts by using awacs planes and 50 interceptor 
alert aircraft positioned at 25 locations nationwide 
the pacific command will greatly increase its use of ships and 
aircraft to provide intelligence data on drug trafficking it also 
will use military dog teams when requested by civilian police 
authorities to help detect illegal drugs at air and sea ports of 
entry 
the us southern command in panama will provide training and 
other support to latin american nations asking for help against 
their drug cartels it also will use a caribbean basin radar 
network that consists of a series of early warning radars some 
already in place to detect and monitor drug traffickers 
duncan refused to say how many us troops will be used in latin 
america

anchorage alaska joseph hazelwood had set up a very nice 
maneuver and should not be faulted for leaving the bridge of the 
exxon valdez before the tanker went aground a veteran captain said 
in testimony for the defense friday shiras walker of 
jacksonville fla said he would have acted much as hazelwood did 
on the day of the nations worst oil spill hazelwood did no wrong 
in leaving the ship in the hands of the third mate after giving 
instructions to avoid channel ice walker said 
it was a very gentle turn he was setting himself up for a 
very nice maneuver around the ice said walker he was never 
putting his vessel in grave danger 
walker who commanded ships through the valdez narrows for nine 
years and now works as a river pilot rebutted earlier testimony 
from prosecution witnesses on these key points 
the third mates lack of pilotage endorsement although walker 
obtained the coast guard endorsement required to pilot in prince 
william sound he said he understood the requirement for this 
license had been waived whenever visibility was two miles or more 
exxon captain andre martineau who testified before walker 
agreed at that point in time there were so many vessels running 
up there without pilotage that there didnt seem to be much point 
in monitoring the pilotage requirements 
coast guard monitoring walker said he understood the coast 
guard always kept an eye on tankers to avoid collisions and 
groundings if they noticed anything wrong he said they would 
really give the pilots hell coast guard monitors said they lost 
sight of the exxon valdez on their radar and gave the ship no 
warning 
the 10 degree right rudder turn which was not executed 
causing the tanker to run aground walker said it is one of the 
simplest commands for a helmsman to carry out its a very simple 
thing its even easier than steering some cars 
hazelwoods failure to sound a general alarm for the crew 
walker said it would have created panic i would have done 
exactly what captain hazelwood did 
hazelwoods postgrounding behavior i think he was really 
thinking walker said of the skippers orders to gather 
information lower lifeboats and check the engine room its 
amazing with all the crushing problems on him to be able to think 
that quickly 
ive been through groundings walker said the feeling is 
equivalent to being punched in the stomach and im talking about a 
onetotwo barrel spill not something of this magnitude to bear 
up under that its amazing 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny faces up to 7 years in 
prison and 61000 in fines if convicted of the four criminal 
charges he faces 
the exxon valdez went aground march 24 spilling almost 11 
million gallons of alaska crude oil into prince william sound 
polluting the rocky shore and killing countless birds fish and 
other widlife 
a central issue confronting jurors is whether hazelwood was 
reckless when he allowed third mate greg cousins to take control of 
the ship while the skipper went below hazelwood was the only 
officer on board who had the coast guard pilotage endorsement 
walker said hazelwood was not reckless noting he left proper 
instructions with his mate 
also friday superior court judge karl johnstone dismissed a 
juror and replaced her with an alternate during a secret session 
with lawyers for both sides johnstone refused to disclose why the 
woman had been excused its not a big deal he said

oliver north says he lied repeatedly to 
congress after national security adviser john poindexter told him 
to take care of inquiries into whether he was secretly 
assisting the nicaraguan rebels 
but nobody ever told me to lie to congress north testified 
friday at poindexters trial insisting that he decided on his own 
to make the false statements after his boss sent him to meet with 
house intelligence committee members on aug 6 1986 
poindexter watched intently while north spent the day on the 
witness stand in us district court reluctantly testifying 
against his former boss on the national security council staff 
north the governments first witness returns monday to face 
questioning about the iran initiative 
irancontra prosecutor dan webb led north through his 
recollections of a conversation with poindexter in which north 
said he didnt think it would be a very good idea to meet with 
the congressmen 
north testified at his own trial last year about the 
conversation in some detail but he said friday he was unable to 
remember much of his earlier testimony 
under prodding by webb north said he had a general 
recollection of telling poindexter that there were things that 
could not be revealed to the congressmen and that meeting with them 
would create vulnerability 
i didnt want to be in that predicament said north 
he recalled that poindexter told him something like you can 
handle it or you can take care of it i do not remember the 
specific preambular language on either side 
asserting that neither poindexter nor anyone else had ordered 
him to tell falsehoods north said i didnt walk into the 
meeting intending to lie 
he said he made false statements when he told the congressmen he 
wasnt providing military advice to the contra rebels hadnt been 
in frequent contact with contra liaison robert owen and hadnt been 
in touch with rebel supporter john singlaub in 20 months 
i recall deceiving them about the full measure of my 
involvement north testified 
north balked when webb showed him a computer message from 
poindexter sent several days after the meeting in which the 
national security official told north well done 
north suggested that the message sent on the computer may not 
have been a reference to his false statements to the congressmen 
at that point webb pulled out norths testimony to the 
congressional irancontra committees on july 8 1987 north told 
that hearing that he informed poindexter what he had told the 
congressmen and that in response his boss said well done 
do you recall that webb asked north 
i do not north replied 
did that surprise you that you got a note saying well 
done webb continued 
not particularly said north 
while defending himself at his trial last year north was much 
more emphatic in recalling the conversation in which poindexter 
directed him to meet with the congressmen 
i said i dont think this is a very good idea north 
testified on april 7 1989 
i had told him that he and i both knew that there were 
all kinds of things that just could not be revealed that could not 
be divulged and that he and i both knew what they were north 
testified at his trial 
north said one of the things was saudi arabias aid to the 
contras which president reagan had admonished must never be 
revealed 
poindexters response said north was you can handle it 
you can take care of it not in the sense that it was going to be 
unlawful just in the sense you can take care of it 
in his trial testimony north went on to say that i felt like 
a pawn in a chess game being played by giants 
poindexter is accused of conspiracy two counts of obstructing 
congress and two counts of making false statements for allegedly 
concealing norths secret contra resupply network and us 
involvement in a 1985 shipment of hawk antiaircraft missiles to 
iran 
north is appealing his conviction on charges of conspiracy 
aiding and abetting an obstruction of congress and accepting an 
illegal gratuity

democrats in congress are zeroing in on the 
richgetricher argument as they battle president bushs proposal 
to cut taxes on capital gains 
changes in federal tax laws since 1977 have shifted considerably 
more of the tax burden away from the wealthiest taxpayers and a 
capitalgains cut would worsen the inequity the congressional 
budget office says in a new report 
in releasing the study friday rep dan rostenkowski dill 
chairman of the house ways and means committee described as 
staggering the tax shift and the increases in incomes of the 
richest americans 
the nonpartisan cbo estimated that 59 percent of the 
capitalgains tax cut would go to the richest 1 percent of 
americans whose incomes average 162000 the top 5 percent 
averaging almost 59000 would get 85 percent of the reduction 
other analyses by cbo the ways and means committee staff and a 
laborfinanced group citizens for tax justice released in recent 
days reached the same conclusions 
senior aides to rostenkowski said that without such analyses 
the heated debate over cutting taxes on capital gains which are 
profits from the sale of investments would be conducted solely on 
administration claims that the reduction would boost the economy 
and lower the budget deficit 
the administration is not raising the other issue what has 
happened to tax progressivity in the 1980s said one aide who 
like others briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
progressivity refers to a tax system based on ability to pay 
the aides acknowledged that rostenkowski does not now have the 
votes to defeat a capitalgains tax cut bush has proposed to lower 
the current 28 percent and 33 percent tax rates on capital gains by 
nearly onethird 
meanwhile rostenkowski carried his fight against the cut to a 
convention of securities dealers in boca raton fla he said the 
proposal is neckandneck with a social security tax cut in the 
race for dumbest idea of the year 
i was left nearly speechless by this competition until i 
finally decided to simply call both proposals political junk food 
and just let them go at that rostenkowski said 
democratic leaders in the house and senate are weighing how to 
respond to a proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny to 
cut social security taxes in order to keep the government from 
using surplus taxes to make the budget deficit look smaller than it 
is 
the democratic response on that issue will be included in a 
plan expected soon setting out the partys policy on a broad 
array of tax and budget issues 
rostenkowski is getting the jump on his fellow democratic 
leaders in an article written for sundays editions of the 
washington post he is expected to call once again for a sharp 
increase in the gasoline tax and perhaps for higher taxes on 
tobacco alcohol and crude oil 
the cbo report released friday concluded basically that major 
tax laws enacted in 1978 and 1981 cut taxes significantly for the 
wealthiest americans but not nearly so much for those at other 
income levels 
the conclusion is essentially the same as was reached in a study 
released citizens for tax justice that study found that if the tax 
laws were made as fair today as they were in 1977 all but the 
richest 10 percent would pay less and the government would still 
collect 675 billion a year more 
the bush administration prefers to point out that the richest 
americans are paying a greater share of the total tax burden than 
they were in 1977 congressional economists agree but say the 
reason is that incomes of the wealthiest 10 percent have soared 
during the same period

for the second time this week hundreds of 
thousands of tax refunds have been delayed by the internal revenue 
services outdated computer system 
the irs said friday that 171000 returns filed into the ogden 
utah service center from 25 midwestern and northwestern states 
were delayed because of a faulty computer tape that number 
included 31000 returns filed electronically 
what this is going to mean is that these people who have filed 
electronically will still get a refund within the two or 
threeweek time frame promised but it will be more toward the 
end said ellen murphy irs public affairs director filers of 
paper returns have been getting refunds in five to six weeks 
on tuesday the irs said 53000 electronic returns and as many 
as 200000 paper returns filed into the cincinnati and memphis 
centers had been delayed two weeks because of a breakdown in the 
transportation of several reels of computer tape 
the irs servicecenter computers used to process returns cannot 
communicate with those at the martinsburg wva center where 
refunds are certified tapes from the service centers must be flown 
to washington national airport and trucked from there to 
martinsburg 
the ogden service center tape containing data from returns filed 
in late february was shipped to martinsburg where it was found to 
be faulty 
a backup tape was received at martinsburg within 24 hours but 
since processing is done on a weekly basis ms murphy said 
refunds had to be delayed into the following week 
of 6000 reels of tape processed this year she said about a 
dozen have had to be reshipped because of faulty formatting or 
other glitches 
through march 3 the irs had received 386 million returns up 3 
percent from the 375 million in the same period last year 
processing is up 15 percent 253 million compared with 22 million 
a year ago 
just under 3 million electronic returns have been received a 
281 percent increase over 777000 at this time last year 
the irs expects about 110 million individual returns to be filed 
this year

the energy department is aiming at a june 
restart of production at its rocky flats colo plant the sole 
supplier of plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
the plant 16 miles from denver has been closed since last 
november the department ordered safety and management 
improvements although it insists the facility poses no threat to 
public health 
on friday the department said it had approved a restart plan 
submitted by egampg inc which operates rocky flats for the 
government under contract 
the restart plan calls for a phased resumption of plutonium 
production by the end of june with all six plutonium buildings 
back in operation by the end of september 
the announcement did not say exactly when full production would 
be restored although department officials said in late february 
that it probably would be sometime this fall 
catherine kaliniak an energy department spokeswoman said a 
firmer estimate of the restart schedule dates might be announced as 
early as april 
among the improvements that egampg said it will make before 
resuming production are better procedures for verifying safety and 
alarm systems better training new management oversight and an 
environmental compliance review 
implementation of the improvements will be monitored by egampg 
officials and department headquarters officials progress will be 
assessed by an independent oversight board and then energy 
secretary james d watkins will be asked to give the final ok for 
restart 
rocky flats has been plagued by a variety of operating and 
wastehandling problems in recent years last june the fbi raided 
the facility in search of evidence of criminal violations of laws 
governing the handling of radioactive wastes a grand jury was 
impaneled last august but no indictments have been returned 
egampg a longtime weapons industry contractor based in wellesley 
mass officially took over rocky flats on jan 1 from rockwell 
international corp although egampg has been working on a 
plantimprovement strategy since last september rockwell quit 
operating the plant last september in a dispute with watkins over 
legal liability for environmental violations

gov gaston caperton offered to pay 
teachers for the class they missed during a threeday walkout if 
they end west virginias first teacher strike and return to schools 
monday 
leaders of the biggest union the west virginia education 
association declined to comment on capertons offer friday 
bob brown executive director of the smaller west virginia 
federation of teachers said representatives of his 3000teacher 
union were meeting today to discuss the proposal 
capterton had earlier refused to negotiate until teachers 
returned to work attorney general roger tompkins on thursday said 
local school boards could suspend fire or file criminal charges 
against striking teachers 
education secretary steve haid said it would be up to each of 
the 55 county school boards whether to follow the governors 
recommendation of clemency and pay for the strike days but he said 
he expects all to comply 
were trying to create an atmosphere of cooperation haid 
said 
caperton said negotiations on pay and benefits can begin once 
the teachers return to work he acknowledged that a pay raise will 
require a tax increase and haid said a special legislative session 
later this spring is possible 
thats a very very important conciliatory offer on the 
governors part because i am sure there are a lot of people out 
there who think its overly generous said education secretary 
steve haid 
the strike began wednesday after the governor and legislative 
leaders withdrew a 5 percent pay raise offer saying the package 
couldnt win legislative approval because the wvea refused to say 
it wouldnt strike 
the wvea says the average west virginia teacher salary of 
21904 ranks the state 49th in the nation ahead only of 
mississippi west virginia teachers received a 5 percent pay raise 
last month 
the strike spread to 40 of the 55 counties friday and the state 
education department said there was no class at all in 24 counties 
with five others reporting some schools closed and some open 
west virginia education association president kayetta meadows 
said earlier friday her 16000member organization was willing to 
resume talks but was not ready at this time to go back to class 
more than 1000 striking teachers most wearing bright red 
swarmed through the capitol on friday for the third straight day 
the teachers have begun wearing anything red from sweaters to 
coats to hats as a symbol of unity much as striking coal miners 
wear camouflage 
an additional 3000 teachers in the state are not represented by 
either union

in a major victory for mongolias prodemocracy 
movement its communist leader proposed a plebiscite for the 
partycontrolled legislature and called for a revamped party 
politburo a foreign source said today 
the soviet news agency tass said president zhambyn batmonh would 
consider ousting the entire politburo batmonh also the party 
chief called for a party central committee meeting monday 
his televised address friday came amid increasing pressure from 
the 3monthold reform movement and raised the odds mongolia would 
become asias first communist country to undergo sweeping political 
change 
the events brought the wave of political reform to the doorstep 
of china which has crushed its own democracy movement last spring 
with the army attack on protesters in beijing 
in his speech batmonh also appealed for opposition groups to 
respect law and order and end a threeday hunger strike said the 
foreign source speaking in a telephone interview from the 
mongolian capital of ulan bator 
the source said the hunger strikers gathered in a ropedoff 
area on the capitals central square ended their fast friday 
night there were about 30 participants at the end 
a general strike proposed for today by demonstrators who 
gathered in the square friday was also likely to be called off in 
response to the concessions made by batmonh the source said 
batmonh a former university rector who took power in 1984 said 
the central committee will consider calling a special party 
congress 
he said he hoped the meetings would result in the election of a 
new ruling politburo but did not say what kind of leaders he had in 
mind 
mondays meeting will also take up the question of holding a 
referendum on the great peoples hural which under communist rule 
has little power and is not directly elected the partys 69year 
monopoly on power may also be on the agenda 
the opposition which first took to the streets in peaceful 
demonstrations in december complains that mongolia is moving too 
slowly in its version of perestroika the soviet word for 
restructuring that is used to describe soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reform policies 
two newly formed opposition parties the mongolian democratic 
party and the social democratic party have demanded the 
resignation of the politburo the dissolution of the legislature 
for new elections and recognition of a multiparty system 
they and smaller opposition groups have also blamed the party 
for the nations economic stagnation and its heavy dependence on 
moscow about 50000 advisers and 60000 troops are in mongolia 
which lies between the soviet union and china 
they say the soviet union doesnt pay enough for mongolias 
natural resources and has saddled the nation of 2 million people 
with a debt estimated by western economists at 6 billion 
the government which began a cautious restructuring program in 
1988 has taken a conciliatory stance toward the opposition demands 
and has not interfered with street rallies but has urged the 
reformists against pressing too hard for rapid change

supporters of rival candidates in local 
council elections hurled rocks and homemade bombs at each other in 
two southwestern cities injuring at least 150 people newspapers 
said today 
the clashes occurred friday in khulna a river port city 85 
miles southwest of dhaka and in jessore about 30 miles northwest 
of khulna 
the independent bengali newspaper khabar said about 100 people 
were injured in the khulna clashes between supporters of two 
candidates from president hussain muhammad ershads jatiya party 
the trouble started when the two sets of supporters tried to 
welcome civil aviation minister abdul gaffar who had come to 
khulna to address a public rally the newspaper said both groups 
claimed their candidate had the jatiya partys support 
the local council elections which traditionally are the most 
violent in bangladesh are scheduled for march 1425 they are 
nonpartisan but clashes usually erupt along party lines because 
local voters know the party affiliations of the technically

a cramped and nervewracking airport and no 
room to build a new one has san diego in a tight spot 
its hard to imagine a more picturesque setting for an 
international airport on a bayfront flanked by rolling hills 
glassy skyscrapers and the gray magnificence of a navy fleet 
but to pilots who are forced by downtown buildings to descend 
steeply on approach to lindbergh field the setting for the airport 
serving the nations sixth largest city is all wrong 
its the worst airport in the world said tom carroll of the 
air line pilots association 
some would call than an exaggeration but a 1988 survey of 1360 
pilots found lindbergh field tied in fith place with denvers 
singleton airport as the least safe airport in the united states 
transportation planners and civic leaders who eye the land that 
lindbergh sits on for downtown expansion have spent 30 years 
searching for a replacement the most frequently discussed option 
is to convert the miramar naval air station to a commercial or 
jointuse airport 
the navy is adamantly opposed to any such plan 
unless an alternative is found by the turn of the century 
lindbergh built in 1928 could throw a wrench into the regions 
robust economy 
san diego is running into an economic buzz saw if we wait any 
longer said dan pegg president of the san diego economic 
development corp 
its absolutely the toughest issue in san diego said jack 
koerper the director of special projects for the san diego 
association of governments the regional planning agency conducting 
the airport search 
squeezed onto 485 acres lindbergh is surrounded by san diego 
bay the marine corps recruit depot businesses residential areas 
and rolling hills 
one pilot likened it to landing in a shoebox said dick 
russell of the pilots association 
i cannot and will not say its unsafe but i will say a pilot 
flying into lindbergh has to be on the ball at all times theres 
very little room for error he said 
lindbergh handled 11 million people last year but planners say 
its saturation point may come in five to 10 years the time to make 
another airport operational a new airport would have to serve 
about 40 million passengers by 2050 aviation planners and civic 
leaders say 
despite some 40 studies since 1960 no consensus has developed 
on an alternative to lindbergh 
one proposal called for a binational airport on otay mesa at 
the mexican border but that would require the negotiation of 
international agreements with mexico 
other possibilities include a hubandspoke concept in which 
a main airport would be constructed in imperial valley some 100 
miles to the east with travelers shuttled to san diego on smaller 
planes or a highspeed train 
an offshore or floating airport also has been discussed 
around san diego options have dwindled as urban sprawl gobbled 
undeveloped land 
the only place that development hasnt preempted is miramar 
and thats because the navy has preserved it said county 
supervisor brian bilbray 
but the cost of replacing the air base home to the top gun 
pilot school would be 10 billion said us rep bill lowery 
rsan diego 
miramar is not an option said lowery the navys not just 
said no theyve said hell no

officials are trying to find dock workers truck 
drivers and others who may have been exposed to an intensely 
radioactive pellet found in cargo shipped from korea to california 
to massachusetts 
there is no need for panic but there certainly is reason for 
concern nuclear regulatory commission spokesman karl abraham 
said friday people could have received significant exposure 
abraham could not say how many people may have been exposed nor 
what radioactive isotope was involved he said the radioactive 
material was used for making xraytype pictures of welds 
structural steels and other industrial objects 
the pellet the size of a pencil eraser was discovered lying 
loose and unshielded in the bottom of a container that was supposed 
to be empty the container was being sent back to a manufacturer 
for reuse in shipping new pellets abraham said 
the pellet was in a shipment of containers that arrived in the 
boston area two weeks ago more than a month after it was sent from 
south korea to los angeles for storage the shipment then was 
trucked from california to pennsylvania maryland and 
massachusetts abraham said 
a preliminary survey of the truck as it arrived at amersham inc 
of burlington revealed some radioactivity and on closer 
examination technicians found 1500 times more radiation within 
six inches of the source abraham said 
he said tests 4 to 6 inches from the pellet found the level of 
radiation to be 150 rems per hour millions of times higher than 
normal background levels 
a rem is a measure of the estimated damage done to living tissue 
by radiation people generally receive about onetenth of a rem or 
100 millirem of radiation annually from natural sources while the 
average american is exposed to an annual dose of 77 millirem from 
medical xrays 
us department of transportation investigators were working 
with the nrc to establish the shipments route and track down dock 
workers cargo handlers truck drivers warehouse managers and 
other people who may have been exposed to the pellet abraham said

john r dunne has been unanimously confirmed 
by the senate to be assistant attorney general for civil rights 
filling a 15month vacancy at the justice department 
dunne a former new york state senator with little prior 
involvement in civil rights issues was confirmed by voice vote 
friday the senate judiciary committee had recommended dunne the 
day before despite criticism over his former memberships in clubs 
that excluded women and stock holdings in a company that does 
business in south africa 
dunne 60 of garden city ny was nominated in january for 
the post which had been vacant since december 1988 when william 
bradford reynolds resigned 
president bushs first choice for the job william c lucas of 
michigan was rejected by the judiciary committee last august 
dunne played a minor role in bushs new york campaign he was a 
new york state senator for 24 years resigning last year after 
losing a race for majority leader and is a partner in the 
uniondale ny law firm of rivkin radler dunne amp bayh 
civil rights groups criticized dunnes almost nonexistent civil 
rights record but none opposed his nomination 
but dune drew fire for having held longtime memberships in the 
fort orange club in albany ny and the garden city golf club on 
long island ny the fort orange admitted women in 1988 the golf 
club is still sexsegregated

members of congress are criticizing the bush 
administration for missing the deadline for setting out regulations 
to ensure the quality and accuracy of all medical laboratory tests 
lawmakers were not appeased by the health care financing 
administrations announcement that final rules to bring 12000 
medical labs under uniform national testing standards would be 
published next week and could take effect after a 60day comment 
period 
by hcfas own estimate there are between 300000 and 600000 
medical testing facilities including labs in physicians offices 
employer health units public health departments blood banks and 
public screening labs most of those would be covered by other 
rules hcfa is drafting but has not yet formally proposed 
it is critical that all laboratories be regulated sen 
brock adams dwash said friday at the joint hearing of the 
senate labor and human resources committee and the governmental 
affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management each 
month the implementation is delayed more cases of cancer go 
undetected more men and women receive erroneous laboratory reports 
and more tragedies result 
gail wilensky head of hcfa told the lawmakers the rules 
covering 12000 labs that receive payments from medicare and 
medicaid will make a tremendous difference in the way those 
labs operate 
she said those rules were already being drafted when congress 
passed a law in 1988 giving hcfa authority to regulate all testing 
labs and directing the agency to have rules in place to implement 
the law by jan 1 1990 
the main reason for the delay in meeting that deadline she 
said was major unexpected dissension within the scientific 
community over the amount of regulation various types of tests 
should require 
she said hcfa expected to propose rules to meet the 1988 law in 
three stages

police and us troops swept through 
panama city seizing weapons and drugs and rounding up hundreds of 
suspects to try to stop a crime wave 
we want to get criminals off the street so our citizens can 
once again walk around without fear of being held up vice 
minister of government and justice ramon lima said of the raids 
friday 
widespread looting broke out after us forces invaded dec 20 
ousted manuel noriega and effectively disbanded his defense forces 
which served as police and army in the country 
while widespread looting has ended citizens complain of 
robberies at stoplights among other assaults and say more 
firearms are being used authorities say the murder rate has 
quintupled 
lima said 760 people were arrested in the friday raids but they 
yielded none of the large caches of weapons believed still hidden 
by exmembers of the defense forces he said many people apparently 
were tipped off in advance and fled 
we did not confiscate the amount of weapons we had expected 
lima told a news conference he said police found 47 shotguns 
pistols and revolvers but no military weapons 
police also seized undisclosed amounts of cocaine marijuana and 
crack he said

for the us southern command said the soldiers worked with about 
400 panamanian law enforcement officers whom they have been 
training in police work since the new civilian government abolished 
the defense forces and created a police force 
many of the new policemen are former members of the defense 
forces 
government officials express concern about hidden weapons they 
fear could be used if noriegas paramilitary organizations regroup 
capt leslie loaiza head of the operation said the crime rate 
is frightening 
a few months ago we had an average of five murders a month in 
the capital he said we now have 30 we had an average of 240 
crimes of different types every month we now have more than 
1000

state radio urged residents turn in 
traitors and officials said scores of soldiers and employees 
were detained after a coup attempt in which president najib 
narrowly escaped death 
sporadic clashes erupted in the capital friday three days after 
the failed coup although officials said the situation was 
generally quiet 
the location of the coup leader defense minister shah nawaz 
tanai remained unknown tanai teamed up with guerrillas from one 
of the seven moslem guerrilla groups battling najibs sovietbacked 
government 
the government said at least 56 people died and 200 were wounded 
in tuesdays coup attempt it said 25 of the dead and half the 
wounded were civilians 
damage to the city was severe it appeared almost every window 
was broken indicating heavy bombing by renegade air force pilots 
bombs had blasted several government buildings including the 
presidential palace 
after a 9 pm curfew took effect friday security forces 
arrested scores of people in a neighborhood populated mainly by 
government employees said a government official who lives in the 
area 
radio kabul urged all citizens to turn in traitors who it 
said were hiding in houses throughout the capital 
a government source said intelligence agents killed a military 
officer believed loyal to the coup leader and arrested another near 
the presidential palace friday one agent from the security 
service khad was wounded the source said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the status of the shindand air base in southwest herat province 
was in question a government official said the base had yet to 
pledge loyalty to najib 
lt col mohammad hassan said he was on duty in the presidential 
palace on tuesday when four clusters of bombs landed on the 
grounds killing four soldiers from the presidential guards 
a cluster of three small bombs landed yards from najibs office

fled to neighboring pakistan naqib sameer a government spokesman 
said some had been arrested but he could not say which ones 
death sentences were widely expected for people found guilty of 
supporting the attack najib established a special tribunal to hear 
treason cases and bakhtar said punishment would be carried out 
in accordance with afghan tradition

guerrillas of masterminding the coup attempt and said it could not 
tolerate such interference bakhtar said 
tanai a marxist hardliner was involved in the 1978 coup that 
brought the communists to power in afghanistan he disagreed with 
najibs attempts to make peace with the anticommunist guerrillas 
that began fighting the government 11 years ago 
despite this tanai this week teamed up with hezbiislami one 
of the most radical of the guerrilla groups it had split from a 
fractious coalition with the other six guerrilla groups and its 
leader gulbuddin hekmatyar backed the coup attempt 
hekmatyar and tanai appeared to be linked only by their desire 
to overthrow najib

the st louis postdispatch submitted a new 
contract to negotiators representing some 630 newsroom employees 
who have been on a byline strike 
postdispatch publisher nicholas g penniman iv said friday the 
latest proposal was a response to concerns among employees most of 
the newspapers reporters and columnists have withheld their 
bylines from stories since wednesday 
they said tell us what you need to remain competitive and 
give us a chance to vote and basically thats what we did 
penniman said we listened to our employees and put on the table 
a very fair offer 
herb goodrick executive secretary of the newspaper guild local 
47 said he would withhold comment until the guild received a 
written version 
about 630 newsroom employees including reporters some editors 
photographers and advertising sales staffers have been working 
without a contract since the last one expired feb 28 the guild is 
the largest of 11 unions at the newspaper and one of six seeking a 
new contract 
the postdispatch is owned by pulitzer publishing co 
penniman said the new proposal was for three years and included 
a 4 percent pay raise for each year and a 600 signing bonus it 
also eliminated many demands that guild members had objected to in 
the past few months 
in october the guild rejected a proposal for a fiveyear 
contract it offered the same pay raise but called for 
drugtesting which the union said was unclearly defined and a 
twotier wage system that would have meant lower wages for some new 
employees 
the companys subsequent contract offer included no wage 
increases a reduction in sick leave and vacation benefits and a 
number of other clauses denounced by the union 
the paper said that offer was made because of a drop in 
advertising and competition from the st louis sun a new daily 
published by ingersoll publications that started up in september

chaplain trained in racetrack ministry krueckeberg is welcome as a 
guest preacher said the attorney richard burke

off the property 
the affidavit supported a lawsuit by track workers who are 
trying to overturn a management ban on families with children in 
the apartments on arlingtons backstretch the migrant workers say 
they cannot afford to live anywhere else but management contends 
it is a dangerous area for children 
i feel like a shepherd who has been separated from his 
flock the lutheran minister said in a recent interview 
i love the people and im in a relationship with them im 
baptizing the children of children i baptized 
burke said the track opted for hiring a chaplain from the race 
track chaplaincy of america a nationwide organization based in new 
jersey the tracks attorney said such chaplains receive special 
training in helping racetrack workers and travel with the workers 
from state to state 
it had nothing to do with rev krueckeberg we have no quarrel 
with him burke said in a telephone interview friday its just 
that we were attempting to handle the problem of the needs of the 
track on a professional basis 
krueckebergs lawyer alan chen of the american civil liberties 
union of illinois said the lutheran churchmissouri synod 
clergyman had been ministering to people on the backstretch at 
arlington park for 20 years without any problem

the job has baptized babies in trailers and performed weddings in 
the winners circle 
whatever the outcome of krueckebergs complaint which the two 
sides are negotiating to try to settle or the workers lawsuit 
krueckeberg will continue to minister at hawthorne race course in 
stickney balmoral park in crete and at sportsmans park in 
suburban cicero 
charles bidwill jr president of sportsmans said friday that 
krueckeberg approached him 20 years ago and told him what he hoped 
to accomplish at the track 
all he wanted to do was preach the word of god to these people 
and help wherever he could said bidwill hes helped a lot of 
people and hes done a lot of good

rival christian forces skirmished with 
machine guns in east beirut overnight despite gen michel aouns 
declared readiness to negotiate peace police today said four 
people were wounded 
the command of samir geageas lebanese forces militia blamed the 
violations of the weekold ceasefire on aouns troops and demanded 
strict measures to prevent such attempts that jeopardize 
security 
aouns command said the militia fired four mortar rounds into 
territories held by the generals 19000 troops in east beirut 
a police spokesman who requested anonymity in line with 
regulations said the four casualties were wounded in 
militiacontrolled districts 
by police count 750 people have been killed and 2093 wounded 
since jan 30 when the inconclusive showdown began for mastery of 
the 310squaremile enclave 
the overnight exchanges the fiercest since a mediation 
committee called a ceasefire march 3 came after aoun in an 
unexpected conciliatory move called for dialogue with geagea as 
well as with the various other moslem and leftist leaders to end 
the nations 15yearold civil war 
aoun on friday also dropped his outright rejection of an arab 
leaguebrokered peace plan worked out by lebanese legislators in 
the saudi arabian resort of taif last fall 
however the 54yearold general proposed that the plan be 
amended calling for a taif accord no 2 
prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem rejected aouns 
proposal to amend the peace accord declaring we adhere to the 
taif agreement both in letter and spirit 
voice of the people radio which is close to hoss government 
said aoun was maneuvering and stalling for time 
the taif accord called for a redistribution of political power 
in lebanon doing away with christian domination and dividing power 
equally between moslems and christians 
aoun earlier had rejected the pact because it did not provide 
for the immediate withdrawal of syrias 40000 troops in lebanon 
under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate 
aoun also has ignored orders by president elias hrawi to step 
down as army commander and turn over the presidential palace 
the intrachristian showdown has forced onefourth of the 
enclaves 1 million population to evacuate and seek refuge in safer 
areas 
the police spokesman said the estimated 250000 evacuees who had 
fled the christian enclave due to the clashes do not seem to 
trust the ceasefire 
some of the evacuees return to the enclave early in the day to 
check on their damaged property but leave before dark the 
spokesman said 
a mediation committee is meeting separately with aoun and geagea 
in an effort to consolidate the ceasefire and form a national 
authority grouping representatives of the warring factions and 
independent figures to work out a political settlement to the 
intrachristian conflict

the motorman who operated a subway train 
that derailed and killed three people tested postive for cocaine 
and mechanics inspected cars to make sure their motors are 
installed correctly 
john k lauber of the national transportation safety board on 
friday said urine tests uncovered traces of cocaine in the 
motormans system louis gambaccini general manager of the 
southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority said the 
motorman would be suspended as of monday 
no other details about the employee including his name were 
released 
lauber said inspectors examined 76 motors on 19 cars friday 
they found 27 cotter pins which help hold the motors in place 
underneath the cars installed improperly 
lauber said the cotter pins are designed to slip through a nut 
and the bolt the nut is screwed onto the improperly fitted cotter 
pins were turned down too far on the bolts failing to lock the 
nuts 
that is not the proper way of securing that mechanism he 
said 
the ntsb recommended that the transit authority immediately 
inspect the motors on all 240 subway cars gambaccini said the 
recommendation would be carried out 
investigators believe a motor on a car came loose wednesday hit 
a switch and sent half of a sixcar train onto another set of 
tracks the fourth car smashed into steel support beams killing 
three passengers and trapping survivors 
of 94 injured 10 remained hospitalized friday all in good or 
satisfactory condition hospital officials said 
within three hours of the accident the train conductor and 
motorman underwent tests for alcohol and drugs lauber said both 
tested negative for alcohol use a urine test on the conductor for 
other drugs also was negative 
investigators have not determined whether cocaine played a role 
in the accident he said 
we have no idea when the cocaine was ingested at what time 
and whether or not it had an effect or was a factor in this 
accident lauber said that question he said would receive 
further analysis 
lauber declined to comment on whether the worker had been 
disciplined for or had tested positive for drug use in the past 
saying the investigation was continuing 
gambaccini said the transportation authority has initiated a 
comprehensive drugtesting program 
it is our understanding that septa is only one of two of the 
larger urban transit authorities that conducts random drug 
testing he said 
he also insisted philadelphias rail system was safe 
transportation in all modes has accidents he said i 
believe that it is safe this is the single most tragic accident 
in the history of the system 
the accident was the worst since the marketfrankford line began 
operation 21 years ago a 37block stretch of that line remained 
closed friday service was expected to resume monday

an iranian newspaper today said a media 
blitz on us hostages in lebanon was designed in part to prepare 
the american public for a military mission to try to free the 
captives 
in beirut a key shiite moslem leader mohammed hussein 
fadlallah said of the hostages we believe there are encouraging 
elements regarding readiness to deal with this issue 
fadlallah spiritual leader of the proiran hezbollah or party 
of god was answering a question from the newspaper alliwa if he 
thought the hostages would be released in 1990 
on feb 23 after returning from a trip to iran fadlallah had 
called for realistic and humanitarian means to free the 
hostages hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for groups 
holding some of the 18 western hostages 
the newspaper kayhan international in an editorial said a us 
military rescue mission involving israel would end the 
socalled crisis with the death of at least the american hostages 
the newspaper cited no source or facts to back its assertions 
eight american hostages are among the 18 westerners being held 
by proiranian groups in lebanon the longest held is terry 
anderson the chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press who was abducted march 16 1985 
andersons sister peggy say called the iranian newspaper 
report rather bizarre 
theres so much flying around out there that one doesnt know 
what to put stock in said mrs say who recently completed a 
trip to europe and the middle east to discuss the hostage issue 
with political leaders 
but she added i think the media blitz remark is well 
founded because the media have built themselves into a frenzy that 
something will happen by march 16 and neither i nor anybody else 
can do anything to dissuade them 
kayhan international which is often at variance with iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani said if the us and israel embark 
on military adventurism the hostages will in fact be a pretext for 
crippling the islamic movement 
rafsanjani said earlier this week that the hostage issue was 
nearing solution and recent editorials in the tehran times have 
also said the hostages were near release 
the iranian president attempting to consolidate his hold on 
power is opposed by radicals who disagree with his wish to end 
irans isolation and gain western participation in rebuilding the 
country after an eightyear war with iraq 
kayhans editorial today said said other reasons for the current 
media campaign in the us press is to evaluate the reaction of 
iranian officials and to use the humanitarian aspect to put 
pressure on iran 
it said another reason for the us hostage propaganda was 
aimed at positioning american firms to take part in rebuilding iran 
that is why america is looking redeyed and sullen at the 
lively competition being waged by italians germans russians and 
japanese kayhan said 
the editorial was reported by irans official islamic republic 
news agency monitored in nicosia 
it said recent stories on the hostages were a media blitz 
designed to create activity and certain conditions that at present 
are nonexistant kayhan said without elaborating 
kayhan mentioned the february incident in which bush was 
persuaded to talk to someone he thought was rafsanjani but was not 
the incident was first reported thursday 
it called the bush attempt at diplomacy callow 
in a friday sermon rafsanjani said the phone hoax showed the 
confusion of leaders inside the white house he said that 
although the united states needs to talk to iran iran is not ready 
to talk to the united states 
iran denies any connection with the kidnappings but has said it 
would use its influence for their release if the united states 
fulfilled certain conditions such as freeing frozen iranian assets

the soviet union will cut back on underground 
nuclear testing and move the site for the explosions from asia to 
an island inside the arctic circle says a report published today 
the move to the arctic location will force the soviets to 
conduct fewer tests and will hamper development of weapons that 
could be used against the united states the washington post 
reported in todays editions 
the decision came after strong political pressure inside the 
soviet union the post said citing unidentified soviet and us 
sources 
col gen vladmir gerasimov was reported as telling committees 
of the supreme soviet the national legislature that the defense 
ministry plans to conduct 27 more tests at the semipalatinsk site 
in southcentral asia before closing it in 1993 that rate is 
roughly 40 percent below the current pace of testing 
us officials were quoted as saying the soviet announcement 
came as no surprise and added that it still may not curb pressure 
within that country for a complete moratorium on underground 
nuclear explosions

police said today that at 
least 10 people were killed in factional clashes and authorities 
reportedly arrested more than 70 suspects in nationwide raids to 
curb growing violent unrest 
meanwhile police firing shotguns tear gas and rubber bullets 
clashed with protesters in several parts of the country but no 
serious injuries were reported a police report said 
the blackonblack factional fighting came amid the worst 
violence in south africa since the mid1980s more than 200 people 
have died in the past month 
the staterun south african broadcasting corporation reported 
today that more than 70 people were detained nationwide to try to 
halt the violence the report gave no other details 
in the factional fighting overnight nine protesters died and 
one police officer was killed by gunmen the police report said 
the worst violence in recent days was in the black township of 
kathlehong outside johannesburg where police reported finding 
three more bodies today bringing the death toll in the devastated 
township during the past week to at least 22 with scores injured 
a fight between rival taxi companies in the township exploded 
into a major factional fight and hundreds of residents have fled 
the area the south african police sent extra units into the area 
to protect residents and halt the fighting police said 
law and order minister adriaan vlok told parliament on friday 
that the government was determined to end unrest and was prepared 
to use its extensive powers under the 3yearold state of 
emergency to quell the violence 
the proapartheid conservative party blamed the government for 
the violence opposition leaders said president fw de klerks 
decision to legalize the african national congress and other 
opposition groups encouraged radicals to attempt to seize power 
de klerk legalized the anc last month to try and clear the way 
for talks on ending white minority rule and sharing political power 
with the black majority 
the government has charged that some antiapartheid groups are 
behind the outbreak of violence in south africa and some tribal 
homelands because they are not ready to participate in negotiations 
with the white government 
but anc leader walter sisulu said friday that the government was 
reverting to the old approach of looking for scapegoats and 
hidden instigators 
the primary reason for the unrest conflict and confrontation 
has always been the poverty and violence caused by apartheid he 
said

israeli police shot and killed two palestinians 
at stonethrowing protests in a refugee camp in arab east 
jerusalem arab reports said prompting other skirmishes and a 
strike today 
the shootings friday night and early today and were among the 
worst in jerusalem during the 27monthold palestinian uprising 
against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
police confirmed one dead and two wounded saying in a statement 
that the incidents are being investigated arab and un reports 
said two people were killed 
the trouble occurred after israeli leaders repeated their claim 
to the arab sector of jerusalem despite recent us statements that 
the status of the land was in dispute and should be resolved by 
negotiation 
israel radio linked the violence to the usisraeli dispute 
over the status of jerusalem it said camp residents were 
encouraged by us statements 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek also linked the violence to the 
dispute and noted the impatience of radical elements in east 
jerusalem with the slowness and uncertainty of the israeli 
government in advancing the peace process 
israel captured the gaza strip from egypt and the west bank and 
east jerusalem from jordan in the 1967 middle east war it has 
since annexed east jerusalem home to 140000 palestinians and has 
been building jewish neighborhoods around the arab enclave to 
strengthen its hold on the land 
both president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
have said in the past 10 days that israels policy of settling jews 
in the occupied lands is an impediment to peace 
the incidents apparently began friday night when palestinians in 
the shufat refugee camp the only camp within jerusalems city 
limits tried to barricade entrances and threw stones at police 
arab reports said 
the reports said stones also were thrown at passing israeli cars 
on a nearby highway damaging 14 vehicles police said only that 
there was damage to a number of vehicles 
arab reports said police opened fire in shufat on friday night 
and again today to quell stonethrowing protesters 
residents of the camp identified the victims as mahmud fawzi abu 
khalife 21 who was shot in the stomach and sufian mohammed 
abdullah khalil 25 who was hit with a bullet in the head 
officials with the un relief and works agency which oversees 
aid programs for the refugees confirmed both deaths and said at 
least two other palestinians were wounded one critically 
as word of the deaths spread scattered stonethrowing clashes 
broke out this morning in east jerusalem and merchants shuttered 
their stores in protest at the deaths barricades were put up by 
camp residents again this morning the arab reports said 
students were seen blocking city streets with boulders and 
overturned trash cans and hurling stones at police passing cars 
and police squads also were stoned and several windows were 
reported broken merchants said 
tear gas was used to disperse demonstrators outside at least two 
east jerusalem schools 
after the shooting today paramilitary border police ordered 
residents to remain in their homes and rounded up hundreds of young 
palestinians in a schoolyard for questioning 
reporters were blocked from entering the camp and could see some 
of the police activity from the camp entrances 
the deaths raised to 661 the number of palestinians killed by 
israelis in the uprising which began in december 1987 a total of 
194 other palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs most on 
suspicion of collaborating with israeli authorities fortythree 
israelis also have been killed 
the toll in jerusalem rose to at least 10 dead including six 
palestinians and four israelis

in moscow by soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and his 
hungarian counterpart gyula horn the report said

pullout to be completed but the two sides finally agreed that all 
troops and equipment should be withdrawn by june 30 1991 thats 
the same date that the withdrawal from czechoslovakia is to be 
finished

completed on aug 31 1991 to give them more time for dismantling 
military stockpiles but agreed to the earlier date sought by the 
hungarians

georgia has become the fourth soviet republic to 
condemn its annexation to the soviet union calling the move an 
international crime and demanding talks to secure independence a 
local news agency reported 
in lithuania meanwhile activists preparing for an expected 
declaration of independence said the powerful sajudis movement 
wants to replace the republics communist president who could 
stand in the way of immediate secession 
lithuania would be the first of the soviet unions 15 republics 
to declare independence and would confront president mikhail s 
gorbachev with one of the worst crises in five years of governing 
the soviet parliament is to vote monday on his proposal to increase 
presidential power over unruly republics 
all three baltic republics latvia estonia and lithuania 
have condemned the soviet annexation of their lands a half century 
ago and have strong proindependence movements 
sajudis the proindependence popular movement that dominates 
lithuanian politics will probably back one of its three leading 
figures for president of the republic activists said as tonights 
legislative session neared 
lithuanian president algirdas brazauskas backs independence and 
his communist party broke away from the national party in december 
but sajudis activist haroldas subachius said the group decided it 
would be unfitting for him to be reelected because the communists 
lost their majority in elections last month 
many sajudis members also fear brazauskas is not firm enough 
in his support for independence subachius said 
as chairman of the republics 141seat supreme soviet 
brazauskas conceivably could stave off immediate confrontation with 
the kremlin by delaying debate on the secession issue which is 
expected to begin sunday 
the resolution by the georgian supreme soviet legislature 
quoted by the independent news agency of georgia denounces the 
occupation and annexation of georgia by soviet russia and considers 
it to be an international crime 
it calls the entrance of troops a military interference 
intervention and occupation with the aim of overthrowing the 
existing political order and says it is necessary to start 
talks on restoration of an independent state of georgia 
the official news agency tass in a foursentence report on the 
resolution said nothing about the sections condemning the red 
armys occupation of georgia in feb 1921 and the subsequent 
treaties that made georgia part of the soviet union 
the mountainous caucasus republic the birthplace of former 
soviet ruler josef stalin has 5 million residents it first became 
a part of the russian empire in the early 1800s it was briefly 
independent again after the bolshevik revolution 
it has long had an active independence movement in april 
soviet troops armed with gas and sharpened shovels killed 19 
proindependence demonstrators while chasing them off the main 
street of georgias capital tbilisi 
the georgian resolution calls inadmissible gorbachevs 
proposal for the president to declare a state of emergency and 
martial law 
the declaration says that would introduce an authoritarian 
presidential rule which may be interpreted as the presidents 
right to remove organs of power in a union republic and thus to 
completely eliminate the republics sovereignty 
the resolution says the republics deputies participation in 
approving the draft law also would be inadmissible 
gorbachev hopes to win approval of the constitutional amendment 
in mondays special session of the congress of peoples deputies 
despite progressives complaints that the draft would give him 
dictatorial powers 
the resolution says presidential measures taken to protect the 
nations territorial unity should not conflict with the 
realization of a republics right to secede from the ussr 
lithuania moved up its vote on declaring independence to sunday 
precisely because activists fear gorbachev will use his new powers 
to forcibly prevent them from splitting from the soviet union 
lithuanias newly elected lawmakers on friday pressed on toward 
a showdown with moscow discussing how to take the reins of power 
after a declaration of independence 
moscow is menacing us we hope its only with words said 
anderus kubilus secretary of sajudis lithuanias proindependence 
movement we dont think there will be an acute economic 
blockade it wouldnt be profitable for them either economically 
or in terms of international opinion but we dont know 
in comments reported wednesday by official radio vilnius 
gorbachev appeared to accept lithuanias right to secede but 
cautioned that the onceindependent state would have to pay 34 
billion in compensation for factories built and money invested 
during a halfcentury of soviet rule 
the republics parliament will be asked to reaffirm an act first 
passed on feb 16 1918 declaring the state independent lawmakers 
already have declared illegal lithuanias incorporation into the 
soviet union in 1940 under a secret nazisoviet pact 
lawmakers also will be asked to restore the 1938 constitution 
that was swept away by josef stalins kremlin in favor of a 
sovietstyle law

portauprince haiti ap a western ambassador and a 
highranking army source said today that haitis ruler lt gen 
prosper avril will step down in the face of violent 
antigovernment demonstrations 
avril was to resign today and hand over power to the army chief 
who will preside over a transition to civilian rule the sources 
said on condition of anonymity the western ambassador said avril 
will relinquish power to maj gen herard abraham the armys 
commanderinchief 
abraham in turn will have 72 hours to hand over the government 
to a civilian council headed by a supreme court justice the 
ambassador said 
the army high command source said avril would remain in haiti 
after stepping down and a 48hour curfew would be imposed to 
prevent disorder 
the prediction came after five days of antigovernment 
demonstrations and calls by an opposition coalition that avril 
relinquish power 
the army source said the main problem facing the high command 
was how to handle possible resistance among the 1000member 
presidential guard many of whom are hostile to the idea of 
democratic government 
a palace source said however that the guards would not resist 
the transfer of power the source also spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
if avril steps down it will be the fifth change in leadership 
in haiti since 1986 when president jeanclaude duvalier fled the 
impoverished country during widespread protests ending a 29year 
family dictatorship 
the idea of setting up a civilian council headed by the supreme 
courts vice president gabriel volcy was proposed last week by 
the unity assembly an umbrella group of 11 opposition political 
parties and a civic organization the council is to prepare for 
legitimate elections 
on friday night the unity assembly issued a statement calling 
for an unlimited total paralysis of the country if avril didnt 
resign by monday 
also friday troops fired on 250 student demonstrators in 
portauprince and three protesters were reported wounded 
state television said avril met with his army high command and 
with church leaders about bringing peace to haiti 
a us embassy diplomat said the united states was not involved 
in negotiations with avril but added without elaboration that the 
talks were expected to be successful 
we are keeping in touch with them but we are in no way 
involved with negotiations we are not putting together a deal it 
is up to haitians to decide if theres to be a change in 
government the diplomat said on condition of anonymity 
avril who came to power in a soldiers revolt in september 
1988 promised political reform and elections after taking power 
but he exiled seven opposition activists and arrested scores of 
people in a crackdown in january avril scheduled general elections 
this year but most parties refuse to participate saying they 
dont trust him to give up power 
the latest round of mass protests in haiti began monday after 
troops killed an 11yearold girl studying on her porch 
on friday witnesses and radio reports said soldiers opened fire 
on about 250 students protesting at the state university wounding 
three three people were killed thursday including a soldier beat 
to death by an angry mob 
demonstrations also broke out friday in the outskirts of 
portauprince and continued until sundown with protesters putting 
up flaming tire barricades and soldiers shooting in the air to 
break up crowds 
in the heart of portauprince groups of heavily armed soldiers 
guarded the national palace and two manned antiaircraft guns were 
positioned on the palaces front lawn 
the capital of 1 million usually teeming with people on weekend 
nights was deserted friday night and early today 
the remnants of smoldering tire barricades remained in many 
intersections and there was sporadic gunfire heard around the 
palace

a journalist for a british newspaper has been 
sentenced to death in iraq for alleged espionage and a british 
nurse has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for allegedly 
helping him the foreign office said today 
farzad bazoft a 31yearold stateless iranian exile who travels 
with british documents and works for londons weekly observer 
newspaper was arrested in september while investigating reports of 
an explosion at an iraqi military plant nurse daphne parish 52 
was accused of helping him by driving him to the plant 
an iraqi who was in contact with bazoft in baghdad was also 
given a 10year sentence for communicating government secrets to a 
foreigner the foreign office said 
bazoft and mrs parish went on trial thursday in a revolutionary 
court charged with committing hostile acts against iraq the 
iraqi identified only as rahim was tried with them 
the proceedings which were not open to the public adjourned 
after five hours and the foreign office said it received a report 
by telephone this morning of the sentences 
under iraqi law no appeal is allowed 
we utterly deplore these harsh and excessive sentences a 
foreign office statement said 
iraqs ambassador to britain dr azmi shafiq alsalihi was 
being summoned to the foreign office to hear the governments 
utter dismay and an appeal for clemency was being made to 
iraqs president saddam hussein the foreign office said 
no evidence was produced at the trial which would justify 
sentences of this severity the foreign office said they come 
ill from a regime which is trying to show a more liberal face to 
the world 
in november bazoft appeared on iraqi state television and said 
he had been spying for israel mrs parish a senior nursing 
administrator for the irishrun ibn albitar hospital in baghdad 
did not appear in the broadcast 
observer editor donald trelford said the paper was certain that 
bazoft was not spying for anyone he said the statement must have 
been made under duress and noted that bazoft appeared to be in poor 
physical shape 
trelford said today that although bazoft said at his trial that 
the tv confession was made under duress it was admitted as 
evidence nonetheless 
the sentences are barbaric and unjust trelford said our 
first objective is to have the death sentence lifted prior to their 
release and return to britain 
trelford said bazoft had sought official permission to visit the 
aliskandaria military complex south of baghdad had told the paper 
of his movements and had talked openly about the visit to 
colleagues on his return to baghdad 
none of this conduct is consistent with espionage it is 
entirely consistent with journalism he said 
trelford said iraq refused to allow a british lawyer to attend 
the trial or the observer to be represented 
as bazoft is an iranian the foreign office said it was not in 
the same position to argue on his behalf as it was for mrs parish 
who is britishborn but it said it was appealing on bazofts 
behalf for humanitarian reasons and because he lived in britain for 
years 
britain has brought up the case with every prominent iraqi 
minister or official who has visited london in the past few months 
the foreign office said 
it said it had also complained to iraq about shortcomings in 
the treatment of the two particularly the denial of consular 
access to mrs parish for almost three months 
the explosion at a military complex was reported in london to 
have killed up to 700 people but the iraqis later said 19 people 
were killed in a fuel depot blast

of the plant the united states says is producing poison gas the 
official libyan news agency reported today 
libyas people will stand as a shield to protect the rabta 
pharmaceutical factory the jana news agency quoted the general 
poeples congress as saying

denounced chemical weapons saying the libyans are against all 
types of weapons of mass destruction including nuclear 
bacteriological and chemical ones 
the congress made up of representatives from local grassroots 
governing committees throughout the north african nation and 
roughly the equivalent of a parliament met friday night in 
tripoli the libyan capital jana said 
the white house has charged that the plant at rabta 65 miles 
southwest of tripoli is apparently producing poison gas other 
us officials said the plant was making some mustard gas and nerve 
agents 
libyans made similar vows early last year following the first 
round of us accusations that the facility was gearing up to 
produce chemical weapons 
the congress reiterated previous libyan statements that the 
country supports international inspection provided that controls 
are universally applied jana said 
last year col moammar gadhafis government offered to open the 
plant to inspection provided the united states also lets its 
facilities be inspected gadhafi has insisted the plant was built 
to produce pharmacueticals 
in 1987 libya was accused of using poison gas against chad

vice president dan quayle turned to 
economic and trade talks in a meeting today with leaders of 
caribbean nations as he continued his weeklong trip to shore up 
american relations in latin america 
quayle arrived friday in barbados after discussions in venezuela 
on the prospects of moving the nicaraguan contra rebels from their 
honduran border camps to enclaves within nicaragua as an interim 
step in demobilization 
quayle also discussed central america with barbados prime 
minister lloyd erskine sandiford and he was briefing the leaders 
of five other caribbean nations on his talks with venezuelan 
president carlos andres perez and spanish prime minister felipe 
gonzalez who also was in venezuela 
the meeting today held against a backdrop of palm trees and an 
ocean view at the official residence of the american charges 
daffaires included sandiford and the leaders from barbados 
dominica st vincent and the grenadines st kitts st lucia and 
antigua 
quayle said he promised sandiford on friday that he would pursue 
a resolution to the very important subject involving a 
usbarbados taxation agreement 
the issue centers on us taxes on american insurance and 
banking companies that lose incentive to locate in barbados unless 
they can escape those taxes 
quayle was flying later today to santiago chile where he and 
his wife marilyn will represent the united states at the 
inauguration sunday of presidentelect patricio aylwin 
on the first day of his weeklong trip to barbados and south 
america the vice president was pressed by perez and gonzalez on 
the need for rapid disbandment of the usbuilt contra army 
they were pressing very hard for very early disbandment 
said sen edward kennedy dmass who is accompanying quayle to 
chile and who sat in on the meetings friday 
kennedy said he agrees the contras should be demobilized 
immediately regardless of the bush administrations insistence 
that their security must be assured for reintegrating into 
nicaragua 
one official traveling with quayle indicated the administration 
is leaning to the idea of interim relocation in designated areas 
united nations peacekeeping troops would insure order under that 
scenario making sure there were no clashes between the contras and 
members of the nicaraguan army which is still controlled by the 
outgoing leftist sandinista government 
that might be a way station to disarmament the official 
said when asked whether the administration envisions having the 
contras keep their weapons in such camps the official spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the official reiterated that the administration wants the 
contras to disband before violeta chamorro the usbacked 
candidate who defeated sandinista president daniel ortega in the 
feb 25 election takes office april 25 
he said the united states expects at the same time however 
that the sandinistas will submit to a peaceful transfer of power 
including relinquishing control of the 70000man army 
but quayle later said in barbados im not saying everything 
will be accomplished by the 25th of april we hope to accomplish a 
lot by then i dont believe its important to focus on whether 
its the 25th or the 26th i think its important to focus on the 
concept and the goal of having the new government succeed 
quayles discussions in venezuela focused almost entirely on how 
to ensure a peaceful transfer of power in nicaragua after a decade 
of marxist rule 
quayle said the administration will announce next week its aid 
package to help get the countrys desperate economy moving again 
the package will weigh heavily on agricultural assistance 
because nicaragua is largely agrarian and will include trade 
assistance as well said the official traveling with quayle

after the speakers had finished wrestling with the 
subject of their symposium germany in the 1990s jewish hopes 
and fears an old whitehaired man in the audience struggled to 
his feet 
everybody says reunification of germany is unavoidable but is 
everybody really happy about this forthcoming reunification he 
said i a refugee from vienna in 1939 am not and i suspect 
that there must be many people here who equally are not happy 
his remarks encapsulated the unease and helplessness felt by 
many western european jews although clearly not all at the 
prospect of a united germany 
it is happening too soon it is happening too fast said 
claude lanzmann the frenchman who made the epic holocaust 
documentary shoah 
germany is a special country he said in a telephone 
interview from paris one cannot guess now what this new germany 
will be what the contradictions and the tensions will be inside 
this country the new german nationalism will have in my opinion 
a very strong revival 
nobody can say calmly today that this new germany will behave 
like the former federal republic of west germany lanzmann said 
the london symposiums audience consisted mostly of elderly jews 
holocaust survivors refugees people who had achieved peace and 
prosperity in britain but were still sufficiently preoccupied with 
the nazi past to crowd into a basement auditorium and air their 
fears 
reassurances that there could never be another hitler were 
coupled with vaguely expressed fears for the future a man spoke of 
this feeling of impotence in the face of a german giant risen 
again 
like a dark backdrop to the proceedings lay the fears jews feel 
about reawakened antisemitism in the soviet union and in eastern 
and central europe 
no matter what the structure will be at this moment as jews 
as people who have often experienced germany at its worst we have 
great fears that cannot be easily laid aside said albert 
friedlander a london rabbi and holocaust survivor 
there were moments when the panel of rabbis and scholars seemed 
sharply at odds with the audience 
when a speaker professor geoffrey alderman remarked that 
germany was not wholly responsible for the two world wars there 
were angry mutterings of nonsense and rubbish 
friedlander said he was more worried about french antisemitism 
than about a reunited germany alderman declared that some remarks 
he had heard privately from orthodox jews about germany quite 
frankly strike me as racist 
in a letter last month to rabbi marvin hier of los angeles who 
demanded measures by a united germany to preserve the memory of the 
holocaust chancellor helmut kohl of west germany sounded aggrieved 
he listed the many measures already taken and said to my 
mind there is no doubt that these provisions will also apply in a 
united germany this certainly does not require any special 
demand 
european jews readily acknowledge west germanys record of 
liberal democracy and support for israel they also are gratified 
by east germanys apparent newfound readiness to share the blame 
for the nazi era and make amends to the jews 
i dont think a democratic german state will represent any 
danger for jews or israel said leo eitinger a czechoslovak 
survivor of the holocaust who is a psychiatrist in norway 
jean bloch a belgian jew who experienced the hitler era noted 
the conditions that spawned nazism economic crisis and national 
humiliation do not exist now 
we must be careful not to stir the same feeling of humiliation 
by opposing unification he said 
ronnie naftaniel a spokesman for dutch jewry said the fact 
that israel is on the map makes jews everywhere sleep better 
many jews when asked admit to an instinctive anxiety it is 
shared by many nonjews in europe but for jews it is compounded by 
memories of the holocaust that stripped them down to tiny 
minorities in many european countries 
an oftheard remark laced with bitterness is that if theres 
no antisemitism in germany it must because so few jews are left 
there about 41500 compared to 560000 before world war ii 
the germans always were unpredictable said simon 
wiesenthal the nazi hunter they become foolhardy as soon as 
they feel strong they have to be careful not to repeat mistakes 
alderman told the london symposium that to orthodox jews the 
division of germany was not just a product of the cold war but a 
punishment visited by the almighty upon the germans for their 
unspeakable crimes toward the jews 
now that the division is ending he said the jewish people 
will have to take stock again of their attitude toward germany 
one sensitive theme is the fear that unification will embolden 
germans to shrug off their awareness of the holocaust 
professor peter pulzer a refugee from vienna now at oxford 
university worries that once germany is united a lot of 
germans who arent racists or neonazis may say ok thats over 
weve drawn a line underneath the nasty bits 
if one reason for dividing germany was its nazi past lanzmann 
said today this seems to be if not forgotten left aside it 
has become unimportant in a way 
fears seem most acute among the generation old enough to 
remember nazi germany shalom an italian jewish monthly surveyed 
opinion and concluded in general optimism prevails among the 
young and pessimism among those less young 
most jews acknowledge there is nothing they can do to stop 
unification what we must avoid at all costs is nostalgia 
for the old cold war order said alain finkielkraut a french 
jewish intellectual 
lord jakobovits chief rabbi of britain has been quoted as 
calling for a chair for a jewish spokesman at an international 
conference on the shape of a new germany other jews say the jews 
could never agree who should represent them 
we hope that jewish victims of the holocaust will have their 
say in laying down rules and laws forbidding exclusion 
discrimination racism and antisemitism of any kind said jean 
kahn head of the representative council of french jewish 
organizations 
the european jewish congress meeting last month in brussels 
said the jewish communities of europe which suffered so much 
under the third reich must express their preoccupations about a 
reunited germany it said germany should recognize now and 
forever its collective responsibility for the holocaust and its

here are some quotations from european jews who 
have reacted in speeches interviews and articles to the prospect 
of german reunification 
it is happening too soon it is happening too fast claude 
lanzmann french filmmaker who made the holocaust documentary 
shoah 
amongst religious jews there has been for a long time a 
feeling toward germany and toward germans which is almost 
apocalyptic in its implications that is to say that the division 
of germany was somehow visited by the almighty upon the germans for 
their unspeakable crimes toward the jews and that that division is 
a symbol of divine wrath that division is now coming to an end 
and the jewish people will have to take stock again of their 
attitude toward germany geoffrey alderman british university 
professor 
it would be unwise to oppose unification on the contrary we 
must welcome it with good will as a deep desire of the german 
people but we must get assurances that the new german generation 
will respect all human values and any minority albert guigui 
belgian chief rabbi 
you cannot argue from the past if we were to argue from the 
past we would have to say that the major danger we perceive is 
that the french will get to moscow again as napoleon did lord 
beloff british historian 
the germans always were unpredictable they become foolhardy 
as soon as they feel strong they have to be careful not to repeat 
mistakes simon wiesenthal nazi hunter based in vienna 
the germans dont think any more about us my feeling is that 
the great majority of german people have other things on their 
minds fiamma nirenstein italian journalist 
the fact that israel is on the map makes jews everywhere sleep 
better ronnie naftaniel a spokesman for dutch jewry

on the brink of its finale the trial 
of joseph hazelwood has become a battle of expert highpriced 
witnesses trying to unravel the tangled tale of the exxon valdez 
skippers seamanship 
prosecutors spent more than 140000 to hire five experts the 
defense will spend perhaps half that on more experts to give 
opinions on how well the skipper performed his job 
you cant build a case totally on experts said thomas 
russo one of hazelwoods lawyers but in any case where the 
issues are not within common knowledge experts are useful to 
explain things to jurors 
russo said the defense has tried to use experts less likely to 
confuse or intimidate jurors sea captains who sail a naval 
architect who builds ships and a computer expert who had never 
before testified in a court 
prosecutors appeared to go for impressive credentials 
their toxicologist dr richard prouty spent more than an hour 
reciting his qualifications before venturing the opinion that 
hazelwood probably was drunk on the crucial night he said he has 
testified more than 1000 times 
the case with its discussions of rudder angles and nautical 
miles fathom markers and buoyancy soundings and engine thrust 
has not been easy for a nonmariner to understand 
for weeks the courtroom of superior court judge karl johnstone 
has been littered with huge nautical charts and diagrams tracking 
the exxon valdez on its disastrous voyage through the valdez 
narrows into prince william sound 
there is a detailed beautifully painted color mockup of the 
987foot tanker that would be the envy of amateur model makers 
expert witnesses carry it around and point out its features to the 
jury another pullapart model shows the ships bridge lift off 
the top and you can look down to the deck where the skipper sat in 
his cabin during the grounding on march 24 
it was just after midnight when the fully loaded tanker struck 
bligh reef spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the clear 
waters of scenic prince william sound the spill largest in us 
history devastated the areas rich fisheries and wildlife and 
fouled hundreds of miles of rocky shore 
was it an accident or a crime that question underlies five 
weeks of testimony the jurys answer is likely to have 
repercussions beyond the fairly mild charges against hazelwood 
civil suits abound and federal criminal charges have been filed 
against exxon 
hazelwood 43 from huntington ny is accused of one felony 
criminal mischief and three misdemanors reckless endangerment 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil 
the trial began with testimony from those who saw hazelwood in 
the port town of valdez on the day the ship sailed crew members 
who accompanied him and officers who carried out the ships 
carefully organized functions coast guard officers and a state 
trooper related their investigations 
then assistant district attorney brent cole brought on his 
experts 
george greiner jr a retired coast guardsman with a consulting 
firm said he figured hazelwood had tried to move his stranded ship 
off the reef after the grounding risking capsizing and killing the 
crew the defense elicited his statement that the exxon valdez was 
so deeply impaled that it could not have moved 
robert beevers a retired tanker captain told jurors everything 
that hazelwood did was reckless william milwee jr a salvage 
expert said the exxon valdez could have capsized and sunk 
on the crucial question of whether hazelwood was drunk the 
state presented prouty who calculated backwards to conclude 
hazelwood probably was drunk 
he conceded there is dispute on his technique among scientists 
the defense is expected to offer an alcohol expert this week 
the defense has called a naval architect edward hoffman to say 
the ship would not have sunk even if dislodged from the reef they 
brought in computer whiz peter shizume who simulated the voyage and 
found a simple rudder turn by the helmsman would have saved the 
ship 
a marine surveyor joseph winer analyzed charts to support the 
conclusions when court recessed for the weekend a former tanker 
captain shiras walker had declared hazelwood was not reckless 
i would have done exactly what captain hazelwood did he 
said walker faces crossexamination on monday

a redviolet eclectus parrot a greenwing macaw 
and an ostrichlike emu are among the missing victims in a rash of 
40 exotic birds thefts in the miami area over the past five months 
the popularity of the valuable tropical birds and federal limits 
on imports have combined to produce a profitable black market in 
birds ron magill assistant to the curator at miamis metrozoo 
said friday 
you see these birds that are stolen being sold everywhere from 
classified advertising to flea markets he said i wouldnt be 
surprised from whats going on now that some of these birds arent 
sold before theyre stolen 
the 9yearold zoo lost a female eclectus parrot valued at more 
than 1000 to someone who ducked into a screened breeding cage two 
weeks ago while the staff member on duty was gone for about 20 
minutes 
the only other time that i know of that we had a theft of an 
animal at metrozoo since we opened was about five years ago at the 
bird show area said magill 
but the law of supply and demand is at work even at the 
criminal level 
the population of these birds in the wild is becoming so 
depleted that federal regulations are making it extremely difficult 
to import them therefore the price is becoming very high on these 
birds he said whats happening now is people are starting to 
steal from the private owners and collectors in this country 
warren and jude werner stars of their gold coast mime co used 
a macaw named miami beak in their act until the 3000 bird was 
stolen from their miami beach home march 3 
these were people who knew birds werner said they didnt 
take anything but the bird 
susan boyd president of the miami parrot club improved 
security after two blind eclectus parrots two lovebirds and a 
cockatoo were taken from her home feb 21 two days later 
birdnappers struck again this time making off another cockatoo and 
a blue and gold macaw 
bird dealer joe wasilewski of natural selections lost four birds 
in a breakin at his warehouse dec 27 but recovered three in a 
police sting that resulted in two arrests but he still misses the 
fourth bird a 7yearold african gray named lola african grays 
are considered the best talkers or mimics among parrots 
she used to talk and sing and whistle and drive around with 
me he said its part of my family 
victims suspect a ring is behind the spate of thefts dating back 
to late october wasilewski said 
if you dont have the training to handle them youre going to 
get bit he said they have to have training to steal all the 
wide variety that they are

legend has it that rembrandt once bet he could 
prepare an etching of the dutch countryside before a friends 
servant could fetch mustard from a nearby village 
rembrandt won the wager according to the frenchman responsible 
for the tale although it was not said how long the waiter took to 
run his errand the old masters spontaneous touch with a normally 
slow and painstaking medium is known and the results can be seen 
sunday through may 20 at washingtons national gallery of art 
the etching sixs bridge is part of the first major 
exhibit devoted to rembrandts landscape prints and drawings the 
etching shows a canal two boats two bushes a church a bridge 
and two men standing on it all on a plate 5 inches by 10 inches 
rembrandt is better known for his oil paintings but only eight 
of his surviving oils are landscapes largely scattered among 
european museums they are not among the 99 works in this exhibit 
though one of them can be seen in another part of the gallery 
etching can be one of the most difficult timeconsuming 
processes lending itself to tightly controlled highly detailed 
works 
the works are begun on metal plates coated with a soft wax 
formula the artist cuts through the mixture with a needle so that 
acid can bite into the resulting scratches on the plate from which 
the etching is later printed rembrandt took prepared plates with 
him during his long walks around the city 
because of its selfimposed narrow scope the exhibit contains 
much of rembrandts most intimate work homely scenes that roused 
his personal interest boats bridges churches towers cottages 
a man rowing a boat and an artist sketching by the road 
this is the story told by edme francois gersaint who made the 
first catalogue of rembrandts works more than 80 years after the 
artist died in 1669 
one overcast day in the year 1645 rembrandt sat down to lunch at 
the country house of his friend jan six later mayor of amsterdam 
when they made a discovery there was no mustard six sent a 
servant to the village 
rembrandt knew how slow servants usually are in his country 
when they reply anstons which means right away they take at 
least half an hour to appear wrote gersaint in one of the few 
stories about the artist 
so rembrandt made the bet 
art history professor cynthia p schneider of georgetown 
university calls the story apocryphal but she added in the 
catalogue for this exhibit that the work was a miracle of artistic 
economy 
the swift and spare strokes of the etching have all the 
freedom of a sketch from life she said 
she also pointed out that it is done from a low viewpoint as if 
the artist were sitting on the ground gersaint said it was the 
scene from the window of the room the two men were in 
a dutch scholar has claimed to identify the church and sixs 
property along the amstel river in the suburbs of amsterdam then 
it was called kleinkostverloren little moneylost how much 
was the bet are those the two friends on the bridge 
the show will not travel elsewhere after closing in washington 
roger mandle the gallerys deputy director said he expected large 
crowds but did not intend to use a ticket system unless they get 
too big for comfortable viewing

abortionrights advocates can expect to have 
at least three new allies in congress next year according to a 
survey of candidates running in 79 key house and senate races 
the survey by congressional quarterly magazine also found the 
abortion issue is causing internal conflicts among party members in 
both democratic and republican primaries 
the magazine found many candidates are trying to stake out 
positions somewhere between prochoice and prolife 
in at least three cases the magazine reported antiabortion 
incumbents are retiring and all the candidates running to succeed 
them favor abortion rights 
the races are for the senate seat from colorado being vacated by 
republican sen william armstrong the house seat held by retiring 
rep wes watkins dokla and the new york seat vacated by 
republican rep guy molinari who resigned to become borough 
president for staten island 
the survey focused on open seats and close contests for 16 
senate and 63 house seats it found 23 races in which 
abortionrights democrats face antiabortion republicans 
but it also found the issue is not purely partisan 
in 15 contests the leading candidates of both parties support 
abortion rights in 14 races both oppose abortion 
democratic candidates disagreed on abortion in 10 of the 
primary races surveyed while republicans disagreed among 
themselves in 12 primary contests 
in at least one competitive house race an antiabortion 
democrat faces a prochoice republican the democrat is rep george 
sangmeister of illinois his opponent is insurance broker manny 
hoffman 
congressional quarterly said its survey found many candidates 
are trying to find a middle position that will appeal to voters not 
allied with either side in the abortion debate 
in nine of the 14 races that involve only abortion opponents 
the magazine said at least one candidate supports federal funding 
of abortions for poor women in cases of rape or incest it said 
many prochoice candidates meanwhile are wary of opposing 
parental involvement in abortion decisions by minors 
cq a weekly publication about congress conducted its telephone 
survey between feb 16 and march 8 some candidates positions may 
have changed since then the authors said

the son of nationalist chinese leader 
chiang kaishek withdrew his candidacy saturday for vice president 
in a contest that had threatened an unprecedented split in the 
governing party 
chiang wego pulled out of the race a day after his running mate 
popular judicial chief lin yangkang decided against challenging 
president lee tenghui in the presidential election march 21 
i will follow the steps of mr lin yangkang chiang 73 
told reporters 
the nationalist partys 180member central committee unanimously 
backed lees candidacy for a sixyear presidential term last month 
but lee 67 angered elderly party members when he rejected their 
choice of chiang as his running mate and instead selected 
presidential adviser li yuanzu 66 
the elderly party members retaliated by endorsing lin 62 and 
chiang as a rival team to contest the election 
taiwans 752seat national assembly which will elect the 
president is dominated by the elderly legislators they fled to 
taiwan in 1949 when the nationalists lost a civil war on the 
chinese mainland to communist forces 
the elders have been frozen in office to support the nationalist 
claim of being the legitimate government of all china they are 
concerned that lees pragmatic policies toward the rival communist 
government will weaken their dream to reunify china under 
nationalist rule 
lee is the first native taiwanese to head the nationalist 
government he was elevated to the post from the vice presidency in 
1988 when president chiang chingkuo died 
chiang wego a retired general and chiang chingkuos half 
brother is viewed by many of the older assemblymen as the defender 
of their nationalistic ambitions he is the sole surviving son of 
chinese leader chiang kaishek 
he said earlier that he would not actively campaign for the vice 
presidency but would not discourage the electoral college from 
supporting him 
his stand has been criticized most recently on friday when his 
nephew chiang hsiaowu accused him of wanting to be elected but 
claiming he would not campaign 
chiang hsiaowu the son of chiang chingkuo is head of 
taiwans unofficial diplomatic mission in japan 
the opposition democratic progressive party has accused chiang 
wego of using his influence with taiwans military to block native 
taiwanese from gaining power in the government 
the democratic progressive party formed three years ago by 
taiwanese does not have enough members in the national assembly to 
nominate its own candidate for president

the united states led the way last year as 
central banks around the world raised their holdings of foreign 
currency to a record 768 billion the international monetary fund 
reported 
the holdings reflect efforts by industrialized countries to 
influence trade through international exchange rates and by third 
world countries to stockpile cash for emergencies last years 
worldwide level was 726 billion 
the holdings do not include gold 
the largest increase was in total us holdings of foreign 
currency especially west german marks and japanese yen imf said 
in its march compilation of international financial statistics 
total us holdings at the end of 1989 were valued at 633 
billion up from 369 billion in 1988 imf reported japan held 
837 billion worth of reserves down from 97 billion at the end 
of 1988 
the united states and japan were both trying to keep the price 
of the dollar low so that the united states could sell more goods 
and japan and others would buy more said robert solomon of the 
brookings institution a private policy studies group 
so the united states sold a lot of dollars to push the price 
down and got a lot of yen and marks in return 
solomon is a former adviser to the board of governors of the 
federal reserve system the american central bank 
the japanese were trying to buy more american goods so they 
sold some of their dollars to push the price down solomon 
explained 
a lower price for the dollar makes american goods cheaper and 
more attractive to japanese when the dollar is cheaper the yen is 
more expensive that makes japanese goods less attractive to 
americans 
both effects tend to lower the us deficit in world trade 
which dropped to 1086 billion in 1989 that deficit was still a 
major world problem though it was down by more than 10 billion 
from the year before 
like other market operations government buying and selling of 
currencies does not always work as well as intended japanese 
authorities have been complaining that the dollar has risen lately 
despite the intervention it rose once again on friday to more 
than 151 yen and 17 marks 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady and finance ministers of 
six other major industrial countries have just called a meeting in 
paris for april 7 ups and downs of the dollar and other currencies 
will be a major topic 
in most of the third world reserves are an insurance against a 
rainy day when a country needs to buy more goods abroad than it can 
earn by selling its own products 
reserves rose for 130 third world countries to a record 267 
billion the fund reported

will be enforced 
our problems havent been with the college kids said 
daytona police chief paul crow contrary to public perceptions 
crow said about 65 percent of those arrested last year were 
florida youths many underage high schoolers the task force is 
doing its best to uninvite high schoolers who skip classes and 
try to participate in activities designed for collegeage students 
as a result the names of rock groups giving spring break

hoped florendos death will shock us into reality and do some 
soul searching in order to gain the determination to unite for 
peace

seattle archbishop raymond hunthausen has 
canceled plans to train more deacons until the role of women in the 
roman catholic church is addressed more thoroughly 
women are not allowed to be deacons 
many women and men told us that the church didnt seem to 
respect the personhood of women that the church was patriarchal 
and unappreciative of womens gifts said hunthausen who with 
coadjutor archbishop thomas murphy is helping the us catholic 
bishops to write a pastoral letter women in society and the 
church 
some priests deacons and lay catholics praised the archbishops 
decision in calling attention to womens role in the church but 
others said they thought it would have no effect other than slowing 
the flow of deacons into parishes 
deacons perform considerable work in some parishes such as 
administering the sacraments of baptism and marriage

former president richard nixon was making his 
first visit to the house since being driven from office by the 
watergate scandal when rep newt gingrich learned that his own 
ethics cloud had evaporated 
gingrich secondranking republican in the house said it was 
during nixons hourlong meeting thursday with gop members of 
congress that he was handed the letter ending 11 psychologically 
difficult months 
the letter said the committee had dismissed ethics complaints 
brought by rep bill alexander dark against the georgia 
lawmaker after he had caused the investigation that led to the 
resignation of former speaker jim wright dtexas 
the committee however criticized gingrich for not reporting on 
his annual financial disclosure forms that he had cosigned the 
mortgage on his daughters home it also criticized gingrich for 
his staffs use of official letterhead to promote a private 
companys senior citizens cruise 
but on each of alexanders major allegations of misconduct the 
committee said it found that no adequate basis existed to 
launch a fullscale ethics investigation 
most of the allegations focused on a partnership gingrich 
created in 1984 to promote a book he helped write window of 
opportunity alexander contended gingrich had violated house 
rules on gifts and outside income as well as federal campaign 
finance laws with the partnership and book deal 
the committees letter capped gingrichs meteoric rise in less 
than two years from a backbench republican firebrand to the 
leading contender to replace 67yearold republican leader bob 
michel when he retires 
along the way gingrichs tactics made him the target of choice 
for house democrats 
gingrich compiled lists of democrats he claimed should be 
investigated he traveled the country denouncing house democratic 
corruption and he filed the complaint that led the ethics 
committee to charge wright with 69 violations of house rules 
including charges that he accepted 145000 in gifts from a fort 
worth texas business executive 
as the ethics investigation grew more serious for wright house 
republicans rewarded gingrich by electing him whip last year when 
dick cheney left the job to become secretary of defense democrats 
vowed revenge when wright decided to resign last june 
theres no question democrats were mad as hell and wanted to 
pin him to the wall after wright was forced from office said 
thomas mann a congressional scholar at the brookings institution 
but mann said gingrich benefited both from the changed 
atmosphere in the house since wrights resignation and from the 
apparent weakness of the charges 
politically motivated charges arent going to go anywhere 
unless theres something really there to begin with and unless the 
overall atmosphere that made it possible remains the same he 
said 
when he resigned wright called for an end to mindless 
cannibalism and the new democratic leadership team moved to 
reduce the partisan tone in the house 
but gingrich said hes convinced the committee would have 
reached the same conclusion in his case anyway 
on item after item after item they said there is no grounds 
for these charges gingrich said so my presumption is that 
even in a more intensely partisan environment the truth beats 
passion in the end 
with the ethics case resolved in gingrichs favor mann 
predicted democrats likely will reorient their campaign but not 
abandon it 
they still want to get him but i think it will switch from 
ethics and legal wars to political wars he said

liz taylor roberto duran and a pack of 
marauding mussels all came to congress this past week in one form 
or another 
if you thought your representatives spent all week on such 
weighty matters as aid for eastern europe and the clean air bill 
think again 
most members of congress devote only a small portion of their 
days to such pursuits just as many hours and usually many more 
are spent on keeping constituents happy getting ones picture or 
name mentioned in the hometown or national press attending 
receptions and lavishing praise on colleagues and witnesses 
a typical twohour congressional hearing for example will 
devote 20 minutes or so to rituals of accolade the democratic 
chairman of the committee praises a colleague for helping prepare 
the session the ranking republican praises the chairman for 
holding the hearing the members praise the witness an 
administration official or specialist of some sort for his or her 
work on the subject and so on 
with some 250 committees and subcommittees in congress the 100 
senate members and their 435 colleagues in the house are busy 
people most sit on three or four committees which is where most 
congressional action is taken 
except during floor votes the main chambers of the house and 
senate are virtually empty with only a speaker on the podium and a 
stray clerk or usher in the aisles 
more often than not lawmakers will stay away from a plenary 
session to make time for a meeting with constituents visiting 
washington after all these are the people who will get them 
reelected 
on a recent day rep dave mccurdys schedule had 15 constituent 
visits aides to the oklahoma democrat say this is an unusally 
heavy load although not rare 
mccurdy and his colleagues also have to travel to their home 
districts periodically to meet with voters and tend to local 
business last year mccurdy flew home 11 times 
no wonder then that much of the work on capitol hill gets 
accomplished by staff members rather than by the lawmakers 
themselves most members have a staff of about 20 although some 
especially if they chair influential committees have double that 
in all congress employs about 20000 people including security 
police cleaners and clerks 
while visits by foreign visitors presidents prime ministers 
and the like usually get bigger headlines american celebrities 
are often a much bigger draw at the capitol itself 
elizabeth taylor came to capitol hill to lobby for a bill that 
would give 600 million to aids sufferers 
although congress has been discussing the proposed bill for 
weeks miss taylors appearance at a hearing and a news conference 
drew dozens of lawmakers eager to shake her hand or stare into her 
famous violet eyes 
it took elizabeth taylor to get you to one of my hearings 
the panels chairman california rep barbara boxer admonished her 
democratic colleague from illinois richard durbin 
dante fascell chairman of the house foreign affairs committee 
made time last week for boxer roberto duran the former 
welterweight champion came to congress to seek aid for his native 
panama food for hungry children and housing for panamanians left 
homeless by the us invasion last december 
and then there were the marauding mollusks 
reporters on capitol hill sifting through their mail boxes 
pulled out a plastic bag stuffed with mussel shells appended to a 
press release 
sen john glenn and rep henry nowak today proposed a 40 
million plan to control the zebra mussel the small shellfish 
attacking water intake pipes and creating environmental problems in 
the great lakes the release said 
glenn was joined at a news conference by seven lawmakers 
battling the spread of the mollusks which reached the great lakes 
by stowing away on freighters from europe 
i can tell you its no joke glenn said

a recall election on tuesday the second time 
in a month residents will cast ballots is shaping up as a battle 
between oldtimers who favor slow growth and newcomers who say 
development is vital to the economy 
voters must decide whether to recall fourterm mayor bill 
stirling and three other city councilmen steve crockett frank 
peters and michael gassman 
their critics say the four run a confrontational and 
unprofessional government and have done little to solve pressing 
housing and traffic problems also they have been accused of being 
rude to constituents and promoting favorite causes as in 
stirlings widely publicized campaign to ban fur sales which 
failed in an election feb 13 
the four members of the fivemember council drew the ire of many 
when they opposed a largescale ritzcarlton hotel at the base of 
aspen mountain 
residents voted 60 percent to 40 percent in february to let 
developer mohamed hadid build a 292room 66foottall 70 million 
luxury hotel stirling and his supporters on the council wanted to 
scale back the hotels size by 25 percent and down to 44 feet high 
the slowgrowth advocates who have dominated city and county 
politics for decades fear they are becoming suddenly unfashionable 
voter approval of the hotel was a real big departure an 
aberration said michael kinsley a pitkin county commissioner 
from 1975 to 1985 for the last several years nobody has been 
elected to office who explicitly favored growth and this election 
approved a major hotel 
kinsley who had favored the scaledback hotel plan attributed 
the vote to intensive lobbying and campaign spending by hadid 
the strongest supporters of the hotel came from more recent 
arrivals to aspen from the wealthy and from people who call 
themselves moderates or conservatives according to an aspen times 
daily exit poll feb 13 about 70 percent of the towns 3700 
registered voters turned out for that election 
supporters of the larger hotel plan say voters simply recognized 
the reality that aspen has become a worldclass resort 
this towns 15 years behind the times as far as 
accommodations said don kopf 61 a contractor who passes out 
recall buttons 
he believes the city council has failed to direct growth and has 
let the housing problem reach crisis dimensions government 
should be run like a business not like a fraternity he said 
kopf accuses those in power of trying to close the door on 
future development its an attitude that ive got mine you 
cant have yours 
carol craig an aspenite for 34 years and a volunteer at the 
thrift shop opposed both the larger hotel and a measure approved 
by voters to widen and straighten highway 82 into town she says 
the roads should be closed to cars entirely 
that would preserve the essence of aspen she says people 
come here for the beauty and the security of the place 
in the recall election voters will vote first on whether to 
recall each councilman then may vote on a candidate to replace him 
stirlings post is being sought by wainwright dawson 54 a 
management consultant and former stirling aide and terry butler 
who lost to stirling in last years mayoral race 
rick head margot pendleton augie reno and ward hauenstein seek 
to serve the remaining three years of crocketts and peters terms 
marcia goshorn is running to replace gassman whose term is up this 
fall 
of the four subjected to a recall crockett is considered the 
most vulnerable critics say he made fun of a speaker at a city 
council meeting he also was accused of calling tourists 
parasites on national television but provided videotape 
disproving that charge his accusers however refuse to apologize 
stirling who departed from his usual laidback style and began 
taking out newspaper ads a month before this election said theres 
a new rancor in aspen than goes beyond the spirited debate that 
always has characterized the town 
pitkin county sheriff bob braudis agrees several issues have 
driven a wedge between 30year friends here theres a 
meanspiritedness thats descended on this little valley here 
thats new to us 
judy gerbaz who manages the thrift shop says shes weary of 
the infighting even the school board meetings in this town are 
wild 
still she takes pride in aspens argumentative and progressive 
spirit 
some say were a laughingstock but i think were educating 
the world

jerusalems mayor saturday blamed recent 
statements by president bush for raising tensions in the city 
which over the weekend experienced some of its worst violence in 
the palestinian uprising 
israeli police shot and killed two palestinians in a refugee 
camp of arab east jerusalem on friday night sparking riots 
saturday 
israeli leaders recently restated their claim to the arab sector 
of jerusalem despite recent us statements that the status of the 
land is in dispute and should be resolved by negotiation 
israel captured east jerusalem and the west bank from jordan and 
the gaza strip from egypt in the 1967 middle east war it has since 
annexed east jerusalem home to 140000 palestinians and has been 
building jewish neighborhoods around the arab enclave to strengthen 
its hold on the land 
both bush and secretary of state james a baker iii said in the 
past 10 days that israels policy of settling jews in the occupied 
lands including east jerusalem was an impediment to peace 
we do not believe there should be new settlements in the west 
bank or east jerusalem bush said at a news conference march 3 
mayor teddy kollek of jerusalem called bushs remarks untimely 
and unjustified 
i feel offended by lack of knowledge about what is going on 
here on part of very important people who are our friends who have 
no idea whats happening the mayor said on israel radio 
he said that on one hand bush supported the unity of the city 
and the right of jews to live there but on the other he referred 
to jewish neighborhoods in east jerusalem as settlements this he 
said is inconsistent with the facts 
kollek also said palestinian frustration over the lack of 
progress in peace efforts was mounting in advance of a debate 
sunday in the inner cabinet the leftleaning labor party and the 
rightwing likud bloc will once again attempt to reach a decision 
on whether to accept us proposals for holding peace talks in 
cairo 
violence erupted friday night in the shufat refugee camp in arab 
east jerusalem the only camp within jerusalems city limits 
residents said police opened fire that night and again saturday 
morning to quell stonethrowing demonstrations 
camp residents and un officials identified the victims as 
mahmud fawzi abu khalife 21 and sufian mohammed abdullah khalil 
25 they said at least two other palestinians were wounded one 
critically 
police spokesman uzi sandori confirmed one dead and two wounded 
he said the man was killed when 40 masked youths charged police 
with iron bars saturday morning about a dozen camp residents were 
detained for questioning he said 
it was some of the worst violence in the city since the uprising 
against israeli rule began in december 1987 
the deaths raised to 662 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli troops or civilians in the uprising forthythree israelis 
also have been killed 
word of the deaths sparked rioting in east jerusalem police 
dispersed students who had overturned a vehicle and hurled stones 
at passing cars sandori said 
later about 400 israeli and palestinian women held a peaceful 
rally along the border where east and west jerusalem meet they 
called on israel to negotiate with the palestine liberation 
organization and halt jewish settlements in occupied lands 
in the gaza strip arab reports said masked assailants killed a 
palestinian man ibrahim elbatnaje with axes and daggers for 
allegedly collaborating with israeli authorities 
his death brought to 195 the number of palestinians slain by 
their fellow arabs on suspicion of collaborating with israel

the government acknowledged saturday 
that civilian casualties in last weeks coup attempt were almost 
four times higher than originally reported 
government spokesman naqib sameer said 70 more bodies of 
civilians were pulled from the rubble of destroyed buildings 
bringing the death toll to 95 president najib orignally said 25 
civilians died during the fighting tuesday and wednesday 
no figures were released saturday for military casualties a 
western military expert estimated hundreds of officers and elite 
commandos died when afghan warplanes bombed the capital causing 
extensive damage to the city of 2 million 
the military also appeared have suffered heavy material losses 
at least 10 jet fighters and 15 tanks were believed destroyed 
government and diplomatic sources said the government has said it 
shot down three rebel planes 
meanwhile eastern european diplomatic sources and one afghan 
government official provided some insight into the failure of the 
coup which was launched tuesday by defense minister shah nawaz 
tanai a hardline communist 
according to their statements forces from the afghan 
intelligence agency surrounded two renegade tank corps late monday 
amid indications a coup might be attempted this prevented critical 
ground suport for tanai when the assault began tuesday 
one corps was bottled up near pulcharki prison on the outskirts 
of kabul and another tank unit was surrounded behind the defense 
ministry only two tanks from the unit near pulcharki broke free 
tuesday they attacked the military university near the prison but 
were soon destroyed the eastern european source said 
the renegades were limited to air strikes on the capital 
although the strikes were bloody and destructive they were not 
enough to unseat najib 
the trapped tanks coupled with the armys use of destructive

barraged by drug questions death penalty 
claims and milliondollar television advertising texas voters go 
to the polls tuesday to cast their primary election ballots for 
governor 
the democratic primary pitting treasurer ann richards 
attorney general jim mattox and former gov mark white is 
especially bitter republican hopefuls are scrambling to hold 
oilman clayton williams under the 50 percent mark he needs to avoid 
an april runoff election 
the races appeared headed toward an alltime state spending 
record for a gubernatorial primary together the top three 
democrats and top four republicans spent 25 million through march 
5 
a dallas morning newshouston chronicle poll conducted last week 
showed the democrats in a dead heat and williams widening his 
already substantial lead over the republican pack 
the poll to be published in the newspapers sunday editions 
showed 28 percent of those surveyed backed ms richards while 
mattox had 25 percent and white garnered 24 percent but the polls 
margin of error of 45 percentage points meant it was too close to 
call 
the democratic race was so contentious that mattox whose own 
slogan was texas tough decried what he called the 
cannibalism of his partys infighting 
ms richards a rising democratic star after her keynote speech 
at the partys 1988 national convention found herself under siege 
from opponents and the news media after repeatedly refusing to say 
whether she ever used illegal drugs 
this question was never raised in the eight years that i was 
managing a portfolio of 4 billion a day it was only when i got in 
the way of these two boys who want to be governor that it came 
up she said 
a recovering alcoholic ms richards said she hadnt used a 
moodaltering chemical in 10 years and she accused both white 
and mattox of profiteering from public service 
theyve got the best resumes money can buy ms richards 
said suggesting that besides a drug test the candidates should 
take liedetector tests as well 
mattox called on her to stop running the downinthegutter 
type of campaign youre running 
white and mattox sparred with each other over the death penalty 
mattox aired television commercials claiming he was responsible 
for the executions of 32 felons 
white governor from 1983 to 1987 responded with an ad that 
showed him walking past giant photos of criminals put to death 
during his tenure saying only a governor can make executions 
happen i did and i will 
the republicans dueled more politely with pundits predicting 
that the colorful and popular claytie will coast to victory 
the question is not will williams fall under 50 percent 
but will he get over 60 said richard murray director of the 
poll for the newspapers by the public policy center at the 
university of houston 
williams nearest rival railroad commissioner kent hance 
nonetheless predicted a runoff a former democrat and congressman 
hance said he would quit politics if he didnt win the gop 
nomination 
williams a midland businessman so popular that his campaign 
appearances drew autograph seekers said he hoped to avoid a runoff 
so he could turn his guns on the democrats 
as a republican it would be much better for our party if i 
were able to make it without a runoff he said 
he has spent 8 million on the campaign 6 million out of his 
own pocket a record for one candidate in a texas gubernatorial 
primary 
the williams campaign dominated the television airwaves with 
lavishly produced commercials his final ad showed him wearing a 
cowboy hat and standing in front of a chuck wagon talking about 
the spirit of texas 
im a fourthgeneration texan and im very proud of it he 
tells the camera we sure as heck havent lost that spirit 
besides hance two other gop hopefuls aimed at a runoff 
dallas lawyer tom luce an associate of billionaire h ross 
perot won endorsements from most of the states largest newspapers 
for offering detailed programs on such issues as education and the 
environment 
but confronted with williams slick tv performances luce said 
perhaps he could have used a charisma transplant to compete 
former secretary of state jack rains was counting on a big vote 
in his hometown of houston to carry him after winning praise as a 
skillful orator in three debates televised statewide 
while the governors race monopolized the publics attention 
tuesdays primary ballots also will include dozens of other races 
from the us senate to the state legislature 
in the senate race republican phil gramm is uncontested on the 
democratic side state sen hugh parmer of fort worth faces a 
lyndon larouche supporter harley schlanger of houston 
secretary of state george bayoud and the two party chairmen have 
predicted that about 25 percent of the states 83 million 
registered voters will cast ballots 
gop turnout is forecast at 750000 to 1 million while 
democratic turnout is estimated at 14 million to 16 million

the government acknowledged saturday 
that civilian casualties in last weeks coup attempt were almost 
four times higher than originally reported 
government spokesman naqib sameer said 70 more bodies of 
civilians were pulled from the rubble of destroyed buildings 
bringing the death toll to 95 president najib orignally said 25 
civilians died during the fighting tuesday and wednesday 
no figures were released saturday for military casualties a 
western military expert estimated hundreds of officers and elite 
commandos died when afghan warplanes bombed the capital causing 
extensive damage to the city of 2 million 
the military also appeared have suffered heavy material losses 
at least 10 jet fighters and 15 tanks were believed destroyed 
government and diplomatic sources said the government has said it 
shot down three rebel planes 
meanwhile eastern european diplomatic sources and one afghan 
government official provided some insight into the failure of the 
coup which was launched tuesday by defense minister shah nawaz 
tanai a hardline communist 
according to their statements forces from the afghan 
intelligence agency surrounded two renegade tank corps late monday 
amid indications a coup might be attempted this prevented critical 
ground suport for tanai when the assault began tuesday 
one corps was bottled up near pulcharki prison on the outskirts 
of kabul and another tank unit was surrounded behind the defense 
ministry only two tanks from the unit near pulcharki broke free 
tuesday they attacked the military university near the prison but 
were soon destroyed the eastern european source said 
the renegades were limited to air strikes on the capital 
although the strikes were bloody and destructive they were not 
enough to unseat najib 
the trapped tanks coupled with the armys use of destructive 
scud missiles against mutineers appeared to have been central in 
quelling the coup a western diplomat in islamabad said the prompt 
smashing of tanais communications network also hurt the defense

louie the llama doesnt have to be a 
follower any more the 5monthold 72pound south american 
ruminant had cataracts removed from his right eye in an operation 
that lets him to see for the first time 
dr james clinton the medford veterinarian who performed the 
50minute surgery thursday said louies history suggests the llama 
could not see because he never started any activities with fellow 
animals 
this one always followed clinton said it never led 
louie is recovering at popcorn park zoo home to about 300 
injured or abandoned animals ranging from chickens to deer said 
zoo director john bergmann 
with cataracts the crystalline lens of the eye becomes opaque 
blocking light rays instead of refracting them the surgeon removes 
the lens leaving the cornea the transparent tissue over the front 
of the eyeball 
clinton compared the crystalline lens to a finetuning 
instrument he said its removal results in about 90 percent vision 
clinton an eye specialist whose prior patients have included 
owls and a leopard said louie was his first llama 
clinton operated on just one eye because the surgery prompts a 
release of a protein that causes inflammation most animals can see 
well enough with one eye but louie could get surgery in his left 
eye after 16 weeks clinton said 
bergmann is checking on how louie is faring with eyesight for 
the first time last night it moved away from us for the first 
time when we brought it food bergmann said friday

federal officials have revoked the licenses 
of three northwest airlines flight crew members accused of flying 
under the influence of alcohol 
safety and alcohol do not mix said federal aviation 
administration administrator james b busey in a swift action that 
he said friday should serve as a lesson to other crews 
capt norman prouse 51 of conyers ga first officer robert 
j kirchner 35 of highland ranch colo and second officer 
joseph w balzer 34 of antioch tenn were arrested thursday 
when northwest flight 650 a boeing 727 with 91 passengers aboard 
arrived without incident in minneapolis from fargo nd airport 
police said 
faa officials had received an anonymous call indicating that the 
three had been drinking in the fargo area wednesday night said 
alan muncaster a northwest spokesman 
minnesota law prohibits flying with a bloodalcohol level above 
004 percent the case will be referred to the city attorneys 
office by tuesday said minneapolisst paul international airport 
police chief jim welna 
busey said the crew had violated the minnesota law and federal 
rules against flying within eight hours of drinking alcohol 
we will take equally forceful action against any other airman 
who violates the agencys regulations against alcohol busey said 
violation of the agencys alcohol rules is not common at 
all said faa spokesman bob buckhorn 
buckhorn said busey acted after the three crew members were 
reported by an faa inspector to have been flying within eight hours 
of drinking being under the influence of alcohol and having 
bloodalcohol concentrations greater than 004 percent 
the three crew members have the right to appeal their emergency 
license revocations within 10 days to the national transportation 
safety board 
kirchner and balzer have not returned phone calls and prouse has 
an unlisted number 
the air line pilots association issued a statement expressing 
its support for a 100 percent alcohol and drugfree cockpit on 
every flight and called any deviation from that standard as an 
extremely rare anomaly 
bob gibbons another spokesman for eaganbased northwest said 
that the airline was conducting its own investigation to see 
whether the crew had violated the companys rule against drinking 
within 12 hours before a flight 
the three men were removed from flight duty he said upon the 
completion of our investigation they could be subjected to 
discipline which could be as severe as discharge from the 
company he said 
northwest spokesmen were silent on specifics of the case pending 
the outcome of the investigation but promised to make public the 
outcome and suggested that the matter may be settled next week 
faa records show that since 1984 the industry has recorded 237 
incidents of drug and alcohol abuse by crew members including 126 
in which licenses were revoked the rest were suspensions of 30 
days to a year at least six involved major carriers but none 
appeared to involve northwest 
friday also marked the last day for comments to the us 
transportation department as it debates whether to formally 
introduce a new rule allowing random testing of essential 
transportationsystem workers for alcohol abuse 
drug testing in the airline industry including pilots and 
mechanics at northwest began jan 1

week of factional violence to at least 22 scores of people have 
been injured 
south africa has been hit by a wave of violent unrest that has 
claimed about 200 lives during the past month the unrest is 
regarded as the worst to hit the country since the mid1980s the 
government threatened to use emergency measures to end it

taking part in a protest to demand the release of political 
prisoners police declared the march illegal and moved in after

responsible for the violence opposition leaders said president 
fw de klerks decision to legalize the african national congress 
and other opposition groups encouraged radicals to attempt to seize 
power 
walter sisulu an anc leader said friday the government was 
reverting to the old approach of looking for scapegoats and 
hidden instigators 
the primary reason for the unrest conflict and confrontation 
has always been the poverty and violence caused by apartheid he

rocked the nevada desert saturday the same day a published report 
said the soviet union is phasing out testing on its mainland 
because of citizens safety concerns 
the washington post reported that the soviet union would move 
its nuclear testing site from southcentral asia to an island 
inside the arctic circle it cited sources it did not name in the 
soviet union and the united states 
the tested weapon codenamed metropolis was detonated at the 
bottom of a 1500foot shaft at yucca flat at the remote nevada 
test site the device was listed as having an explosive force of 
20000 to 150000 tons of tnt but was believed to be near the 
upper limits because of warnings issued in advance by the energy 
department 
the test registered 51 on the richter scale at the national 
earthquake information center in golden colo according to 
spokesman john minsch 
seismic equipment atop fitzgeralds hotel and casino in downtown 
las vegas 85 miles away registered slight motion from the blast 
theres definitely ground motion doe spokesman chris west 
said by telephone from a control point 12 miles from ground zero

a mild rocking motion west said

plan to shift their testing program to novaya zemlya a large 
island in the barents sea within the arctic circle the sources

lithuanias first freely elected 
parliament in 50 years convened saturday night to prepare for a 
historic vote on independence from the soviet union 
tomorrow the festival begins said longinas vasiliauskas a 
spokesman for the proindependence sajudis movement which won a 
twothirds majority of the deputies in the new parliament 
the parliament which votes sunday on whether to secede is the 
countrys first legislature not dominated by communists 
its deputies represent a variety of political parties with no 
single party dominant in municipal elections earlier this month 
sajudis backed candidates based on their views on democracy and 
independence regardless of party 
at the modern building housing the parliament citizens and 
legislators sang the lithuanian anthem as the session opened 
saturday night outside about 100 demonstrators waved the 
redyellowandgreen flags of independent lithuania and joked about 
the day when they would need passports to travel to moscow 
inside lithuanian leaders stood in front of a huge banner 
depicting the soviet star and the communist partys famous 
hammerandsickle emblem 
asked if the banner would be removed when lithuania declares 
independence activist eduardas potashinskas replied thats 
easy if only that were all that we had to change 
lithuania was an independent country between the two world wars 
in 1940 lithuania and the other baltic states latvia and estonia 
were forcibly annexed to the soviet union while under red army 
occupation 
the bold move to declare lithuania independent could present 
president mikhail s gorbachev with his greatest crisis in five 
years in power gorbachev and other soviet officials have indicated 
the kremlin may grudgingly accept lithuanian secession but at a 
steep price 
specifically gorbachev has suggested a bill of 34 billion in 
compensation for factories and other infrastructures built during a 
halfcentury of soviet rule lithuanians replied that their bill to 
the soviet union for decades of repression would be higher 
the independence proposal is widely expected to pass sunday due 
to the commanding majority of seats won by sajudis candidates who 
favor independence sajudis has already won 95 of 130 seats filled 
so far said spokesman haroldas subachius 
the last 11 races were being decided in runoffs saturday and 
sunday but the new parliament chose to rush into session with a 
minimal quorum so it can vote on independence before gorbachev is 
given broad new powers by the soviet congress of peoples deputies 
on monday 
gorbachev is seeking the authority to declare a state of 
emergency on his own which would include the power to suspend 
republic parliaments and take over administration of a republic 
progressives consider the proposed powers potentially dictatorial 
also high on the parliaments agenda is election of the 
irelandsized republics two top leaders the premier and the 
chairman of the supreme soviet legislature the second slot is 
sometimes called the presidency and sajudis wants its own man in 
the job instead of the current communist party leader algirdas 
brazauskas 
a sajudis council decided that because communists are a minority 
in the new lithuanian parliament it would be unfitting to reelect 
brazauskas activist subachius said 
brazauskas enjoys widespread personal popularity because he led 
the lithuanian communists when they split from the soviet party in 
december and joined the drive for independence 
sajudis probably will back one of its three leading figures for 
the post of president activists said 
gorbachevs reforms have provoked strong proindependence 
sentiments in many of the countrys 15 republics on friday the 
georgian parliament passed a resolution condemning the republics 
annexation to the soviet union mirroring moves already made in 
lithuania latvia and estonia 
the parliament will be asked to reaffirm an act first passed on 
feb 16 1918 declaring the state independent lawmakers already 
have declared illegal lithuanias incorporation into the soviet 
union in 1940 under a secret nazisoviet pact 
lawmakers also will be asked to restore the 1938 constitution 
that was swept away by josef stalins kremlin in favor of 
sovietstyle law 
in remarks reported by the official tass news agency lithuanian 
economist bronislovas zaikauskas said his homeland poor in natural 
resources could exploit its location on the soviet unions western 
fringe to become a trampoline for western firms seeking entry 
to the soviet market 
however brazauskas has indicated the kremlin might demand to 
retain control of the city of klaipeda if lithuania secedes 
klaipeda is the republics main port

the soviet union and hungary signed an agreement 
saturday calling for all red army troops to be withdrawn from 
hungary by the middle of next year and budapest proposed an end to 
the mutual assistance pact between the nations 
the pact was the soviet pretext for invading hungary in 1956 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn hinted it is time for the 
soviets to apologize for that invasion 
we must give a clear picture of the events of 1956 and the 
soviet interference he said in december the soviets apologized 
for the 1968 warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia 
this is a new page in hungarian history horn told a news 
conference after he and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
signed the troop withdrawal agreement 
he credited soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs new foreign 
policy for the agreement it calls for all 49700 red army soldiers 
and 27146 military vehicles to start heading home monday and to be 
out of hungary entirely by june 30 1991 
the soviets have already agreed to remove their 73500 soldiers 
from czechoslovakia by the same date that means moscow is 
committed to withdrawing 123200 troops from countries on the east 
blocs front line within 14 months 
horn said it is time to drop the obsolete mutual assistance 
pact which the soviets cited when their troops poured into hungary 
in 1956 to crush its drive for democratic reforms 
on march 25 hungary will hold its first free national elections 
since the communists consolidated power in 1948 
the treaty of friendship and cooperation is obsolete horn 
said we must now replace it with a joint statement reflecting 
changes in our bilateral relations and in the international 
sphere 
we should get rid of the ideological elements still remaining 
in our relationship he said a clear reference to the soviet 
unions decades of forcing communism on resisting hungarians the 
foreign minister said the soviets have agreed to discuss the issue 
in an interview with hungarian radio horn also said he could 
see the possibility of nato and the warsaw pact converging someday 
if the east bloc continues to democratize 
asked if he preferred a united germany to be neutral or a member 
of the western alliance horn said bluntly if the future germany 
wants to remain a member of nato we should respond to that wish 
he also said the wishes of all of europe should be taken into 
account 
hungarian radio reported that the two governments are still 
negotiating on the property being left behind by the soviet troops 
the soviets were reported to have preferred a final pullout date 
from hungary of aug 31 1991 giving them more time for 
dismantling military stockpiles hungarian military officials say 
the equipment includes 860 tanks and 1500 armored personnel 
carriers 
according to hungarian radio twothirds of the withdrawal of 
soviet troops and equipment is to be completed by the end of this 
year 
horn said the hungarian side first brought up the troop issue 
two years ago and it was initialed friday in time for horns 
planned arrival saturday for the signing ceremony

an opposition leader was placed 
under house arrest saturday after demanding multiparty democracy 
and expressing support for demonstrators protesting austerity 
measures 
soldiers surrounded laurent gbagbos house and prevented 
reporters from entering 
gbagbo at first was allowed to make telephone calls he said he 
was ordered to remain at the house after he returned from the 
french embassy where he was refused a visa to travel to france to 
participate in a television debate on african economies 
but several hours after police arrived at his home telephone 
callers received an announcement saying gbagos number was no 
longer in service 
gbagbo has been under house arrest twice in the ast two years 
he is a history professor who founded the unauthorized ivorian 
popular front eight years ago and has been calling for multiparty 
elections 
he also has said his party supports recent antigovernment 
protests the protests turned violent and produced the worst unrest 
in years in this normally peaceful country 
demonstrators mainly university students said the poor were 
being burdened with an unfair load of austerity measures they 
demanded the ouster of president felix houphouetboigny accusing 
him of siphoning money from state coffers 
soldiers and police broke up protests with harsh beatings tear 
gas and stun grenades many protesters were peaceful but others 
stoned and burned cars and ransacked several stores it is not 
known how many people were injured in the violence 
troops still patrol abidjan the capital though there have been 
no demonstrations for a week 
the government defused the unrest by promising to review planned 
austerity measures those measures would cut salaries of civil 
servants by up to 40 percent and charge a 10 percent austerity tax 
for some people 
authorities also have promised to cut prices of staple foods and 
rents on government housing 
but world bank and international monetary fund officials say 
wage cuts are necessary if ivory coast is to control an economic 
crisis rooted in slumping prices of cocoa and coffee its main 
exports 
gbagbo has blamed the crisis on the ruling democratic party and 
houphouetboigny who has ruled the nation as a oneparty state 
since its independence from france in 1960 
several of gbagbos supporters have been detained recently for 
distributing a newsletter calling for the peaceful creation of a 
multiparty democracy the newsletter cost the equivalent of 2 but 
photocopies now are being sold for 7

areas incorporate former guerrillas into civilian life and create 
a commission to study the effects of cocaine trafficking on 
colombia and other countries

conflicts and differences but the president added that other 
leftist guerrilla groups were persisting in their terrorist 
actions against the colombian people

major opposition parties saturday 
demanded a delay in may elections to allow more time to challenge 
the postrevolutionary leadership which has been attacked for its 
ties to the old regime 
the demand represents the first time the fractious opposition 
has openly pooled its forces to stop the national salvation fronts 
bid for longterm power 
the national peasants party and the national liberal party the 
two largest opposition groups joined forces with smaller parties 
in seeking the election postponement in a letter to interim 
president ion iliescu they did not say when the letter would be 
sent 
however the government has reacted with scorn to previous 
demands for a delay in elections they are idiots government 
spokesman cristian unteanu said recently 
the vote is set for may 20 but the opposition wants more time 
to build up electoral momentum against the dominant national 
salvation front many of its members have been assailed for having 
held posts in the government of communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu who was toppled in a bloody revolution in december 
a draft of the oppositions letter to iliescu said romanians are 
not ready for democratic elections because they dont know the true 
state of the nations devastated economy 
the countrys rulers gained some economic maneuvering room 
saturday though as four strikes were reportedly settled the 
actions involved bucharest subway workers 15 carpathian coal 
mines pilots and sailors in the black sea port of constanta and 
public transport workers in the danube port city of galati 
according to bucharest radio 
the opposition also argued in its letter that may elections 
would hurt the nations agricultural sector by distracting workers 
from the vital spring planting 
however the primary reason for seeking postponement clearly is 
opposition fears that the national salvation front would have an 
unassailable lead in elections as early as may the front has 
dominated romanian politics and government since the december 
revolution 
the 150member front took power during the revolt it 
relinquished only part of its power to a multiparty council of 
national unity in february after the front announced it would run 
candidates in the elections reversing an earlier pledge the 
reversal touched off an outcry from the opposition because the 
front was also organizing the elections 
the front has since styled itself as a political movement rather 
than a ruling body but its members dominate both the government 
and the council which is serving as a parliament until the 
elections 
in his earlier interview with the associated press unteanu 
said if they decide to postpone the elections it will be a 
signal for political instability 
the government needs to have the legitimacy of elections he 
said 
the government is struggling to restructure the economy from the 
centralized staterun communist model to a freeenterprise market 
economy

the reenactment of the historic 
50mile march from selma to montgomery ended saturday with 3000 
people gathered in the shadow of alabamas capitol to rekindle the 
spirit of the civil rights movement 
the turnout paled in comparison to the 1965 march when 25000 
people gathered in the cradle of the confederacy to demand 
voting rights but organizers hoped the 1990 trek would herald a 
new age of activism 
it would be a shameful waste if we marched all the way from 
selma to montgomery to go home and sit on our seats of apathy 
said joseph lowery president of the southern christan leadership 
conference who led the weeklong commemorative march 
at the capitol where the confederate battle flag still flies 
over the white dome despite blacks protests jesse jackson told 
the chanting crowd their message must be taken to the nations 
capital 
on to washington for jobs jackson exhorted the gathering 
on to washington for peace dividends keep hope alive 
coretta scott king encouraged the mostly black crowd to keep 
fighting for racial equality 
these are the faithful few and god always uses those who are 
willing to be used said the widow of slain civil rights leader 
rev martin luther king jr whose first church is a block down the 
street from the capitol steps 
mrs king jackson and others said blacks had made progress but 
much remained to be done lowery called for corporations to 
engage in equitable reinvestment in our communities 
jackson later went to meet with former gov george c wallace at 
his home wallace who opposed the 1965 march later won widespread 
black support that helped win his fourth and final term as governor 
in 1982 
if the governor can come from where he was 20 years ago and 
speak of a moral society where there is economic justice there is 
hope for blacks and whites alike jackson told reporters after 
the meeting 
the rally capped a week in which about 150 marchers crossed the 
edmund pettus bridge in selma and headed east along a rural highway 
to montgomery covering the same path activists took in 1965 
the march 25 years ago came two weeks after bloody sunday 
where white authorities routed black marchers with clubs and tear 
gas as they tried to cross the bridge over the alabama river 
the violence at selma was recorded by television cameras and 
helped spur congress to pass the 1965 voting rights act which 
guaranteed ballot box rights for blacks 
james p turner an acting assistant attorney general in the 
civil rights division of the justice department said the laws 
effect was almost immediate in alabama alone he said black voter 
registration increased from about 92000 in 1964 to nearly 250000 
in 1967 
nationwide the number of black elected officials has leaped 
from 103 in 1964 to 7226 today turner told the rally 
the final twomile leg of the commemoration began about two 
hours before the capitol ceremony with lowery and mrs king 
leading about 1000 blacks and a few whites through some of 
montgomerys black neighborhoods 
blue skies and warm temperatures greeted the signcarrying 
marchers who chanted fired up and we aint gonna take it no 
more on their way downtown 
lowery said blacks must reclaim values of the civil rights era 
that some have lost en route to 1990 we crossed the edmund 
pettus bridge but now weve got to cross the rivers of apathy and 
loss of selfesteem he said

harlem residents fed up with billboards enticing 
them to buy alcohol and cigarettes splashed paint over more than a 
dozen of the signs saturday and cheered a company that followed 
suit 
singing yield not to temptation about 50 members of the 
abyssinian baptist church marched with buckets and paint rollers 
down a street in harlem a section of new york where a recent study 
found men have shorter lifespans than in bangladesh 
alcohol kills more people than heroin marijuana crack and 
cocaine together said the rev calvin o butts the protest 
organizer and church pastor it was the groups second swing 
through harlem in two weeks 
butts said billboards advertising such products as whiskey and 
cigarettes proliferate in the africanamerican community more 
than any other community often degrade women and are designed to 
entice youths 
the board says alive with pleasure but tell that to someone 
dying of lung cancer butts said 
the group passed graffiticovered tenements and a dozen or so 
men drinking out of brown paper bags at 10 am the protesters 
whitewashed more than a dozen 6footby12foot billboards 
four police cars and a police van tailed the crowd which 
included several children 
we are using discretion said police capt terry tunnock 
we havent had complaints from anyone if any of the companies do 
complain there could be arrests but none have come forward 
butts and others painted over several billboards a week earlier 
prompting one outdoor advertising company scheiffelin amp somerset 
co to announce johnny walker scotch and hennessey cognac would be 
banned from its billboards in lowincome communities 
protesters gathered at the church saturday before hitting the 
streets with their whitewash and rollers they got a surprise 
announcement from a visitor john brown who is vice president of 
another sign company metropolitan outdoor advertising 
brown announced that his company one of the largest in the city 
and one of the biggest distributors of small billboards in the 
united states would remove liquor and cigarette billboards within 
five blocks of places of worship schools and play areas in new 
york he said the company would consider doing the same elsewhere 
in the country 
brown noted similar whitewashing campaigns under way in chicago 
detroit and oakland calif 
if we are to survive as advertisers in the 90s we need to 
take positive action he said 
the billboardblotting campaigns come at a time of heightened 
criticism of manufacturers that target advertising for cigarettes 
and alcohol at minority consumers 
in january rj reynolds tobacco co canceled plans to market a 
new cigarette uptown with ads tailored to win over blacks after 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan joined 
philadelphia community groups in criticizing the campaign 
officials in richmond calif are considering a ban on alcohol 
and tobacco billboard advertising near schools 
we have to get at the basic underlying motivations of people 
and we believe that these alcohol and cigarette billboards send a 
mixed message to kids who are being taught in a school to shun 
drugs said jim rogers chairman of an antidrug task force in 
richmond 
a metropolitan outdoor advertising worker perched on a ladder 
got cheers and applause from paintslinging protesters as he 
papered over a billboard advertising beer with a new message god 
makes house calls 
a few bystanders some sipping from cans or bottles hidden 
inside brown paper bags seemed unimpressed with the effort 
it aint going to work said an elderly man watching the 
group he nudged a young man standing next to him who held up his 
brown paper bag and said this is a personal thing 
the protesters worked at one point in a vacant lot littered with 
garbage and ankle deep in spots with empty cans across the street 
21yearold larry rodgers said he didnt think the billboard 
campaign would change much 
on every corner theres a liquor store and a bar said 
rodgers who described himself as a recovering alcoholic its a 
good idea but its not going to help

the subway train had just left 
philadelphias big bustling 30th street station when morning 
commuters noticed something was wrong 
it kind of hit a bump or something and then it rocked really 
hard said rose mcgurl 35 and then it hit the posts that 
separate the two lanes of trains and then it came off the tracks 
three people were killed and 94 injured when the southeastern 
pennsylvania transportation authoritys sixcar train 61 filled 
with hundreds of people heading to work derailed at 821 am 
wednesday 
the last three cars abruptly were jerked onto adjacent tracks 
one car was ripped open by steel pillars in the 83yearold tunnel 
then after president bush and transportation secretary samuel 
skinner had unveiled a national transportation policy urging 
further cuts in federal support for mass transit investigators 
findings came in 
one of four motors on the trains third car had lost its 
primary and backup supports come loose and gouged 1555 feet of 
ties before hitting a crossover switch the national transportation 
safety board said 
on friday the ntsb said 27 of 76 motors it inspected on 19 
cars were improperly secured including one other motor on the same 
car on which the motor had dislodged 
the motorman driving the train had tested positive for cocaine 
use but the ntsb said it hadnt been determined whether the drug 
was a factor in the accident the motorman whose name was 
withheld will be suspended without pay monday septa spokesman 
dave murdock said 
still unexplained by septa or city officials was a 17minute 
delay in which a septa dispatcher didnt issue an alarm for nine 
minutes after the derailment and paramedics werent summoned for 
eight minutes more 
the safety board recommended none of the budd cobuilt cars be 
used until inspected and repaired and commuters had to take 
shuttle buses the rest of the week for a 37block stretch of the 
128mile subway and elevated line 
septa general manager louis gambaccini pledged to complete the 
inspections by monday when full service was scheduled to resume 
he insisted the rail system was safe the accident was the first 
fatal derailment since 1961 on the line which typically carries 
100000 passengers twice a day and which septa has operated since 
1969 
operator error equipment failure and vandalism have caused 
several major accidents in the past decade on septas suburban 
train and trolley systems including one fatality and 246 injuries 
in three accidents during a 22month stretch from 1984 to 1986 
ntsb members john k lauber and susan m coughlin returned to 
washington on saturday but 10 employees were expected to stay in 
philadelphia through the middle of this week said russell gober 
investigator in charge 
investigators were still interviewing survivors looking at 
track and signals and going over earlier findings he said 
mostly were just getting the information that weve already 
developed in perspective he said 
the ntsbs report on the accident isnt expected for nine months 
to a year 
gov robert p casey toured the crash site thursday and was 
questioned about septas complaints of inadequate financing by 
local state and federal governments 
president bush cut 27 million from septa this year casey 
said ive never cut five cents from septa ive done nothing but 
increase money for septa 
gambaccini agreed the states recent increases have been crucial 
to septas survival but he said more was needed especially in 
light of the federal governments proposed end of mass transit 
subsidies 
gambaccini later said septas financial problems sometimes force 
maintenance workers to take shortcuts but dismissed them as a 
possible factor in the subway crash 
when the cocaine results were revealed gambaccini said he hoped 
the findings wouldnt taint other septa workers whom he 
characterized as a workforce of dedicated and responsible human 
beings 
of nearly 1000 septa employees tested since the transport 
workers union agreed to random tests a year ago 232 percent 
tested positive for illegal drug use gambaccini said 
in every case immediate and appropriate action was taken 
he said

the rev billy graham took his crusade to the 
open berlin wall on saturday and appealed to east germans he sees 
as spiritually adrift following the demise of communist ideology 
in a onehour sermon at the wall the us evangelist warned of 
materialism and the lure of hedonism and selfgratification at 
this time of rejoicing he was referring to democratic changes 
sweeping the communist world 
the people ive met in germany are living in both hope and 
fear graham told a rainsoaked rally of about 10000 people on a 
vast grassy square in front of the imposing reichstag the 
parliament of germany prior to world war ii 
he noted that while many germans hope for renewed national unity 
and prosperity worries about the future abound 
many people feel insecure the old roots are shaking 
everywhere graham said 
hartmut stepp a west german evangelical church leader from 
stuttgart said grahams ministry was sought since a spiritual 
ideological vacuum exists because of this social upheaval 
at least half of the crowd was east german judging from a show 
of hands sought by one speaker at the rally 
horst arold 50 said he had traveled 175 miles from weimar 
east germany for an event that would have been inaccessible only 
five months ago east germanys old communist regime flung open the 
berlin wall in november under pressure from mass protests for 
democratic reform 
this is fantastic arold said its the first time in 
years that we can take part in something like this 
rally organizers set up a giant video screen and public address 
loudspeakers on the reichstag steps where graham spoke under a 
portico inscription that reads to the german people 
however turnout was only a fraction of what organizers had 
expected 
graham spoke a week before east germanys first free 
parliamentary elections on march 18 but said he had no political 
message 
the east german christian democratic union which is backed by 
its west german counterpart led by chancellor helmut kohl has 
emphasized its religious roots in the campaign 
graham last held rallies in berlin in 1960 the year before the 
wall went up he has conducted eight previous evangelical crusades 
in germany the first in 1954 when much of the nation still lay in 
ruins from world war ii 
graham who was ordained a minister in the southern baptists 
church in 1939 has also preached in the soviet union and other 
east european countries in recent years

jim lahr sat ramrod straight in his wheelchair 
tears welling in his eyes as his field commander in vietnam added a 
longdelayed bronze star saturday to the rows of medals pinned to 
his marine uniform 
the good guys finally won one said col donald meyers who 
retired from the corps less than two years ago it doesnt happen 
very often 
while on patrol in vietnam on march 21 1969 16 days before the 
end of his 13month tour of duty lahr and several other marines 
descended the steep banks of a stream to fill canteens 
it turned out they had stumbled on a huge north vietnamese 
supply cache said denver lawson freeman who probably would have 
died there if it werent for lahr as they stooped in the 
2footdeep water they were suddenly ambushed with machinegun 
fire and rocketpropelled grenades 
the whole hill basically just exploded freeman said 
a grenade fell nearby wounding freeman and several others 
corporal lahr with complete disregard for his own safety 
assisted several marines to safety the award citation says 
despite the heavy fire he made several trips until he 
himself was wounded and unable to continue 
lahr said he took one round from a rifle the bullet went into 
his shoulder grazed his lung hit three ribs and finally lodged in 
his spine paralyzing him from the waist down 
for 20 years neither freeman nor lahr knew that the other had 
survived 
but through a contact he made at a marine corps reunion last 
summer freeman learned that lahr was living in lincoln ill he 
set out to see that his friend received the honor he deserved 
if he hadnt pulled me out of the river that day i wouldnt be 
here today freeman said after the awards ceremony saturday at 
the marine reserve base in st louis theres just no doubt in my 
mind about that 
freeman started the ball rolling said marine sgt major 
wallace poyner writing letters and petitions to the awards section 
of the marine corps 
lahr downplayed his heroism saying he did it all on impulse and 
didnt even know immediately that he was shot 
it all happened so fast he said as he fingered the citation 
for heroism i fell down in the water and grabbed a big rock i 
didnt know i was hit until i looked down and saw the blood running 
away from me in the water 
he remembers nothing more until he awoke on a hospital ship some 
days later 
freeman suffered a crushed bone in his right thigh in the battle 
and was hospitalized for 10 months after the attack he now sells 
insurance in south charleston wva 
lahr is active in veterans groups said nancy his wife of 20 
years

democracy will fail in panama unless promised 
us economic help arrives soon president guillermo endara said 
saturday as he entered the 10th day of a hunger strike to press for 
the aid 
people cannot eat democracy endara told the associated 
press in an interview in the nave of metropolitan cathedral where 
he is fasting in solidarity with the suffering of the people of 
panama 
endara whose electoral victory in may 1989 was annulled by 
former dictator manuel antonio noriega was sworn in secretly on 
dec 19 only hours before us forces invaded panama and ousted 
noriega 
but endaras government is faced with severe economic problems 
the united states has turned over only 160 million of 400 million 
it withheld in back pay during the last two years of noriegas 
rule meanwhile president bushs promises of economic assistance 
are being discussed in congress 
the invasion and ensuing looting destroyed most of panama citys 
business districts costing nearly 700 million in losses and 
thousands of jobs unemployment estimated at 20 percent before the 
invasion is now more than 30 percent the government says 
it is painful to see that for ridiculous and foolish reasons 
they are holding back money that belongs to panama endara said 
the 52yearold president added that he understands bureaucracy 
i am sure president bush is doing the best he can there are 
legal requirements that have to do with the releasing of the funds 
but still i do not see why the people of panama have to wait he 
said 
one of hundreds of people who visit the cathedral daily to draw 
endaras attention to the presidents problems was raul kennedy 
who belonged to a military unit dismissed by noriega because of its 
participation in a failed coup last october 
kennedy was called back to serve in the new police force and 
said he has been working since january 
but i have not gotten paid yet because my appointment is not 
official yet he said they tell me everything is being delayed 
or suspended for lack of money i understand the country is in bad 
shape but i have a wife and two children to support 
said endara in order to survive democracy must show that it 
is effective that it can provide people food and justice if it 
does not do that it fails 
i am still optimistic i think our experiment will be 
successful but i see signs of concern there could be popular 
unrest unless there are some quick solutions the congressional 
delay of approval endangers our democracy he said 
endara a portly man who normally weighs around 240 pounds has 
lost more than 10 pounds since he started his fast 
he is under medical care and drinks only water he sleeps on a 
canvass cot cooled by a fan there is a phone by his side and he 
attends government meetings 
not everyone agrees with how endara is conducting panamas 
affairs 
the daily newspaper la prensa ran a cartoon showing the 
president and his fiance 22yearold ana diaz holding hands in 
the cathedral ignoring the rise in crime and other social 
upheavals 
on friday police arrested more than 700 suspects while searching 
for drugs and guns 
the rise in crime is alarming and police officials blame some 
of it on unemployment and the amount of weapons believed to be in 
the hands paramilitary bands set up by noriega 
we used to have an average of four murders per month said

have 30

its starting to sprinkle on the electionyear 
parade that last march brought the nations 27 million veterans 
more access to the white house 
not that the marching and music will stop anytime soon 
the bush administrations 1991 budget proposal asks for a record 
31 billion for the veterans affairs department including an 
unheard of 123 billion for health programs 
the proposal is the best va medical care budget request by a 
president in more than a decade says sen alan cranston 
dcalif chairman of the senate veterans affairs committee 
and va secretary edward j derwinski has raised the hopes of the 
31 million vietnam war veterans by promising he will personally 
settle the agent orange question this spring derwinski more than 
any va official in the recent past has opened his doors to that 
group of veterans says paul s egan of the vietnam veterans of 
america 
but the same members of congress who praised the budget have 
already begun tinkering with it and refused to go along with a 
review of the va medical system that could mean closing hospitals 
or clinics veterans groups demanded 11 billion more and are 
attacking vas effort to review the benefits system 
derwinski is the first va secretary of the united states until 
march 15 1989 va stood for the veterans administration just 
another government agency albeit a massive one now it is a 
department giving derwinski full cabinet status 
va helps educate house treat and bury the people who served 
the country in war or peace it operates the largest healthcare 
system in the free world and is the fifthlargest life insurance 
provider in the country 
second in size only to the nations veteransproducing machine 
the pentagon the va employs about a quarter of a million people 
vas 172 medical centers and its other facilities are choice cuts 
of meat in the federal pork barrel 
since they make up well over a tenth of the us population and 
are all of voting age veterans are a political force especially 
when politicians wrap themselves in the flag as they did in 1988 
that is why it was easy for president reagan to sign the 
department of veterans affairs act in october of that year even 
though as an avowed enemy of big government he had tried to strip 
the education and energy departments of cabinet status 
given the broad political support which already exists for the 
va and its programs the gain from elevation to a cabinet 
department would be at the margin the independent national 
academy of public administration told congress in 1988 
that assessment is also why derwinski a wily former congressman 
from chicago knows that hard times lie ahead 
derwinski must decide what to do about the 9 million or so world 
war ii veterans who are getting older and many of them sicker and 
poorer large numbers have moved south and west away from existing 
facilities in the east and midwest 
he must also decide how much special attention to give to the 
nearly halfmillion vietnamera veterans who have continuing 
postcombat trauma or to countless others who say they have cancer 
or other ailments caused by exposure to agent orange 
he must deal with an overstrained bureaucracy that forces young 
veterans to wait months for their claims to be handled or just 
cant get through to va on the telephone he must deal with 
chronically underpaid doctors and nurses 
finally derwinski must develop and maintain good working 
relationships with congress where he served 12 terms before 
joining the reagan state department and with the veterans lobby 
congress and the veterans groups tend to be better 
secondguessers than blocking backs derwinski said recently in a 
rare show of pique 
they tend to be less cooperative about proposals to innovate 
than they do critiquing our past performance he said thats 
the headache part of the job 
when derwinski made those remarks the disabled american 
veterans had just questioned the departments commitment to its 
role as veterans advocate the group had discovered va was 
quietly studying benefit reforms 
that inhouse study includes a look at the sacred cow known as 
disability payments va says it is looking at ways to restore 
fairness to the system including equal death benefits for 
survivors of privates or generals 
derwinski ran up against a brick wall in congress last july when 
he asked for legislation to create a study commission that would 
examine the vas network of hospitals and clinics he said no such 
review had been done for a quarter of a century 
we got caught in the debate about military base closings so 
our timing wasnt good said derwinski who decided this year to 
appoint his own review commission it will make its proposals to 
congress in two years 
derwinski has also eliminated 27 medical districts that 
everyone told me were layers of bureaucracy 
although congress cheered the new budget request the house 
veterans affairs committee wasted no time tacking another 729 
million on to it veterans groups asked for 11 billion more 
derwinskis considerable reserve of goodwill could rise or drop 
depending on what he does about agent orange this spring 
the advice is so terribly conflicting derwinski said 
theres no consensus out there 
he gave strong hints starting last may he would give veterans 
the benefit of the doubt and award them compensation payments on 
agent orange claims adding perhaps 36 million to the vas cost 
of doing business 
derwinski backed off from a chance to decide last november but 
this year hes promising action depending on the outcome of a 
centers for disease control study on cancer in vietnam veterans

officials spent saturday laboriously trying to 
track down truck drivers warehouse workers and others who may have 
been exposed to an intensely radioactive pellet buried within a 
transcontinental cargo shipment 
the radioactive pellet the size of a pencil eraser was 
discovered thursday lying loose in a shipment of what were supposed 
to have been empty containers trucked to massachusetts the pellet 
called a source is used for making xraytype pictures of welds 
structural steel and other industrial objects 
technicians at the shipments last stop amersham inc of 
burlington discovered the pellet when they detected radioactivity 
coming from the shipment of containers used to carry sources the 
container that the source was found in lacked a shielding device 
that would have prevented the radiation from leaking out 
its safe to say that this is extraordinarily rare said 
karl abraham a nuclear regulatory commission spokesman there 
should be concern but certainly not panic until we have a chance to 
contact all the individuals who have had exposure 
abraham said it would take several days to determine how many 
people may have received radiation during the shipments transit 
from south korea to los angeles where it was stored for a month 
before being trucked crosscountry to amersham which manufactures 
equipment used to test industrial structures 
it appears to be an old source a decayed source abraham 
said of the pellet new pellets radiate at a level of 60 to 75 
curies radiation from the one that was found was at levels from 3 
to 7 curies he said 
initial measurements taken 4 to 6 inches away form the pellet 
found the level of radiation to be 150 rems per hour millions of 
times higher than that people normally are exposed to from the 
environment and xrays a rem is a measure of the estimated damage 
done to living tissue by radiation 
people generally receive about onetenth of a rem or 100 
millirem of radiation annually from natural sources the average 
american is exposed to an annual dose of 77 millirem from medical 
xrays 
abraham said investigators would better be able to determine the 
radiation field after reconstructing the way in which the cargo was 
stored 
then we have to determine the relation of that to where the 
driver was sitting where the people in the warehouse were and how 
long these people were near the source he said its going to 
be a laborious process that will take many days 
the nrc has enlisted the help of state officials in 
massachusetts california pennsylvania and maryland in their 
efforts to reconstruct the radioactive shipments path the sate 
department has also contacted the south korean government he said 
abraham said it wasnt immediately clear how or at what point 
the radioactive pellet slipped into the cargo but the shipment 
supposedly came in sealed up under bond like most things do when 
they go from one continent to another

federal officials proposing a 200000 fine 
against northwest airlines say improper maintenance was involved 
when an engine fell off a northwest plane over florida in january 
northwest said friday it would seek to have the fine reduced 
a threeengine boeing 727 en route from miami to minneapolis on 
jan 4 landed safely in tampa fla after losing the right rear 
engine which fell onto ranch land north of tampa there were no 
injuries 
the national transportation safety board said in january that 
preliminary findings showed blue fluid that apparently leaked from 
the planes forward lavatory solidified into chunks of ice as the 
plane cruised at 35000 feet 
the blue ice then flew into the engine damaging it until it 
broke loose and fell off as the engines are designed to do to 
prevent damage to the fuselage the official said 
northwest has maintained that various problems with the lavatory 
had been repaired several times in the weeks before the incident 
but the federal aviation administration said late friday that a 
leaking valve reported to the airline on several occasions between 
dec 23 and jan 4 wasnt repaired 
as a result during that period the aircraft was operated in 
an unairworthy condition on 53 flights the faa said 
northwest spokesman alan muncaster said friday he expects the 
airline will negotiate with federal officials in an attempt to get 
the fine reduced

the bush administration on saturday welcomed a 
promise by haitis new leader to set the stage for national 
elections by turning over power within 72 hours 
a us statement called on the countrys armed forces to join 
with political and business leaders in a spirit of reconciliation 
stressing the longtime us call for human rights in haiti the 
statement said we obviously hope the latest developments 
contribute to a realization of this objective 
the administration has had mixed feelings about the regime of 
lt gen prosper avril in haiti finding it responsive to us 
human rights demands but unconvincing about its commitment to free 
elections 
there is no us economic or military aid to haiti except for a 
small program to combat narcotics a 10 million emergency food 
program for what is one of the poorest and most densely populated 
countries in the western hemisphere was not continued this year 
however 414 million for agricultural development and other 
humanitarian assistance is being distributed through voluntary 
agencies 
shortly after avril yielded power to maj gen herard abraham 
the state department responded by saying it welcomed the intermim 
leaders promise to give way to a panel led by the supreme court 
president in order to arrange elections 
this step by arabahm is in conformity with the spirit of the 
constitution said adam shub state department spokesman 
the department in its human rights report last month linked 
the haitian army to human rights abuses in rural areas and said 
armed bands some possibly traced to remnants of the feared tonton 
macoute militia of the duvalier years had committed a number of 
murders 
and yet the report said human rights abuses perpetrated or 
directed by government leaders were the hallmark of previous 
haitian regimes the avril government avoided the egregious 
violations massacres and politically motivated killings 
characteristic of its predecessors 
this slightly favorable report to congress on haitis record in 
1989 took a nosedive at the start of this year 
in january the avril government imposed a state of siege 
suspending basic civil liberties prominent opposition politicians 
were beaten and deported the bush administration registered its 
outrage within 10 days the ban and censorship of the press was 
lifted constitutional guarantees were revived 
and on feb 7 political prisoners arrested since november were 
released in an amnesty but the state department said the actions 
were insufficient evidence of the avril governments commitment to 
human rights and free elections ambassador alvin adams was 
recalled to washington 
it was amid this reevaluation of us relations with haiti and 
a strategy designed to wrench a positive response from 
portauprince that the latest crisis developed 
reports that mrs avril had taken refuge in washington were not 
confirmed the state department on saturday watched unfolding 
developments in portauprince without a word of comment 
the avril government is the fifth in haiti since jeanclaude 
duvalier fled for france in february 1986 aboard a us air force 
transport his familys 29year rule was replaced by a national 
governing council 
baby doc left haiti with a strong shove from the reagan 
administration though duvalier left a taped message behind 
suggesting he had made the decision himself so a bloodbath 
would be avoided for my people 
we dont want to take too much credit a us official told 
an associated press reporter at the time but yes we did force 
him out and he knows it he knew that sooner or later we would 
make sure that he did leave but we wanted it done in a way that 
would bring about democracy and help prevent another iran or 
nicaragua 
as it turned out haiti became neither democratic nor as 
instable as iran after the departure of the shah haitians gained 
freedom of expression of the press and of association that did not 
exist under the duvaliers but arbitrary arrests continued

six aids patients taking the experimental 
drug ddi have died of pancreatitis a toxic side effect attributed 
to the drug according to a published report 
the los angeles times reported saturday that the deaths have 
occurred in the five months since the federal government made ddi 
dideoxyinosine available on a limited basis 
five of the dead were among the 8000 patients receiving ddi as 
part of an expanded access program through the food and drug 
administration according to the drugs manufacturer bristolmyers 
squibb co the sixth was one of 700 patients taking part in 
governmentsponsored trials of the drug the times said 
in a news release saturday the fda said officials were aware of 
adverse reactions to the drug including deaths but didnt provide 
further detail the fda said it asked bristolmyers to provide 
detailed information as soon as possible so the agency could 
determine if changes are needed to make the ongoing protocols as 
safe as possible 
the fda also asked the drug company to write doctors caring for 
patients receiving ddi providing them and their patients with the 
best available information about this situation and urging them to 
monitor their patients closely for signs of pancreatitis 
dr anthony s fauci the director of aids activities for the 
national institutes of health told the paper toxic sideeffects 
some of which will be serious were expected 
pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas a digestive 
organ severe inflammation can lead to kidney failure respiratory 
failure and death 
kathryn r bloom a spokeswoman for bristolmyers told the 
times the it hadnt been proven the deaths were caused by ddi 
bloom said there have been 44 reports of pancreatitis including 
the six fatalities 
we are taking this very seriously bloom told the newspaper 
in addition to the letter being prepared for doctors the company 
is studying the affects of dose levels and the length of therapy 
the expanded access program is to make ddi available to patients 
with advanced infections by hiv the virus that causes aids who 
are unqualified to take part in formal research studies this 
includes patients who are medically unable to take azt another 
drug for aids treatment 
when the expanded access to ddi was approved last year eight 
nonfatal cases of pancreatitis had already been reported among 
about 100 aids patients who had received the drug the times said 
citing government statistics 
many of those patients however were receiving far higher does 
of ddi than those approved for widespread experimental use by the 
fda

italian communists applauded and sang 
saturday after party leader achille occhetto moved to tears by the 
embrace of his chief opponents made an impassioned call for unity 
in creating a new party 
occhetto has emerged victorious at the party congress in his 
effort to relaunch the italian communist party a move that 
eventually is expected to lead to a new party name and the 
elimination of the hammerandsickle symbol 
delegates representing the wests largest communist party began 
voting at about 1120 pm on the proposal but the result was 
assured and delegates passed resolutions during the evening to 
regulate how they will plan for the new party 
the party said the voting booths would be open for three hours 
and the result would be announced later sunday the final vote had 
been expected earlier but was backed up behind a series of 
resolutions and speeches 
we want to change many things but we do not intend to leave 
the historic path from which we came we want to widen it said 
occhetto 
together we will construct our future we will struggle 
together for democracy for italy and for europe and socialism 
occhettos proposal was spurred by the collapse of communism in 
eastern europe and the partys steady decline in membership and 
electoral strength in italy 
occetto was interrupted by applause 24 times during the 
hourlong speech he urged unity and outlined how the new party 
would seek to create a democratic alternative in italy to 
represent the workers the poor the weak and the disenfranchised 
the party leader came to the congress with the support of almost 
67 percent of the delegates that was more than enough to ensure 
the success of his bid to create a new party 
however his proposal risks splitting the party which claims 
14 million members 
old guard communists waged an impassioned battle against 
revisions which were expected to include the name change and 
elimination of the partys revered symbols 
but fears of a party split seemed to vanish when the partys old 
lion pietro ingrao and former party secretary alessandro natta 
two of the leading opponents of change embraced occhetto at the 
end of his speech 
the 1092 delegates gave occhetto a standing ovation applauding 
and singing bandiera rosa red flag the party anthem 
occhetto wiped tears from his eyes as he took his seat on the high 
red multitiered platform the sports arena was awash in red 
banners and communist symbols 
the communists nearly came to power in 1976 when they won 34 
percent of the vote but they dropped to about 27 percent in the 
last parliamentary elections in 1987 
the italian party has long proclaimed itself independent of 
moscow it has espoused western parliamentary democracy supported 
italys membership in nato and condemned the soviet intervention in 
czechoslovakia in 1968 and afghanistan in 1979 
but while the party has portrayed itself as a critic of 
international communism occhetto has argued it cannot ignore the 
march of history and the collapse of communist governments in 
eastern europe 
he has maintained that a revamped italian party can move closer 
to the mainstream of european socialism and perhaps unite italys 
fractured political left to offer an alternative to the christian 
democrats who have dominated italian politics more than four 
decades

an iraqi court sentenced a journalist with a 
british newspaper to death on espionage charges saturday and 
ordered a british nurse jailed for 15 years for allegedly helping 
him the foreign office said 
under iraqi law no appeal is allowed 
the journalist iranianborn farzad bazoft of londons weekly 
observer newspaper was arrested in september while investigating 
reports of an explosion at an iraqi military complex the nurse 
daphne parish was accused of helping bazoft by driving him to the 
plant 
bazoft 31 and mrs parish 52 were tried by a revolutionary 
court on charges of committing hostile acts against iraq the 
proceedings which were not open to the public began thursday then 
were adjourned after five hours they resumed for 35 minutes 
saturday the foreign office said 
the defendents were assigned iraqi lawyers but a british 
diplomat was allowed to attend the trial 
there was no indication when the execution of bazoft might be 
carried out the 31yearold stateless iranian has lived in britain 
since 1975 and travels on british documents 
prime minister margaret thatcher was horrified by the severity 
of the sentence against bazoft a foreign office spokesman said 
he said she will appeal to iraqi president saddam hussein for 
clemency on humanitarian grounds 
junior foreign office minister william waldegrave said the 
government was concentrating on the immediate next few hours 
to get the death sentence lifted 
he said the government was considering sending a toplevel 
emissary to baghdad we rule out nothing he said 
the sentences if carried out are bound to have a 
farreaching effect on relations between the two countries 
waldegrave added 
amnesty international appealed for clemency 
the londonbased human rights organization said in a statement 
that it opposes the death penalty in all cases and supports the 
right not to be subjected to cruel inhuman and degrading 
treatment or punishment 
iraqs ambassador to britain dr azmi alsalihi told 
independent television news he passed mrs thatchers plea for 
clemency to baghdad 
asked whether hussein would consider the request he said let 
us see we have good relations with the british government we want 
all the aspects of our good relations continued 
bazoft an iranian exile has lived in britain since 1975 and 
travels on british documents mrs parish lives in baghdad where 
she is a senior nursing administrator for the irishrun ibn 
albitar hospital 
her daughter michelle de vries who lives in london said she 
was extremely shocked and distressed by her mothers sentence 
an iraqi who was in contact with bazoft in baghdad was also 
tried and received a 10year sentence for communicating government 
secrets to a foreigner the foreign office said the iraqi was 
identified only as rahim 
we utterly deplore these harsh and excessive sentences a 
foreign office statement said no evidence was produced at the 
trial which would justify sentences of this severity they come ill 
from a regime which is trying to show a more liberal face to the 
world 
in a frontpage editorial on sunday the observer called the 
iraqi courts action a monstrous piece of injustice that will 
damage the countrys reputation around the world 
it is an outrage demanding the same firmness which the prime 
minister showed when she broke diplomatic relations with the 
regimes of libya and syria for their official association with 
terrorism 
terrorism is not the issue here but cruelty barbarity and 
injustice which can be demonstrated many times over in iraq 
in november bazoft appeared on iraqi state television and said 
he had been spying for israel mrs parish did not appear in the 
broadcast 
the editor of the sunday observer donald trelford said the 
paper was certain bazoft was not spying for anyone he said the 
statement must have been made under duress and noted that bazoft 
appeared to be in poor physical shape 
trelford said bazoft had sought official permission to visit the 
aliskandaria military complex south of baghdad had told the paper 
of his movements and had talked openly about the visit to 
colleagues on his return to baghdad 
none of this conduct is consistent with espionage it is 
entirely consistent with journalism he said 
as bazoft is an iranian the foreign office said it was not in 
the same position to argue on his behalf as it was for mrs parish 
who is britishborn but it said it was appealing on bazofts 
behalf for humanitarian reasons and because he lived in britain for 
years 
the explosion at the military complex was reported in london to 
have killed up to 700 people but the iraqis later said 19 people 
were killed in a fuel depot blast

an iranian newspaper said saturday the 
united states and israel are planning a military rescue mission to 
free western hostages in lebanon 
the newspaper the englishlanguage kayhan international said 
the eight captive americans would be killed if such an attempt were 
made to free them and the 10 other westerners 
the paper did not cite sources and its unconfirmed report gave 
no further details there was no immediate comment from washington 
the newspaper quoted by irans official islamic republic news 
agency said any joint usisraeli rescue mission would end the 
socalled hostage crisis with the death of at least the american 
hostages 
meanwhile a key moslem leader in beirut lebanon mohammed 
hussein fadlallah said of the hostages we believe there are 
encouraging elements regarding readiness to deal with this issue 
he is spiritual leader of hezbollah or party of god an 
iranianlinked group believed to be an umbrella for organizations 
holding most of the western hostages 
on feb 23 after returning from a trip to iran fadlallah 
called in a sermon for realistic and humanitarian means to free 
the hostages 
there have been several iranian reports since then that some 
hostages might be freed president hashemi rafsanjani of iran 
recently said the hostages were being used by the west as a 
propaganda weapon and should be freed 
there have also been reports that us officials were talking 
indirectly to iranian officials in an effort to win the release of 
captives 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
kayhan international said saturday a recent media blitz on 
the us hostages in lebanon was designed in part to prepare the 
american public for the planned military operation 
the revolutionary justice organization said last week it had 
acquired accurate information that an american military operation 
is imminent against areas where the americans believe hostages are 
held 
the proiranian group which holds two us hostages said in a 
statement it had no intention of freeing hostages it was 
holding 
kayhan internationals positions are often at variance with 
those of rafsanjani who favors good ties with the west to attract 
investment and technology for irans sluggish economy 
former president carter authorized an attempt to rescue 52 
american hostages held in iran in 1980 however the operation 
ended in disaster on april 25 of that year when a helicopter 
collided with a tanker aircraft over an iranian desert killing 
eight servicemen the hostages were finally freed in january 1981 
after 444 days in 
captivity

a proposal to declare ann arbor a zone 
for reproductive freedom by limiting punishment for abortions to 
a 5 fine has generated little visible opposition from residents 
the fines similar to parking tickets would go into effect only 
if the us supreme court reversed its 1973 decision permitting 
abortions and michigan decided to restrict abortions 
there seems to be more discussion nationally than in ann arbor 
about this city attorney r bruce laidlaw said this week 
ann arbor resident sabra briere said she led the effort to get 
the referendum on the april 2 city ballot because abortion bans 
dont stop women from having abortions 
in the event the dark ages return ann arbor will have a core 
group of committed prochoice people anyway briere said 
briere predicted the measure would pass easily in ann arbor a 
city of about 112000 that is home to the university of michigan 
the effect of the proposed revision in the city charter would be 
limited because ann arbor cant prevent state police from 
enforcing state laws laidlaw said the measure wouldnt protect 
doctors from losing their licenses or facing other penalties for 
performing illegal abortions he said 
briere said antiabortion laws dont work she said they didnt 
stop her grandmother from having two abortions in the early 1900s 
i think abortions will be performed all over including in ann 
arbor just as they always have been briere said 
briere headed the effort to gather 4127 signatures to get the 
proposal on the ballot to declare ann arbor a zone of 
reproductive freedom she needed 3720 signatures the measure 
was approved last month for the april election 
ann arbor residents voted overwhelmingly against a 1988 proposal 
to ban statefunded abortions for poor women the measure passed 
statewide by a wide margin 
barbara listing president of the antiabortion group right to 
life of michigan views the 5 fine proposal as a publicity stunt 
by those who believe a woman have a right to have abortions 
i doubt very much if any city could pass a local ordinance 
excluding a state penalty especially for a felony she said 
raeann houbeck who chairs washtenaw county right to life in ann 
arbor urged its members to vote against the proposal 
i think it sends out a message to the rest of the state sort 
of naming ann arbor as an abortion capital of the state which i 
think is appalling she said 
the measure is patterened on an ann arbor charter provision that 
limits the fine for marijuana possession in the city to 5 despite 
stiffer penalties at the state level 
i can tell you we do have more than a legal leg to stand on 
said briere a secretary at the university of michigan who is the 
chairwoman of citizens for reproductive freedom 
a hefty majority in favor of the measure would be a signal to 
lawmakers to avoid restrictions on abortion said carol king 
executive director of the michigan abortion rights action league 
i think its a statement on the part of ann arbor people that 
they think abortion should be legal and available i dont think 
its an empty gesture at all she said

sheriff michael ashes unique solution 
to chronic jail overcrowding commandeering a national guard 
armory may have unlocked new approaches to the problem lawmen 
said 
in these extraordinary times you cant just sit back and 
conduct your operations as business as usual said robert c 
rufo president of the massachusetts sheriffs association 
sheriff ashe took a real public sector entrepreneurial 
approach and was highly creative he said 
ashe got extra space for jail inmates thursday when a judge 
approved a compromise offer from the state for the hampden county 
sheriff to move inmates from the springfield armory to a vacant one 
in holyoke about 10 miles to the north 
holyoke officials promptly launched a legal challenge but 
hampden county superior court judge george keady refused to 
immediately block the compromise he scheduled a hearing on the 
matter for next week 
the saga began feb 16 when ashe shocked state officials by 
marching into the armory and ordering officials to make room for 
prisoners under a 17thcentury statute that orders citizens to give 
suitable aid to law enforcement efforts 
the 102yearold hampden county jail built to hold 279 
prisoners had reached its federal limit of 500 inmates and the 
only alternative to seizing the armory was putting criminals back 
on the streets ashe said 
the sheriffs action which initially met with strong resistance 
from the state government drew the support of sheriffs around the 
country ashe said 
it resurrected all of these unresolved issues which is not 
just here but all over the nation he said 
you have to commend the guy said dick ford executive 
director of the american jail association in hagerstown md he 
took the initiative to do something about which no one else had 
acted 
other sheriffs struggling with crowded jails have taken direct 
action such as selfimposed caps on jail populations ford said 
in massachusetts sheriffs quickly called a meeting after the 
armory takeover and presented a letter to gov michael s dukakis 
expressing their interest in more than two dozen national guard 
armories recently closed because of a fiscal crisis in the state 
rufo said the sheriffs received an encouraging response and will 
meet with state officials next week to talk about the possibility 
of using the empty armories to house overflow inmates

more than half the delegates to the republican 
state convention endorsed steven pierce for governor saturday but 
one of his chief opponents in the gop primary vowed to stay in the 
race 
pierce minority leader in the massachusetts house received a 
socalled supermajority a margin wide enough to allow the gop 
to endorse him before the sept 18 primary 
his chief rival william weld said he would remain in the race 
upsetting state gop chairman raymond shamies plan to get the party 
to unite behind one candidate 
a third gop gubernatorial contender paul cronin failed to get 
enough votes to stay in the race and wont be on the primary ballot 
massachusetts hasnt had a republican governor since 1970 but 
the partys fortunes rose after democratic gov michael s dukakis 
lost his 1988 presidential bid dukakis returned home to find the 
massachusetts economic miracle he made a centerpiece of his 
campaign had collapsed 
i am very gratified and very excited about my victory today 
pierce said were going to win the primary i dont know what 
the margin will be 
the convention vote was 2672 for pierce or 526 percent weld 
received 1845 votes or 363 percent cronin garnered 563 votes 
or 111 percent 
under convention rules candidates needed at least 15 percent of 
the votes to go to the primary 
the rules also provided that a candidate who beat his closest 
rival by 15 percent or more got the supermajority freeing the gop 
from neutrality 
weld a former federal prosecutor made it clear he planned to 
continue his campaign though he didnt question the results of the 
convention vote 
i think my strength is in the primary said weld who has 
positioned himself as more moderate than pierce i think it will 
be a real service to the party and the voters 
shamie stopped short of saying he would ask weld to drop out 
at first shamie said i have no plans to ask bill weld to 
withdraw but later saturday he said i might i might when 
asked the same question 
the state that bragged of having a budget surplus and one of the 
nations lowest unemployment rates before 1988 now has a budget 
deficit of more than 500 million and a jobless rate of 53 
percent which equals the national average the fiscal crisis is 
the top issue in the gubernatorial race 
on the democratic side none of four top candidates for governor 
have emerged to lead the pack they are state rep john flood 
former state attorney general francis bellotti onleave boston 
university president john silber and lt gov evelyn murphy 
republican us rep newt gingrich of georgia told delegates to 
the gop convention that the democratic party in the state is the 
democratic candidates biggest problem 
if you are running as a democrat if you are part of the 
democratic machine you are the problem and electing you cant 
solve it gingrich said

portauprince haiti ap when lt gen prosper avril came to 
power in in 1988 he talked of free elections and leading the 
country toward democracy 
saturday it was avril himself who was on the move he was 
forced from power in a popular uprising by opponents who feared he 
would not make good on his promises 
like many haitian rulers avril came to power in violence and 
left in violence 
a week before the september 1988 coup that brought him to power 
thugs armed with machetes guns and spears stormed the roman 
catholic church of the rev bertrand aristide a popular government 
critic they massacred a dozen people there 
the bloodbath split the military and lowerranking soldiers 
revolted against lt henri namphy he was the army chief of staff 
who took charge of the government after dictator jeanclaude 
duvalier fled to france in february 1986 during another mass 
uprising 
the 1988 soldiers rebellion was apparently not orchestrated by 
avril then army chief of staff but it was avril who finally came 
out on top declaring himself president 
he quickly went on national television and promised the 
impoverished caribbean nation democratic reform and free 
presidential elections haitians accustomed to lies and brutality 
from their leaders were skeptical 
avril a 52yearold with a quiet demeanor never seemed 
comfortable in the public eye his wife marieange is a captain 
in the army and a nurse the couple has four children 
avril had been in the background as a financial adviser to 
francois papa doc duvalier jeanclaudes father who founded 
the 29year duvalier family regime avril later advised duvaliers 
son when he replaced his father 
because of that close relationship critics called avril a 
bagman who reputedly became a millionaire and negotiated 
military weapons and equipment sales abroad 
meanwhile the duvaliers created an authoritarian regime using 
the dreaded forces known as tonton macoutes to keep opponents in 
check 
despite his earlier association with the duvaliers avril won 
some public support a few months into his rule he held public 
meetings with civilian political leaders talked with union leaders 
and restored most of the 1987 constitution that namphy suspended 
he also approved the formation of an independent electoral 
council to organize and oversee this years general elections 
although there was skepticism many thought it was better to 
work with avril than against him 
youre not going to get power if theres not a reasonable 
understanding with those guys marc bazin a presidential hopeful 
and former world bank economist said at the time 
the us government has had mixed feelings about avrils regime 
in its human rights report it said the haitian army was linked to 
human rights abuses in rural areas but that it avoided the 
egregious violations massacres and politically motivated killings 
characteristic of his predecessors 
nevertheless in march 1989 it said the resumption of 60 
million in aid must be tied to democratic reform and cooperation in 
fighting drug trafficking immediately afterward avrils 
government accused four highranking army officers of drug 
trafficking and discharged them 
the next month avril showed he had the loyalty of his 
1100member presidential guard when they put down a rebellion by 
two army units 
but avril started looking more like a dictator 
after the unsolved killing of an army colonel his government 
imposed a state of siege on jan 20 jailed 50 opposition activists 
and sent seven political leaders into exile abroad many detainees 
were reportedly beaten or tortured 
nearly all political parties decided to boycott elections unless 
avril stepped down 
speculation began to swirl monday that avril was on his way out 
after the army killed an 11yearold girl apparently by accident 
mass demonstrations followed and at least three people were killed 
president bush in a speech mentioned haiti in the same breath 
with cuba this time avrils government was characterized as a 
black mark on democracy

groups horman was among many suspected dissidents held and 
executed at santiagos national stadium the military government 
has denied the allegations 
hormans father ed horman pressed for years for details on his 
sons death and wrote a book about his efforts the book provided 
the story for the movie missing starring sissy spacek as 
hormans wife and jack lemmon as the father 
the movie is officially banned in chile maybe now theyll 
show it mrs horman said 
in the ap interview she said she found the country much more 
open and friendly than it was when she and her fatherinlaw were 
ushered out by us diplomats and military authorities on oct 18 
1973 
the air feels lighter its a different place she said 
its not the place i remember 
both mrs horman a 45yearold computer specialist and 
hormans father live in new york city hormans father is not 
attending the inauguration 
on monday the national stadium will be the site of a massive 
celebration to mark the end of pinochets rule

candidate of a centerleft coalition that defeated pinochet in dec 
14 national elections winning 55 percent of the vote

saturday to celebrate chiles return to democracy said the united 
states expects outgoing president general augusto pinochet to honor 
a new era of civilian rule despite his continued control of the 
military 
under the constitution his regime wrote pinochet still heads 
chiles 60000member military 
but quayle told reporters traveling with him that the ultimate 
authority is patricio aylwin being inaugurated president sunday 
on another matter quayle raised the possibility of talking with 
outgoing nicaraguan president daniel ortega also here for aylwins 
inauguration 
he noted that the feb 25 elections in nicaragua and ortegas 
promise to abide by the results and turn over power to violeta 
chamorro makes it a different situation now and leaves no 
reason that i shouldnt talk to ortega 
he said no meeting with ortega was scheduled but added that i 
anticipate it could happen 
during a brief airport arrival ceremony saturday night quayle 
congratulated chileans for bringing the dawn of a new era of 
democracy through election 
sen edward kennedy dmass a member of the us party and 
sponsor of an arms ban against chile responded to chilean 
reporters seeking a comment by proclaiming its extraordinary to 
breath the free air of chile tomorrow is a day that i would not 
have missed in all the world 
quayle was to meet sunday with pinochet for what he called a 
short meeting in the line of protocol he said he would carry 
messages from various individuals including president bush 
during his stay in chile quayle said he expected to raise the 
matter of the united states continued unsuccessful attempts to 
extradite two chilean military officers wanted for trial in the 
1976 killing in washington of exiled former chilean cabinet 
minister orlando letelier 
earlier in bridgetown barbados quayle wrapped up talks with 
caribbean leaders by pledging greater us assistance to the region 
chile became the last country in south america to return to 
democracy 
a potentially troubled future already looms with pinochet 
insisting on retaining control of the countrys 60000 strong 
military and victims of human rights abuses vowing to file 
thousands of criminal complaints against the military 
pinochet called the dec 14 election that aylwin won after 
voters rejected a referendum in october 1988 that would have 
extended his rule to 1997 
quayle on saturday met with six caribbean heads of state in a 
session hosted by barbados prime minister lloyd erskine sandiford 
quayle told reporters the meeting focused on economic 
development issues of concern to barbados dominica st vincent 
and the grenadines st kitts st lucia and antigua 
i had it pointed out to me very clearly the lack of 
adequate contribution this year from the united states to the 
region he said 
i believe next year we will be able to do better he added 
but refused to give any dollar amounts 
the talks covered educational opportunities and reforms in the 
way we approach agriculture and other economic development 
quayle said 
they touched only briefly on antidrug cooperation said 
quayles press secretary david beckwith the meeting came a day 
after the pentagon announced it would increase aircraft and warship 
presence in the caribbean to step up interdiction efforts 
quayle repeated what is becoming a refrain for his trip to 
barbados and south america he said people in the region should not 
believe the united states is overlooking them because of the 
intense interest in the eastern europe reforms 
we are interested in the world and we are particularly 
interested in the western hemisphere he said 
we are all americans he said adding the caribbean is a 
priority with bush

an organization of colorado physicians may no 
longer negotiate prices with hospitals and insurance companies on 
behalf of its members a federal judge has ruled in a lawsuit 
brought by the state 
the ruling friday concluded a state attorney generals 
pricefixing investigation into the colorado union of physicians 
and surgeons which has more than 100 members 
state attorney general duane woodard said us district judge 
sherman g finesilver barred the organization from acting as a 
collective bargaining unit on behalf of the physicians it 
represents many of whom are in direct competition 
the groups telephone number is unlisted 
a state complaint contended the organization violated federal 
and state antitrust laws by engaging in a pattern of pricefixing 
woodard said the organization with members in denver and 
pueblo is not a bona fide labor union and its physician members 
are not employees 
therefore the collective bargaining done by cups with various 
hospitals and health insurance plans is an illegal restraint of 
trade and amounts to pricefixing he said 
the organization agreed in a settlement of the complaint to pay 
the state 8000 for investigative costs and attorneys fees 
the complaint said the doctors group and its members agreed on 
reimbursement for providing medical services to patients then 
would negotiate for increased compensation with insurance 
companies hospitals and health maintenance organizations 
the complaint alleged that the group and its members threatened 
termination of existing contracts with insurance companies 
hospitals and health maintenance organizations and threatened 
patients with billing on a fee for service basis if the 
companies refused to cooperate 
garth lucero first assistant attorney general said a fee for 
service basis meant a patient would have been unable to get 
reimbursed for medical treatment

sandinistas have resisted calls from the outgoing and incoming 
governments to lay down their weapons about 11000 contras are 
based in border camps in honduras 
the law of general amnesty and reconciliation was introduced 
thursday replacing an earlier version that prompted significant 
opposition the wording of the new version was changed to make the 
amnesty more sweeping 
the amnesty covers public employees who presumably committed 
crimes of failing in their duties fraud or theft and have not been 
prosecuted between july 1979 when the sandinistas came to power 
and the day the law takes effect 
legislators said it will take effect between march 2023 when it 
is published in the official government gazette 
edwin illescas of the democratic conservative party said he 
supported the law because he recognized that by holding elections 
the sandinistas were working for peace he said similar laws had 
been passed in argentina uruguay and chile and hastened the return 
of democracy 
the law says it is designed to contribute to the national 
reconciliation of all the sectors of society with the goal of peace 
and tranquillity to nicaraguan families 
the union of nicaraguan families needs the pardon and to 
forget those deeds that brought anxiety and restlessness in the 
nation 
the law is not to protect criminals but benefits people 
who have worked more than 10 years protecting the revolution 
nunez said 
the sandinistas hold 61 seats in the present legislature to 35 
for the opposition the 14party national opposition union will 
hold a majority in the new legislature with the sandinistas 
remaining the largest single party

from each of us a responsible attitude he said standing erect 
in a white dress army uniform with the presidential sash 
i want the best for my country and i always will be ready to 
serve her pinochet said 
the 74yearold general plans to stay on as commander of the 
60000man army despite requests by aylwin that he fully retire 
in 1988 a proposal to extend pinochets rule to 1997 was 
defeated in a referendum and the loss forced him to call elections

of 17 centrist and leftist parties won 55 percent of the vote his 
closest challenger a former pinochet finance minister won 29 
percent

new halffinished congressional palace for sundays inaugural 
ceremony others in santiago swept up debris from a series of small 
terrorist bomb blasts friday that left one person injured 
about 40 relatives and sympathizers of leftists jailed on 
terrorism charges staged a protest inside santiagos downtown 
cathedral on saturday occupying the pews but the protest was 
peaceful and they vacated the building without incident after about 
seven hours 
a spokesman for the protesters mirnas rivas told reporters 
there can be no transition to democracy in chile if political 
prisoners arent freed aylwin has said he favors freeing 
prisoners of conscience but not those convicted of guerrilla or 
terrorist actions 
the military government says all of those now jailed are charged 
or convicted in connection with guerrilla activity 
pinochet took power in september 1973 in a bloody coup that 
toppled the elected government of president salvador allende an 
avowed marxist during a period of political and economic disorder 
he suspended congress and launched a harsh crackdown on leftists 
and dissidents that earned his government a worldwide reputation 
for systematic human rights abuses 
also attending aylwins inauguration will be joyce horman widow 
of charles horman an american freelance journalist whose arrest 
and killing during the 1973 coup inspired the movie missing 
according to the family and testimony collected by human rights 
groups horman was among many suspected dissidents held and 
executed at santiagos national stadium the military government 
has denied the allegations 
mrs horman of new york was invited by the new government and 
was expected to attend several events surrounding the inauguration 
she arrived saturday 
police said at least 11 small bombs went off across santiago 
during a 45minute period late friday night no one claimed 
responsibility for the blasts 
in one of the explosions in an underground tool shed at a city 
park near the downtown us consulate one worker was injured in 
the face and hands police said 
other bombs went off at or near several government offices a 
mormon chapel a courthouse an army colonels house and two 
businesses aylwin characterized the bombings as strange 
he spoke to reporters in front of his home before leaving for 
valparaiso where he planned to spend the night 
small groups of leftist extremists are active in chile but 
there is widespread suspicion that at least in some cases the 
attacks attributed to them are the work of rightists who want to 
exaggerate the leftist threat

the roman catholic archbishop of los angeles 
has asked elderly nuns and priests to volunteer to be inoculated 
with an experimental aids vaccine 
archbishop roger mahony has sent a letter to the 3500 priests 
and nuns in the los angeles archdiocese seeking 10 volunteers age 
65 or older the prototype vaccine was developed by dr jonas salk 
father of the commercial polio vaccine 
the appeal was first reported by the chicago tribune which said 
some scientists are concerned about the proposed experiment and the 
safety of salks vaccine that is because the prototype vaccine is 
the only one among several being developed that is made from the 
whole aids virus 
critics say that if live strains of the virus contaminate the 
vacine the volunteers could be accidentally infected the paper 
said in its sunday editions 
the main reason for seeking volunteers from the ranks of the 
church was that they presumably would be most unlikely to have been 
infected with aids through the two most common means sexual 
intercourse or intravenous drug use the paper said 
the rev kevin kostelnik who was working saturday night at st 
vibianas church adjacent to mahonys residence said a letter 
requesting volunteers was sent out two months ago 
the letter really didnt go into detail kostelnik said i 
work in the office so i didnt see the need to respond to it 
kostelnik said he couldnt recall the details of the letter but 
that it was sent to all the nuns and priests in los angeles and was 
seeking five to ten volunteers 
mahony is in rome until march 19 kostelnik said 
scores of americans were infected with polio in the early 1950s 
when salk used the same technique in developing the polio vaccine 
that eventually saved thousands of lives 
a government investigation later determined the infections 
resulted when the virus contained in the vaccine hadnt been 
killed as it was supposed to have been 
thus if any of the volunteers were to test positive later for 
the aids virus the infection could be traced directly to live 
virus that had contaminated the vaccine 
the appeal by mahony to the religious community was accompanied 
by a letter in which dr brian henderson of the university of 
southern california said salk would be the first volunteer 
the 75yearold salk works at the la jolla calif institute 
that bears his name 
henderson one of salks collaborators added another reason for 
appealing to priests and nuns the need for individuals who would 
find a role as such a volunteer a meaningful part of their life 
salk said he hasnt inoculated himself or any voluteers because 
the proposed experiment had yet to be approved by california 
authorities the tribune said 
salk developed the first polio vaccine which was pronounced 
safe and effective on april 12 1955 the deadvirus vaccine was 
administered by injection 
in the 1960s an oral polio vaccine was developed by dr albert 
sabin and it has generally replaced the salk vaccine in part 
because of the ease of giving it the vaccine developed by sabin is 
also more potent and longlasting but because it uses tamed live 
virus one of about every 32 million doses results in paralytic 
polio according to the centers for disease control in atlanta

portauprince haiti ap haitian ruler lt gen prosper 
avril who rose to power 18 months ago in a revolt by prodemocracy 
soldiers resigned saturday during a popular uprising against his 
military regime 
the embattled haitian leader turned over power to maj gen 
herard abraham the army chief of staff who said he would transfer 
rule to a civilianled government within 72 hours abraham said the 
interim government would prepare for elections but did not give a 
date 
diplomat sources speaking on condition of anonymity said avril 
would leave the country within two days there was no word on where 
he would go and how he would get there 
immediately after avrils resignation members of a coalition of 
opposition parties disagreed over the provisions for abrahams rule 
and there also was discord over who would lead the civilian 
government the opposition members later met with abraham and it 
was not immediately known whether they reached agreement they 
scheduled a news conference for sunday morning 
it was haitis fifth change of government since february 1986 
when dictator jeanclaude baby doc duvalier fled the 
impoverished caribbean nation into exile in france 
avrils departure followed five days of mass protests his 
opponents said they no longer trusted him to usher in fair 
elections that had been scheduled for october 
thousands of residents poured into the streets of the capital to 
celebrate youths erected flaming tire barricades at major 
intersections and black smoke filled the sky over the capital 
the television station telehaiti said teenagers shouted 
slogans outside the house of a special police agent in the slum 
suburb of martissant and that the agent and backers wildly 
opened fire killing six radio metropole said seven were killed 
sporadic gunfire was heard throughout the capital 
portauprince and there were power outages in some neighborhoods 
independent radio metropole said the houses of some duvalier and 
avril sympathizers had been ransacked and their cars burned on 
radio talk shows callers demanded that avril be thrown out of the 
country 
abraham in uniform appeared on state television at 305 pm 
est to announce avrils resignation 
in light of the resignation of the military government of lt 
gen prosper avril the armed forces of haiti accept the heavy 
task abraham said in french 
the mission is clear and the objective is precise to 
reestablish peace and order within 72 hours so in conformity with 
the constitution a provisional government can organize elections 
abraham and the army want to give the interim presidency to 
supreme court president gilbert austin who had been appointed by 
avril as chief justice last year after serving as the generals 
justice minister 
however the opposition coalition called the unity assembly 
said he would be a puppet of the army and that it wanted him to 
resign as president of the high court 
it is the president of the supreme court who according to the 
constitution should be president austin said saturday night 
there had been speculation that 51yearold avril wanted to 
return to his old job as army chief of staff however telehaiti 
an independent television station said he was retiring from the 
army 
radio metropole said avril left the palace saturday afternoon 
and was at his private residence in the wealthy suburb of canape 
vert on the hills overlooking portauprince 
conservative leader hubert de ronceray one of seven prominent 
politicians forced into exile in a government crackdown in january 
said avrils resignation was an encouraging first step 
but prosper avril is still a public danger if he stays in 
haiti said de ronceray speaking by telephone from miami 
another exile louis roy principal author of haitis 1987 
constitution said from the caribbean island of martinique that the 
haitian people had risen and overthrown a regime which had tried 
to destroy its desire for a democratic form of government 
but he added it remains to be seen whether the army deserves 
the confidence which has been placed in it 
in washington the bush administration welcomed the promise by 
haitis new leader to set the stage for national elections by 
turning over power within 72 hours 
the statement said the united states long has called for 
improved human rights in haiti and added we obviously hope the 
latest developments contribute to a realization of this objective 
telehaiti said the interim president would be advised by an 
11member council representing civic groups churches the army and 
eight provincial districts 
earlier the opposition coalition had said it wanted supreme 
court vice president gabriel volcy as the new provisional head but 
antoine izmery a prominent businessman who belongs to the unity 
assembly said volcy refused 
he said its an allout war if abraham remains in power for 
72 hours 
however other political leaders were more conciliatory 
mark bazin an economist who leads a centerright party said he 
was reassured about abrahams good faith to play according to the 
rules he did not elaborate 
avril came to power in september 1988 in a coup by 
noncommissioned officers he promised to hand over power to a 
civilian government after elections this fall but critics said a 
brutal crackdown in january on government critics made clear that 
avril intended to renege on that promise and make himself a 
dictator 
speculation avril might be on his way out began growing monday 
after a soldier killed an 11yearold girl apparently accidentally 
during a demonstration the killing set off a spate of violent 
antigovernment protests across the country that resulted in the 
deaths of at least three people 
haiti the poorest country in the hemisphere has been ruled by 
force of arms for most of its history since independence from 
france in 1804 
after jeanclaude duvalier went into exile in 1986 he was 
replaced by lt gen henri namphy duvaliers army chief of staff 
he headed a threeman provisional junta that was to rule until 
elections for a new government 
the first election attempt in november 1987 was called off hours 
into the vote after thugs killed at least 34 voters and confiscated 
ballots in january 1988 leslie manigat a university professor 
was elected president few haitians voted and most opposition 
leaders refused to participate 
five months later namphy entered the picture again his troops 
deposed manigat who had tried to fire namphy avril replaced 
namphy in the coup of september 1988

the senate agreed friday to protect cities 
along the southwest border from proposed clean air sanctions if 
their pollution comes from mexico 
the government in assessing whether a city or region is in 
compliance with clean air standards would have to consider whether 
the emissions originate across the border according to the 
amendment to the clean air bill 
without this amendment if the pollution in juarez continues 
to get worse it could technically shut down el paso because of 
pollution someone else is causing said sponsor phil gramm 
rtexas 
it is imperative to not let cities along the border in texas 
new mexico arizona and california be penalized for pollution that

from this administration

the post which had been vacant since december 1988 when william 
bradford reynolds resigned

bushs new york campaign he had a powerful booster in attorney 
general dick thornburgh whom he has known since 1972 when they 
traveled to japan among a group of young american political leaders 
dunne was a new york state senator for 24 years resigning last 
year after losing a race for majority leader dunne is a partner in 
the uniondale ny law firm of rivkin radler dunne amp bayh 
civil rights groups criticized dunnes almost nonexistent civil 
rights record but none opposed his nomination many had praise for 
the work he did helping to reform the new york prison system after 
the deadly 1971 riot at attica state prison 
but dunne drew fire for having held longtime memberships in the 
fort orange club in albany ny and the garden city golf club on 
long island ny the fort orange admitted women in 1988 the golf 
club is still sexsegregated 
during his confirmation hearing dunne expressed regret at 
having joined the clubs

electronic battlefield in utah have been scrapped because of cuts 
in the military budget sen jake garn said 
garn rutah met thursday with air force lt col neal branford 
and an air force fiscal analyst the senator had sought the meeting 
following rumors that the future of the battlefield proposed for 
utahs western desert was in jeopardy

military budget cuts president bush has proposed and with congress 
expected to make even deeper cuts in the pentagon budget the 
battlefield simply will not be built the officials also said 
the costs of the battlefield had grown over what they had 
originally estimated garn said 
the air force requested no money for the battlefield in the 
fiscal 1991 budget the air force officials told garn their 
projected fiveyear budget also includes no money for the 
battlefield

simulation ranges in other states most likely nevada and 
california will be upgraded

sophisticated electronic combat simulation devices throughout the 
states west desert were jubilant over the announcement

a frustrated font of trivia 
old richard is just going bananas sen alan simpson 
rwyo the assistant gop leader said in a fiveminute floor 
speech devoted primarily to attacks on gephardt 
gephardt this week criticized president bush for failing to 
wield leadership in eastern europe and proposed to provide direct 
economic aid to the soviet union white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater fired back that gephardt has become the maxwell smart 
of politics likening the missouri democrat to the bumbling 
character of the 1960s get smart tv show 
simpson while acknowledging that gephardt is talented and 
articulate complained he has taken some pretty personal potshots 
at the president he seems to delight in that i think its time 
to take a swift look at the institutional life of this frustrated 
font of trivia about our fine president 
simpson said gephardts criticism was prompted by the failure of 
his race for the democratic presidential nomination and the success 
of the bush campaign for the white house 
it doesnt take any brains to be a critic simpson said 
anyone can qualify all you need is a shrill voice and usually a 
human target 
gephardt communications director david dreyer said in a 
statement that it shows a low opinion of the american people when 
the republicans launch a personal attack against congressman 
gephardt who is urging greater american leadership to advance 
democracy in the eastern bloc

federal regulators sold a failed texas savings 
institution friday to a holding company controlled by financier 
ronald o perelman in a deal that will cost the government 890 
million 
the buyer is putting up 10 million 
the resolution trust corp created in august to dispose of 
failed thrifts sold san antonio savings savings association to 
first gibraltar holdings inc 
the holding company already owns first gibraltar bank a 
dallasbased sampl with assets of over 9 billion it was formed in 
1988 from five smaller insolvent sampls in a much criticized bailout 
deal that required 51 billion in federal assistance and favorable 
tax breaks 
the name of the san antonio sampl will be changed to first 
gibraltar bank but it will be maintained as a separate financial 
institution earlier this week the resolution trust corp board 
voted to allow thrifts created in earlier bailouts to bid for newly 
failed sampls 
however because congress has ordered the corporation to review 
the old bailouts the agency is requiring first gibralatar holdings 
to maintain the san antonio institution as a separately capitalized 
entity 
the corporation said first gibraltars proposal was the cheapest

the motorman who operated a subway train 
during a fatal derailment this week tested positive for cocaine 
and federal investigators friday found problems with other cars 
that run the same underground line 
john k lauber of the national transportation safety board said 
urine tests uncovered traces of cocaine in the motormans system 
louis gambaccini general manager of the southeastern pennsylvania 
transportation authority said the motorman would be suspended as 
of monday 
no other details about the employee including his name were 
released 
investigators believe a motor under a subway car became 
dislodged wednesday hitting a switch and sending half the sixcar 
train onto a second set of tracks the fourth car smashed into 
steel support beams killing three passengers and trapping 
survivors 
of 94 injured 10 were still hospitalized friday all in good or 
satisfactory condition hospital officials said 
a 37block stretch of the subway and elevated train line 
remained closed friday with buses ferrying passengers through west 
philadelphia service was expected to resume monday 
in another development lauber said inspectors examined 76 
motors on 19 cars they found 27 pins installed incorrectly in nuts 
that help hold the motors under the cars 
septa has agreed to thoroughly inspect all cars running the 
line lauber said 
the motor that became partially dislodged and was dragged along 
the subway tracks shortly before wednesdays crash should have been 
attached to the car by a long vertical bolt held on by a nut with 
a cotter pin inserted through the bolt and nut 
a horizontal bolt and safety bracket would have been a backup in 
case the vertical bolt came loose but the safety bracket two 
thick steel loops that normally hold a horizontal bolt had worn 
through in two places 
in addition the nut and cotter pin holding the vertical bolt 
onto the car apparently were lost before the crash lauber said 
the safety bracket tore loose and the motor fell he said the 
motor gouged a 1500foot section of railroad ties before hitting 
the crossover switch and jerking the last three cars to a second 
set of tracks lauber said 
the fourth car was peeled open and nearly cut in half by steel 
support beams seven people were trapped including the three who 
died 
ntsb investigators had been told of at least three times once 
during the past six months once from 1980 to 1982 and once in 1975 
when motors broke loose lauber said 
but investigators did not know whether those motors had fallen 
to the tracks ntsb spokesman alan pollock said friday were 
trying to get the exact details he said 
erich vogel chief mechanical officer for septa confirmed that 
bolts had come loose previously but he believed the motors always 
had been caught by the safety brackets 
ive been here since 1985 and we havent lost a motor that i 
know of he said 
the cars are inspected visually once a month and more thoroughly 
every 12000 miles or about four to five months vogel said each 
car also has an annual inspection the most thorough of the three 
types he said

pigs may not need encouragement to belly 
up to the feed trough but scientists are looking for ways to make 
swine more efficient eaters 
researchers are trying to determine if bacteria found in the 
digestive tracts of american buffalo can be implanted in pigs and 
help farmers save money fattening their hogs for market 
we know what it does in the test tube we dont know yet what 
happens in the animal says vincent varel a research 
microbiologist for the governments agricultural research service 
a lot could be riding on the outcome of the tests at the 
department of agricultures us meat animal research center at 
clay center neb 
feed represents about half a farmers production costs an 
efficient lowcost method to improve the digestive process and 
increase the weight gain from each pound of feed would lower farm 
costs and increase the chance of operating profitably 
the studies are of special interest in iowa which accounts for 
one out of every four hogs raised for market in the united states 
the livestock feed industry also is interested and varel says 
four feed companies already have contacted him to find out how the 
studies are progressing 
varel says the research is preliminary and that even if 
successful it would be at least five years before farmers could 
apply the results to their hogs 
the studies are focusing on a bacterium known as clostridium 
longisporum found in bison when fed or implanted in pigs the 
bacterium stimulates production of a new yettobenamed 
microorganism which previously has not been found in pigs 
the new organism better degrades fiber in pigs fed corn and 
soybeans metabolic studies will be done to determine how much 
energy the pig derives from this organism if the fiberdegrading 
activity in pigs is increased producers may be able to switch to 
less expensive feeds such as feed grains from ethanol 
production the agricultural research service says in a synopsis 
of its studies 
varel says researchers suspected such an organism existed in 
bison because those beasts do a better job digesting a poor quality 
diet than domestic cows do 
in the test tube researchers found the organism degrades 
cellulose fiber 15 percent better than other organisms and decided 
lets try it in the pig and see what happens there varel said 
in a telephone interview 
so far no side effects have been found and none are suspected 
he says 
the initial round of tests has determined the microorganism can 
be established in pigs and a new test will see if it can be done 
consistently 
the next step is to compare the metabolism of pigs that have the 
organism with pigs that do not metabolism is the process of 
breaking down food into energy and waste matter 
to find out researchers will analyze what goes into the pigs 
mouth and what comes out the other end 
the object is to see if this organism is having an effect on 
growth he says within the next year we will have a good idea 
if we can consistently establish it and whether it has an effect on 
the animals or not 
eventually scientists will want to determine if the organism 
helps pigs add lean tissue or fat varel also says researchers will 
want to know if the organism makes pigs eat less because they make 
better use of what they are fed 
we just dont have all the answers yet he says

nbcs jane pauley safely away from the woes and 
slipping ratings of the today show she once cohosted starts 
life anew in prime time tuesday with an appropriately entitled 
special changes 
her own changes include anchoring a primetime news series that 
nbc once said might start this summer however it has no executive 
producer yet and may not arrive until fall or even january she 
says 
but she doesnt consider this the nbc news version of waiting 
for godot 
i think its very sensible pauley says of the delay in her 
view corporations dont normally behave sensibly if there is 
some pressure to put something on the air but this strikes me as a 
very rational way to approach a weekly series and im very pleased 
with that 
on saturday pauley who also has been filling in for tom brokaw 
on the nbc nightly news leaves for east germany to start 
another documentary on sports there a few more documentaries lie 
ahead after that 
tuesdays special is about three people and one couple whose 
lives are in transition work on the first story about frank 
morgan a 56yearold acclaimed jazz saxophonist who spent much of 
his life in prison began in december 
that was the month that pauley her contract extended to 1992 
bid adieu to 13 years of predawn wakeups for today she had 
told its audience in october she was leaving and got a hug then 
from her successor deborah norville 
but since january today hasnt exactly been hugged by 
viewers even though pauley took pains in october to assure them 
she wasnt at odds with norville or cohost bryant gumbel whom she 
called her friends 
although nbc executives say they have no research to indicate 
it today likely was hurt and abcs good morning america 
helped by the turmoil preceding pauleys decision to leave 
those offcamera troubles last year included the leak of 
gumbels caustic memo criticizing staffers notably weatherman 
willard scott and the decision of nbc executives including 
today vice president dick ebersol to replace veteran today 
news anchor john palmer with norville 
although nbc officials have said they expected a dip in 
today ratings when norville moved up from news anchor to 
succeed pauley in january the dip now is in its third month 
abcs good morning america easily won the important february 
ratings sweeps the results used by tv stations to set their 
advertising rates it averaged a 45 rating which was good news 
for abc affiliates 
no so for nbc affiliates today according to nbcs 
estimate had a 365 average in the sweeps well below the 46 it 
had in february 1989 when it won the reveille ratings race each 
ratings point now represents 921000 homes 
pauley who last year kept a stiff upper lip and never publicly 
complained about the behindcamera woes at today is 
sympathetic to its current ratings problems 
well ive been there before she says harking back to a 
time when she cohosted today with brokaw and the nielsen 
verdict was that good morning america then hosted by david 
hartman had become no 1 
it was almost a relief when it finally happened she says 
because from that moment on we were able to scramble and get our 
act together and come back 
she thinks the same thing will happen again and that those in 
charge of today including new executive producer tom capra 
will be able to put together something that comes on pretty 
strong 
pauley laughed uproariously when asked about an upcoming report 
in the national enquirer confiding that nbc on bended knee had 
begged her to return to today and that she has agreed to 
interview guests on two of five shows each week starting in april 
totally bogus she said 
her own thoughts about the today turmoil and its effect on 
the shows ratings 
obviously i cant personalize it she said and yet i 
think that an explanation is that there were dislocations shall 
we say on the today show and i think that bothers people 
especially early in the morning 
its not just that jane is gone its just that there was 
too much disruption in the morning you want er regularity

both say they do not want war in 
kashmir but india and pakistan are preparing their armies to turn 
the lush rugged region into a battleground for the third time 
since 1947 
an estimated 240000 indian soldiers supported by armor and 
aircraft are in kashmir a provocation or misunderstanding arising 
from the moslem insurgency in indias part of the region could send 
them into action 
india and pakistan have fought over the mountains and valleys of 
kashmir since britain carved the subcontinent into two nations 
along hindu and moslem religious lines and granted them 
independence 43 years ago 
on the indian side of the 41yearold truce line nearly 200 
people have been killed since late january in battles between 
kashmiri moslem secessionists and indian troops 
militarily speaking it is a nearwar scenario both sides are 
ready a retired indian infantry officer in srinagar said 
speaking on condition of anonymity the irony of the situation is 
that both sides claim day after day that they do not want war 
in baramulla a major indian army base and the last town before 
the ceasefire line convoys of army trucks and artillery roll 
toward the frontier 25 miles away soldiers in battle fatigues 
practice battle tactics firing live rounds at mock targets 
the military activity you see here is more or less normal 
chewang phunsog chief civilian administrator of the strategic 
border districts baramulla and kupwara said in an interview 
i do not know if a war is on the cards but if we are drawn 
into it the other side will not find us lacking he said 
in islamabad a spokesman for pakistans defense ministry said a 
buildup of indian paramilitary forces had occurred along the 
frontier 
we think it is primarily for internal security but it can 
always be used once its there said the spokesman whose name 
cannot be used under briefing rules 
indian military sources said the number of troops deployed in 
jammukashmir the only indian state with a moslem majority had 
grown from 150000 a few months ago to about 240000 
at least three border incidents have occurred since an indian 
crackdown on kashmiri separatists began jan 20 
the most serious was feb 5 when about 4000 pakistani 
civilians tried to cross the border to help their moslem brethren 
troopers opened fire killing as many as 10 according to indian 
newspapers 
here was a classic case of provocation said an indian 
officer in srinagar summer capital of jammukashmir who also 
would not let his name be used 
we could have killed a thousand of them but we did not 
because that could have escalated into a major confrontation he 
said today political consideration comes first but if we are 
pushed and pushed we may not have any option but to go flat out 
india and pakistan fought their first war in 1948 it officially 
ended with the declaration of a unsponsored truce in january 
1949 and kashmir has been divided since 
in 1965 they fought a second war over kashmir it lasted 16 
days and ended with no real gains for either side 
their third war in 1971 did not concern the disputed region 
india entered the civil war between east pakistan and west pakistan 
and helped transform east pakistan into independent bangladesh 
on paper india has a great military advantage it has 136 
million men in the armed forces and 240000 in reserve compared 
with 500000 men under arms in pakistan 
india has 3150 battle tanks to pakistans 1600 and 714 
warplanes to pakistans 338 the indian aircraft include advanced 
soviet mig29s and pakistan has us f16s 
the 35member un military observer group continues the task it 
began four decades ago

st patrick is a 
protestant and a catholic too in the town where tradition says he 
is buried 
things that would separate us nowadays would not separate us 
from st patrick said the rev tj simpson a presbyterian who 
will be preaching in the church near the grave on st patricks day 
our common ground is st patricks ground said simpson 
general secretary of the presbyterian church in ireland 
very little can be proved about patricks life and work but 
tradition associates him strongly with the counties of northern 
ireland where a cycle of sectarian violence began more than 20 
years ago 
roman catholics anglicans methodists and presbyterians will 
pray together on st patricks day in this placid town 20 miles 
southeast of belfast close to the places where patrick is believed 
to have begun his mission and won his first converts 
this is what people find hard to understand said the rev 
brian mayne whose anglican cathedral is host for the service a 
big slab of granite marking patricks grave is south of the church 
tower 
we take it for granted that people of all persuasions would be 
involved mayne said its a recognition that downpatrick is 
patrick 
their common ground is not the legendary figure who drove the 
snakes from ireland and had more powerful magic than the druids 
but the 5th century missionary as he describes himself in his 
confession 
the modern protestant evangelical would be surprised at how 
modern patrick is said brian turner curator of the down museum 
a few hundred yards from the grave site 
he is very biblically based he is always quoting the bible as 
justification for what he does 
turner a methodist finds the protestant in patricks 
description of his inner turmoil while he was a captive in ireland 
and forced to herd flocks 
the lord there made me aware of my unbelief that i might at 
last advert to my sins and turn wholeheartedly to the lord my 
god patrick writes in his confession one of the few pieces 
of writing to survive from that time in ireland 
he showed concern for my weakness and pity for my youth and 
ignorance he watched over me before i got to know him and before i 
was able to distinguish good from evil 
in other words turner says patrick claimed he was saved by 
grace a fundamental principle of the reformation 
canon joseph p maguire at the roman catholic cathedral also is 
attracted to this patrick 
st patrick was a humble man of great faith maguire said 
pointing to the saints declaration that while a captive he 
prayed a hundred times by day and as many by night 
i would hope that the image of st patrick for this present 
day is as a healer and reconciler and as a person of prayer he 
said but added we have a sneaking regard a regard for the man 
of the snakes and shamrocks 
a few years ago maguire became the first roman catholic to 
preach in the anglican cathedral since the reformation 
despite all the clerical talk of ecumenism the visitor may get 
a strong feeling of division 
two miles away in saul the traditional site of patricks 
landing in 432 there are an anglican church at an old monastic 
site and a large statue of st patrick atop a nearby hill 
appropriated by the catholics 
both were erected in 1932 for the 1500th anniversary of 
patricks arrival 
people come to downpatrick and they say when did st patrick 
become a protestant maguire said and related an old joke that 
st patrick became a protestant in 1932 
mayne winced at hearing that gibe repeated and insisted the 
church of ireland has always celebrated st patrick 
simpson grew up in ballymena near mount slemish where st 
patrick is said to have been a herdsman i as a child was very 
close to all that he said 
turner thinks downpatrick is untypical in its regard for 
patrick in armagh the seat supposedly chosen by patrick there 
are no plans for ecumenical services on the 17th 
there will be the usual parade in dublin which is cheerfully 
conceded to be a copy of the one in new york and shamrocks will be 
distributed at many catholic church services 
the state primary school in downpatrick usually closes on st 
patricks day turner said although it is not an official holiday 
and the great majority of the schools pupils are protestants

the prochoice training film at a recent 
candidate workshop was most notable for its audience and its star 
the candidates were republicans getting a prochoice message 
from one of their own gop rep connie morella of maryland 
shes still at odds with her president and her partys platform 
on abortion but in the new gop a gop that says it is scrapping 
litmus tests in favor of a big tent that takes in many views 
morella no longer is a dissident shes a role model for 
likeminded republicans 
were proof that there can be differences of opinion 
morella says 
the gop never was as singleminded as its platform suggests 
plenty of its members have long supported abortion rights for 
example 
but that diversity has been widely acknowledged only since last 
november when antiabortion republicans lost the new jersey and 
virginia gubernatorial elections in races where abortion was a key 
issue 
it was less than two years ago that gop leaders turned off rep 
nancy johnsons microphone when she moved to delete some 
antiabortion language from the republican platform at a party 
meeting in new orleans 
johnson rconn doesnt think that would happen now 
we have moved from a climate in which the party was trying to 
avoid the issue to a climate in which not only is discussion seen 
as inevitable but people are beginning to reevaluate their 
positions she said 
some republican women in congress attribute the partys new 
openness to reawakened consciences but others are less charitable 
there is a greater desire clearly motivated by political 
expediency to make the issue less black and white says rep 
claudine schneider rri who is running for the senate 
either way the women say the end results are the same a 
greater sensitivity to womens concerns and a possible windfall of 
support for bills that are important to women voters 
they dont want to get hung with being antiwoman or 
antiprogress says rep lynn martin rill another candidate 
for the senate people are looking for areas that all sides can 
come together on legislators always like finding the middle 
some gestures are cosmetic such as a recent stampede to honor 
women in sports but there also could be new support for more 
substantive options including bills to provide better child care 
benefits jobprotected family leave easier adoptions and better 
nutrition and health care programs for pregnant women and children 
several antiabortion lawmakers from both parties have said 
theyll back a new contraceptive research bill a shift that is 
encouraging to house cosponsors olympia snowe rmaine and 
patricia schroeder dcolo 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan sees a willingness among some 
legislators to look at family planning in a new light they are 
saying wait a minute this is not an abortion issue this is a 
preventive issue its about health counseling and a support 
system she said 
some gop women say the true test of any attitude shift will be 
whether the mostly male congress shows any urgency to pass bills 
that would expand the federal child care role and require most 
employers to offer unpaid leave to new parents 
rep marge roukema rnj sees improved prospects for the 
family leave bill in light of developments in her home state where 
such a measure was approved by the legislature in a special 
session the bill had been considered dead until antiabortion 
republican jim courter lost the gubernatorial election by a wide 
margin 
theres no doubt about the political dynamics roukema said 
of the turnaround in new jersey a lot of people who were afraid 
they were on the wrong side of the choice question reassessed 
their positions and voted for the bill 
roukema said shes signed up more supporters for the national 
familyleave bill as a result of what happened in new jersey and 
a lot of people have told me they are keeping their options open 
some prochoice gop activists would like their allies in 
congress to press for relaxed rules on abortion itself among other 
things they want to restore federal funds for all medicaid 
abortions and enact a freedom of choice act that would take the 
future of abortion rights out of the supreme courts hands 
but many gop women say such crusades are bound to fail 
those are the kinds of changes that legislators are leery 
of martin said they are looking for a different package that 
could let people work together 
but if most republicans are not prepared to do an aboutface on 
abortion many may be ready to approach the issue in a less 
confrontational way prochoice women say they hope that will 
improve chances for restoring federal medicaid abortion funds for 
victims of rape and incest 
president bush condones abortion under those circumstances and 
might be persuaded to release federal medicaid dollars if there 
were strict regulations according to snowe and others who have met 
with him on the subject 
hopefully we can soften the partys position and bring some 
political benefits snowe said the republican party is going 
to be looking for ways to modify the whole issue

the junk bond kingpin is dead long live the 
junk bond market 
thats the theme that has emerged in many wall street post 
mortems of drexel burnham lambert now that a month has passed 
since the dominant firm in underwriting and trading of 
lowerquality bonds collapsed into bankruptcy proceedings 
on first reaction drexels demise came as a severe blow to the 
junk market by abruptly removing from the scene the chief advocate 
of highyield finance 
participants in the market lost their primary sponsor 
facilitator and cheerleader even greater perhaps was the 
symbolic impact on the faith and trust of junk bond investors 
nevertheless some observers say the junk bond market seems 
very likely to endure once the current storms have passed indeed 
they add the latest developments may actually prove a boon to 
fanciers of junk in its original sense the depressed bonds of 
companies in trouble 
its likely that what weve known as the junk market in recent 
years with its emphasis on takeover bonds is gone say analysts 
at ids financial services inc in minneapolis 
but highyield securities are a legitimate investment and the 
highyield market will emerge from the current situation in some 
form 
in fact the shakeout now occurring should remove some of the 
excesses that have gone on in recent years and result in a market 
that is more fundamentally sound 
perhaps the greatest irony in the current picture observers 
say is that trouble in the new sectors of the junk bond game may 
well expand activity in the earliest form of junk securities 
before drexel came along the junk bond market was largely made 
up of oncerespectable issues that had fallen on hard times though 
some of these offered high and risky yields others held out the 
promise of no current return at all since their issuers were in 
default and making no interest or dividend payments 
investors bought noyield junk bonds just as they would 
depressed common stocks speculating on the chances for a 
turnaround in the issuers fortunes 
in part because of drexels failure we expect to see a steady 
flow of new distressed securities in the coming months says 
george putnam iii in the current edition of the bostonbased 
advisory service the turnaround letter 
there will probably be several highly leveraged companies that 
might have been able to squeak by with drexels help but now will 
not make it 
this kind of firesale merchandise has always appealed to a 
hardy breed of speculators historically all you needed in this 
game was one or two big scores to offset the losses from other 
investments that never come back 
but analysts caution that junk bonds of that kind have always 
been and will continue to be a longshot proposition suitable 
only for people who can afford to absorb losses and be patient 
concludes ids 1990 is a watershed year for the highyield 
market a number of the sources of the markets problems will 
resolve themselves this year if investors begin to feel that deals 
are being made for sound reasons and in a prudent manner they will 
return

recession fears have been fading on wall street 
lately helping the stock market to rally but not all investors 
are happy to see those worries go 
as spring approaches in the financial world the us economy 
apparently is gathering momentum again resuming the expansion that 
has been running for nearly 7 years 
analysts still have some major reservations about the state of 
business activity interest rates are higher than many people might 
wish and corporate profits remain in a slump 
nevertheless the view seems to be spreading that those 
misgivings will be alleviated as the year progresses by an 
increasingly healthy combination of growth and slackening inflation 
that would presumably allow stock prices to climb substantially 
even before any marked improvement in corporate finances worked its 
way through to the bottom line 
at this stage the united states is the only developed country 
with a declining inflation rate said john connolly an analyst 
at dean witter reynolds inc while the us economy is troughing 
others are peaking 
right now our fundamentals are excellent perhaps the best 
that can be found in the world 
for others who look at the same picture from a less optimistic 
viewpoint the prospect of a pickup in business conjures up 
memories of difficult periods for investors in recent years 
conceivably they say it could usher in a new bout of concerns 
before long about possible credittightening by the federal 
reserve which has been waging a longterm campaign against 
inflation whenever the economy was strong enough to permit it 
i expect to see more takers for the idea that the us economy 
is indeed growing not growing rapidly enough to generate strong 
profits but growing too rapidly to effect any improvement in 
inflation or interest rates said greg smith at prudentialbache 
securities 
i suspect the triumph of this view will create another decline 
in the market and may perhaps create a buying opportunity sometime 
in the second quarter i anticipate a relatively difficult period 
marked by a paucity of brave and exciting new ideas 
undaunted by such warnings buyers took stock prices to their 
highest levels since early january in the past week the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials climbed 2297 to 268333 on top of a 
9617point gain the week before 
the new york stock exchange index of all listed common stocks 
rose 121 to 18618 the nasdaq composite index for the 
overthecounter market gained 574 to 43676 and the american 
stock exchange market value index was up 503 at 36115 
volume on the big board averaged 15773 million shares a day 
against 16160 million in the previous week 
if corporate profits were the gauge rather than overall economic 
output the us economy already would have lapsed into a certified 
recession 
by most measures profits declined in the third and fourth 
quarters of last year and they are expected to show another 
decline in the threemonth period through the end of march 
most investors are resigned to weak earnings in the first half 
of 1990 observed thomas doerflinger at painewebber inc the 
next surprise is likely to be that earnings fail to improve much in 
the second half of 1990 
a primary reason for this doerflinger argues is the recent 
rise of interest rates which stands to act as a drag on growth and 
to increase companies interest costs at the expense of profits 
of course he adds rising us rates partly reflect 
higher rates overseas 
a significant risk for us corporate profits is that these 
rate increases will suppress economic growth overseas this would 
eliminate one of the few remaining bright spots for the earnings of 
us companies

corporate raiders once used junk bonds like 
kryptonite to intimidate companies with takeover forays 
but the sagging market for junk has given potential targets a 
lead shield to protect themselves and the raiders are resorting to 
other less powerful weapons 
the latest example came this past week when usx corp harried 
by carl icahn consented to his proposal for a nonbinding 
shareholder vote on whether the company should vacate the steel 
business 
icahn usxs largest shareholder once could have taken much 
more drastic action ultimately a hostile takeover backed by 
billions of dollars in borrowed money provided by eager banks and 
the sale of junk debt securities 
this shows that raiders without the junk market and with 
banks much more conservative are now toothless and dont have the 
financing to back takeover threats said charles laloggia author 
of a special situation report a rochester nybased investment 
newsletter that focuses on takeover stocks it shows management 
is just able to say go away no leave 
for usx consenting to the may 7 shareholder vote was a shrewd 
move takeover experts said largely because the steelandenergy 
giant relinquished practically nothing while giving the appearance 
of responsiveness 
icahn is considered to have a slight chance of winning majority 
support for his proposal which would recommend that the nations 
biggest steel company sell the steel operations because they arent 
profitable enough 
but even if he won the companys board isnt required to 
oblige moreover allowing the vote enables the board to deflect 
complaints that it isnt acting in the shareholders best interests 
its like the line in the godfather keep your friends 
close keep your enemies closer laloggia said it appears to 
accommodate icahn and it avoids shareholder lawsuits 
others said the icahnusx arrangement reflects how takeover 
strategists are increasingly relying on shareholder votes to gain 
control of target companies because they can no longer rely on bank 
credit and the junkbond market which has slumped badly because of 
a dearth of buyers and a glut of sellers drexel burnham lambert 
inc the biggest junk underwriter collapsed a month ago 
more than half a dozen large american corporations already are 
facing proxy fights which are efforts by minority shareholders to 
put an issue to a vote at annual meetings the objective is usually 
to sack the directors and replace them with allies who will take 
control or force the companys sale 
the most prominent of these fights is an effort by dallas 
investor harold simmons who owns about 19 percent lockheed corp 
to replace directors up for election with a slate of his own and 
nullify the aerospace giants poison pill antitakeover defense 
other examples include ual corp facing a proxy challenge by 
coniston partners a new yorkbased takeover investment group and 
armstrong world industries inc challenged by the belzbergs a 
wealthy canadian family 
the end of easily available money for takeovers isnt the only 
obstacle confronting the icahns simmonses and belzbergs who were 
once much more aggressive in their tactics corporate management 
has been strengthened by recent court decisions and a number of 
state antitakeover laws 
many takeover strategists are particularly alarmed about a 
proposed strengthening of a pennsylvania law that could serve as a 
model for other states which would require hostile buyers to 
surrender their profits from the sale of an acquired company 
this bill is anticapitalist and would set a dangerous 
precedent with farreaching consequences the dean of the 
takeover strategists t boone pickens wrote recently in the 
newsletter of his washington lobby group the united shareholders 
association with management untouchable by shareholders no 
matter how poorly it performs there will be little incentive for 
anyone to own stock 
in other business and economic news this past week 
new weaknesses surfaced in american manufacturing domestic 
automakers said us car and truck sales fell nearly 8 percent in 
february the lowest showing in seven years while japanese 
automakers strengthened their share of the market the government 
said us factory orders fell 54 percent in january the biggest 
drop in 15 years 
stocks and bonds slumped at the end of the week hurt by 
renewed fear of higher inflation the catalyst for the drop was the 
government report on february unemployment which showed the 
economy produced the most jobs in nearly two years 
the bestknown softdrink makers in the united states and 
france attempted to inject fresh fizz into classic flops cocacola 
co announced the test marketing of coke ii five years after the 
introduction of a marketing debacle new coke perrier which 
recalled its soda water worldwide because of benzene contamination

the municipal bond market could be in for a 
major boost in the coming decade thanks to president bushs new 
national transportation policy 
the policy released this past week calls for shifting much of 
the cost of the nations transportation system to state and local 
governments it also envisions users of the system paying for 
upkeep as much as possible and private investors taking a larger 
role in the funding 
the result experts say should be greater sales of taxexempt 
bonds by state and local governments the historical way that 
highways airports ports and transit systems are paid for 
it will cause a major increase in bond issuance over the next 
decade predicted peter j schmitt chief operating officer of 
financial guaranty insurance co which insures municipal bonds 
other experts are more cautious 
it is the beginning of a process it may take a couple of 
years before you begin to see specific results from it said 
austin koenen chairman of the public securities association a 
trade group for companies that underwrite municipal bonds 
for years many groups including the psa have been saying the 
nations infrastructure roads rails airports and waterways 
needs a major upgrading koenen said bushs plan is a recognition 
of this concern 
the bush policy outlines new ways for state and local 
governments to raise funds for transportation such as airport 
passenger taxes and tolls on roads built with federal funds both 
of which are now prohibited 
koenen said this means the policy should favor the use of 
municipal revenue bonds rather than general obligation bonds 
general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing authority 
of a government while revenue bonds are tied to a specific revenue 
source linked to the project to be funded such as tolls charged 
for use of a highway built with bonds 
another reason revenue bonds should be more popular than general 
obligation bonds is that raising taxes is a political pitfall for 
most state and local governments legislatures and voters are much 
more willing to approve bond issues if they are paid off by a fee 
tied to the project funded instead of by a general tax on all 
residents 
while the bush plan is encouraging the psa said it will 
continue to press for easing of taxcode rules that it contends 
hinder the issuance of municipal bonds 
schmitt said the plan appears to favor increased use of 
publicprivate partnerships in funding transportation but those 
partnerships were reined in by the 1986 code revision 
you cant have it both ways he said 
the 1986 tax revision reduced the percentage of revenue from a 
municipal bond issue that may benefit private interests from 25 
percent to 10 percent the revision also put caps on each state on 
the amount of taxexempt bond funding they may issue for private 
uses 
the change was made in response to what was perceived to be 
abuse of the taxexempt fundraising ability of local governments 
for the benefit of private companies 
but bob brown a vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc 
said the restriction should be eased for transportation projects 
since transportation traditionally is a function of government 
while the bush policy statement appears to promote municipal 
bonds brown said it is more important as a recognition of the 
needs of the nations transportation system 
the real thing that drives the municipal market is not so much 
federal policy as the need for infrastructure he said what 
will have a much greater effect over the next five years is how 
people begin to look at infrastructure needs do they see that as a 
top priority to address at all levels of government

when things seemed darkest for the fraternity 
brothers in national lampoons movie animal house they staged 
a wild roman toga party 
life sometimes imitates art with circulation down and 
publication schedules scaled back at the 20yearold humor and 
satire magazine national lampoon executives decided it was time to 
let loose 
this month national lampoon is spending 500000 to promote a 
revamped look to the college spring break crowd in daytona beach 
the campaign will include billboards sports contests bikini 
competitions and of course a toga bash 
were going to the college students and saying take a look 
at our magazine we think youll like it said michael carr a 
former advertising director at playboy hired last year as publisher 
of new yorkbased national lampoon 
the april issue already shows the new direction of the magazine 
which built its reputation in the 1970s on locker roomlevel 
guffaws and a sardonic eye 
for the first time in many years there is no nudity in the 
magazine but it still contains many maleoriented sex jokes a 
national lampoon staple 
plans include improved graphics more short fiction articles on 
comedians and humor and an emphasis on listings and tips we want 
to make it a guidebook to your funny bone said carr 
carr said none of the spring break promotions will feature 
alcohol which showers most other activities for the estimated 
400000 college students expected in daytona beach this year 
the days of the fort lauderdalepartytillyoupuke mentality 
is gone said carr we want the kids to go home with good 
memories of spring break 
spring break is a marketing paradise said james spanfeller 
associate publisher of playboy magazine which was launching its 
own threeweek daytona beach promotions 
the 1980s was a boomtime for comedy clubs and films but the 
yuppie era was tough for national lampoon an outgrowth of the 
harvard lampoon in cambridge mass 
circulation which peaked at nearly 850000 in 1974 fell to 
230000 before a slight rebound last year in 1986 the magazine 
started publishing every two months but carr said monthly 
publication will resume with the 20th anniversary issue in october 
media analysts say part of the magazines decline stemmed from 
its failure to keep pace with the growing sophistication and 
changing tastes of its readership defined by carr as 80 percent 
male about 28 years old collegeeducated and earning 36000 a 
year 
a magazine must continually invigorate to bring in a new 
audience said hollywood califbased producer daniel grodnik 
who purchased national lampoon inc last year his partner in the 
venture is actor tim matheson who played the character otter in 
animal house 
on friday grodnik and matheson announced they had agreed to 
sell the company to j2 a homevideo producer and distributor in 
an exchange of stock valued at 467 million both will continue to 
run the company as a division of j2 which will provide additional 
capital for the magazine 
the two investors hired carr several new writers and billy 
kimball who edited the harvard lampoons 1981 parody of people 
magazine 
carr says advertisers already have begun to respond to the 
shakeup in its february issue the 112page national lampoon had 
six pages of advertising the 96page april issue which sells for 
395 has 40 pages of ads including bigbudget companies such as 
molson beer rj reynolds and playboy 
in 1988 the most recent financial reports available national 
lampoon inc reported revenue of about 5 million slightly down 
from 1987 but the report does not include the third of national 
lampoons vacation films christmas vacation which grossed 
more than 75 million at the box office following its late 1989 
release 
if the lampoon will tone itself down and have that 
sophisticated look and content to match advertisers will put their 
label on it said paul ducharme head of print advertising at 
grey advertising 
but analysts note that other publications are competing for the 
chuckles of us readers 
fouryearold spy magazine which often satirizes modern urban 
culture announced last month it is seeking either a buyer or 
cashrich investors for expansion time warner incs 38yearold 
mad magazine focuses on a schoolage crowd and reports a growing 
circulation of about 14 million worldwide 
problems however may loom for publications that cater to a 
mostly male readership said david orlow chairman of periodical 
studies service inc in new york 
that usually means a lot of cigarette and alcohol ads he 
said the way things are going with public attitudes it appears 
that type of advertising is on the decline

digital equipment corp said friday it will cut 
thousands of employees from its payroll by expanding a voluntary 
severance program as it contends with a slumping us computer 
market 
digital officials would not give specific figures on how many 
jobs would be eliminated saying the plan was under preparation 
but brad allen manager of shareholder relations said the number 
was in the ballpark of previous estimates by industry analysts 
analysts have said digital which employs about 125900 people 
worldwide and more than 70000 in the united states wants to pare 
its payroll by at least 5000 and eventually redeploy as many as 
15000 employees in new jobs 
the momentum has picked up the program definitely will be 
expanded allen said adding the program was to be implemented by 
the end of the companys fiscal year on june 30 
digital spokeswoman nikki richardson said the severance program 
will be similar to a package offered last year to 700 employees at 
the companys manufacturing plant in salem nh 
under that volunteer plan which has been accepted by 260 
workers so far employees received a cash payment based on years of 
service as well as medical dental and life insurance coverage for 
one year 
workers with up to two years of service for example received 
40 weeks of pay those with three to 10 years got 40 weeks plus 
three weeks for each year between three and 10 years 
we are looking at all transition programs on a 
businessbybusiness basis richardson said 
digital the worlds secondlargest computer company after 
international business machines corp saw its earnings fall 39 
percent for the six months ended dec 31 
the company based in suburban maynard blames the drop on a 
lackluster computer market in the united states which has forced 
other companies to make cutbacks as well 
digital also has reassigned hundreds of employees from 
manufacturing to sales

a group of banks and investors may take control of 
penrod drilling co on march 31 because its owners the hunt 
brothers are having problems raising cash for a loan payment a 
newspaper reported friday 
the dallas morning news quoting anonymous sources said penrod 
may not be able to meet the first of 32 payments on 525 million 
owed a group of six banks 
penrod was founded by the late billionaire hl hunt and passed 
on through trusts to his children william herbert hunt nelson 
bunker hunt and lamar hunt 
if the hunt brothers default on the payment which includes 15 
million in principal and about the same amount in interest they 
would lose control of their 50 percent stake in penrod 
leon crozier who leads penrods landbased drilling operations 
said friday the company had no comment on the report

exxon corp shareholders and environmentalists 
said friday that their attempts to prod the giant oil company into 
a more environmentally sensitive direction could include a call at 
exxons annual meeting to oust its chairman 
six shareholder proposals on environmental issues have been 
cleared by the securities and exchange commission for inclusion in 
exxons proxy statement and will be voted on at the companys april 
25 annual meeting 
the company opposes all six proposals which among other things 
call for exxon to take leadership in dealing with the damage 
caused by its alaska oil spill 
another resolution for an environmental report card based on the 
valdez principles which is a set of corporate guidelines calling 
for conservation restoration of damaged environments reduction of 
wastes and other moves to protect the environment 
shareholders were unable to get such measures in the proxy 
statement last year because the huge oil spill in alaska which 
created a lingering public outcry against exxon occurred after the 
deadline for submitting resolutions 
instead shareholders including some representing pension funds 
with large holdings of exxon stock had to be content with 
questioning company leaders about the spill and demanding greater 
accountability 
as occurred last year some shareholders again are likely to ask 
at the annual meeting for the resignation of lawrence g rawl 
exxons chairman and chief executive officer said gray davis 
trustee for the california public employee retirement system the 
nations largest public pension fund 
ive never seen a less concerned and less tuned in ceo said 
davis who also is comptroller for the state of california maybe 
it requires a new ceo to understand that america will not tolerate 
this 
davis said a shareholder request for rawl to resign is 
obviously on the table and the outside directors should look 
seriously at making a management change 
davis said 824 million shares of exxon stock owned by calpers 
will be voted in favor of at least some of the environmental 
resolutions new york city also will be tossing its 51 million 
exxon shares into the environmental pool said tim smith executive 
director of interfaith center on corporate responsibility which 
represents 250 religious groups nationwide some of whom own exxon 
stock 
together the pension funds own less than 1 percent of exxons 
13 billion outstanding shares 
smith who helped draw up the valdez principles said most of 
the 25 companies asked to approve the principles had agreed to 
submit a report describing their companys programs and progress 
toward achieving the objectives 
mobil corp texaco inc chevron corp and amoco corp have 
agreed to supply a report in six months preventing a shareholder 
resolution on the matter in their proxy statements smith said 
several other big companies including exxon atlantic richfield 
co and american express co declined to provide the report card 
and will have resolutions put to a vote at upcoming meetings 
there has been no response from exxon it surprises me because 
one of the things they said they are doing is this kind of 
report said smith 
brent blackwelder an exxon shareholder and vice president of 
friends of the earth a washington dcbased environmental 
organization with 50000 members said his group endorses the 
resolutions and would support a change in exxon management 
despite getting the resolutions included in exxons proxy 
supporters concede it is unlikely they will be adopted because 
passage of shareholder proposals is rare nonetheless 
environmentalists hope the proposals will increase pressure on 
exxon to become more environmentally sensitive 
at a minimum hopefully they will get the attention of the ceo 
and the board davis said

rep glenn english says he may 
reluctantly support a user fee on futures trades to fund tougher 
enforcement by the industrys federal regulator the commodity 
futures trading commission 
in a speech friday to the futures industry associations annual 
convention english also criticized the securities and exchange 
commissions bid for jurisdiction over stockindex futures calling 
it a bureaucratic power grab 
english dokla sponsored a cftc reauthorization bill passed 
last year by the house the bill would increase the agencys budget 
by about 30 percent to 44 million over the next two years to pay 
for tougher policing of the nations futures exchanges 
the bush administration has proposed an 11cent user fee on 
every futures transaction to provide nearly all of the cftcs 
revenue a plan the industry strongly opposes 
english who chairs a house credit subcommittee with cftc 
oversight authority said he might support a smaller user fee to 
pay only for the proposed increase in the agencys budget the 
chicago mercantile exchange has said it could back such a plan 
english said he usually opposes user fees which he also called 
taxes 
but he said that given the realities of the budget we face 
today if we can find no other way to meet the funding requirements 
that we have authorized in the house and senate legislation i 
would very reluctantly accept user fees in making up that 
difference 
a version of englishs bill has been approved by the senate 
agriculture committee and a senate vote is expected after easter 
user fees and jurisdictional issues are among the concerns being 
addressed by congress in the debate over cftc reauthorization in 
the wake of the 1987 stockmarket crash and the federal 
investigation of trading fraud at the chicago board of trade and 
chicago merc 
on the question of regulatory jurisdiction over stockindex 
futures english said the sec is outmoded and lacks the expertise 
to effectively regulate futures markets 
the sec which regulates the stock and bond markets has been 
gaining congressional support in its longrunning battle for 
control over index futures which are regulated by the cftc 
stockindex futures which are based on such indexes as the 
standard amp poors 500stock index enable investors to speculate 
on the stock markets general trend without actually having to buy 
hundreds of different issues 
strategies involving the simultaneous trading of stockindex 
futures and the stocks they represent known as index arbitrage 
has been blamed by some for causing excessive price volatility in 
the stock market 
but english said the sec has no business in the futures markets 
the securities and exchange commission has been living on 
its reputation and may in fact be archaic and oldfashioned in many 
of their methods english said 
he said the recent collapse of of the junkbond giant drexel 
burnham lambert inc raised serious questions about whether the 
sec can handle their own business much less anyone elses
