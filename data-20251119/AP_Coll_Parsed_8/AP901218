liberalconservative barricades within the 
nations churches have limited religious groups ability to help 
americans develop a common ground to discuss moral issues the 
third installment of a fourpart series unholy wars religion in 
public life examines the consequences 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
religion in america was simpler in the 1950s 
the phrase under god was added to the pledge of allegiance 
catholics evangelicals jews and muslims kept a low profile and a 
pecking order helped a communitys most prominent citizens 
gravitate toward mainline protestant institutions such as the 
presbyterian and episcopal churches 
but then a series of sociological changes shook nearly 3 
centuries of protestant hegemony ranging from the rapid rise of 
evangelicalism to the surge of catholics to equal protestants in 
income and education to judicial rulings limiting the influence of 
religion in public life 
in explaining what happened in his midwest community one 
mainline protestant executive told hartford seminary dean william 
mckinney you have to understand the neighborhood changed when 
the whites moved out and the irish catholics moved in 
the demographic shifts have not led to a passive changing of the 
guard but to what some observers see as increasingly bitter 
divisions between liberals and conservatives that threaten 
religions traditional role of supplying society with a common set 
of moral standards 
religious people have got to get their act together said 
dean thomas ogletree of yale divinity school if were unable to 
talk to one another because were so divided the larger society is 
wise to say lets keep religion out of it because theyll just 
mess it up 
in a 1984 gallup poll 31 percent of religious conservatives 
held negative stereotypes of religious liberals while only 7 
percent found similar faults with themselves the range of 
intolerance was even greater on the religious left where 41 
percent held negative views of conservatives while only 3 percent 
said liberal sterotypes were valid 
the division is at least as strong if not stronger than it 
was five years ago said robert wuthnow a princeton university 
sociology professor who has studied the issue 
america may be heralded as a haven for religious freedom but it 
also has a history of religious bigotry 
at the founding of the country most states had laws 
discriminating against catholics and formally establishing either 
anglican or congregational churches 
strong anticatholic and antisemitic attitudes existed into the 
1950s despite a veneer of placid tolerance epitomized by president 
eisenhowers declaration that our government makes no sense 
unless it is founded on a deeply felt religious faith and i dont 
care what it is 
but the 60s and 70s saw unprecedented ecumenical advances 
fueled by such things as a broad range of religious groups working 
together on the civil rights movement pope john xxiii opening the 
windows of the catholic church to the world with the second vatican 
council and a series of theological statements from christian 
groups apologizing for their past antisemitism 
i think if you look at any long time line the trend is only 
up said jacqueline wexler president of the national conference 
of christians and jews 
but many observers say the resurgence of catholics and 
bornagain christian evangelicals into the public arena has brought 
about a renewal of religious prejudice 
thirty percent of the respondents in a gallup survey last year 
said they would not welcome religious fundamentalists as neighbors 
by comparison only 5 percent said they would not welcome 
protestants in general or jews 
at a reformation day service in october at yale divinity school 
lutheran theologian george lindbeck lamented that anticatholicism 
has become in some corners the antisemitism of intellectuals 
mckinney who is studying mainline protestant executives and who 
authored american mainline religion its changing shape and 
future agreed 
i think anticatholicism is the last respectable american 
prejudice he said 
the liberalconservative barricades cross denominational lines 
many religious conservatives who tend to emphasize spirituality 
prayer and bible study over social concerns have begun to form 
their own organizations within mainline churches the good news 
movement in the united methodist church the presbyterian lay 
committee and the episcopal synod of america are examples 
in more conservative denominations such as the southern baptist 
convention those who favor greater acceptance of divergent 
theological views also have formed their own lobbying groups such 
as the southern baptist alliance 
but the liberalconservative divide may not be as wide as each 
side might think 
princetons wuthnow said his research indicates conservatives 
are more tolerant and socially concerned than liberals think they 
are some conservative churches for example have established 
programs to help the homeless and counsel the unemployed 
in the brookings institution study religion in american public 
life a james reichley said many religious conservatives 
approach the abortion struggle with the same ardor liberals fought 
for civil rights 
on the issue of abortion they believe it is the liberals who 
are countenancing mass destruction of potential life while 
fundamentalists in alliance with catholics stand up for the most 
vulnerable of all forms of human life the unborn reichley 
said 
at the same time wuthnow said liberals are more devout in 
their faith than conservatives think they are as shown by a 
renewed interest in evangelism and bible study 
bishop herbert w chilstrom spiritual leader of the evangelical 
lutheran church in america said more than 9000 of the 
denominations 11000 congregations ordered tapes of a 
churchsponsored faithdevelopment program 
thats indicative of a very deep hunger for faith development 
among our people he said 
and partnerships are being fostered for the first time in a 
generation religious groups across the board now are forming 
coalitions on issues ranging from apartheid to pornography 
many religious leaders have a sense of being in the same boat 
they sense as they once did not the danger of religion being 
totally driven out of a public role in society reichley said 
pressure has grown in recent years to consider on secular 
grounds issues ranging from abortion to nuclear war as more people 
view religion as a set of divisive sectarian interests wuthnow 
said 
when you take out the moral values supplied by religion he 
said then what becomes important are issues of economics 
political expediency practicality 
those are the wrong guidelines to use for deciding issues such 
as euthanasia genetic engineering allocation of limited health 
care resources and even whether the nation should go to war 
wuthnow and others said 
in the new religious climate the ability to compromise is seen 
as a high moral value said ogletree of yale divinity school 
the alternative to compromise is moral anarchy or religious 
conflict he said

some scrooges say its those little red and green things 
that make them think youd have to be nuttier than a fruitcake to 
eat one others drag out the joke you know the one about there 
being just one fruitcake that gets passed around and around and 
around 
its the only thing that everybody doesnt like except 
lutefisk the humorist calvin trillin says referring to a 
norwegian dried cod dish 
but have you ever eaten fruitcake mr trillin 
i think i had a bite once 20 years ago it was before i knew 
i was an innocent he says probably it was christmas the fire 
was going the presents were being unwrapped or maybe they already 
were unwrapped 
fruitcake has had its share of humiliation johnny carson and 
columnist russell baker have poked fun nearly a third of the 
people surveyed by american express a couple of years back said it 
was the worst gift of all 
well mr trillin mr baker and all you other naysayers enough 
already 
its sort of an annual plague said susan purdy author of 
the cookbook a piece of cake who argues theres more to 
fruitcake than men of this ilk know 
im not going to sit here and tell you that when you hear a 
fruitcake joke it doesnt make you kind of mad it does said w 
dale parker a vice president at the granddaddy of fruitcake 
bakers claxton bakery inc in claxton ga 
parkers family business bakes 5 million pounds of fruitcake a 
year 
obviously theres a lot of people out there eating 
fruitcake parker said 
we get some rave reviews that its just like the one 
grandmother wanted to bake but couldnt boasts father andrew of 
the holy cross abbey in berryville va where each year the 
monastery bakery turns out 13000 traditional fruit and 
nutstudded cakes laced with brandy 
so mr trillin how do you suppose these companies stay in 
business 
people are buying them and theyre giving them to other 
people but that doesnt mean theyre eating them he said 
ive been given a lot of fruitcakes as gifts 
richard sullivan of the glace fruit processors admits some 
fruitcakes taste like sawdust his father always got one for 
christmas that was dense and bitter i never liked the thing 
ah but then there are good ones 
they have to have wonderful fruits said purdy who uses 
mangoes papayas apricots dates nuts dried apples pears and 
plums she advises avoid little red and green and yellow 
things 
a good fruitcake to me is like eating candy sullivan said 
i just love it 
melvin gordon president of paradise fruit inc in plant city 
fla said he doesnt know how fruitcake got such a lousy 
reputation 
he notes that his industry sells 50 million pounds of candied 
fruit a year and if he could talk to mr trillin hed say 
fruitcake has been around a lot longer than you and i 
even some particular fruitcakes can claim that 
in enoughs enough a new collection of trillins columns 
he mentions a family in michigan that brings out an antique 
fruitcake every christmas a fruitcake that for some reason was not 
eaten at christmas dinner in 1895 and has symbolized the holidays 
ever since 
mr trillin meet morgan ford of tecumseh mich keeper of a 
cake baked not in 1895 he says but in 1878 by his 
greatgrandmother 
when she died early the following year the cake was forgotten 
for a while today its in an airtight glass box ford said 
theres a musty rum smell there yet he said 
when his uncle then 86 took a bite a couple decades back ford 
said he had to cut it off with his jacknife sliver it off it 
doesnt look too appetizing to me 
as if to ward off the inevitable ford notes right away that his 
uncle lived two more years 
if i make it to 86 and im 70 ill taste it then he 
said 
but he could be persuaded to give into temptation by johnny 
carson who has poked fun at the cake if hed take a bite 
ford said id take a bite 
go ahead mr trillin joke about heirloom or antique 
fruitcakes age can be a virtue 
the late james beard often called the dean of american food 
once wrote that his mother baked fruitcakes a full year ahead and 
kept some of her wedding fruitcake for a quartercentury by 
periodically lacing it with cognac 
the ancient romans purdy said baked fruitcakes called 
satura latin for a full dish and the root of the word 
satire perhaps the romans had one up on you mr trillin 
martha washington made one for family holidays before 
refrigeration the sugar and spirits in fruitcakes acted as 
preservatives 
as recently as 50 years ago no one chortled over fruitcake 
our taste has changed we dont like things that are too 
heavy too sweet purdy said were talking about an antique 
cake in contemporary life and its trying to make the 
transition 
so go ahead take your potshots mr trillin and co but 
honestly wouldnt you be in a holiday funk if nobody at all 
remembered you with a fruitcake 
 
editors note mary macvean comes from a long line of fruitcake 
lovers and nevers lets a december go by without eating or baking 
some with or without the little red and green fruit

there are december nights when beverly nyberg 
who works all day looks up from frosting ginger cookies and finds 
its 3 am 
its a mad rush thats the essence of christmas cookies 
said nyberg a commercial artist at a new york advertising agency 
why do it then for tradition for love she said her 
mother now nearly 80 used to make at least 30 kinds of christmas 
cookies nybergs 20yearold son already is asking what kinds mom 
is making this year 
her favorites are thumbprints a sugar cookie covered with nuts 
and rolled in a ball a thumb stuck in the middle before baking 
leaves a depression just right for frosting or jam 
throughout december cooks everywhere take out traditional and 
newfound recipes baking nights and weekends to fill old shoe 
boxes or tins with cookies carefully layered with wax paper to 
freeze until christmas 
yeah your body complains from the effort nyberg said but 
the payoff is the enjoyment that everyone is walking by and 
grabbing cookies off the plate when it comes to the dday of 
christmas 
food historian william woys weaver of devon pa said he tries 
new cookies each year but always returns to old favorites such as 
a german cookie called chocolate apeas 
i made some for some children last week and a little girl 
said these even taste like christmas i said good good 
thats just what i want to hear weaver said 
nothing represents the spirit of loving nurturing and giving 
more than a homemade cookie rose levy beranbaum writes in her 
new book roses christmas cookies 
theyre always exactly the right size they look so appealing 
they taste so delicious theyre satisfying but not too filling 
judy knipe and barbara marks write in the christmas cookie 
book 
in many homes the morning before christmas the shoe boxes and 
cookie tins come out and gift baskets are arranged for delivery 
later that day little hands take delight in decorating cutout 
sugar cookies with sprinkles and red hots some to be left that 
night for santa claus 
marks will make eight or 10 kinds of cookies this year 
including ginger pecan slices chocolate orange chunk cookies and 
lemon drops carrying on a tradition learned at the elbow of her 
mother and other relatives especially her dads aunt marie 
i would get so exicted and a month before christmas i would 
go over on saturdays and bake with her marks said getting to 
go somewhere all by yourself at 7 or 8 was really something 
much of the year home baking is something of a lost art the 
nestle toll house kitchen in purchase ny cites studies showing 
that only 35 percent of the baked goods eaten last year were made 
at home but nearly all the people surveyed said they bake for the 
holidays nestle said 
cookie comes from the dutch koekje the diminutive for 
cake but cookies are easier to make and more forgiving of the 
novices mistakes than cakes beranbaum said 
americans have always loved christmas cookies weaver said 
colonists could afford sweets only for special occasions and while 
christmas cookies in the shapes of animals and people were made for 
children they appealed to everyone he said 
it was a release a fantasy food in a sense the adult 
whos making camels and what have you i think theyre going back 
to childhood a little dont you weaver said of course they 
taste very good too 
among the earliest cookies were gingerbread which came both 
from germany and from england and scotland weaver writes in the 
christmas cook 
by the late 19th century refined sugar eggs and flour were 
available to most people and the castiron stove gave homemakers 
more control over baking than they had at the hearth he said 
that combined with a wave of immigration broadened the home 
cooks repertoire which now includes cookies from much of the 
world he said 
in her greenwich village apartment beranbaum shows off what 
look like stained glass windows sugar cookies with intricate 
cutouts filled with crushed sour balls that become translucent 
when baked she also bakes exquisite delicate snowflakes that 
sparkle when hung from the branches of a lighted tree 
beranbaums book has traditional elegant cookies downhome 
green wreaths made with marshmallows and cornflakes even brownies 
in the christmas cookie book the sharing is evident from the 
many recipes with a name attached amys molasses puffs renatas 
vanilla crescents hollys ginger crisps 
when beranbaum worked in the test kitchen of the ladies home 
journal her first story was on cookies for the christmas of 1975 
but christmas has long been part of this jewish new yorkers life 
i grew up with the feeling that in new york chistmas was a 
joyous cultural celebration belonging to everyone and not 
restricted only to those who observed it as a religious holiday 
she writes 
because of her book beranbaum doesnt have time to bake cookies 
for family and friends this year but she likes one way of 
considering her situation 
give a gift of christmas cookies and you spruce up one holiday 
give a book that teaches how to bake them and you feed christmases 
forever

aryeh levin doesnt quite know what his title is 
israeli consul general israeli envoy 
im the head of a diplomats group he said chuckling 
with the questionable title of ambassador 
two years after his arrival and two months after the soviet 
union said it would end its 23year diplomatic rift with israel 
levin still waits to raise his countrys whiteandblue flag at an 
embassy in central moscow 
the kremlin has said bureaucratic problems are delaying full 
consular ties levin blamed the demon of antisemitism which 
he said pervades certain ministries and nearly reaches the top 
levels of government 
its a perception that looms large for israel and soviet jews 
both hope to cultivate a deeper jewish presence in the soviet union 
even as tens of thousands of jews emigrate 
we need a developed jewish life said leonid stonov a 
prominent jewish activist we need to increase jewish dignity 
israeli officials and soviet jewish leaders said emigration no 
longer defines their attitude toward the soviet union as it did 
during much of the cold war cultural and religious expression for 
jews and trade and social exchanges for israel now are nearly 
equal to emigration on their list of priorities 
more than 130000 soviet jews have emigrated this year to 
israel driven in part by increasing antisemitism several 
thousand more have gone to the united states about 300000 soviet 
emigres already live in israel 
of the 14 million jews still in the soviet union about 250000 
live in moscow 
jews who remain can celebrate their holidays openly and attend 
hebrew schools in major cities a new law on religion guarantees 
the right to such practices many of which formerly were 
prohibited 
groups have emerged to promote everything from zionism to jewish 
theater last december 250 such groups formed the confederation of 
soviet jewish organizations to protect jews and coordinate their 
activities 
our goal is to secure the survival of soviet jewry as part of 
world jewry said mikhail chlenov a cochairman of the 
organization 
antisemitism remains an obstacle for decades the kremlin 
painted israel as a racist state bent on taking arab land 
in the realm of foreign affairs where the general new 
thinking is like a stream there are little eddies on the side of 
this larger current levin said these little eddies are the 
antiisraeli attitude the concept of a world zionist conspiracy 
he said those attitudes had delayed restoration of full consular 
ties which would allow israel itself to issue visas to the 
hundreds of jews who want to leave the dutch embassy now 
represents israel in the soviet union and issues the visas 
israel and the kremlin agreed sept 30 after three years of 
warming relations to upgrade the delegations in each others 
capitals 
during that period levin arrived in moscow and his delegation 
moved back into the building it occupied before ties were severed 
over the 1967 arabisraeli war 
despite the announcement the state of relations has not 
changed a soviet foreign ministry spokesman blamed slowmoving 
bureaucracy 
levin said ranking soviet officials told him privately they must 
proceed slowly because of an antisemitic mood 
theyre using it as an excuse and they are at the same time 
suffering from it levin said 
he expressed optimism that full diplomatic relations could be 
restored within a year unless antiisraeli and antisemitic 
elements prevail levin said 
they all have their own pavlov reactions to anything that has 
to do with israel he said they have to get rid of this and 
im glad to say they are thinking along these lines but it will 
take time 
people who deal with israel today in the ministry of foreign 
affairs are not hebraists theyre arabists this does not explain 
everything but it goes a long way to explain a few things 
vladimir nosenko a middle east analyst at the institute of 
world economics and international relations echoed that view 
they have an old perception about the role of israel in the 
middle east and im afraid our bureaucracy is very strong he 
said our antizionist propaganda several years ago created the 
basic antisemitic problems we have now 
israel hopes diplomatic ties will increase trade and cultural 
contacts levin said 
nosenko said the soviet union needs israels agricultural 
knowhow the two countries have exchanged visits by farming 
experts and levin said israels agriculture minister would travel 
to the soviet union soon 
the confederation of jewish groups is working to open synagogues 
and may run candidates for the soviet parliament said chlenov the 
cochairman 
there is a feeling that jews were sitting in the far corner of 
a big room and only now theyre trying to come out into the 
center he said

lawrence e walsh ends his fourth year as 
irancontra prosecutor today fighting to preserve his most 
important convictions and pry evidence from unwilling witnesses to 
complete his investigation 
congress and much of the public appear to have forgotten or at 
least lost interest in the biggest scandal of the reagan 
administration 
but a grand jury continues to hear evidence in the case and 
walsh says he will decide by spring whether to seek new indictments 
or conclude his investigation 
in the meantime walsh gets a chilly reception from the bush 
administration whose hardline stance on releasing classified 
documents scuttled the prosecution of former cia agent joseph 
fernandez 
he endures the editorial taunts of conservative commentators 
one recently compared him to a dinner guest who wont go home 
his office is still dueling in closed court proceedings with 
oliver l north over the former white house aides refusal to give 
more testimony to the grand jury 
north scored a major victory earlier this year when a federal 
appeals court set aside his three felony convictions for his role 
in covering up the sale of us arms to iran and the diversion of 
profits to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
the decision bodes ill for walshs other major triumph five 
guilty verdicts earlier this year against former national security 
adviser john m poindexter convicted of lying to congress and 
obstructing its investigations 
poindexters appeal is set to be argued feb 28 
and now walsh is fighting a rearguard action against jeffrey 
toobin a former junior associate of his office who wants to 
publish a book about the irancontra investigation that the 
independent counsel contends would expose grand jury secrets 
toobin has filed suit against walsh in new york 
i have never felt in the center of friends said walsh a 
former federal judge and wall street lawyer who is a month shy of 
his 79th birthday but looks at least 10 years younger this has 
always been a lonely place 
but walsh who shuttles between washington and his home in 
oklahoma city said his investigation achieved its goal of 
uncovering the wrongs of the irancontra affair 
the central actors have been pretty well described he said 
in an interview while acknowledging that the supervisory and 
support roles may never be fully exposed 
when the investigation is over we will have substantially a 
full story but there will undoubtedly be enclaves that arent 
fully developed walsh said 
eight participants have been convicted including poindexter 
north former national security adviser robert mcfarlane and arms 
dealers richard v secord and albert hakim 
just last week thomas g clines received a 16month sentence 
the longest prison term imposed on an irancontra defendant for 
failing to report on his tax returns all the money he earned 
brokering the arms deals 
the grand jury is trying to determine whether other former 
reagan administration officials could be prosecuted for misleading 
congress about the covert operation to arm the nicaraguan rebels 
these former officials include elliott abrams a former 
assistant secretary of state and donald gregg an adviser to 
thenvice president bush and now ambassador to south korea said 
sources familiar with the case who demanded anonymity 
walsh refused to comment on any aspect of the grand jury 
investigation 
he is preparing to ask the supreme court to revive norths 
convictions the appeals court had ruled that televised testimony 
north gave lawmakers under a congressional grant of immunity may 
have unfairly seeped into his trial 
that ruling gives poindexter powerful legal ammunition for his 
appeal 
like his former subordinate at the national security council 
poindexter gave congressional testimony on condition that his words 
would not be used as evidence against him 
walshdeclined to comment on the wisdom of the congressional 
grants of immunity but he acknowledged they posed a major 
stumbling block for his investigation 
the irancontra affair is most often compared to the watergate 
scandal that forced president nixons resignation 
but walsh said there are important differences that pose 
different problems for his investigation 
this isnt watergate where you have a burglary and a simple 
coverup this is a very complex operation at the very highest 
levels of government he said 
unlike the investigation by the watergate special prosecutor 
walshs probe has never definitively answered the question of the 
presidents role in the scandal 
but walsh said the irancontra investigations produced an 
unprecedented collection of ronald reagans statements 
particularly a sevenhour videotaped deposition the former 
president gave for poindexters trial 
its rare the public has been given his own view rather than 
the secondhand view of the investigator walsh said we have 
given the public the raw facts

defense secretary dick cheney said 
tuesday the pentagon has no evidence that saddam hussein is 
planning any withdrawal of troops from kuwait and is instead 
pouring additional infantry into the occupied emirate 
cheney was asked about comments monday by secretary of state 
james a baker iii that saddam might try a ploy like a partial 
withdrawal just before the united nationss jan 15 deadline to 
quit kuwait he said he did not rule out such a move but said 
iraqs military maneuvering indicated no pullout was in the offing 
the defense secretary en route to saudi arabia to discuss with 
ground commanders us contingency plans for war said the 
administrations resolve to restore kuwait would not melt if saddam 
gave up some of the conquered territory 
if he is planning to withdraw we certainly havent seen any 
evidence of it cheney told reporters traveling with him before 
his plane landed to refuel at shannon ireland 
he might move the pieces around on the board but our objective 
is for him to get all of that stuff out of kuwait not half of it 
not 75 percent of it not 10 percent of it all of it cheney 
said 
cheney was accompanied by gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff on their first joint visit to saudi arabia 
the cheneypowell trip begins with two days of military strategy 
sessions in the saudi capital of riyadh where the two will meet 
with american commanders and ranking saudi officials including 
king fahd cheney and powell then plan to split up for two days of 
prechristmas visits with some of the 270000 american troops in 
the persian gulf region 
cheney and powell conceded some of the reinforcements the united 
states is sending wont make it there by jan 15 and that some 
will arrive but still not be ready for combat perhaps not for 
weeks after the jan 15 deadline 
yet cheney insisted we have an offensive capability should 
that be required 
most of the force will be there by then but obviously there is 
additional work to be done before you would identify them as combat 
ready cheney said including testing equipment and getting used 
to the desert 
powell declined to answer several specific questions about the 
pentagons plans for war saying he did not want to tip his hand to 
saddam 
i want him to sit there in beautiful downtown baghdad and 
worry his butt off about it powell said 
the joint visit will give cheney and powell their first 
opportunity to sit down together with the us field commander 
army gen h norman schwarzkopf and to assess the status of the 
us deployment less than a month before the un deadline 
in washington pentagon spokesman pete williams said wednesday 
the us troop level has passed the 270000 mark and that another 
220000 allied air ground and naval troops were in the region as 
well 
williams said the number of iraqi forces in kuwait and souther 
iraq continues to grow and now is more than 510000 
he said there were concerns raised within the pentagon about the 
security risks of a joint cheneypowell trip 
but i think whatever considerations about that are outweighed 
by the desire for them to spend some time together discussing the 
operation and how things are going spending some time with the 
commander in chief of the operation williams said

ask prominent conservative thinkers what they 
think of george bushs presidency and you get unanimity they dont 
think much of it 
increasingly conservatives are dismayed over bushs direction 
and going public with their feeling that he has betrayed what one 
of them david keene calls the ideological base of the 
republican party 
and increasingly they tell of hearing talk about running some 
trueblue conservative against bush in the republican primaries of 
1992 if only as a token protest they agree though that theres 
scant chance of denying him renomination 
it isnt only the presidents abrupt abandonment last summer of 
his antitax stance that roils conservatives although that rubbed 
them the most raw 
they also complain of the bill he signed to ensure the rights of 
disabled people which they say smacks of welfare statism and 
they point to bushs program to reinvigorate the clean air act 
which they see as just so much more social engineering 
just too much government is how tom winter editor of the 
conservative newspaper human events summarized the right wings 
grievances 
even more the chemistry isnt right keene chairman of the 
american conservative union said conservatives feel that bush 
remains part of the establishment that most of these folks fought 
for so many years they chafe over the white houses cavalier 
dismissal of ronald reagan and all he ever stood for he said 
and they resent the way the bush administration treats 
conservatism essentially as an interest group keene said 
the presidents latest moves the installation of moderates 
lynn martin as secretary of labor and lamar alexander as secretary 
of education are unlikely to win any applause in the conservative 
camp 
when william bennett a true conservative hero changed his mind 
last week and said he would turn down the offer to become 
republican national chairman some gop hardliners assumed hed 
been shoved overboard 
it took richard nixon six years to destroy the republican 
party burton yale pines vice president of the heritage 
foundation told the washington times bush has done it in two 
years 
to test the depth of dismay with bush a reporter telephoned 
conservative thinkers and read them this paragraph written last 
week by conservative columnist joseph sobran also a senior editor 
at national review 
conservatives now spend most of their time trying to figure 
out how and with whom to replace mr bush asap they dread the 
prospect of his running again in 1992 even more they dread his 
winning many of them would rather see even a liberal democrat in 
the oval office on the principle that your enemies cant betray 
you the way your friends can and a bush defeat would allow 
conservatives to take back the republican party 
those questioned didnt agree that they spend most of their time 
conspiring to dump bush but they all had heard such talk 
and all expressed dismay with the presidents performance 
especially on tax and domestic matters 
the aboutface on no new taxes was the fulcrum of 
discontent 
r emmett tyrrell jr editor of the american spectator called 
it a gigantic error patrick mcguigan editorial writer for the 
daily oklahoman in oklahoma city said it was capitulation 
winter labeled it a fiasco to george gilder economic idea man 
for conservatives it was appalling 
when bush abandoned that issue he virtually destroyed the 
party gilder said 
the conservatives complaint about bush on taxes said martin 
anderson domestic adviser to reagan is not that he didnt 
succeed but he didnt fight 
still conservatives arent ready to lead an allout rebellion 
they said 
republicans are monarchists at heart said paul weyrich 
president of the free congress foundation no matter how much the 
king may be unpopular they tend to stay with the king 
but said pines if george bush three months from now is doing 
the same things that george bush is doing now then sobran will 
have turned out to be very prophetic 
sobrans idea is not a majority position said robert bork 
who was reagans rejected candidate for a supreme court seat 
if bush were defeated in 92 and democrats retained senate 
control they would have between three and four supreme court 
appointments probably and that means youd have 20 or 25 years of 
an extremely activist supreme court and i dont think conservatives 
want that bork said 
you cant beat somebody with nobody said anderson now back 
at californias hoover institution on war peace and revolution 
does sobran have a candidate

the first faust performance of this 
metropolitan opera season failed to enthrall one wonders if its 
partly because the scenery new last season grows on one in the 
wrong direction 
the sets changing by revolving on the mets turntable make the 
16th century look like a desert with adobe buildings and ruins 
neil rosenshein sang the title role acceptably on monday night 
except for an irritating push on high notes that sounded more like 
a shriek than a ring diana soviero didnt stir one as marguerite 
best were james morris a deep richvoiced nimble 
mephistopheles gino quilico sounding warm and clear as 
marguerites brother valentin and susan quittmeyer even more 
clear as valentins friend siebel quittmeyer singing a young 
boy has a warm voice that doesnt spread its tone its a 
happysounding voice that one could listen to a long time without 
tiring off stage she is the wife of morris he was the only 
principal on monday who sang his role when this production was new 
in february 
thomas fulton conducted sometimes swelling the orchestra over 
rosensheins singing 
the lighting people were working doubletime as lighting effects 
changed by the minute there also were some special effects for 
mephistopheles like a ring of fire and then smoke around him his 
shadow which moved differently from him in the church scene and 
blasts of fire during which he disappeared

hafr albatin saudi arabia ap elite commandos from the 
egyptian 3rd army which stunned israel in 1973 by secretly 
crossing the suez canal showed they can survive on anything even 
raw rats 
it wasnt surprising that the commandos successfully blew up 
three houses monday and repelled an armored assault in simulated 
attacks against the iraqis in the saudi desert about 30 miles from 
the kuwaiti border 
but the eight commandos showed the real egyptian mettle when 
they tore into live rats rabbits and chickens with gusto and ate 
them raw 
if youre behind enemy lines if you dont eat youll die 
an egyptian officer told lt gen khalid bin sultan commander of 
arabislamic forces in saudi arabia the general swatting an 
occasional aggressive fly sat cooly in a chair watching the desert 
survival feast 
the meal started with a raw egg quickly followed by a raw 
potato then came a cooked egg wrapped in soil and baked by a 
blaze started with a rifle shot into a campfire doused with 
gasoline 
out of a carton two commandos then pulled a pair of live 
chickens and proceeded to wring their necks the commandos then 
pulled each chicken apart feathers flying and stuffed them into 
their mouths 
two live rabbits were skinned and similarly devoured the final 
course was live rat minus the tail 
i love it prince khalid a nephew of king fahd said when 
asked how he liked the meal that is a typical standard function 
or capability which any special forces unit conducts even in the 
united states by the way 
us special forces teams are assigned to all arab and islamic 
forces under khalids command but they operate in obscurity among 
other training drills the teams have been trying to help 
coordinate us air strikes with arab ground operations this was 
put to a test in mondays exercise 
us a10 antitank aircraft swooped in low over the simulated 
enemy column which was also being attacked by egyptian m60 tanks 
and 155mm howitzers but the american attack planes only made a few 
passes apparently flying off because they werent expecting ground 
explosions 
the egyptian and syrian armies both battletested are 
considered the toughest in the 110000strong arab and islamic 
force deployed in saudi arabia 
egypts 20000 troops include the 3rd armored division and the 
3rd mechanized division part of the 3rd army which started the 
1973 mideast war but was eventually encircled by israel and forced 
to retreat 
gen salah mohammad alhalaby the egyptian commander said his 
troops in saudi arabia were egypts best fighters 
prince khalid told about 1200 egyptian troops sitting in the 
desert sun that the 1973 war restored the arab dignity and 
destroyed the israeli security theory and put an end to the concept 
of the undefeatable enemy 
after his speech the prince and his entourage drove a short 
distance to a carpeted tent for lunch on the menu traditional 
arab food of roast goat and chicken and potatoes and tomatoes 
stuffed with ground meat and rice

government safety investigators say little can 
be done to force ship captains to rest even as they ruled acute 
fatigue a primary cause of rhode islands worst oil spill 
the national transportation safety board said monday that the 
captain of the greek tanker world prodigy had been on the bridge 35 
consecutive hours when the ship ran aground off newport ri on 
june 23 1989 
but the agency said there is little the government can do to 
force ship captains of foreignflag vessels to rest before reaching 
a us port 
hopefully what we can do is attenuate foreign ship operators 
that fatigue is a major hazard to transportation safety said 
ntsb chairman james l kolstad we see it in all modes of 
transportation clearly we saw it in this particular accident 
the board unanimously approved a report detailing how acute 
fatigue led capt iakovos georgoudis to make a series of dubious 
orders and miscalculations in the hours leading up to the 
grounding 
the spill of 289000 gallons of no 2 heating oil sent ribbons 
of pollution toward the rhode island coast in slicks as long as 
five miles shell fishing swimming and pleasure boating were 
halted in some areas 
the ntsb ruled out intoxication drug use or crew incompetence 
as possible causes 
board staffers described georgoudis as wellorganized and 
conscientious but said his sense of duty led him to overwork 
georgoudis told investigators he took several short naps on the 
bridge but remained there because he was worried about the weather 
and heavy ship traffic 
he had sent subordinates off the bridge to perform routine tasks 
and was himself distracted with cargo calculations as the ship 
approached the shallow water of brenton reef off newport ri 
georgoudis was off by more than a halfhour in his estimate of 
when the tanker would arrive at its rendezvous point with a boat 
carrying the harbor pilot and also made a slight but crucial course 
miscalculation that sent the ship on the wrong side of a warning 
buoy officials said 
the ntsb said the rhode island state pilotage commission 
contributed to the spill by failing to require that harbor pilots 
notify inbound vessels of exactly where they plan to board ship and 
guide it into port had that been done the board said the tanker 
would have waited to take on an experienced local pilot before 
proceeding through the reef area 
vernon dunlap chairman of the pilotage commission disputed the 
ntsb conclusion 
the vessels are always told that the pilot will board 
dunlap said the problem here was that the vessel arrived 45 
minutes early georgoudis arrived at the pilot boarding station 
and continued right across it 
attorney thomas walsh of the boston law firm bingham dana amp 
gould which represents tanker owner ballard shipping co said the 
ntsb appeared to be overplaying the fatigue issue i dont know 
where in the record theres any evidence of acute fatigue he 
said 
the spill has spawned lawsuits against the shipper by the state 
boaters shell fishermen and others seeking damages totaling about 
40 million the suits have been consolidated into a single case 
pending in us district court in providence 
ballard pleaded guilty to federal clean water act violations and 
paid a 1 million fine georgoudis was fined 10000

mayor marion barry who leaves office next 
month facing a jail term for drug possession says he intends to 
remain a public servant 
after 30 years in public life i will not change barry told 
city workers in a farewell address monday i will remain in that 
army of people committed to making a difference 
in a speech both conciliatory and confrontational barry also 
warned against the evils of drug use and proudly outlined his 
accomplishments 
barry who is appealing his conviction on a cocainepossession 
charge and sixmonth prison sentence said he is healthier today 
clearer today than ever before in my life 
we need to stop using cocaine and other illegal drugs said 
barry who has admitted to alcoholism and dependence on two 
prescription drugs s well as occasional cocaine use if we 
expect our children to forgo illegal drugs we must not condone the 
use of legal ones like alcohol 
i leave here with no regrets but joy and relief quite 
frankly that we can move on to a new life the 12year mayor 
said we have fought the good fight 
barry who does not yet have a job has been exploring the 
possibility of a teaching position at the cityrun university of 
the district of columbia aides said 
in a reference to the racial divisions that his arrest and trial 
produced throughout the city barry urged residents of the nations 
capital to put our hearts together in love love for our city 
love for our brothers and sisters of every race 
but the mayor also assumed a defiant tone in highlighting the 
broadened involvement of minorityrun businesses in the citys 
contracting procedures 
some people dont like what we are about the former civil 
rights activist said in explaining his commitment to minority 
contracting we have opened up the door of government to people 
who couldnt share in the process that is a legacy no one can 
take away from us 
and in an emphasis on healing political divisions barry also 
pledged his full support and cooperation for mayorelect sharon

the federal reserve which has already eased 
credit three times since late october will reduce interest rates 
further in coming weeks as it battles what may turn out to be a 
worsethanexpected recession many economists predict 
these analysts however think the central bank will not move as 
aggressively to lower rates as the bush administration would like 
because of lingering inflationary pressures stemming from the 
persian gulf crisis 
the debate over how much and how fast to cut interest rates was 
expected to be the primary topic today when top fed officials 
gathered behind closed doors for their final monetary strategy 
session of 1990 
the minutes of those deliberations will not be released for six 
weeks but in advance of the discussions many economists were 
looking for a fourth modest step toward easing credit 
the fed has to ease because the economy looks so rotten 
said david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill a lexington 
mass forecasting firm 
while the administration still says it is unclear whether the 
nation has entered a recession economists said recent statistics 
showing a big jump in unemployment and a threemonth slide in 
industrial production are unmistakable signs that a downturn has 
begun 
i dont think there will be a doubt among members of the fed 
that a recession has begun said allen sinai chief economist of 
the boston co the debate will come over how much more to do in 
light of what has already been done 
in the past seven weeks the central bank has pushed the federal 
funds rate down a quarter point three times sending it from 8 
percent to 725 percent the funds rate is the interest that banks 
charge each other for overnight loans 
many economists believe the fed will signal a desire to push the 
funds rate down another 025 percentage point but hold off doing so 
until after the report on the december jobless rate is released 
jan 4 
that will give fed policymakers time to assess other economic 
statistics especially reports on whether inflationary pressures 
are subsiding 
some analysts suggested that the fed may go further and cut the 
discount rate the interest the central bank charges to make loans 
to commercial banks a reduction in the discount rate is the most 
dramatic signal the fed can send of its intentions to ease credit 
in order to boost economic growth 
while analysts were in basic agreement that further small 
reductions in the funds rate would be coming in the months ahead 
there was no consensus on whether the discount rate would be cut 
some economists argued that the fed will be hesitant to cut the 
discount rate while inflationary pressures remain at current high 
levels they said that overhanging all of the feds deliberations 
is the threat of war in the middle east which has the potential to 
send oil prices and inflation soaring 
a war would be a very unfavorable environment for the fed to 
be trying to ease domestic interest rates said david jones an 
economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities 
dealer he said the fed will likely make only modest easing moves 
until the situation in middle east becomes clearer 
even if todays meeting produces nothing more than a small 025 
percentage point cut in the federal funds rate many economists 
said that would be enough to prompt banks to cut their prime 
lending rate from 10 percent where it has been stuck since last 
january 
that would be good news for businesses and consumers because the 
prime rate is used as a base to calculate more than onethird of 
fixedrate and adjustablerate consumer and business loans 
wyss said he was also looking for mortgage rates which dropped 
to a threeyear low of 951 percent last week to stay low but not 
fall much further perhaps dropping to 925 percent by early 
spring

president bushs aid program for the soviet 
union will cost us taxpayers very little unless the soviets fail 
to pay back the money they borrow from commercial banks officials 
say 
but a study due to be released this week concludes that massive 
western aid would be wasted unless the troubled soviet economic 
system is improved official sources said monday 
instead the report recommends giving the soviets help in 
carrying out fundamental economic reforms said the sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the study conducted by the international monetary fund world 
bank and two europeanbased development groups comes on the heels 
of a weekend summit at which western leaders ordered 1 billion in 
emergency aid for the soviets and approved spending more than that 
amount on technical assistance during the next two years 
last week bush promised a 13 billion loan guarantee package 
including up to 1 billion to buy us farm products and up to 300 
million to purchase us manufactured goods 
the soviets have been scrupulous about repaying their debts 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said last week 
of course wed be liable if they default barbara clay a 
press officer at the us treasury said monday 
under the program outlined by bush the soviets would borrow 
from commercial banks to buy the food and manufactured goods the 
us government contribution will consist of a guarantee for those 
loans if the soviets fail to repay in three years the united 
states would pay the banks 98 percent of the principal and about 
half the interest 
in addition the us agency for international development will 
coordinate medical aid to be provided by private organizations the 
agency may help pay the private groups administrative costs aid 
spokesman john riddle said 
the soviets have paid cash for billions of dollars worth of 
grain and other food bought from this country 
the commodity credit corporation the us agency that 
guarantees the loans for food purchases said that without a 
government guarantee the soviets might not be able to get the loans 
at all 
nobody wants to make a threeyear loan on something thats 
going to be eaten up in a few weeks explained deputy director 
robert s simpson 
the loan guarantees for manufactured goods will be offered 
through the governments exportimport bank the bank has not lent 
to the soviets since 1975 
bank spokeswoman ann frye said the loan guarantee would 
encourage commercial banks to give the soviet union better terms 
than it might otherwise get including a break of up to 1 percent 
on the interest rate 
the studys findings according to the official sources were 
pessimistic and depressing because they describe a system even more 
backward than expected and practically paralyzed by inefficiency 
and confusion 
no amount of aid will make a real difference the system 
simply cannot absorb it the pipe is so porous that very little 
would reach its intended target said ilya prizel of the johns 
hopkins school for advanced international studies 
prizel said a political statement in the form of food aid to 
help soviets get through the winter might shore up president 
mikhail s gorbachev or even help induce the kinds of reform that 
are necessary 
but prizel said what they need is technical assistance 
everything from entrepreneurial and managerial assistance to 
logistical assistance as well as traditional advice such as how 
to set up a central bank 
the soviet currency the ruble is not traded on international 
exchanges and its value inside the country is in a free fall the 
price of goods bears little or no relationship to the cost of 
production inflation is accelerating at a pace difficult to 
measure and manufacturing plants are almost universally old 
inefficient and unable to compete in world markets

louvenia lewis has been on the waiting list for a 
subsidized apartment for a year the boston housing authority tells 
her shell have to wait at least 2 years more 
but lewis 52 a nurses assistant and divorced mother of five 
boys doesnt have that much time because her job was cut to 
parttime her rent exceeds her income and the landlord is 
threatening eviction 
it makes her even more anxious to know there are 1630 
subsidized aparments in boston sitting empty largely because 
there is little incentive to fill them 
public housing authorities get the same federal subsidy whether 
their buildings have vacancies or not as long as they promise to 
fill them eventually 
an estimated 1 million families nationwide are on waiting lists 
for subsidized housing and more than 91000 subsidized apartments 
are vacant enough for nearly 220000 people or all the homeless 
in new york chicago and los angeles combined according to figures 
from the us department of housing and urban development many of 
the apartments need only routine maintenance 
its a scandal said john donahue a spokesman for the 
chicago coalition for the homeless they have to open up those 
places 
the nations capital for example has 2295 empty apartments 
enough to accommodate 46 percent of the 12000 people on the 
waiting list of those units 1697 are awaiting repairs 
a small number of vacancies is normal said joseph schiff 
assistant secretary for public and indian housing at hud this 
many vacancies is not 
schiff said hud is pushing for an end to subsidies for empty 
units 
in boston about 1000 vacant apartments are awaiting 
renovations 
its a case of deliberately not wanting to fix them up said 
cushing dolbeare executive director of the national coalition for 
the homeless there are a lot of housing authorities that dont 
want to house a lot of homeless people 
housing administrators defend their handling of the vacancies 
the problem is that when somebody doesnt give you the money 
to fix the unit there is no great incentive to do anything about 
it said mike nail director of the national association of 
housing and redevelopment officials an umbrella organization of 
public housing professionals 
boston housing officials say many apartments remain unoccupied 
because applicants reject them some reject highrises because they 
are afraid the elevators will break down others dont want small 
efficiency apartments which account for threequarters of the 
vacant units some shun public housing for fear of crime 
just because someone is lowincome or homeless doesnt 
necessarily mean they can be forced to take any housing anywhere 
said dale mitchell the boston housing authoritys assistant 
administrator 
hud is urging an end to the practice of giving applicants a 
choice of assignments but the housing officials say that would 
send the rejection rate skyrocketing and leave units empty even 
longer 
public housing authorities are getting beaten up because they 
cant fill these vacant units said nail but he added its 
like triage when you have a limited amount of resources you have 
to decide how best to allocate those resources 
in the meantime some groups have taken matters into their own 
hands church volunteers started fixing up some of chicagos 7020 
vacant apartments in boston a nonprofit agency has temporarily 
housed homeless elderly people in 16 empty public housing units it 
took over

stalinist albania seems to have taken a 
giant step by permitting its first noncommunist party but many 
emigres and others are skeptical the change is genuine or 
sufficient to contain popular anger 
caught between a reluctance to relinquish a 46year monopoly on 
power and a desire to avoid mass violence the communist leadership 
has sent a series of contradictory signals in the past week 
president ramiz alia who a month ago denied any need for 
competing political parties has now pledged that reform is 
irreversible 
yet his government has to date kept all but a handful of foreign 
journalists from reporting independently on the historic events in 
his land it has also so far failed to accord the new democratic 
party of albania legality 
appeals from the new party for calm appeared in official media 
during last weeks riots in four cities but media have not carried 
details of its program or profiles of its leaders 
this puts the founders of the new party in a state of suspended 
animation working furiously on a program yet under pressure not 
to antagonize authorities apparently willing to take reform 
seriously 
the founders caution has also bred suspicion 
we dont know who these people running the new party are 
said an albanian intellectual who recently fled to greece and spoke 
on condition his name not be used 
he noted that economist gramoz pashko who has close ties to the 
communist elite helped found the new party 
just as in romania and bulgaria the governing party is 
pretending to put on a new face to subvert opposition to it the 
people rioting on the streets are the real opposition to the 
regime 
in a country of 32 million people run for decades by a small 
secretive elite intellectuals have automatically enjoyed both 
privilege and close ties with the leadership 
yet they are among the few groups with the courage and power to 
organize in a country in which critics traditionally faced death or 
jail and the mystery that surrounds so much of what happens in 
totalitarian countries means these intellectuals cannot be sure who 
was involved in last weeks violence 
some echoed official language talking of dark forces and 
hinting that what one called some kind of new dictator was 
behind last weeks riots in shkodra elbasan durres and kavaje 
ismail kadare the renowned albanian author who defected to 
paris in october saying he despaired of seeing genuine democracy in 
albania told the french newspaper le figaro last week i fear a 
counterattack by conservative albanian forces 
if there is a power struggle between oldtime stalinists and 
reformers in the ruling albanian labor party last weeks violence 
could have been provoked by the conservatives 
yet popular discontent at economic misery and decades of 
repression is so high that the protests likely were spontaneous 
outbursts particularly in industrial centers like elbasan a city 
of 80000 in central albania with a huge steel mill employing some 
15000 workers 
elsewhere in the balkans similar mystery surrounds much of 
politics to this day for instance debate rages in romania over 
last years ouster of nicolae ceausescu 
was it in fact engineered by disillusioned communists and the 
military riding a wave of popular protest to seize control 
themselves or was it the true result of a popular uprising 
even the legitimacy conferred by election victories on the 
excommunists who took over in romania and bulgaria this year has 
proved insufficient for them to forge the consensus needed for the 
harsh economic reforms they recognize as inevitable 
romanias president ion iliescu opened negotiations monday on 
getting some opposition parties into the government 
a coalition government is to take office in bulgaria after 
strikes and economic chaos forced the socialist government to 
resign 
albanias elections scheduled for feb 10 will be a test of 
the communist partys willingness to accept democracy 
again this puts the new party in an awkward position in a 
backward country with poor communications and limited resources all 
controlled by the communists the democratic party faces an unequal 
contest in february 
pashko said monday that the new party has therefore asked for a 
postponement of the elections but that carries the risk of popular 
anger rising beyond anyones control 
the reforms need to be realized in a short time said nedim 
vlora an italian professor of albanian origin at bari university 
the situation is desperate and when a population is 
desperate it attacks it is essential that there be both economic 
and political reforms 
burhan kalaya who fled albania for italy three months ago said 
relatives reached by telephone in the albanian capital of tirana 
paint a confusing picture of optimism about change and despair 
at food shortages and other hardships 
such confusion prompts calls for the clear commitment to change 
that albania certainly must make if it is to meet the human rights 
standards of the conference on security and cooperation in europe 
it says it wants to join 
if they want us to believe in their claims of change let them 
allow christmas to be celebrated in religious ceremonies said a 
prominent greek orthodox critic of albania bishop sevastianos of 
konitsa near the greekalbanian border 
it is precisely such decisive acts however that seem to rankle 
communists accustomed to decades of absolute power who fear the 
consequences if they let control slip from their hands

the nations toughest law protecting users 
of video display terminals went to a noncommittal mayor art agnos 
after winning approval from city supervisors who called it 
cuttingedge legislation for a hightech age 
union leaders and victims of vdtrelated injuries cheered when 
the ordinance was approved 74 monday the board of supervisors 
approved it 81 in a preliminary vote last week 
im ecstatic said becky hogue a pacific bell operator who 
wears plastic splints on her wrists because of weakness from years 
of using computer keyboards i suffered so much but now maybe 
others wont have to go through the same pain 
the chamber of commerce opposed the measure saying its high 
costs would drive businesses away 
the law would force the city and businesses with 15 or more 
employees in san francisco to spend millions to provide safer 
workplaces for people who use desktop computers at least four hours 
a day 
adjustable swivel chairs glare shields detachable keyboards 
tables with sufficient leg space and special lamps are among items 
that would be required during the next two years violators would 
face penalties of up to 500 a day 
vdt users would also be allowed 15minute breaks every two 
hours and an advisory committee would monitor information about 
the health effects of vdt use including those from radiation 
this is a message to the nation that this is the next wave of 
worker safety issues said supervisor nancy walker who 
cosponsored the ordinance it has to start somewhere and 
frequently things start at the local level since the federal and 
the state have not been able to do anything really 
agnos said he supports the spirit of the measure but has 
misgivings about its cost he has 10 days to act during which time 
he plans to meet with business and labor leaders if agnos rejects 
it the board needs eight yes votes to override his veto 
i want to sign vdt legislation that both labor and business 
can hold up as a model vdt legislation is an issue whose time has 
come agnos said 
the only similar ordinance passed in 1988 in suffolk county on 
new yorks long island and bitterly opposed by business owners was 
overturned a year later by a state court on the grounds that the 
local government lacked authority to make such rules that decision 
is under appeal 
city budget analysts estimate businesses will spend 315 
million to 765 million during the next two years to comply with 
the measure while the city will spend 14 million to 6 million 
jim lazarus vice president of the chamber of commerce said 
businesses need longer than two years to replace office furniture 
that doesnt meet the requirements 
the vdt coalition which represents unions computer workers and 
community groups cited studies that show the law would save 
businesses money through increased productivity and reduced 
injuries 
among the problems associated with regular work at a computer 
keyboard are nerve damage to the wrists and fingers back and neck 
strain eyestrain sleep disturbances chronic headaches nausea 
and fatigue 
one case of a wrist ailment known as carpal tunnel syndrome can 
cost 70000 when lost time and productivity are factored in said 
laura stock of the labor occupational health program at the 
university of california at berkeley

a childs shoe peeling away from its 
2inchhigh wooden sole an abdominal truss metal leg braces and 
plaster body parts all hang in a small shrine here 
i can remember when i was real small they had all the 
crutches the braces all around the altar tacked up there said 
albert hattier 61 
they are offerings of thanks to st roch who cared for victims 
of the black plague in the 1300s and himself survived the disease 
the faithful left them at the national shrine of st roch built in 
1875 after a yellow fever epidemic 
the items include models of healed organs and braces and 
crutches left by people who no longer needed them 
similar offerings are found in a number of european churches in 
a practice that dates at least to the middle ages 
these devotional offerings are a particularly latin 
expression said the rev john p ford a historian at catholic 
university in washington other people will give a window or 
a pew or a pulpit or candlesticks 
catholic churches in many us cities with large hispanic 
congregations have special rooms for such milagros said 
leonardo r anguiano a staff member at the mexicanamerican 
cultural center in san antonio texas 
most often he said they are tiny silver replicas of arms 
legs heads or other body parts sometimes they leave crutches 
sometimes they give thanks with a wedding dress sometimes with 
little baptismal outfits he said 
those at the shrine of st roch situated in a poor and 
workingclass neighborhood a few blocks outside the french quarter 
were moved from the altar in the 1950s during renovation to a tiny 
room next to the chapel 
the room is paved with marble tiles most inscribed thanks 
or merci a few tiles show the cured part a hand a leg a 
stomach 
thanks to st roch for my eye reads the inscription on one 
there is a 4foot statue of st lucy patron of people with eye 
troubles in her traditional pose a quill pen in her right hand 
and a pair of eyeballs anatomically correct down to the optic 
nerves on a plate in her left hand 
hattier whose grandfather was superintendent of the adjacent 
cemetery and who was himself superintendent from 1953 to 1985 said 
a second fullsized statue in the room is that of a woman who was 
cured after praying to st roch 
i think she had arthritis or something like that he said 
other hooks hold doll parts and feet hands a leg an ear a 
breast and even a brain made of plaster 
a tag reading hector a boesch gratitude is pinned to st 
lucy a pair of eyes is scratched on a smaller tag hung with it 
boesch 50 said his mother left the tags he credited his 
doctor with saving his eyesight after a scratched cornea became 
infected in 1974 but said prayer may have helped him recover from 
an aneurysm a year earlier 
while i was under the knife at east jefferson hospital the 
doctors gave up on me he said i think the power of st 
roch and some of the saints of my mother and grandmother who prayed 
for me may have helped 
personally i think its a little superstitious said 
boeschs sister liz miranda 41 but if it makes them feel a 
little better why not

for nearly three years the palestinian 
uprising consisted mainly of street battles in the occupied 
territories a war of stones far removed from most israelis daily 
lives 
but a series of fatal stabbings on the streets of tel aviv and 
jerusalem has brought the arab revolt closer to home 
growing fear among israelis has prompted calls for harsh 
punishment of arabs who attack jews it also has renewed debate 
over whether israel should continue to occupy the west bank and 
gaza strip home to 17 million palestinians 
the independent israeli newspaper yedioth ahronoth called this 
week for a solution based on physical separation between us and 
the palestinians 
the leftist al hamishmar said legislators calls for the death 
penalty and massive arab expulsions would only worsen the conflict 
the only solution lies in a separation of the two nations and 
a political settlement which the government has been unable to 
reach the paper said in an editorial 
few believe the rightwing government of prime minister yitzhak 
shamir is prepared to yield any of the territory captured from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war only recently shamir 
spoke of his likud blocs historic commitment to keeping all the 
land from the mediterranean to the jordan river 
but leftist parliament member dedi zucker who advocates trading 
land for peace believes growing anger and fear over the stabbings 
are shifting public opinion toward getting rid of the territories 
i cant remember in the last 10 years when my argument was 
accepted so well among people that i meet zucker said in an 
interview they say yes there is no hope for us living 
together 
he warns that if a peace process is not launched soon the 
antiisraeli attacks may accelerate 
i fear in the coming year we may witness some horrendous 
horrible terror activity zucker said it will be born he said 
out of palestinian desperation a lack of hope 
from the december 1987 start of the palestinian uprising against 
israeli occupation leaders of the revolt discouraged the use of 
firearms and attacks on jews inside israel 
but the guidelines began collapsing after the oct 8 riots on 
jerusalems temple mount in which 17 palestinians were killed by 
police gunfire 
the fundamentalist groups islamic holy war and hamas or zeal 
have since urged armed revenge for the deaths 
palestinian journalist daoud kuttab said the massive use of live 
ammunition by police on people armed only with stones had made many 
ordinary arabs feel restraint on their part was useless 
some people now feel they can cross the green line he said 
in a reference to the pre1967 demarcation between israel and the 
territories 
since oct 8 seven jews have been stabbed to death and at least 
19 wounded in attacks by palestinians inside israel 
palestinian anger over the temple mount incident also has 
strengthened support for fundamentalist moslem groups which 
advocate the destruction of israel at the expense of the palestine 
liberation organization which has been pushing for a twostate 
solution 
i am hoping the israelis decide to do something with a 
credible organization that still has some weight or face the 
possibility it will be left with organizations it cannot deal 
with kuttab said 
instead of compromise however rightwing politicians have 
responded to the latest attacks by urging even stiffer retaliation 
against palestinians 
after hamas claimed responsibility for the latest stabbing 
deaths of three israelis last week the government ordered the 
deportation of four hamas leaders and the arrests of hundreds of 
moslem activists 
defense minister moshe arens promised that the deportations 
will not be the last and science minister yuval neeman urged 
expelling 1000 uprising ringleaders others demanded banning 
all 110000 palestinian workers from entering israel 
israeli military analyst zeev schiff believes such tactics will 
backfire 
israel is still at the stage where many in the public feel 
that an angry reply will solve the problem he wrote in the daily 
haaretz but it is clear that we are nearing a critical stage 
where more and more people will understand that it is impossible to 
solve a civil war through military means only and that we need 
aggressive political steps

lamar alexander a former governor and 
president of the university of tennessee may well be the man who 
can make george bush the education president say those who know 
him 
even detractors of his reform programs credit alexander with 
generating interest in improving public schools and higher 
education in tennessee where as many as one in five adults is 
functionally illiterate 
bush on monday nominated alexander a 50yearold lawyer and son 
of teachers as education secretary if confirmed by the senate he 
would succeed lauro cavazos who was forced to resign last week 
no governor in the country is so clearly identified with the 
imperative to improve education in america the president said 
he said the former twoterm governor was at the forefront of the 
movement to restructure our nations schools 
relzie payton president of the 42000member tennessee 
education association praised alexanders education efforts with 
some reservations 
bush evidently lacks the basic knowledge of what it takes to 
be education president she said lamar alexander i think has 
a basic understanding he made education a no 1 issue and it 
became the discussion item on everybodys agenda 
for that we can say hooray she said 
alexander said that as education secretary he will work to 
improve the nations grade schools and training and adult education 
opportunities for american workers who need new skills for the 
changing workplace 
alexander entered politics as an aide to sen howard baker of 
tennessee and later worked as an aide in the nixon white house he 
won the governorship on his second try in 1978 serving until 1986 
state law prevents a third term 
he has been president of the 40000student university of 
tennessee since 1988 
education was the cornerstone of his second term as governor 
his 300 million better schools program outlined in 1983 gave 
teachers higher pay based on their education levels and 
performance expanded basic education curriculum put computers in 
junior high schools and added more math and science teachers 
in 1986 he finished second to massachusetts michael dukakis as 
the most effective governor in a survey by newsweek magazine 
doubts now are being raised about the better schools programs 
effectiveness particularly the merit raises a recent study also 
suggested the program was biased toward whites and women ms 
payton complained alexander failed to consult her organization 
before launching it in 1984 
alexander on monday refused to state his views on a government 
ruling that would deny federal funds to colleges that grant 
scholarships based on race 
but he noted that the university of tennessee offers 
scholarships to poor minority students and said my general 
disposition would be that when youre wandering through 
constitutional thickets that a warm heart and a little common 
sense sometimes are helpful 
praise for alexanders nomination was quick and widespread 
richard f rosser president of the national association of 
independent colleges and universities called alexander one of 
the best people in the country in background and understanding of 
education 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said he hoped alexander would not be as zealous as others 
in the bush administration in pushing school choice as the key 
to reform school choice lets parents decide which school to 
send their children to 
ernest boyer head of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching said every signal suggests that not 
only does he have strong commitment but a realistic sense of what 
the priorities should be it seems to me that hes looked at reform 
more broadly there is nothing in his past record to suggest that 
hed be narrow or ideological 
alexander received a law degree at new york university and later 
supplemented his income as a law clerk in new orleans by playing 
the trombone in a dixieland band at night 
he has known bush since 1968 and was once touted as his 1988 
running mate

portauprince haiti ap the rev jeanbertrand aristide 
likely the next occupant of the presidential palace is for haitis 
impoverished masses a savior come to deliver them from their 
misery 
the 37yearold priest has enormous support from the people and 
has promised to sweep out tyranny and usher in an era of democratic 
rule 
but he is loathed by many of haitis traditional power brokers 
the army the business community rural landowners and roman 
catholic and protestant church leaders opponents see him as a 
populist demagogue whose presidency poses the threat of a 
theocratic dictatorship 
although official returns were not expected until late today 
international observers said aristide was projected to win sundays 
elections the countrys firstever democratic vote 
the priest has said his mission is to make life better for the 
poor the slum dwellers and peasants he has associated with for 
years 
he is slight bespectacled and softspoken yet capable of 
crowdrousing oratory 
for years he preached to the poor from a church in the capitals 
slums he shared his feelings telling his parishioners when he was 
depressed shedding tears publicly without shame he operated a 
home for streethardened boys 
he first decided to run for president to counteract the 
candidacy of roger lafontant selfproclaimed chief of the dreaded 
tonton macoute militia used by the duvaliers to terrorize the 
populace into submission 
lafontant later disqualified from running calls aristide a 
communist and has said he will block his way to the presidency 
born the son of peasants in the southern coast town of port 
salut aristide was sensitized at an early age to the countrys 
stark poverty by the roman catholic salesian order 
he joined the order in 1982 and was ousted in 1988 for 
allegedly fomenting revolution 
aristide is an advocate of liberation theology a belief popular 
among third world priests that the church should be involved in the 
struggles of the poor 
he remains a priest but cannot lead mass or deliver radio 
sermons under vatican regulations priests cannot hold public 
office and aristide has said he would quit the priesthood if he won 
the election 
jesus was not a priest he was a man fighting for justice 
he said recently 
aristide is the figurehead of a messianic movement the 
incarnation of a collective dream says laennec hurbon a 
specialist on religious movements in the caribbean his 
responsibility to his following is not the same as that of a 
politician to his constituency 
jeanclaude bajeux a human rights activist and former priest 
called aristide a great communicator 
aristide is a poet nourished by biblical imagery he is a 
master of the vernacular creole he said unlike the other 
candidates who told the people what they thought he helped the 
people express themselves 
aristide gained a nationwide following from radio broadcasts of 
his strident sermons against successive military regimes that have 
ruled haiti since jeanclaude baby doc duvalier fled the 
country in 1986 
he has been the target of three assassination attempts most 
recently in 1988 when armybacked thugs stormed his saint jean 
bosco church during mass and killed at least 12 parishioners 
aristide has not outlined a political agenda to carry out his 
campaign promises 
playing on messianic symbolism and patriotic fervor aristide 
has stumped nationwide he calls his campaign operation lavales or 
torrent its emblem is the fighting cock which represents 
haitis coming sunrise

lothar de maiziere who a year ago led east 
germany to democracy and unity with the west has resigned from the 
reunited nations first government following allegations that he 
was once a police informant 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said monday there were 
indications de maiziere and a man codenamed in files of east 
germanys stasi secret police as czerny were one and the same 
he said there was no proof however that de maiziere knowingly 
worked for the secret police of the former communist nation 
de maiziere has denied the charges but resigned from chancellor 
helmut kohls government as ministerwithoutportfolio and said he 
would not be a member of kohls new cabinet 
he kept his seat in the new germany parliament but resigned his 
leadership positions in the christian democratic party 
the resignation of the softspoken de maiziere who often said 
he preferred playing viola to playing politics illustrates how 
hard it will be for the united nation to escape the repercussions 
of east germanys past 
as one of germanys truly historical figures the man who built 
and held together former east germanys young fractious democracy 
is by far the biggest casualty so far but he was not the first and 
likely wont be the last 
de maiziere a professional viola player in east german 
orchestras during the 1960s spent most of his adult life as a 
lawyer under the old communist regime a deeply religious man he 
made a name for himself by defending concientious objectors and 
political dissidents 
he also was a member of the christian democrats an approved 
relatively ineffectual party that received money from the communist 
government but put forth an image of independence 
in november 1989 after the communist hardliners were ousted by 
the peaceful revolt he was chosen to lead the party as it tried to 
remake itself in the image of its west german namesake 
when the communists agreed to free elections in march de 
maizieres party formed a coalition with two other conservative 
parties and began advocating swift unity with west germany 
another lawyer wolfgang schnur was chosen to lead the 
coalition but schnur resigned march 14 four days before the 
elections amid allegations he too had been an informant for the 
secret police 
de maiziere 50 was hastily chosen to replace him and led the 
coalition to resounding victory 
after german unification on oct 3 de maiziere was among four 
east german officials added to kohls expanded cabinet 
one day after the election new reports surfaced alleging that 
de maiziere had been a paid stasi informant who even had an 
identity card and a code name 
the government said monday the evidence was inconclusive but 
accepted his resignation schaeuble said the investigation would 
continue 
the stasi had hundreds of thousands of informants who spied on 
their colleagues in government factories offices and schools 
nonconformists were harassed intimidated and denied decent wages 
former stasi agents often claim they should not be singled out 
because virtually everyone in a position of influence or privilege 
worked with them 
eastern german politicians have said privately that the stasi 
spent the waning days of communist rule concocting false 
information intended to implicate prominent people

nasa cant keep its earthbound buildings in 
good repair according to a governmental report 
the space shuttles garage leaks high voltage transformers are 
corroded one cooling tower collapsed from an accumulation of ice 
and faulty wiring caused a fire in a control room all because of 
poor maintenance the congressional general accounting office said 
monday 
nasa has given little priority to preserving its facilities 
most of which are at least 30 years old and there is no standard 
maintenance system within nasa the study said 
many of nasas facilities have not been adequately maintained 
and are in degraded conditions it continued in addition 
several serious incidents have been caused by the facilities 
deterioration including a fire and a steam line explosion 
john e obrien assistant deputy administrator of nasa called 
the report a useful assessment and said the agency is in the

stranded in addis ababa after trekking there from their homes in 
northern ethiopia to escape famine and civil war and await flights

new york gov mario cuomo maintains the nation 
is in a recession as a result of 10 years of republican economic 
policies and argues that only the federal government can spur a 
recovery 
the states have done all they can to raise taxes and cut 
services the threeterm democrat said monday in a speech at the 
national press club 
dont tell me its hard i know it is but thats why youre 
there he said of policymakers in the white house and congress 
it is not a lack of options it is not a lack of ideas it is 
simply unwillingness so far to make the hard decisions 
cuomo who has been on the short list of presidential 
possibilities for six years said the nation failed in the 1980s to 
respond to crack aids homelessness and an eroding education 
system 
he lambasted the ballooning deficit during the decade and the 
annual interest bill country must pay on the 3 trillion national 
debt 
thats the part that gets me and most governors he said 
thats 200 billion that doesnt put a computer into the hands of 
one child doesnt fund one hour of research doesnt provide a 
single meal for one hungry person 
cuomo said the supplysiders of the 1980s really did think 
that all you needed was capital to create economic growth and 
prosperity he called those policies simplistic and unfair and said 
they left the nation fundamentally weakened 
it is time for the captain to change course he said of 
president bush adding that investment is needed in the labor force 
of the future as well as in bridges roads technology and energy 
cuomo made a point of saying he supports bushs posture in the 
persian gulf 
i do believe he needs to go to congress before starting a 
war but he has not ruled that out the governor said

pioneer 6 built to study the sun for six 
months is still doing its job 25 years later offering critics of 
nasas whizbang superprojects proof that simple is better 
after 25 years we are relearning the importance of simplicity 
and reliability and the value of science as the focus of the 
american space program said rep george brown incoming chairman 
of the house committee on science space and technology 
the california democrat spoke monday as nasa and trw inc which 
built pioneer 6 held a daylate anniversary celebration of the 
spacecrafts dec 16 1965 launch from florida pioneer is now the 
oldest operating spacecraft 
the barrelshaped 6 million spacecraft compares favorably with 
helicopters that fall out of the sky and amphibious assault 
vehicles that sink said fred wirth pioneer 6 deputy project 
manager the government does sometimes purchase things that work 
and pioneer 6 is one of them 
the 140pound spacecraft provides lessons for the national 
aeronautics and space administration bedeviled by problems with 
the hubble space telescope shuttles and other huge 
superprojects said brown whose committee oversees nasa 
he said the simpleisbetter view of the space program was 
confirmed by last weeks report from a government advisory panel 
the group said nasa must focus on unmanned scientific spacecraft 
and put less emphasis on the shuttle manned planetary missions and 
the proposed space station and aerospace plane 
pioneer 6 which was 1319 million miles from earth on monday 
has traveled 154 billion miles without a single stop at a 
service station costing a measly fourhundredths of a cent per 
mile said trw spokeswoman montye male 
pioneer 6 was built to serve as a solar weather station and 
make the first detailed measurements of the suns atmosphere 
it collected information about solar flares allowing the 
government to protect astronauts from intense radiation outbursts 
and to predict disturbances that periodically disrupt 
communications and electric power grids on earth 
it also studied the back side of the sun for the first time 
measured solar wind speeds of 144 million mph tested einsteins 
theory of relativity helped track sunspot cycles and in 1973 
measured the tail of comet kohoutek 
to observe pioneers anniversary a nasa tracking station at 
goldstone calif tuned into pioneers radio signal for about 90 
minutes monday 
a computer converted the normally inaudible signal into 
rapidfire beeping played at news conferences at the california 
museum of science and industry in los angeles and at ames research 
center in mountain view near san francisco 
in los angeles officials also cut a big yellow cake which was 
frosted to look like the sun and had a pioneer 6 model suspended 
above it 
three of pioneer 6s six science instruments still work 
although only two can be turned on simultaneously because the 
spacecrafts solar power cells are wearing out wirth said he 
couldnt predict how much longer pioneer 6 will survive 
newer spacecraft have usurped much of pioneers value to 
scientists and it sends data to earth only about twice a year 
because of demands other spacecraft place on nasas tracking 
stations

hospital records often err in listing 
medications that patients older than 65 were taking before 
admission posing a risk of serious treatment errors a study 
suggests 
sixty percent of records in the study contained at least one 
error in listing important medications and 18 percent had 
three or more errors 
the analysis excluded overthecounter drugs cold medicines and 
medications applied to the body when those drugs were included 83 
percent of hospital records contained at least one error 
mistakes in medication records mean patients may not be given 
drugs they need or they may get unneeded drugs that cause harmful 
side effects said researcher dr mark beers 
he cited the case of a patient whose records failed to note she 
was taking an oral diabetes medication the drug was not continued 
in the hospital until beers pointed out the error he said 
another patient was given a bloodthinning drug because his 
record said he was on the medication when in fact the treatment 
had been stopped months before beers said the error created a 
needless risk of bleeding beers said 
we found some really clinically very important problems that 
could lead to complications prolonged hospital stays and perhaps 
even death said beers of the university of california at los 
angeles 
i expected to find some errors but the number of people 
involved and the quantity of errors and the kinds of drugs involved 
were much greater much more serious than i had speculated beers 
said 
the study appears in the november issue of the journal of the 
american geriatrics society 
the 60 percent error rate is high enough that i think every 
patient and every doctor would agree thats scary commented dr 
jerry avorn of harvard university medical school an authority on 
medication use by the elderly 
while most such mistakes will not cause any trouble the high 
frequency means its just a matter of time and the law of 
probability that some unpleasant clinical outcome is going to 
occur he said 
part of the problem is that physicians are not as preoccupied 
as we should be with taking a medication history avorn said 
another factor is that sick or injured patients are often unable to 
give a comprehensive list of their medications avorn and beers 
said 
beers recommended that people of any age carry an updated list 
of current medications with them including the name of each drug 
the dosage and how often they take it 
he also recommended that patients older than 65 be asked a 
second time about their current medication use a day or so after 
admission by a nurse or pharmacist who can devote 15 or 20 minutes 
to a thorough interview 
the study involved 122 randomly chosen patients who were 
admitted to a university hospital or a community hospital their 
average age was 77 and all were older than 65 
the work focused on older people because they tend to use more 
medications than younger people change prescriptions more 
frequently and are more vulnerable to side effects beers said 
researchers checked records written by doctors at the time of 
admission and then carefully interviewed the patients within two 
days of admission to get their own list of medications for 
comparison 
for important medications records for 52 percent of all 
patients omitted at least one drug while records for 22 percent 
listed a drug that the patient was not actually taking 
omitting a drug not only means that a patient may not get a 
needed medication in the hospital but it also deprives doctors of 
a clue to the patients medical status beers said

the head of the presidential commission 
organizing the 500th anniversary celebration of columbus voyage to 
america says he has submitted his resignation amid questions about 
his and the panels finances 
john goudie a miami republican and real estate businessman was 
quoted as saying in the new york times today that he sent a letter 
to president bush announcing his resignation from the unsalaried 
post 
goudie who was appointed by president reagan in 1985 denied 
any wrongdoing 
its time for me to bow out he said adding that the 
commision needed some favorable publicity 
there was no immediate word on whether goudies resignation was 
accepted white house spokesman sean walsh had no comment on the

to his knowledge the commission had no particular financial 
problems

scores of volunteers climbed through fences into 
vacant lots strewn with broken glass and searched ratinfested 
alleys early today in bostons annual count of the homeless the 
nations only tally of its kind 
armed with walkie talkies more than 100 volunteers set out at 
midnight and combed 35 zones in a count that helps other cities 
estimate their homeless needs another increase in the homeless 
population was expected this year 
homeless people encountered by the volunteers were often offered 
a bed or food in most cases the volunteers simply counted the 
bodies where they found them in subway stations behind trash bins 
on benches and roaming around 
hi how are you you wanna go to a shelter mayor raymond 
flynn asked a women curled up in the doorway of an ice cream store 
her puffed up face lay on a pile of possessions 
no shelter the elderly woman named suzy replied gripping 
her blanket in the relatively mild winter night temperatures were 
in the 30s 
i see her there every night said flynn shes mentally 
ill she needs medication you try to get her to go to a shelter 
and shell get very very violent 
suzy was marked on a chart just one in the dozen street people 
he and three volunteers recorded in their zone 
flynn and other city officials said boston is the only major 
city to hit the streets for a head count of its homeless 
officials combine the count with a survey of hospitals and 
shelters to calculate bostons homeless population the figures 
which will be tabulated this week are used to lobby for money 
determine where to build shelters and develop services 
we really make the promise no one will go without a shelter 
bed said ann maguire executive director of bostons emergency 
shelter commission a city office this is how we make sure we 
can accommodate all of them 
in 1989 3830 homeless people were documented an 11 percent 
increase over the previous year currently 3 million is spent on 
beds and services for the homeless 
homeless advocates and city officials said there probably would 
be an increase in the number of homeless this year 
maguire said the past four head counts have accurately portrayed 
the homeless population 
last year 128 men and 29 women were found on the street 
if we dont find too many homeless people on the streets we 
feel were successful at sheltering them richarch weintraub 
director of the citys three shelters 
in a subway station flynn and the volunteers found a man in his 
30s bundled in a coat and his arms curled around his head asleep at 
about 1 am on a bench in a passage asked if he wanted to go to a 
shelter he said leave me alone 
another man was propped up on a bench sipping coffee holding a 
bag from a doughnut shop volunteers tried to get him to a shelter 
but the man was incoherent 
other people showed signs of drinking an intoxicated man was 
persuaded to enter a homeless shelter 
flynns national task force on hunger and homeless is due to 
release a major study wednesday the mayor said it will show 
increased demands for things as simple as soup kitchens and bread 
lines and is likely to show a dramatic rise in the number of 
mentally ill homeless people 
flynn a boston native who knows many street people by name 
covered zone 13 without the help of a map 
see these little cots flynn said pointing to a row of foam 
rubber mats tucked behind a trash bin not far from the combat zone 
the citys red light district they hide their clothes here 
their little goodies

secretary of state james a baker iii 
said today that he would not object to europeiraq talks on the 
persian gulf crisis and expressed confidence that european leaders 
will accept nothing short of a complete iraqi withdrawal from 
kuwait 
the european community was expected to decide later today 
whether to schedule a meeting between iraqi foreign minister tariq 
aziz and italian foreign minister gianni de michelis who would 
represent the ec 
we support all diplomatic efforts to try and resolve this 
crisis peacefully and politically baker said as he entered nato 
headquarters for the second day of meetings with other foreign 
ministers 
he dismissed suggestions that such discussions would give iraqi 
president saddam hussein the impression of a split in the alliance 
arrayed against iraq 
those kinds of talks will not lead iraq to think theres a 
division when the message continues to be the same message baker 
told reporters 
on monday after baker warned that saddam might try to get the 
world to accept a partial pullout from kuwait the nato ministers 
issued a communique saying they wanted iraqs unconditional 
withdrawal from kuwait 
de michelis had planned a meeting with aziz in rome after the 
iraqis scheduled talks in washington with president bush 
but the bushaziz talks set for monday were scrubbed in a 
dispute over dates for a subsequent visit to baghdad by baker 
the iraqi government has asked de michelis to agree to meet aziz 
anyway 
de michelis refused to answer when asked about the meeting 
other ministers including british foreign secretary douglas hurd 
said on monday that they would prefer that aziz make a stop in 
washington first 
the nato foreign ministers statement monday said the gulf 
crisis can be settled peacefully only by a complete iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait 
we have not decided to go to war belgian foreign minister 
mark eyskens said we are all in favor of a peaceful solution 
the choice between peace and war is in the hands of iraq 
all nato allies except iceland luxembourg germany and turkey 
have sent ground air or sea forces to the gulf region turkey has 
reinforced troop deployments along its border with iraq and the 
other nations have provided aid to the gulf force 
on monday baker told nato allies that saddam he expects may 
pull some of his troops out of kuwait by jan 15 the un 
deadline for an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait in an effort to 
split international opposition 
we need to anticipate saddams possible moves be prepared for 
a partial withdrawal ploy and coordinate closely our responses 
baker said at the start of the twoday meeting of the 16nation 
north atlantic treaty organization 
baker also appealed monday for more military and financial help 
to bolster the us deployment in the gulf and economic aid for 
nations suffering from the crisis most notably nato member turkey 
turkey borders iraq and has suffered millions in trade losses 
because of the us embargo against baghdad 
by midjanuary washington will have deployed over 400000 
troops in the gulf region

a computer chip found in the wreckage of pan am 
flight 103 suggests a libyan planted the bomb that blew the plane 
out of the sky over scotland cbs says 
british police discovered the evidence last summer while combing 
through the fields around the village of lockerbie where the plane 
crashed dec 21 1988 the network reported monday all 259 people 
on board and 11 other people on the ground were killed 
the computer chip lodged in the bombs detonator matched a 
bomb part carried by a libyan agent arrested in dakar senegal 10 
months before the new yorkbound boeing 747 was destroyed cbs 
said 
it was constructed and put together in such a way as to have a 
libyan signature to it vince cannistraro former chief of the 
cia counterterrorism section told the network 
previously investigators suspected the bombing had been carried 
out by a bombmaking cell based in germany and acting on the orders 
of ahmed jibril leader of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command 
in turn investigators believed jibril was working for iran to 
avenge the deaths of 290 people aboard an iranian jetliner shot 
down in the persian gulf in july 1988 by the uss vincennes 
but investigators have concluded jibril had to change operatives 
when his german bombmaking cell was uncovered by german police 
and that he turned to the libyans according to cbs 
the evidence according to the unidentified investigators is 
the computer chip which is different from those the jibril 
bombmakers were known to use 
they used a switch triggered by the planes altitude the 
lockerbie bomb was a swissmade timing device of the type traced to 
the libyan agent the report said 
in addition the toshiba radio preferred by the german 
bombmaking cell for concealing explosives was a singlespeaker 
model while the lockerbie bomb parts of which were in the 
wreckage was a twinspeaker model cbs said 
the libyan operative was spotted in malta one month before the 
lockerbie bombing cbs reported the radio bomb was put aboard an 
air malta flight there and later transferred to pan am 103 it 
said 
a libyan connection was also reported last week in the london 
newspaper the independent which quoted unidentified highlevel 
sources close to the inquiry into the crash 
asked about the independent report on friday a spokesman for 
scotlands senior law officer the lord advocate declined to 
comment on what he called media speculation 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt germany changing planes at 
londons heathrow airport

iraqs health minister claimed today that 
2042 children under age 5 have died because of shortages in baby 
food and medicines brought on by the unordered embargo on trade 
with his country 
the minister abdulsalam mohammed said blamed president bush 
for the deaths in a statement distributed by the official iraqi 
news agency 
documented evidence of this high rate in childrens death will 
stand to condemn the crimes committed by bush and his partners 
ina quoted the minister as saying 
he said 600 of the children died in hospitals this month mainly 
due to shortages of vaccines that caused the spread of contagious 
diseases like measles diphtheria tetanus and whooping cough 
said claimed on dec 3 that 1416 children had died because of 
shortages resulting from the sanctions the un security council 
imposed on iraq as punishment for its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
western diplomats in baghdad have discounted the reports of 
shortages noting that the security council decided in october to 
allow shipments of essential food and medicines to iraq 
the diplomats note that since midoctober nearly 120 tons of 
medicines have arrived from humanitarian groups worldwide 
earmarked for iraqi children 
most of the shipments were in exchange for western hostages 
helped by iraq until president saddam hussein announced a blanket 
release on dec6 
last week alone iraqs red crescent the islamic equivalent of 
the red cross announced it had received a shipment of 22 tons of 
medical supplies from the italy and another 28 tons of the same 
from the united nations children fund unicef 
but government hospitals still report shortages of vaccines 
antibiotics and baby formulas and tell patients they should bring 
their own 
iraqis say they can buy medicines at pharmacies and on the black 
market but the prices are at least five times higher than normal 
some diplomats and medical personnel in baghdad suggested last 
month that iraq might be stockpiling medicine in case of war and 
that some of the reported shortages resulted from profiteering 
a government rationing plan enforced in september limits each 
child under age 1 to three 16ounce cans of baby formula a month 
at government subsidized stores each can costs 750 fils or 225 
dollars at the official exchange rate 
iraqis are forced to supplement their babies diet with powdered 
milk bought on the black market for as much as 40 dinars per 
kilogram 22 pounds 
that price amounts to 120 at the official rate and is beyond 
the means of many iraqis

the un security council has for a 
seventh time postponed voting on a resolution deploring israels 
deportation of palestinians from the occupied territories 
but the united states which had stifled any resolution linking 
the palestinians to a middle east peace conference or assailing 
israel too harshly agreed during debate monday to support a 
carefully critical proposal 
council president abdalla saleh alashtal of yemen said he was 
not certain which of several amended resolutions might be put to a 
vote wednesday when the council meets on the issue again 
he said various western and nonaligned drafts would have to 
first be reconciled 
the resolutions under consideration also call for an 
international conference to settle the arabisraeli conflict 
the postponements of the votes over the past two weeks have 
largely been the doing of the united states which fears its 
support for a peace conference would be seen as a concession to 
induce iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
iraq insists it will not consider pulling out unless israel 
moves to relinquish the occupied west bank and gaza strip which it 
seized during the 1967 middle east war 
israels decision last week to deport four palestinian leaders 
of an extremist group apparently pushed the united states closer to 
the position of security council members who want to improve the 
safety of palestinians in the occupied territories 
the deported palestinians were leaders of a group that claimed 
responsibility for murdering three israeli civilians outside tel 
aviv but many palestinians say they prefer death to deportation 
from the land they call their own saturdays deportations order 
were israels first in over a year 
the usbacked draft resolution deplores the decision by the 
government of israel the occupying power to resume deportation of 
palestinian civilians in the occupied territories 
it also requests the un secretarygeneral urgently monitor the 
safety of palestinian civilians and make new efforts to help them 
it was not immediately clear whether the proposal goes far 
enough to satisfy the councils strongest palestinian supporters 
another proposal under consideration states that an 
international peace conference on the middle east properly 
structured and at an appropriate time could promote a 
comprehensive settlement the united states has indicated it would 
support a carefully arranged conference at an unspecified time 
israel has rejected any deployment of un personnel in the 
israelioccupied territories as an infringement upon its 
sovereignty 
it has also rejected most proposals for an international 
conference on the mideast situation

thousands of reservists reported to their 
army units today in a mass mobilization begun a day after iraqs 
rulers declared once again that they would never surrender kuwait 
we are ready for the decisive showdown if thus god wills but 
many heads will roll and many thrones will fall said a statement 
from the ruling revolutionary command council 
the defense ministry on monday ordered all ablebodied 
33yearold reservists to report for duty by thursday for short 
training periods before being assigned to active duty 
the reservists began reporting today according to officials at 
mobilization centers 
president saddam hussein said last month that he would call up 
some 250000 reservists most of the countrys 230000 other 
reservists had already been activated following the aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait 
mondays move was iraqs third major callup of reserves in 
recent weeks men aged 3032 were ordered to report for military 
duty last month as were 60000 farmers who had earlier been 
exempted to help boost food production to counter united 
nationsimposed trade sanctions against iraq 
the londonbased international institute for strategic studies 
estimates that iraq has 904000 men ages 1822 and 13 million in 
the 2332 age group 
saddam has placed an estimated 500000 men in the kuwait theater 
facing a 28nation usdominated force that by midjanuary is 
expected to total around 650000 men and women 
iraqs regular army has 500000 soldiers some of whom are 
deployed on its borders with turkey and syria 
the united nations security council last month ordered iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait by jan 15 or face military action 
in its statement monday the government said it wanted peace but 
would not capitulate to western demands to abandon kuwait 
unconditionally 
iraqi authorities have intensified preparations for war in the 
last couple of weeks ordering owners of buildings to provide bomb 
shelters and expanding firstaid and civil defense training 
the staterun aljomhuriya daily said monday that civil defense 
authorities have opened 342 training centers in the capital of 4 
million people

offices that will cost the financially 
strapped city government 12 million a month barely will be used 
philadelphias comptroller says 
the city which may miss a payroll payment in 10 days unless it 
gets a cash infusion in january is taking over 600000 square feet 
of space it agreed to rent three years ago in a deal to keep cigna 
corp from leaving the city 
jonathan saidel philadelphias comptroller said the city plans 
to fill only 12323 square feet about 2 percent in the two 
office buildings the company has vacated 
we found that much of the 12 million monthly rental payment 
for the cigna space will simply be a waste of taxpayers money 
since the city has no effective plans for moving city departments 
into the space as it becomes available saidel said in an audit 
released last week 
saidel accusing city administrators of grossly inadequate 
handling of office space costs said lease costs for the city have 
skyrocketed 
the city budgeted 366 million for rent in the 1991 budget year 
up 56 percent from the 234 million of fiscal 1990 and more than 
six times the total rent of 54 million in fiscal 1980 
the report said the citys system and procedures for renting 
office space were in disarray and millions of dollars are wasted 
each year on rent 
mayor w wilson goode did not immediately respond to a request 
through his press secretary for comment on the audit 
public property commissioner andres perez jr was not in his 
office monday and unavailable for comment a secretary said 
philadelphia has overspent its 21 billion budget by some 240 
million this year unless it receives a cash infusion the city has 
warned it will not meet its payroll as early as dec 28

japan today announced a 108 million package of 
emergency food and medical aid to the soviet union but stressed 
that its policy of withholding ordinary assistance from moscow 
remains unchanged 
japan is making its first offer of food aid to the soviet union 
as a humanitarian gesture prime minister toshiki kaifu said 
a longstanding dispute over the ownership of small islands off 
northern japan has prevented tokyo and moscow from signing a treaty 
to formally end world war ii hostilities japan has been reluctant 
to extend aid to the soviet union 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said japans basic 
position on economic assistance to the soviet union remains 
unchanged but that humanitarian aid is being offered because the 
situation is deteriorating very rapidly 
the package consists of 38 million in food aid and an equal 
amount in medical aid both to be delivered through the red cross 
up to 100 million in food credits through the exportimport bank 
of japan and government tax support for organizations that help the 
soviet union the foreign ministry said 
the ministry had delayed deciding on food aid because of reports 
of a bumper soviet harvest but watanabe acknowledged that problems 
with transportation and organization had created food distribution 
problems 
indeed foreign minister taro nakayama expressed concern tuesday 
that food from japan would not reach its intended destination 
we would like to ask soviet authorities for cooperation to 
make sure our assistance will properly reach the destination he 
said 
kazuhiko togo the head of the foreign ministrys soviet 
division said the government had a tough time deciding on the aid 
plan because of the political strains between the nations

mary christmas says it wouldnt be 
a merry christmas without a little merriment about her holiday 
moniker 
its a good conversation piece and i never get tired of people 
laughing about my name said the 38yearold mother of three 
sometimes however her name can get her in a pickle 
for example phone conversations can became more than a bit 
twisted when she picks up at the horry county alcohol and drug 
abuse commission 
ive had several people hang up on me in the last week mrs 
christmas said but once they find out my name really is mary 
christmas they never forget it 
her 13yearold daughter also named mary christmas also said 
the name is cause for unwanted attention 
all my teachers call on me to do stuff for them because they 
cant remember anyone elses name the eighthgrader complained 
there are other drawbacks too 
one time a woman wouldnt cash my check she refused to 
believe anyone could have the name mary christmas mrs christmas 
said 
and this time of year its particularly strange because people 
call out merry christmas and im constantly turning around to see 
what they want 
mary christmas was not always mary christmas she was mary alice 
allen until 18 years ago when she married kent christmas who works 
at a local car dealership 
at first i never really thought about it because my friends 
usually called me mary alice she said then other people 
started calling me mary christmas and it stuck no one ever just 
calls me mary its always mary christmas

pentagon audits revealed mcdonnell douglas 
corp and general dynamics corp have a possible chance of 
bankruptcy a newspaper reported today 
the financial health of the nations two largest defense 
contractors has been debated privately all year but the september 
audits by the defense contract audit agency are the first official 
word on the subject according to the los angeles times 
the pentagons accountants found that the financial condition of 
the two firms had deteriorated this year but their ability to 
complete projects under contract was not impaired 
a general dynamics spokesman told the times he had not seen the 
audit but said it is unfortunate that matters related to that 
were leaked at this particular time 
mcdonnell douglas chief financial officer herbert lanese said 
any prediction of bankruptcy was ludicrous the company also 
discredited the criteria on which the pentagon made its 
conclusions 
the formula in question is the zscore a weighted average 
of ratios that considers sales operating profits retained 
earnings and working capital as a percentage of total assets and 
market value of stock as a percentage of total debt 
auditors gave mcdonnell douglas a zscore of 227 or a 
possible chance of bankruptcy a score of 18 or lower means a 
probable chance of bankruptcy 
general dynamics got a score of 242 also indicating a 
possible chance of bankruptcy according to the audit 
private defense industry experts also questioned the pentagons 
findings 
if i had to rely on the government for my financial analysis 
i would be in a lot of trouble said aerospace analyst howard 
rubel of cj lawrence morgan grenfell one of the problems that 
exists in any form of government secondguessing is that they dont 
understand what they are doing 
mcdonnell douglas does have two debtladen projects the c17 
cargo jet which is exceeding its contract ceiling by 600 million 
and the a12 attack jet facing an overrun of 500 million

the district of columbia has approved the most 
farreaching gun control bill in the nation a measure to make 
manufacturers and dealers liable for deaths and injuries caused by 
semiautomatic weapons 
mayor marion barry jr said today he has signed the bill which 
cannot become law until reviewed by congress 
i think we have to take all measures to try to get the guns 
off the streets of america barry said on wttgtvs fox morning 
news the manufacturer has to begin to take some of the weight 
we dont need those guns on the streets 
barry said everybody who touches guns used in homicides should 
be held liable 
the measure which was approved by the city council last week 
would give private citizens the right to sue for damages from 
manufacturers and sellers of semiautomatic weapons regardless of 
where the makers and dealers do business 
its time for these merchants of death to pay a price said 
council member william lightfoot who cosponsored the bill we 
can set a very meaningful precedent 
officials in washington which has the nations highest homicide 
rate say that since january 1988 about 70 percent of the 8500 
guns recovered by police have been traced to dealers in neighboring 
maryland and virginia 
the bill will face strong opposition from the national rifle 
association when it arrives in congress for a 30day review period 
that begins when congress returns to legislative business jan 23 
congress normally lets new city laws stand but controversial 
measures sometimes become platforms for ideological debate and are 
defeated 
a lobbyist for the nra carl t rowan jr called the bill 
frivolous and said it would not have any impact on the 
violence i dont think it stands a chance in court 
the nra was instrumental earlier this year in the defeat of 
three congressional proposals to ban semiautomatic weapons 
michael beard president of the coalition to stop gun violence 
said he believes the bill would survive a court challenge although 
no real precedent exists 
a top aide to rep ron dellums dcalif chairman of the house 
district of columbia committee said dellums would support the 
measure but the office of rep dana rohrabacher rcalif who 
also is on the committee said letting such a law stand would be 
unconscionable 
president bushs chief of staff john sununu has said the white 
house also will look at the matter 
the bill is based on productliability law which allows 
individuals to seek monetary damages for death or injury to 
themselves or family members caused by a particular product 
in such cases juries or judges decide the amount of damages 
after a trial on the individuals lawsuit 
the city already has one of the strictest gun laws in the 
country sales are banned and private citizens are prohibited from 
owning weapons unless they were purchased and registered before 
1976 
still the murder toll keeps climbing from 369 two years ago to 
434 in 1989 and 465 with just 14 days left in 1990 
by damn its time to stand up said council chairman david 
clarke who cosponsored the bill if we can begin to take the 
profit out of the gun trade it will have an effect on our lives

dozens of former contras seized a 
police post and battled the sandinista army in fighting that 
claimed 11 lives and left 20 people wounded the highest casualty 
toll during violeta chamorros presidency 
the violence occurred as mrs chamorro prepared to veto a 25 
percent cut in the military budget that the sandinista peoples 
army said would push nicaragua into chaos and a bloodbath 
col antenor rosales said the fighting took place sunday when 60 
rebels seized a police post in jalapa 125 miles north of managua 
the army put down the uprising and captured more than half the 
former contras he said in a interview on staterun television 
eleven people were killed and 20 wounded rosales said he did 
not say how many of the dead and wounded were former contras 
the usbacked contras agreed to give up their 10yearold 
battle in june their leftist sandinista foes were defeated at the 
polls in february by mrs chamorros conservative united national 
opposition coalition 
mrs chamorro has reduced the size of the army which with the 
police is still controlled by the sandinistas and promised the 
demobilized contras land and support for their resettlement 
but her efforts at reconciliation have fallen short of former 
fighters expectations and strong antagonisms persist between the 
contras and the armed forces and police 
interior ministry spokesman frank cesar said monday the 
government is investigating the clash in jalapa which he said 
in no way contributes to the reconciliation and pacification of 
the country 
in a television broadcast cesar condemned a series of attacks 
on uno elected officials that began during the weekend 
a bomb destroyed the car of an uno lawmaker humberto castilla 
and part of his home in the southeastern town of juigalpa on 
saturday castilla a hardliner who pushed for the army budget 
cuts was out of the country at the time no one was hurt in the 
blast 
grenads were fired sunday and monday at the homes of several 
other coalition mayors and deputies who backed the budget cuts no 
injuries were reported in the offensive that uno blamed on army 
members 
mrs chamorro returning monday from a costa rican summit in 
which central american presidents addressed demilitarization of the 
region said she wants to reduce the sandinista armys size 
but she said we cant do things overnight 
she has cut thousands of soldiers from the ranks of the army 
and the 39member sandinista bloc in the national assembly opposed 
the military budget reduction saying it would mean firing 10000 
more 
on sunday the army took fullpage ads in prosandinista 
newspapers and ran television spots to publicize a threepage 
communique that said some legislators were pushing nicaragua into 
chaos and a bloodbath by voting for the budget reduction 
as humans that we are we cannot throw into the street the army 
or any civilian mrs chamorro said monday 
mrs chamorro is treading a fine line between the polarized 
positions of the powerful sandinista party and the 14party uno 
coalition whose 51 deputies in the 92member national assembly 
voted in unprecedented unity for the military budget cut on friday 
the leglislature includes two independents 
since taking office in april she has weathered paralyzing 
sandinista union general strikes and a series of roadblocks by 
sympathizers of former contras 
the dissidence from both sides has erupted in violence but the 
shootout sunday claimed more lives than any incident before

safety of the nations nuclear weapons was not 
given the same urgency as modernization of those systems to meet 
military requirements a special review panel said today 
three of the nations leading physicists in a report to the 
house armed services committee also expressed concern over the 
absence of quantitative safety standards for the dispersal of 
plutonium 
plutonium a highly poisonous component in a nuclear device 
could be released from a weapon by a fire or conventional explosion 
as well as by an atomic explosion the panel said in its 44page 
report 
although plutonium dispersal is a much less threatening danger 
than a sizable nuclear yield it is nevertheless a potentially 
serious hazard particularly if the plutonium is aerosolized in a 
chemical detonation the panel said 
its members are dr sidney d drell deputy director of the 
stanford linear accelerator center nobel laureate dr charles h 
townes of the university of california at berkeley and dr john s 
foster head of the defense science board 
the armed services committee empaneled the three in may after 
questions were raised about the safety of several nuclear weapons 
systems including the shortrange airtoground attack missile 
known as srama 
since that time defense secretary dick cheney has taken the 
srama off alert bombers of the strategic air command 
in the report the panel said that since the 1950s and the 
height of the cold war the government gave special consideration 
to changes in the system to meet defense needs and safety was not 
treated similarly 
modernization and improvement programs gave priority to 
military requirements the report said safety in general was 
not viewed with the same urgency 
modification of the system has moved slowly and due to budget 
constraints the emphasis has been on acquiring new weapons 
in anticipation many older ones remain in todays nuclear 
stockpile that do not meet present nuclear weapons design 
criteria the panel said 
it recommended among other things that all weapons be equipped 
with modern enhanced nuclear detonation safety systems and that all 
nuclear bombs on aircraft be equipped with insensitive high 
explosives and fireresistant pits within the weapons 
these are the two most critical safety features currently 
available for avoiding plutonium dispersal in the event of aircraft 
fires or crashes the report said 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the armed services 
committee said the report calls for a reassessment of the nations 
priorities for nuclear weapons with safety ahead of military 
effectiveness 
improvement in ussoviet relations gives us breathing space 
to begin planning now for a nuclear arsenal that is cheaper and 
smaller than the one we have today as well as safer aspin said 
the ranking republican on the committee rep william dickinson 
of alabama said the panel of physicists correctly notes that 
many of the safety problems identified to date have been or are in 
the process of being fixed nonetheless the panel did express the 
view that there is still room for improvement

todays volunteer army is looking for more 
than volunteers 
for the first time in nearly three decade the army is 
searching out military retirees especially those with medical 
skills and forcing them back into uniform 
as the buildup of us forces in the persian gulf surges toward 
the 400000 level and the united nations deadline nears for an 
iraqi withdrawal from kuwait the army is digging deep into its 
personnel records for help in supporting the force 
lt col henry h hanrahan an army planner said monday that an 
initial callup of 15 retired physician assistants was approved last 
week and about 200 other retirees probably would be involuntarily 
recalled for active duty over the next month 
it is the first involuntary use of army retirees since the 1961 
crisis over east germanys erection of the berlin wall 
hanrahan said in an interview that about 4000 army retirees 
have volunteered for duty in the gulf crisis but that involuntary 
callups were needed because there arent enough volunteers with the 
skills needed most the army is especially eager to get more 
medical specialists in uniform 
about 150 volunteers have been put on active duty and about 
half of those are performing medical duties in support of operation 
desert shield hanrahan said approximately 300 more volunteers are 
likely to go on active duty over the coming month he said 
those recalled would consist of former officers who retired 
after 20 or more years of service 
retired military officers arent required to maintain any active 
association with the services but a service secretary has the 
authority to force retired personnel back into uniform if it is 
deemed necessary for national security 
the armys increasing need for medical skills reflects a broader 
trend within the us military as tens of thousands more american 
troops are deployed to saudi arabia and the jan 15 united nations 
deadline approaches for iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
the navy last week disclosed that it is deploying two additional 
500bed mobile field hospitals in the projected combat zone in 
saudi arabia and that it plans to call up 8000 reservists to 
increase navy medical support 
the navy announced monday that 769 navy reserve members 
including many medical specialists are being ordered to active 
duty last week it called up about 2300 medical reservists 
hanrahan said that in adition to the retirees who have 
volunteered for duty about 5000 members of the individual ready 
reserve have offered their services and about 1000 of those have 
been placed on active duty 
these are not rambo types they see that their country has a 
need and they want to be a part of it hanrahan said 
the irr is the second echelon of reservists mostly former 
enlisted personnel and officers they cannot be involuntarily 
called to active duty under the aug 22 reserve callup authority 
issued by president bush 
the presidential order allows the callup of up to 200000 
members of the selected reserve members of the national guard and 
reserve who are required to train one weekend per month and attend 
a twoweek training session once a year 
members of the irr generally are not required to train there 
are 278000 army members in the irr 
the army faces an increasing need for individual volunteers to 
perform duties such as truck driving water purification medical 
service and graves registration hanrahan said some also are 
needed to fill out the three national guard combat brigades placed 
on active duty for possible deployment to the gulf he said 
the army is concerned about a recent drop in the number of irr 
volunteers hanrahan said noting that about 600 who had offered to 
serve had backed out 
over the next month the army expects to need500 to 800 more 
volunteers from the irr for active duty beyond the 1000 
volunteers already put in uniform he said and if the gulf crisis 
erupts into war the need for individual replacements will greatly 
increase he added 
members of the individual ready reserve can volunteer by calling 
the army reserve personnel center in st louis at 18003252660

iraqi president saddam hussein says direct 
talks with the united states would be useless if the americans only 
reiterate un security council resolutions on the crisis it was 
reported today 
we have already read them the resolutions we know them and 
we rejected them saddam told a turkish television journalist 
the 25minute interview is scheduled for broadcast later this 
week on state television but excerpts were released today 
the united states has said any talks would center on reminding 
saddam of the un demands that iraq withdraw unconditionally from 
kuwait by jan 15 and allow the return of the legitimate kuwaiti 
government 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and annexed the emirate six days 
later 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz had been due in washington on 
monday to meet with president bush but the visit was put off after 
saddam rejected us proposals for a date to meet with the 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
in the interview saddam again ruled out any concessions on 
kuwait before the israelipalestinian conflict is resolved if it 
is settled he said we can make similar concessions on kuwait 
the united states has consistently rejected any such linkage of 
the persian gulf crisis and the palestinian problem 
those who want respect for the international laws and security 
council decisions should first solve this 23yearold problem and 
comply with laws and council decisions before using double 
standards saddam was quoted as saying 
saddam also said iraq posed no military threat to turkey which 
complied with un trade sanctions against iraq by cutting off an 
iraqi oil pipeline

the us fish and wildlife service says it is 
prepared to issue permits allowing the capture of eight to 10 
florida panthers a year for the next three to six years in an 
effort to save the endangered species 
the florida panther is a subspecies of cougar also known as 
puma or mountain lion although it once roamed much of the 
southeast it is making its last stand in southwestern florida 
only 30 to 50 adult animals are believed to survive 
as it stands now youve got the whole population clustered in 
one corner of southwest florida just one hurricane is all it would 
take to wipe out the whole species said dennis jordan 
coordinator of the florida panther interagency committee a group 
of state and federal wildlife agencies 
captive breeding which could begin next month is only one part 
of the effort to save the florida panther said vicki boatwright 
spokeswoman for the federal agencys southeast regional office in 
atlanta 
the most important part is habitat preservation she said 
monday 
congress has provided for expansion of parks and wildlife 
refuges in the area to protect habitat for the animals the 
panthers use about 22 million acres of land of which about 12 
million acres is publicly owned 
it wont be too hard to find kittens said david maehr a 
florida biologist six of seven adult females being tracked by 
radio collar have given birth this year and the seventh is believed 
to be pregnant 
analyses conducted by the florida panther interagency committee 
concluded the species would be extinct within 40 years under 
prevailing conditions 
final approval of the captive breeding program would allow the 
state to capture up to six kittens and four older animals in the 
first year and up to six kittens and two older animals in following 
years 
applications to be part of the breeding program have come from 
several florida zoos including the jacksonville zoo tampas 
lowery park zoo the miami metrozoo and the white oak plantation at 
yulee

as if food shortages and ethnic unrest 
are not enough to keep the soviet union busy the nation is 
actually seeking new hazards only theyre the kind you find on the 
golf course 
a team from the soviet ministry of foreign affairs and american 
international golf resorts have reached an agreement to finish and 
operate a country club and recreation center outside moscow 
the 285acre 18hole golf course in a birch and evergreen 
forest is expected to be completed next year it is believed to be 
the first of its kind in the soviet union 
a recreation center including a luxury hotel is expected to be 
completed in 1992 according to american international of 
greenbrae calif 
the resort initially will be used by diplomats foreign 
businessmen and tourists but eventually soviet citizens will be 
able to enjoy the delights and frustrations of golf with visitors 
from other countries 
it will be a meeting ground said ivan ivanovich sergeev 
the deputy director of diplomatic corps service bureau a division 
of the soviet foreign ministry who spoke through an interpreter 
its not purely a commercial enterprise it will enhance the 
trust between these people 
five hundred memberships in the resort 18 miles west of moscow 
will sell for the equivalent of 50000 to 100000 each far 
above the reach of the average soviet citizen 
but john lisanti american internationals chairman and chief 
executive officer said it will not be long before some soviets 
have enough rubles to take up the driver and putter 
a lot of fortunes will be made in todays soviet union and we 
believe in the very near future many soviet citizens will make some 
of those fortunes and will be able to buy memberships in this 
resort he said 
the joint venture agreement reached at a palo alto law firm on 
friday calls for lisantis company to contribute 30 million or 
half the cost of the project 
private investors will have a 50 percent stake in the course and 
receive half the profits the soviet government will own the other 
half of the resort and keep the other half of the profits 
american international also will help market the club throughout 
the world to draw visitors 
noted golf course architect robert trent jones jr of palo alto 
is designing the course the soviet union hired jones in 1988 to 
build the 7000yard par72 course 
the club will include townhouses and areas for tennis swimming 
tobogganing crosscountry skiing and restaurants the 175bed 
hotel was completed a year ago but will be expanded by 100 rooms

secretary of state james a baker iii today gave european allies 
the goahead for talks with iraq as long as mixed signals are 
not sent but the european community decided not to hold such a 
meeting now officials said 
in another development iraqi president saddam hussein was 
quoted as saying any usiraqi talks would be useless if the 
american side only repeats united nations demands to withdraw from 
kuwait 
meanwhile thousands of iraqi reservists reported to army units 
today on callup orders from their rulers for all ablebodied 
33yearold reservists 
iraqs revolutionary command council said many heads will roll 
and many thrones will fall if war breaks out in the gulf 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz had planned talks this week 
with foreign minister gianni de michelis of italy the european 
community chairman 
european leaders put the meeting on hold after talks that had 
been scheduled for monday between aziz and president bush were 
scrubbed 
baker said today he had no problem with a european meeting with 
aziz 
european community foreign minsters reconsidered the matter 
then decided against any talks unless iraq holds talks with the 
united states first officials said 
a meeting will take place if aziz goes to washington first 
said irish foreign minister gerald collins 
we must maintain the pressure on iraq said jacques delors 
president of the european commission the communitys executive 
body 
the iraqi foreign ministry today criticized the ecs earlier 
refusal to hold talks accusing the europeans of trying to 
appease the united states 
baker speaking at a news conference after a twoday meeting of 
foreign ministers of the north atlantic treaty organization in 
belgium said we support any diplomatic efforts that might 
result in a peaceful solution 
the one thing we do discourage he said are discordant 
messages mixed messages or mixed signals 
the bushaziz talks on monday were scrubbed over differences on 
the timing of a subsequent trip to baghdad by baker 
saddam has sought to hold the meeting jan 12 which bush says 
is too late bush has said saddams intransigence on the issue 
signals his lack of willingness to leave kuwait as the coalition 
lined up against him insists 
a turkish report today quoted saddam as saying direct talks with 
the united states would be useless if the american side merely 
reiterates un security council resolutions on the crisis 
we have already read them the resolutions we know them and 
we rejected them saddam told a turkish television journalist in 
an interview to be broadcast this week on state television 
excerpts were released today 
saddam also repeated his demand that a withdrawal from kuwait be 
linked to a resolution of the israelipalestinian conflict the 
united states has repeatedly said the issues are unrelated 
irans president meanwhile said if iraq finds itself under 
attack by the usled forces the baghdad government itself would 
bear the responsibility 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
cyprus quoted iranian president hashemi rafsanjani as saying we 
are feeling very uneasy over the fact that the iraqi people may be 
hurt by the americans 
but he told a group of college students in tehran that the 
responsibility for this rests with the iraqi regime irna said 
iran and iraq fought a 198088 war but baghdad moved to make 
peace with tehran after it invaded kuwait 
in baghdad today health minister abdulsalam mohammed said said 
that 2042 children under age 5 have died of disease and 
malnutrition because of shortages in baby food and medicine 
resulting from a unordered trade embargo said claimed on dec 3 
that 1416 children had died because of the sanctions 
iraq has offered no proof of the claims and diplomats in 
baghdad have discounted the reports of shortages noting that the 
security council decided in october to allow shipments of essential 
food and medicines to iraq 
in iraq thousands of reservists reported to their army units 
today as part of a major military mobilization to counter a feared 
offensive by the usled multinational force 
on monday the defense ministry ordered all ablebodied 
33yearold reservists to report for duty by thursday for short 
periods of retraining before being assigned to active duty 
it was iraqs third major callup of reserves in recent weeks 
most reservists served in the military during the 198088 war with 
iran 
in other gulfrelated developments 
yevgeny primakov soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs top 
aide on the gulf crisis said the departure of 2500 soviet workers 
from iraq has been delayed only by technical matters and the desire 
of many to remain until their contracts expire there had been 
speculation baghdad was trying to hold the soviet contract workers 
as hostages 
the japanese foreign ministry said today japan would quickly 
respond to a request from the us military for 300 million worth 
of vehicles computers medical supplies and other goods japanese 
corporations plan to donate 20000 stereo headsets to the usled

in a stormy session of the soviet parliament 
today moldavians walked out to protest the presence of rival 
groups and legislators heatedly debated a union treaty designed to 
hold the nation together 
president mikhail s gorbachev said he wants soviet citizens to 
vote this winter in a referendum on whether to sign the pact 
i introduced a suggestion to hold a referendum and those who 
dont want a union let them go and secede gorbachev told 
reporters in the parliament buildings lobby but he reiterated his 
demand that any secession must take place within the framework of 
soviet law its a divorce process he said 
during the second day of the fourth congress of peoples 
deputies the ukrainian communist party leader reportedly said the 
national legislature could deadlock over gorbachevs proposed 
treaty 
several parliamentarians among the 440 scheduled to speak on the 
treaty expressed hope it would be signed but others rejected the 
document assuring protracted debate at the 2250member congress 
of peoples deputies 
we wont sign the union treaty there is no chance of that 
now said dimitru matkovsky one of about two dozen moldavian 
deputies who left the cavernous kremlin palace of congresses today 
matkovsky said his delegation was angry that the congress had 
invited as guests representatives of two ethnic groups seeking 
autonomy within moldavia he said moldavians would not participate 
in the session until the groups left 
sitting in the hall were representatives of the turkish 
christian minority gagauz from southern moldavia and slavs from 
the eastern dniester region both groups have declared autonomy in 
their corners of the republic 
ethnic turmoil and disputes between the central government and 
the republics have so far prevented negotiations over the union 
treaty 
in a stateoftheunion address monday gorbachev said the 
greatest threat to the soviet union was not economic decay but the 
secessionist movements he proposed a nationwide popular 
referendum be held on the concept of the treaty which would form a 
new federation of the 15 soviet republics 
all republics have declared some form of sovereignty since 
march the declarations have paralyzed power in the country 
worsening food shortages and hastening economic collapse 
the treaty would preserve central control over national security 
and such key industries as transportation and energy and natural 
wealth such as gold and diamonds most republics want more 
independence in such areas as well as to make their own economic 
decisions 
in an interview published in pravda the communist party 
newspaper ukrainian commmunist party boss stanislav gurenko also 
a parliamentarian told pravda that the union treaty issue could 
deadlock the congress 
i am afraid that deputies may split on political issues and 
above all on a union treaty gurenko said 
gurenko also said some legislators have in some or other 
measure lost touch with what is happening in their republics 
this too may create some additional difficulties 
gorbachev wants the congress to endorse the union treaty 
although only the legislatures of the republics have the power to 
approve it if the national legislature is deadlocked however the 
treatys future comes into question 
estonian president arnold ruutel today rejected the union treaty 
referendum there never was a free expression of the will of the 
estonian people about their forced incorporation into the soviet 
union in 1940 and there was no referendum then ruutel told the 
congress 
byelorussian communist party chief anatoly malofeyev urged the 
deputies to support the treaty as a way out of the political and 
economic crisis the state news agency tass reported 
anatoly sobchak a congress deputy and the mayor of leningrad 
told tass he supported the union treaty to break the paralysis of 
power 
newly appointed interior minister boris pugo apparently trying 
to reassure deputies who fear he will crack down on independence 
movements said the republics demands for sovereignty were 
inescapable 
he said in a tass interview however that he needs congress 
approval for more power to combat a nationwide breakdown of law and 
order 
the congress is expected to last 10 days 
it is also scheduled to debate constitutional amendments to 
strengthen presidential power by adding a vice president and 
replacing the 89member council of ministers with a cabinet of 
about 15 people

portauprince haiti ap a supporter of the former duvalier 
regime today criticized the united states for saying a leftist 
priest apparently won the presidential election before complete 
official results were released 
he said such a move could incite violence in haiti 
the rev jeanbertrand aristide a fiery champion of the poor 
won as much as 70 percent of the vote in sundays elections which 
also chose a new legislature according to projections by the 800 
foreign observers 
the capital portauprince was quiet today after mondays wild 
jubilation by aristides supporters and a shooting incident that 
left a woman dead 
with slightly more than 1 percent of the estimated 2 million 
votes counted aristide had 706 percent former world bank 
official marc bazin 126 percent agronomist louis dejoie jr 69 
percent and evangelical preacher sylvio claude 27 percent seven 
other candidates were in the race 
the electoral council released the partial results monday but 
did not indicate when further results would be made public 
it gave no explanation for the delay 
bernard w aronson assistant us secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs said monday of aristide 
we fully respect him as the apparent presidentelect of haiti 
and look forward to closely working with his government 
but a spokesman for roger lafontant selfproclaimed leader of 
the tonton macoutes and of other supporters of the former 29year 
duvalier dictatorship said the us government had picked the 
winner before the results were in he said that move could put 
people in the streets who will incite violence 
the american government cant decide who won its against the 
law you the united states dont have the right said serge 
conille executivesecretary of lafontants party the union for 
national conciliation 
lafontant returned from exile this year and announced his 
candidacy but was barred from running for president by the 
electoral council 
well decide after the results are in how we are going to act 
but it wont be in a violent way conille said 
a spokeswoman at bazins party headquarters said he would not 
commet on the election until final results were in dejoie 
conceded defeat monday 
we are very disappointed but we are democrats if thats what 
the people want its okay said danielle bazin a party official 
and sisterinlaw of bazin 
about 70 percent of the registered voters cast ballots sunday 
for president a 110member national assembly and local officials 
observers from the united nations and the organization of 
american states said the vote was orderly and without fraud 
despite delays and some irregularities at voting stations 
tens of thousands of haitians poured into the streets monday 
morning singing and dancing honking car horns and blocking 
traffic with their jubliant celebrations of aristides presumed 
victory 
but at midday police wearing gas masks fired into a crowd 
celebrating outside st jean bosco roman catholic church killing a 
pregnant 44yearold woman then running her over in a blue pickup 
truck witnesses said 
assassins attacked the church in september 1988 as aristide was 
saying mass killing 12 people and wounding 70 aristide escaped 
and went into hiding 
an army statement denied responsibility for mondays shootings 
saying police had fired into the air to disperse demonstrators 
threatening to lynch an undentified man police in haiti are under 
the authority of the army 
the capital was nearly deserted as haitians fled indoors 
fearing more violence from holdovers of the duvalier family regime 
ousted in 1986 when jeanclaude baby doc duvalier fled into 
exile 
the only other time haitians had a chance to freely choose their 
leader in november 1987 34 voters were shot and hacked to death 
at polling stations by thugs supported by the army the vote was 
canceled 
aristide would take office on feb 7 the fifth anniversary of 
baby doc duvaliers departure 
roger lafontant who led duvaliers feared tonton macoute 
militia said last week he would do anything to keep aristide 
from becoming president saying haiti would never be delivered to 
communism 
there has also been concern that the united states would not be 
pleased by the election because of aristides leftist ideology and 
antiamerican rhetoric which was toned down in the last few 
months 
aristide was expelled from the conservative salesian order in 
1988 for allegedly inciting the poor to revolt 
he is a proponent of liberation theology which encourages the 
poor to fight for their rights instead of waiting for an eternal 
reward

polands governmentinexile will hand 
over its historic symbols of authority to lech walesa at a ceremony 
saturday after his inauguration as president a spokesman for 
walesa said today 
parliament speaker mikolaj kozakiewicz has called the national 
assembly into session on friday and saturday the assembly is to 
formally approve the election results friday and witness walesas 
inauguration saturday 
andrzej drzycimski a walesa spokesman said representatives of 
the governmentinexile were in warsaw to discuss a ceremony to be 
attended by ryszard kaczorowski president of the londonbased 
government that dates to world war ii 
the transfer of symbols means the governmentinexile will cease 
to exist 
walesa who won election dec 9 is expected to receive the 
insignia of power from kaczorowski at warsaws royal castle former 
seat of the presidency after being sworn into office as president 
on monday polish authorities said they are investigating three 
generals and five colonels in the 1970 shootings of striking 
workers along the baltic coast that left at least 45 people dead 
walesa then an unknown electrician in gdansk was among the 
leaders of the 1970 strike over food price increases that prompted 
the crackdown by security forces the protests helped pave the way 
for the birth of the solidarity free trade union movement a decade 
later 
justice minister aleksander bentkowski did not name the officers 
under investigation but said the initial order to shoot the 
workers was given by the late wladyslaw gomulka then the communist 
party leader 
a final decision on whether to put the eight officers on trial 
will be made by march bentkowski said 
at present we have enough evidence to present charges against 
eight persons three generals and five colonels who were directly 
involved in the events bentkowski told state television monday 
night 
i think that revealing their names is not proper now as the 
investigation is under way we plan to end the proceedings by the 
end of march he said 
the gazeta wyborcza newspaper reported today that the military 
prosecutor had already presented preliminary criminal accusations 
against the eight 
the newspaper said that unless the accused prove that they were 
acting in selfdefense or out of higher necessity they could be 
charged with homicide or abetting homicide 
official communist accounts say 45 people including 28 in the 
cities of gdansk and gdynia were killed by security forces in the 
december 1970 antigovernment protests which began when workers 
went on strike to protest food price increases 
many people believe the death toll was higher and 
investigations are being conducted to see if names of additional 
victims can be found 
victims of the 1970 shootings were buried secretly often 
without family members being informed 
bentkowski said that so far 160 witnesses have been questioned 
in the case 
he said gomulkas order to shoot the protesters was relayed by 
the late prime minister jozef cyrankiewicz to gen grzegorz 
korczynski the army commander in gdansk 
the strikes led to gomulkas replacement as party leader by 
edward gierek who remained in power until he was toppled after the 
august 1980 strikes that resulted in the founding of solidarity 
walesa who led the 1980 strikes insisted that those who died 
in 1970 should not be forgotten at solidaritys insistence a 
monument to the slain workers was unveiled in december 1980 
on sunday the 20th anniversary of the killings in gdansk 
walesa returned to the monument to pay homage to the slain workers 
solidarity was born from their blood said walesa

edward gnehm known to his friends as skip is 
usually the life of the party 
but not this holidy season 
people keep coming up to me at these christmas parties and 
saying didnt we give a goingaway party for you six months 
ago 
he says he and his wife are thinking of giving a were still 
here party 
gnehm was packing in preparation for his post as the new us 
ambassador to kuwait when iraqi president saddam hussein invaded 
that country aug 2 
but that doesnt mean gnehm is out of a job on the contrary 
hes been putting his experience as a former deputy assistant 
secretary of state and a former deputy secretary of defense to 
maximum use 
gnehm who speaks arabic has traveled far and wide to recruit 
the support of arab countries for the administrations antiiraq 
coalition from algeria in northern africa to iraq nextdoor 
neighbor jordan gnehm has been making the us case 
his recent visit to jordan was particularly emotional for gnehm 
he served in amman as the deputy ambassador several years ago and 
still has friends there many of whom berated him for us policy 
on iraq 
gnehm is determined hell take up his ambassadorial post 
although kuwait will probably be a different country more adds marians 
10yearold neighbor carla oliva theyre not 
just books to read for enjoyment they teach you a lot of things 
like how life is different for different people and how to get 
along with each other 
although martin weaves serious themes into her books she 
chooses not to address such weighty topics as sexual or substance 
abuse of any kind 
its not that the issues shouldnt be dealt with the author 
said 
i think there are a lot of girls who would benefit from 
reading about them but there are also firstgraders out there 
who are reading these books and those subjects are too heavy for 
them she said 
so martin sticks to more manageable problems including the 
perennial trials of youth 
questions about their selfesteem their selfworth how 
important is it to be pretty to be popular all sorts of things 
that we worried about when we were younger i dont think those 
things ever change

iraqs ability to wage a prolonged war depends 
heavily on its military parts stockpiles and analysts believe the 
trade embargo has left some critical weapons systems especially 
vulnerable to shortages 
saddam hussein learned early in iraqs war against iran to build 
parts inventories and has spent billions manufacturing his own 
weapons and buying from other nations 
but pentagon and private analysts believe the combat stress on 
highmaintenance systems such as radar and jet fighters would drain 
iraqs supplies forcing it to cannibalize for parts and eventually 
leaving some sensitive systems weakened or inoperable 
absent combat cia director william webster has told congress 
iraqi forces probably can sustain current readiness for nine 
months with perhaps some erosion of air force capabilities in 
three to six months 
over the past decade iraq has developed an arms industry that 
produces small arms ammunition artillery shells and some spare 
parts for tanks and other equipment 
but iraq is not believed capable of making engine and electronic 
parts it would need to keep its most sensitive equipment running in 
prolonged combat instead iraq would be dependent on reserves and 
perhaps underground arms markets 
us officials say there is no evidence of major cracks in the 
embargo 
we think we clearly have been successful in closing off the 
flow of spare parts and military supplies from the soviet union and 
france which previously were his major suppliers defense 
secretary richard cheney told congress 
there have been several intervals since the aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait when iraqs air forces have cut back patrol and training 
sorties leading to speculation that parts already are scarce 
pentagon officials are reluctant to discuss intelligence on 
iraqi stockpiles but one source said saddam is believed low on 
parts for french mirage jets and probably would suffer shortages of 
components needed for radar systems if hostilities erupted and 
those installations were attacked but iraq has considerable 
stockpiles of most conventional equipment the source said 
hell reach a point when systems will start to go down all 
over the place said bernard trainor a retired marine general 
who visited iraq near the end of the iraniraq war 
but trainor also said that at the time of his visit iraq had 
impressive stores of spare parts and had hired a japanese company 
to computerize its inventories 
saddam should have a pretty good handle on what he needs and 
can plan accordingly both in terms of strategy and in prioritizing 
what they look for in the markets trainor said 
the soviets have provided the united states information on 
iraqs purchases of spares for sovietmade equipment ranging from 
tanks and artillery to antiaircraft missiles and migseries 
fighters and the united states has access to israeli intelligence 
these official analyses are somewhat suspect however because 
of iraqs frequent dealings in the shadowy black and gray arms 
markets 
exactly what they have in the way of stocks and spare parts 
nobody knows one army analyst said privately but they are 
very sensitive to the fact that repair parts and repair times are 
costly and degrade combat power so they plan against that 
most analysts believe iraq would have aggressively stockpiled 
while planning the kuwait invasion remembering that in the early 
weeks of the iraniraq war periodic shutoffs of soviet parts hurt 
iraqs fighting capabilities 
when they go out and acquire something they are very 
different from most third world countries said lt col douglas 
v johnson coauthor of a recent army war college study of iraqs 
military they think of all the spare parts and repair stuff up 
front 
james blackwell of the center for strategic and international 
studies said saddam likely had enough spares to support the kuwait 
invasion and a possible invasion of saudi arabia 
if thats the case then even if the embargo is 100 percent 
successful he can last a long long time blackwell said 
potential sources of spares the embargo notwithstanding are 
arms traders in the mideast asia and central and south america 
before the kuwait invasion iraq was spending an estimated 1 
billion a year to import parts it is now cashpoor because of the 
embargo and probably would quickly exhaust currency looted from 
kuwait if it found spares on the black market libya is a potential 
source for additional financing as are shady mideast banks and 
financiers 
unclear is whether iraq can complete arms deals if it has cash 
if youve got cash you can buy just about anything short of a 
nuclear weapon said the army analyst but the price will be 
high in this market and the question is how much cash does he 
have 
intelligence agencies track underground arms deals and blackwell 
said the united states should be able to block baghdadbound 
shipments 
trainor was less optimistic 
saying youve got a handle on the illegal arms markets is like 
saying youve got a handle on the drug market he said i just 
dont believe it

arun vohra was only trying to be a good 
citizen when he warned the state highway administration about a 
diseased pine tree in front of his house his reward the state cut 
down seven healthy trees 
the pine still stands 
vohra joined the states adoptahighway program last spring 
pledging to keep the woodsy road in front of his house free of 
trash and debris in due course vohra spotted a pine tree that 
appeared to be infested with borers and called the state highway 
administration 
the tree was in front of his house but on state property 
i felt the tree was dangerous and told them it was going to 
fall over and kill somebody and if it hit overhead power lines 
there might be a big tragedy he said 
days later vohra returned home to find that two other pine 
trees three blooming dogwoods and a giant lilac tree had become 
victims of what he calls the bethesda chain saw massacre 
the neighboring pine still stood 
these were just awesome trees vohra says about the six that 
were cut down you dont see that kind of trees every day 
he got on the phone to the highway administration 
the guy i talked to said were sorry it was a new man he 
didnt know what he was doing vohra says i guess he just 
went crazy with the chain saw 
he was told that the holes in the pine he originally called 
about were made by woodpeckers whose foraging for bugs doesnt hurt 
a tree 
vohra says he called a couple more times finally letting the 
matter drop until november then he talked with henry page the 
man in charge of the tree crews 
he came to my house i showed him the tree ringed with holes 
he said yes yes this tree has to come down its too close to 
power lines vohra says 
page told him the tree was too big for state crews hed have to 
call in a contractor 
vohra said he marked the pine tree with a ribbon so there would 
be no more mistakes 
but there was 
the latest victim lay on the ground neatly sawed a cedar tree 
that had been 80 feet to 100 feet tall by vohras estimate 
the pine still lived 
the montgomery journal a daily county newspaper wrote the 
story under the headline they came they sawed they 
blundered 
i was just absolutely in shock vohra said i acted a 
little crazy i tried to call the governor of maryland at the 
governors mansion i called the county police 
and his state delegate and his congresswoman and the state 
department of natural resources 
the next morning he telephoned page 
i said you cut down the wrong tree you cut down a cedar 
that lovely cedar tree he said the cedar is the one you pointed 
at i said we never discussed the cedar tree thats 15 feet 
away 
the journal quotes page the dogwoods and lilac that was a 
mistake this particular time they just went in and made a 
booboo 
but he insists vohra pointed at the cedar and not the pine 
which page says is perfectly healthy 
and so the pine remains 
vohra deprived of the trees that shielded his property from the 
road says he has a book on trees im going to give the state 
highway people so they know what a tree looks like

the european community may suffer major 
political and economic damage by refusing to compromise in world 
trade talks over us proposals for deep cuts in farm subsidies 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said tuesday 
if it comes to an agricultural trade war with the ec said 
yeutter the united states is prepared to fight 
negotiations among 107 nations in the socalled uruguay round of 
trade talks collapsed dec 7 in brussels after the ec refused to 
bend on us proposals on major farm trade issues including 
cutbacks in internal price supports and export subsidies 
the united states backed by australia brazil and other major 
exporters sought sharp reductions in subsidies while the 
12nation ec japan and korea were against the plan 
efforts are being made to reconvene the talks in midjanuary 
but yeutter said further negotiations would have little chance 
unless the ec is prepared to change its hardline stance 
but yeutter told reporters he thinks some internal pressures are 
developing in favor of a reassessment of the ec position 
yeutter said he was europe last week in the aftermath of the 
dec 7 breakdown and found the community to be very embarrassed 
by what happened in brussels 
the community will probably not concede that publicly but the 
fact is they suffered a major geopolitical defeat in brussels with 
essentially all of the world leaving with dissatisfaction and 
disappointment in the ec position he said 
a lot of folks in western europe are chagrined by the present 
status of the uruguay round and are concerned that the ec may 
bear the lions share of the blame for failure should it occur 
yeutter said 
consequently he said a number of working level people in 
the ec are trying to reassess the blocs position in hopes the 
stalled talks can be rejuvenated but yeutter said he didnt know 
at this point whether this can translate into changes at the ecs 
leadership level 
im pessimistic about the potential outcome of the talks so 
long as the community maintains its present intransigent stance 
he said 
earlier in a telephone news conference with broadcasters 
yeutter he was not ready to tip off the ec what the united states 
might do if the uruguay round of talks fail completely 
but yeutter predicted that the ec potentially could be forced 
into spending all its allotted funds in 1991 trying to maintain 
high supports and export subsidies to keep pace with the united 
states 
of course he said the ec then could replenish its coffers but 
they would have to make a conscious decision to spend more on 
agriculture than they do now 
well be spending more money too of course and well have 
to find the financial resources to do that and a lot of other 
countries will as well he said 
yeutter also hinted at other possible us trade actions in case 
the trade talks fail but declined to be specific 
i want them to be uncertain about what our response would be 
and a bit frightened by the potential he said so im not 
going to discuss publicly what the united states might do

would flee among them was a passport nosair held in a different

nosair who is accused of gunning down the jewish leader at a 
manhattan hotel on nov 5 
during the bail hearing the judge also disclosed that he 
received numerous death threats and attempts to influence him via 
telephone messages and mail

that schlesinger remove himself from the case which the judge 
promptly denied schlesinger said the threats and attempts to 
pressure him would not affect his handling of the case

protesters tried to get to the hospital 
room of righttodie patient nancy cruzan to reconnect her feeding 
tube today but guards halted them insidter 
in the morning because some of the protesters blocked the stairwell 
to the second floor which also serves as a fire exit 
state trooper dan banasik who helped remove protesters said 
all refused to give their names and said they would stay and fast 
until ms cruzan dies or her feeding tube is reinserted 
jasper county probate judge charles teel ruled last friday that 
ms cruzans parents could remove the feeding tube that had kept 
their comatose daughter alive for seven years 
teels ruling ended a landmark legal fight he said he believed 
there was clear and convincing evidence that ms cruzan would 
want to end her life 
the protesters tried to get to ms cruzans second floor room at 
the hospital 
most were blocked by guards in a stairwell and a shutdown 
elevator but 11 members of the group got to the second floor where 
they were confronted by 15 police officers they did not get into 
ms cruzans room where joe and joyce cruzan were with their 
daughter 
the rev ted coleman a mount vernon minister on chaplain duty 
at the hospital said the cruzans were aware of the protests 
they said they were aware they said were private people 
we just want to be left alone he said 
if youre going to kill her just put a pillow over her 
head said one protester who identified himself as gary tebbets 
of kansas city 
other protesters refused to give their names to reporters all 
identifying themselves as nancy cruzan 
the rev joseph foreman of montreat nc who announced monday 
he would lead 40 activists in an attempt to forcefeed ms cruzan 
was one of those arrested 
the best we can do is not cooperate with anyone trying to 
starve an innocent person to death said foreman director of 
prisoners for life which he describes as a prolife group 
foreman is director of prisoners of christ a prolife prison 
ministry based in north carolina 
dr ronald cranford a mineapolis neurologist who had examined 
ms cruzan said she would probably die within about two weeks of 
the tubes removal 
ms cruzan suffered severe brain damage in a car accident near 
carthage on jan 11 1983 doctors have said her condition is 
irreversible 
teel ruled in favor of disconnecting the tube in 1988 but the 
missouri supreme court overturned it after the us supreme 
courts decision the case was returned to teel to determine if ms 
cruzan would want to be allowed to die 
ms cruzan suffers from seizures vomiting bleeding gums and 
severely contorted limbs

the secretary of housing and urban 
development jack kemp announced on tuesday a privately financed 
housing program for the homeless that will be encouraged with 
government tax breaks 
the federal national mortgage association is investing 10 
million in the project which will initially finance 600 units of 
rental housing for homeless and lowincome people around the 
country 
the program will target the homeless by typically creating 
small apartments including some with one room and a shared 
kitchen 
both new buildings will be constructed and existing ones will be 
rehabilitated 
rents will be based on the ability to pay and will be subsidized 
with federal state or local funds 
this is the first time that lowincome housing tax credits 
enacted by congress in 1986 have been aimed at helping the 
homeless said david maxwell fnmas chairman and chief executive 
companies can earn income tax credits by putting money in a newly 
created investment fund corporate housing initiatives 
while the bulk of the housing units will be for the homeless 
some will house physically disabled and elderly people with very 
low incomes 
the project is a progressive bleedingheart conservative 
approach to the problem of homelessness kemp quipped at a news 
conference 
he said the program is an important step toward the goal of 
involving the private sector in attacking one of the nations most 
serious social ills 
fnmas partner in the program is the enterprise foundation 
which will help homeless and lowincome residents obtain 
counseling job training child care and other services 
arranging social services as well as housing will provide an 
added boost to help the homeless move up and out of poverty 
said enterprise foundation founder james rouse we have to look 
into deeper needs as well as provide housing local community 
development groups will screen potential participants in the 
program 
the tax credits which became law in 1986 have drawn 4 billion 
in private capital and spurred the development of 125000 
lowincome housing units 
fnmas 10 million investment is the first of what the new 
initiatives sponsors hope will be many more corporate investors 
regulated by hud fnma is a congressionally chartered private 
corporation supporting low and moderateincome housing 
estimates of the number of homeless people in the united states 
range from 300000 to 3 million 
the us conference of mayors found in a report in 1989 that the 
lack of affordable lowincome housing was a main cause of 
homelessness other causes were cited as unemployment mental 
illness and drug and alcohol abuse

president bush said today he believes 
americans would support military action against iraq if needed but 
he conceded that the support would erode if the battle became a 
drawnout one 
the agony of vietnam is still with us bush said at a news 
conference 
at the same time bush said he does not believe iraqs saddam 
hussein knows what he is up against 
i think he basically is at best uncertain as to whether this 
force will be used against him bush said 
what is essential to get the peaceful resolution is that he 
realizes he cannot prevail bush said 
referring to the inability to nail down a date for talks between 
saddam and secretary of state james a baker iii bush said he was 
about where i was a couple of weeks ago when he proposed the 
talks 
bush said he is still hopeful a date can be nailed down for 
baker to meet with saddam hussein 
bush was asked how long the public would support a war if saddam 
did not comply with a united nations deadline of jan 15 for 
withdrawing from kuwait 
i think that if the united states has to do its part to 
implement the united nations resolutions i believe the country 
would support that bush said 
but i dont think that suppoprt would last if it were a long 
drawnout conflagration i think support would erode as it did 
during the vietnam conflict 
but bush said this will not be in my view that kind of 
confrontation 
bush was asked if he would initiate offensive action against 
iraq if necessary 
im having the darndest consultations with congress youve 
ever seen bush said i hope i dont have to cross that bridge 
because i want a peaceful solution to that problem 
he heatedly rejected the argument that theres some kind of 
racism in this deployment because of the disproportionate number 
of blacks and other minorities serving there 
i reject it out of whole cloth its simply not truethis is 
the allvolunteer army he said he said the volunteers knew what 
they were getting into when they signed up 
underscoring the impending deadline for iraqs withdrawal bush 
on monday summoned ambassadors from 28 countries that have sent 
forces to the persian gulf since the aug 2 invasion the united 
states alone has committed upwards of 430000 troops 
none of us wants war but none of us is prepared to accept a 
partial solution the president said there can and will be no 
negotiations for concessions and no rewards for aggression 
referring to saddam bush said i think at some point he will 
realize that this force which is overwhelming that is now being 
arrayed against him would be devastating thats what the 
united nations stated should happen that he ought to get out or 
all available means should be used 
in a decisive vote last month the united nations authorized the 
use of all means necessary to evict iraq from kuwait unless it 
pulls out by jan 15 and i want to see the united nations 
resolutions fulfilled right on schedule bush said 
meanwhile a us army planner said the service was ordering 
some retired personnel to active duty for the first time since the 
1961 berlin crisis 
an initial callup of 15 retired army physician assistants was 
approved last week and about 200 more retirees probably will be 
involuntarily recalled for active duty over the next month said 
lt col henry h hanrahan 
as the jan 15 deadline approaches the army and navy have been 
increasing their deployment of medical specialists and equipment to 
the gulf area 
bush said he would not be opposed to baker and aziz meeting in a 
third country to break the stalemate on scheduling however he 
said what im not going to do is shove these meetings right up 
against the united nations deadline 
bush said saddam does not understand the debate in this 
country as members of congress and former military leaders argue 
that sanctions should be given more time to work before force is 
used 
he thinks it means that our country is divided and we cannot 
go forward to do our part in implementing the un resolutions 
bush said and hes just as wrong as he can be 
aziz had been due in washington on monday to meet with the 
president but that visit was put off when the two sides could not 
agree on a date for a return meeting by baker with saddam in 
baghdad 
bush has said he wants baker to meet with saddam no later than 
jan 3 while saddam has proposed a jan 12 meeting

the drug enforcement administration told 
congress on tuesday it reviewed more than 1600 case files and 
found nothing that would even remotely support news accounts that a 
dea undercover operation was entangled in the terrorist bombing of 
pan am flight 103 over scotland 
the agency has consistently denied such reports and the justice 
department after a monthlong special inquiry said dec 4 there 
was no evidence to link the dea and the december 1988 bombing 
which killed 270 people 
i assure you that those allegations are unfounded and that dea 
had no part in this terrible tragedy testified stephen h 
greene dea assistant administrator in charge of operations 
the dea denied such allegations a year ago but they resurfaced 
in october when both nbc and abc reported that security at the 
frankfurt airport where the new yorkbound flight originated had 
been relaxed to accommodate dea investigators who were tracking 
usbound drug shipments the suggestion was that terrorists had 
taken advantage of the purported controlled delivery operation 
to smuggle a bomb aboard the plane 
greene told the house government operations subcommittee on 
government information justice and agriculture that the agency in 
the wake of the latest reports reviewed more than 1600 case files 
from 1984 through 1989 for any sign of an operation similar to the 
one described in the media 
this file review revealed nothing even remotely resembling the 
alleged operation he said 
greene told the subcommittee that security checks are never 
bypassed in controlled delivery operations in which agents allow 
narcotics shipments to proceed to their ultimate destinations as a 
way of tracing them to key pushers 
greene and david westrate assistant administrator in charge of 
planning and inspection scoffed at the notion that agents may have 
acted outside of agency policy and allowed a package to bypass 
security in defiance of rules 
they said controlled deliveries are carefully run operations 
involving many individuals at both departure points and 
destinations as well as messages between american embassies and 
washington as a result such an operation could not be hidden by 
an agent they said 
greene said that in the fiscal years 1984 through 1989 the dea 
ran only three such operations through the frankfurt airport and 
none of them utilized a pan am flight he said no controlled 
delivery was in progress at the time of the bombing which killed 
259 aboard flight 103 and 11 persons on the ground in the village 
of lockerbie scotland 
the news reports suggested that a dea operation codenamed 
corea or courier allowed the package containing the bomb to 
bypass security 
there was no operation codenamed corea or courier or 
anything similar to that name greene told the panel dea had 
no operation under any name which facilitated the free movement of 
drug couriers from the middle east or cyprus through frankfurt an 
onward to london and the united states 
on behalf of dea i would like to offer our sympathy to the 
families of the victims of flight 103 greene said these 
recent allegations against the dea have just added to their 
grief 
on dec 4 deputy attorney general william p barr said the 
justice department inquiry which involved the fbi as well as the 
internal dea review demonstrated that dea had no investigative 
or operational activity in effect on dec 21 1988 that involved 
the use of pan am flight 103 or frankfurt international airport 
greene testified that in 1987 the dea ran a controlled delivery 
operation that traced a drug shipment from lebanon to cyprus to 
frankfurt to new york and finally to cleveland he said twa flights 
were involved but not pan am 
also in 1987 he said german authorities in frankfurt notified 
the dea of a narcotics shipment that originated in the mideast it 
was allowed to proceed to boston via lufthansa he said where 
arrests were made 
in 1983 greene said frankfurt authorities notified the dea of 
a shipment which proceeded to chicago via lufthansa then on to 
detroit aboard and american flight and finally to toledo ohio 
where arrests were made

first lt patricia mills had put 
in her papers to leave the army before saddam hussein invaded 
kuwait now shes the only woman briefing the us military 
command in saudi arabia 
i just want to make a difference said the 26yearold 
intelligence officer who grew up in north salem ny but 
currently lives in atlanta 
immediately after the aug 2 invasion she withdrew her papers 
at least until the persian gulf crisis ends 
since she arrived here in late august ms mills has been 
working a 12hour overnight shift tracking iraqi ground movements 
so she can brief lt gen john j yeosack the army commander in 
the early morning 
despite her inside information she said she doesnt know 
whether theres going to be a war 
some days i think its going to happen and its going to be 
bad but there are other days i think the longer it goes the less 
likely it is that theyre going to shoot she said 
every day except sunday ms mills stands before an array of 
strategic maps in the armys war room briefing yoesack and his 
staff for anywhere between five and 20 minutes she also helps 
prepare the morning intelligence summary 
she is the only female daily talking dog as briefers are 
called in the military and shes a damned good one composed and 
together the senior army ground intelligence officer in the gulf 
said on condition of anonymity 
shes clearly a topflight performer shes articulate 
quick and has a way of cutting through the fog of too much 
information 
ms mills said she has probably benefited from reverse 
discrimination in her fouryear army career because the military 
is looking to promote women 
she received airborne and air assault training following her 
graduation from cornell university in 1986 then became a platoon 
commander in the demilitarized zone between north korea and south 
korea 
she spent a year at army forces command headquarters at ft 
mcpherson ga before going to panama just before last christmas 
us military operation to oust gen manuel noriega 
ms mills said she sees a lot of similarities between saddam and 
noriega although noriega hadnt built up his empire big enough 
to protect himself 
coming to saudi arabia and being selected to brief the high 
command was a big thing she said 
they dont necessarily want to hear the tactical situation 
from a woman she said sometimes i think theyd just rather 
look at me than look at some guy briefing them but hey 
whatever 
despite the kudos she said she has a lovehate relationship 
with the army 
i think its hard for women today in the army ms mills 
said i want an equal chance its hard because there are certain 
things you have to do to get ahead to be successful and some of 
those things arent available to women 
its hard when you get up top the old boy network takes over 
sometimes 
ms mills said she wants to move forward but isnt sure whether 
to stay in the army work her way toward a command post or go to 
business school and pursue a civilian career in international 
relations 
im really at the big spaghetti junction of life she said 
meanwhile she is jogging daily to relieve the stress of her 
job and she just bought herself a golf putter to practice in her 
room

new safeguards are necessary to prevent an 
accidental nuclear explosion involving the nations aging atomic 
weapons three leading physicists told congress on tuesday 
its not a dangerous system now but we can make it safer 
sidney d drell who headed the panel said in testimony before the 
house armed services committee 
there have been 32 accidents only two in recent years the 
panel said adding that was a relatively low number 
since the 1950s when tensions between the superpowers grew 
nuclearweapon safety wasnt given the same urgency as 
modernization of those systems the panel said in its report 
in addition modification has moved slowly and because of 
budget limitations the emphasis has been on acquiring new weapons 
in anticipation many older ones remain in todays nuclear 
stockpile that do not meet present nuclear weapons design 
criteria the report said 
recent technical advances have enabled scientists to use 
supercomputers to trace the development of a nuclear detonation in 
three dimensions rather than the previous limit of two the report 
said 
a major consequences of these results is a realization that 
unintended nuclear detonations present a greater risk than 
previously estimated and believed for some of the warheads in the 
stockpile it said 
the panel did not specify what the previous risk has been 
its members are drell deputy director of the stanford linear 
accelerator center nobel laureate charles h townes of the 
university of california at berkeley and john s foster head of 
the defense science board 
the armed services committee empaneled the three in may after 
questions were raised about the safety of several nuclear weapons 
systems including the shortrange airtoground attack missile 
known as srama 
since then defense secretary dick cheney has taken the srama 
off strategic air command alert bombers 
the panel recommended among other things that all weapons be 
equipped with modern enhanced nuclear detonation safety systems and 
that all nuclear bombs on aircraft be equipped with insensitive 
high explosives and fireresistant pits within the weapons 
a point of contention is the navys trident d5 missile whose 
nuclear warheads arent equipped with insensitive high explosives 
the warheads also are located near a thirdstage rocket motor 
which has a high energy propellant that could detonate in an 
accident 
drell suggested redesigning the d5 missile with the special 
explosives and putting a nondetonable propellant in the rocket 
motor 
the panel also recommended the creation of a special adversary 
group to examine and challenge nuclear weapons design and a joint 
advisory committee to report directly to the secretaries of defense 
and energy 
the agencies said in a onepage statement they would review the 
recommendations and called the panels goals consistent with both 
departments established priorities for safety 
rep john spratt dsc chairman of the armed services panel 
on department of energy nuclear facilities said the committees 
concern is not to condemn the nuclear community or establishment 
but to see that safety is pushed to the limit

nintynine police recruits may have ants in 
their pants to graduate but the one thing holding them up is they 
just dont have their regulation blue trousers 
the city is running out of cash and the next payroll is in 
doubt to try to keep a bank balance the city began deferring 
certain payments including the one to the supplier of the 
regulation blue police uniform trousers 
the daily news says its a case of pantemonium 
the supplier wont ship until it gets the check for the 
regulation blues and the police academy says the officers cant 
graduate in their cadet black trousers because they are no longer 
cadets 
sgt terry young police spokeswoman said graduation was first 
postponed until dec 26 the actual date when the recruit training 
program ends and the mayor and police commissioner can attend 
then it was delayed indefinitely until the pants arrive and we 
are hopeful that wont be long says capt richard delise 
if the madetoorder trousers arent delivered delise said 
theyll try to see if there are enough pants in stock even if 
not the exact madetomeasure sizes 
that would make the uniform complete though maybe not as 
spiffy 
one unidentified recruit at the police academy said the mood 
is pretty low to have this happen right before graduation is a 
real bombshell 
its not the first time the citys money shortage has affected 
operations at the police academy 
the academy ran out of toilet paper earlier this month

any serious effort in congress to rewrite the 
1990 farm law would be a big mistake agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said tuesday 
last week in denver the board of directors of the national 
farmers union called on congress to reopen and rewrite parts of 
the fiveyear law passed this year 
the nfu directors said the 1990 law will devastate family 
farmers and rural areas unless changes are made 
yeutter told broadcasters in a telephone news conference that 
opening the farm bill would be a big mistake for everyone 
including the folks from the farmers union 
in the view of some critics a problem with the 1990 legislation 
is that it was subject to federal budgetcutting restraints this 
pared 135 billion from commodity program operations over five 
years 
one result was to reduce the amount of acreage eligible for 
direct subsidies or deficiency payments under annual crop 
programs critics say this will cut into farm income 
in my judgment us agriculture came out very well in the 
budget exercise when one considers the circumstances under which 
that bill was legislated yeutter said 
but he added there are still some folks in american 
agriculture who believe that the 26 billion in federal subsidies 
that was provided in 1986 ought to be the norm and that if they 
just make a strong enough appeal in washington that would still be 
possible 
that was a reference to the record 258 billion paid to farmers 
in fiscal 1986 under agriculture department commodity programs 
those payments since have declined to a fraction of that annual 
rate 
yeutter said he sees no chance whatsoever that congress 
would return to the agricultural spending levels of the past 
rather he predicted that if lawmakers reopen the farm bill debate 
the chances would be 5050 that spending would be cut not raised 
bob denman a national farmers union spokesman in washington 
said no one had suggested that commodity spending be boosted to 26 
billion a year over the five years of the law 
but the nfu does believe some parts of the law can be 
strengthened and adjusted to help protect family farmers more than 
the 1990 act does

the official soviet news agency said today a 
telephone sweepstakes offering an american a chance to travel to 
the soviet space station was a hoax 
but the president of the american company promoting the offer 
said the tass report referring to the sweeepstakes as a cosmic 
canard was a misunderstanding 
we basically have our contract in hand so we know that were 
basically straight its just a matter of of us finding out whats 
going on behind the scenes in the soviet union to find out where 
the confusion lies said david mayer of space travel services 
glavkosmos the soviet equivalent of nasa said it did not know 
anything about the project soviet officials told tass vladimir 
zenkin deputy commercial manager at the energia agency said there 
were no deals to allow an american to spend a week on the space 
station mir in 1992 or 1993 tass referred to the sweepstakes as a 
hoax 
space travel services offered callers to a 900number a chance 
to win six months training a trip aboard a soviet rocket and a 
week on the space station mir entrants paid 299 a call nocost 
entries can be sent by mail 
thousands of calls monday the first day the line was open 
overloaded the circuits the line was working again early today 
space travel services corp has a legal contract with npo 
energia for a trip to the mir space station aboard a soyuz 
vehicle spokesman george nelson said two contracts are 
involved one between space travel and space commerce corp of 
houston and a second between space commerce and npo energia of 
moscow 
mayer said the tass report was obviously just a 
misunderstanding and i dont think it will be that difficult to 
clear up 
the winner to be selected in a drawing in december 1991 was to 
get the trip plus 500000 in cash or can forgo the trip and take 
15 million 
our longterm business strategy is to arrange for space travel 
opportunities for anyone who wishes to go into space said james 
davidson senior vice president of space travel services 
to introduce this service and our company to the general 
public weve arranged for a little sweepstakes the trip to the 
mir space station is the ultimate adventure 
davidson said the company has signed a contract with soviet 
officials but refused to disclose the terms mayer said the company 
would pay more than the 12 million paid the soviets by the tokyo 
broadcasting service for a japanese reporters recent ride 
sergei zavgorodny a spokesman for the international department 
of glavkosmos the soviet equivalent of nasa said he was unable to 
confirm the deal 
i know nothing about this lottery he said but the 
soviets are ready for commercial talks on launching any man into 
the mir station the only question is whether the winner is 
physically fit for the flight 
in moscow a secretary who answered the phone at energia the 
soviet rocket making company said she knew there was an agreement 
with an american company but she did not know any details she 
said the person in charge was out of the office until wednesday 
art dula whose houstonbased space commerce corp markets 
soviet space services in the united states said he negotiated the 
deal but also declined to release details 
the soviets for a hefty price have taken several passengers to 
mir but never an american 
space travel services keeps more than 50 percent of the phone 
charges and also hopes to sell advertising space aboard the 
spacecraft 
company officials said they chose not to attempt such a project 
with the national aeronautics space administration 
nasa has repeatedly made clear they theyre not really 
interested in opening up the shuttle to the general public and 
definitely not for commercial purposes mayer said 
the soviets however realize there was a buck to be made and 
thats what they want to do with their space program he said 
nasa spokesman dave garrett was reluctant to comment on the 
competition 
theyre free to do what they want he said we certainly 
dont have a monopoly on sending people into space i dont think 
we would ever do it on the basis of being selected by lottery 
though we would do it on the basis of people having something 
worthwhile to do 
space policy analyst john pike a member of the washingtonbased 
federation of american scientists and a critic of the us space 
program was exuberant about the sweepstakes 
thats fabulous thats great he said where can i buy a 
ticket 
because of local laws on sweepstakes people listing addresses 
in new york florida or rhode island are ineligible the deadline 
to enter is dec 1 1991 
 
eds the telephone number is 19002582mir 
in addition to calling a 900telephone number to enter the space

and so i think that if if the united states had to do its 
part to implement the united nations resolutions i believe the 
country would support that but i dont think there would that 
support would last if it were a long drawnout conflagration i 
think support would erode as it did in the vietnam conquest i 
mean conflict 
so but i can understand why some young kid would ask that 
question i mean they keep hearing of this prolongation and that 
thered be stalemate and all of this kind of thing i dont believe 
that and one of the reasons that i moved this additional force or 
had it moved was because every individual life is precious and if 
there had to be some confrontation military i would want to see 
be able to assure the parents and the families there is enough 
force there to minimize the risk to every single american kid and 
coalition kid the desert rats the french legions and the arabs 
that well be fighting side by side with yeah 
q mr president what prompted the administrations change of 
thinking some might less kindly say flipflop on the question 
of whether financial aid can be targeted to minorities and i have 
a brief followup on that 
a i dont think there was any flipflop on it there was a 
ruling made by a man of great integrity in the department of 
education and when we heard about it here i expressed a certain 
concern asked that the policy be reviewed and indeed today the 
department issued a policy statement that is that i think has mr 
williams who was the promulgator of the original regulation or 
ruling happy and yet it does do what i want to see and that is to 
continue these minority scholarships as best we can 
i met with a group of editors earlier on today and the question 
comes up well will there be a legal test i am not a lawyer 
and i dont know how the courts will rule eventually they will 
rule on it 
but as for now we have worked the regulation so that we can 
continue to have these kinds of scholarships i have long been 
committed to them i have long been committed to affirmative action 
and so i hope the ruling which is some of its quite technical 
will accomplish that end but i would like to think that the matter 
can be resolved with finality this way but i dont think thats 
what weve done i think its going to be i think therell 
probably be some court challenges to this you wanted to follow up 
q yes just briefly i think there is some question how a 
decision of that magnitude in the civil rights arena could have 
been made without knowledge of the white house 
a well it was made without the knowledge of the white house 
and i would simply refer you to mr williams who is a very able 
attorney over there in the education department i think he 
explained that in his press conference yeah 
q id like to ask you about the moral consistency of the us 
policy on iraq during the 1980s iraq waged an aggressive war of 
a brutal a war of brutal aggression against a different neighbor 
iran it also used chemical weapons against iranians and against 
its own kurdish population it also worked on its nuclear program 
but rather than go to war against iraq in that case the united 
states took iraqs side 
in the case of the chemical weapons the reagan and then the 
bush administrations opposed all efforts to impose sanctions in 
protest against the use of chemical weapons and in the nuclear 
area the united states condemned israel for setting back iraqs 
nuclear program 
so my question is is it hypocritical now to threaten war over 
conduct by the same regime when the similar conduct was condoned or 
even supported against different adversaries in the recent past 
a no i dont think its hypocritical whatsoever here you have 
the united nations moving in concert you have an unprecedented use 
of the peacekeeping function of the united nations and i was very 
proud that the united states was a leading component in what the 
security council did and it is true that our administration and 
others previously tried to work with iraq 
but this brutal aggression this this what they did here is 
such a clear violation of international law that the entire world 
was united in opposition to it so if there was a mistake made in 
trying to move them along a more civilized path by having contacts 
as we did fine 
but this kind of this kind of revisionistic view that that 
makes whats happening today wrong im sorry i dont agree with 
it at all and i think were on the right path i think the whole 
world is united against this 
and clearly id like to have been clairvoyant so i could have 
seen that the man was lying when he said he wasnt going to invade 
kuwait which he did say and he told hosni mubarak this for 
example but we werent quite that it wasnt quite that clear at 
the time yeah

both the united states and iraq on tuesday expressed the 
resolve if not the wish to fight a war in the persian gulf 
european nations refused to receive an iraqi envoy unless the 
baghdad government talks with washington 
less than a month before a united nations deadline for iraq to 
relinquish kuwait or face potential attack president bush said he 
believed the american people would support a military strike 
i think that if the united states has to do its part to 
implement the united nations resolutions i believe the country 
would support that he told reporters in washington 
bush acknowledged public backing would probably erode in the 
event of a drawnout conflagration but added this will not 
be in my view that kind of confrontation 
the baghdad government too gave every indication it was 
girding for war thousands of military reservists reported for duty 
in the latest iraqi callup and the ruling revolutionary command 
council said iraq was ready for the decisive showdown 
the pentagon said iraq had deployed another 10000 troops in and 
around kuwait in the last week bringing its troop total in the 
area to 510000 iraq seized the emirate 4 months ago 
an additional 10000 american troops arrived in the region 
during that time said pentagon spokesman pete williams us 
troops in the gulf will number more than 400000 by midjanuary 
nations allied with the united states in a coalition against iraq 
now have about 22000 troops in the area 
that coalition reaffirmed its solidarity on tuesday european 
community foreign ministers meeting in brussels refused to meet 
with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz unless he first goes to 
washington for talks 
europe does not want to lend itself to any bid by iraq to 
drive a wedge between the ec and the united states said dutch 
foreign minister hans van den broek 
aziz had been tentatively set to go to washington on monday but 
the visit was canceled after the united states and iraq were unable 
to agree on a date for subsequent talks in baghdad between 
secretary of state james a baker iii and saddam 
baker also in brussels to meet with nato allies said the 
united states would not object to a european meeting with aziz as 
long as no mixed signals were sent about the allies position 
he said saddam may well attempt further diplomatic 
sleightsofhand in the days ahead but we are all agreed that 
we must not allow his manipulations to divert us 
the bush administration has told saddam not to stage a partial 
withdrawal from kuwait as a ploy 
even with bakers goahead to hold talks with iraq the 
europeans said seeing aziz who had been invited before the 
usiraqi talks were derailed would send the wrong signal to 
baghdad 
we maintain the pressure on iraq said jacques delors 
president of the european commission the communitys executive 
body 
the iraqi foreign ministry said the ec was only trying to 
appease the united states 
iraq has tried to set jan 12 as a date for the bakersaddam 
meeting the united states says that is too late because it comes 
only three days before jan 15 after that date the security 
council has authorized using all necessary means to force iraq 
out of kuwait 
even if the usiraqi talks get back on track a turkish report 
quoted saddam as saying they would be useless if the american side 
merely reiterates security council resolutions demanding a full 
pullout 
we would not go to the united states to get orders saddam 
told a turkish television journalist if bush is going to repeat 
to us the un decision calling for a complete withdrawal there 
is no need to go there 
the bush administration has said urging iraq to comply with un 
resolutions would be the principal focus of any talks 
we have already read them we know them and we rejected 
them saddam said referring to the resolutions the interview 
was to be broadcast this week on state turkish television and 
excerpts were released tuesday 
in iraq thousands more reservists reported to their army units 
tuesday as part of a major military mobilization most of the 
reservists involved in the latest callup served during the 198088 
war with iran 
iran meanwhile had some words of warning for its old enemy 
the official islamic republic news agency quoted president hashemi 
rafsanjani as saying the baghdad government would have itself to 
blame if it were attacked 
we are feeling very uneasy over the fact that the iraqi people 
may be hurt by the americans rafsanjani told a group of 
students but he added the responsibility for this rests with 
the iraqi regime 
in other developments 
defense secretary dick cheney and the chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff colin powell were to leave tuesday night for 
saudi arabia to talk with officials and meet with troops 
prince charles will visit british troops in the gulf this 
weekend buckingham palace said tuesday princess diana will not be 
with him but she will fly to germany wednesday to visit families 
of british soldiers serving in the gulf region the palace said 
soviet mideast envoy yevgeny primakov said the departure of 
2500 soviet workers from iraq has been delayed only by technical 
matters and the desire of many to remain until their contracts 
expire there had been speculation baghdad was trying to hold the 
soviet contract workers as hostages

christmas discounting a sluggish housing

in november to dampen inflation to 03 percent the government said 
tuesday 
the seasonally adjusted increase in the labor departments 
consumer price index represents an annual inflation rate of just 
37 percent down sharply from the 89 percent inflation rate 
during the three months after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the improvement allowed the federal reserve board to take 
dramatic action to stimulate the economy and cushion the effects of 
the recession most private economists believe the nation has 
entered 
the central bank cut its key bank lending rate known as the 
discount rate from 7 percent to 65 percent effective wednesday 
the move announced about 30 minutes before the close of trading on 
wall street sent stock prices surging it was the first cut since 
august 1986 
lower interest rates help the economy by making it cheaper for 
individuals and businesses to borrow but by stimulating demand 
that tends to increase inflationary pressures 
the fed needs to be worrying about the economy going down 
more than it needs to be worrying about inflation right now said 
economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch in new york 
evidence that the economic downturn including slow christmas 
sales is restraining prices was sprinkled throughout tuesdays 
report analysts said 
clothing costs fell 02 percent for the second consecutive 
month home furnishing prices dropped 07 percent and 
entertainment commodities inched down 01 percent that includes 
most televisions radios and other electronic equipment given as 
gifts 
retailers are making sales but theyre doing it at discount 
prices said economist robert brusca of nikko securities co 
international inc in new york sale prices are much more 
widespread and floor traffic appears to be much less dense than 
before past christmases 
prices outside the volatile food and energy sectors taken by 
economists as the best measure of underlying price pressures also 
rose a moderate 03 percent the same as in the previous two 
months 
the effect of sluggish housing markets and even home price 
declines in some regions showed up in homeowners monthly payments 
which remained unchanged in both november and october they account 
for 1 of every 5 spent by consumers 
brusca and other economists said the underlying trend toward 
tamer inflation had been masked by the shock to energy prices after 
the persian gulf crisis began 
but in november energy prices rose only 05 percent after 
jumping 151 percent over the previous three months 
the oil bubble has really pretty well passed through now 
said economist robert g dederick of northern trust corp in 
chicago were going to have some rather pleasant readings 
temporarily on the reverse side of the bubble 
gasoline prices rose 03 percent after a 77 percent jump in 
october fuel oil prices which increased 508 percent in the 
preceding three months fell 38 percent in november but natural 
gas costs were up 32 percent and electricity charges rose 06 
percent 
inflation of prices for services as opposed to goods has 
reacted less strongly to the slowing economy medical care for 
instance rose a hefty 08 percent in november and was 94 percent 
more expensive than a year ago overall they were up 04 percent 
other higherthanaverage price increases included 
new cars up 06 but only the third rise in 10 months 
airline fares up 36 percent in november and 84 percent over 
the past three months after the rise in aviation fuel 
tobacco up 07 percent for the month and 11 percent over the 
past year 
food and beverage prices rose 04 percent pulled up by a large 
27 percent increase in fruit and vegetable prices the cost of 
beef pork fish and eggs also rose however prices fell for 
poultry cereal and bakery products and dairy products 
especially in the west it was very very dry and we struggled 
with the fall fruit and vegetable crops said economist donald 
ratajczak of georgia state university but unless we have a big 
freeze that shouldnt continue 
the various changes put the index for all consumer goods and 
services at 1338 in november that means a hypothetical selection 
of goods and services that cost 100 on average in the 198284 base 
period cost 13380 last month up from 12590 a year ago 
in a separate report the labor department said americans real 
earnings increased a seasonally adjusted 05 percent still over 
the past year wages have not kept pace with inflation average 
weekly earnings for both fulltime and parttime nonsupervisory 
workers were 34849 in november up 3 percent from a year ago 
for the first 11 months of the year consumer prices rose at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 64 percent the worst rate 
since 1981 and well above last years 46 percent rate 
however economists expect the inflation rate to subside to 
between 3 percent and 4 percent next year as the slumping economy 
further weakens demand and as oil prices turn down

more than half the city that is home to the 
taj mahal was under curfew tuesday after three days of riots 
between hindus and moslems but the 17th century architectural 
masterpiece reopened to tourists 
at least 11 people were killed and 49 injured in agra in riots 
that were the latest in a wave of sectarian clashes to have swept 
several cities across india claiming at least 307 lives in 12 
days 
residents stood watch on rooftops and alleys near the taj mahal 
ready to sound alarms at the first sign of trouble a curfew was in 
force in eight of agras 15 districts police said 
elsewhere tuesday two people were stabbed to death in the 
southern city of hyderabad and five people were killed in the 
western city of ahmedabad press trust of india reported at least 
16 people were injured in a bomb explosion and 14 people were hurt 
in stabbings and stone throwing in ahmedabad 
two weeks ago a hindu fundamentalist group revived a plan to 
build a temple on a site already occupied by a mosque in the sacred 
town of ayodhya 250 miles east of agra 
the temple campaign caused sectarian clashes in at least 12 
other towns the most violent in hyderabad more than 620 miles 
south of ayodhya 
although hindumoslem clashes have occurred frequently since 
indias independence in 1947 the brutality of the attacks this 
time numbed the country 
in several towns babies and women were targeted by masked men 
who roamed at night defying police and a curfew to hack their 
victims with axes or to stab them with swords knives and daggers 
in hyderabad alone 28 children were among the 151 people killed 
since dec 7 more than 100 people have been killed in 11 towns of 
uttar pradesh state where agra and ayodhya are located

at the school where he had taken shelter we are still in a 
dangerous position we dont know what will be in the future

here is the text of president bushs news 
conference tuesday with regional reporters in the old executive 
office building 
president bush let me just make a quick comment and then ill 
be glad to take some questions 
but i want to just comment once again on the situation in the 
gulf because you see ever since aug 2 the world community has 
been virtually united in its condemnation and in its rejection of 
iraqi aggression 
ive been talking about the security council resolutions but 
the general assembly of the united nations with only one vote 
against it iraq joined in condemning what has gone on by saddam 
hussein and i think thats a very significant point because those 
who were saying well its only the security council now have 
to recognize that what weve been saying all along is true that it 
is not saddam hussein against and the arab world against the 
united states but indeed it is it is saddam hussein against the 
rest of the world 
and so i mention this because were coming down towards this 
unmandated deadline i still want to see a peaceful solution to 
this question you keep hearing about new initiatives president 
bendjedid of algeria but i gather that that has gone about as far 
as those initiatives that others have undertaken bendjedid good 
credentials on all sides of this dispute but unable to talk sense 
to iraqs dictator 
so i would just simply say that we will keep trying to find an 
answer it cannot be an answer of concession it cannot be an 
answer where saddam hussein is rewarded with one single concession 
because that would fly right in the face of the rejuvenated united 
nations peacekeeping effort and it simply is unacceptable not 
just to us but to the rest of our coalition partners 
and you look at what the ec said yesterday or today i guess it 
was regarding the visit of tariq aziz when they said there would 
be no point in his coming to see them unless the visits with the 
united states had taken place it shows a real solidarity because 
the temptation might have been the other way 
so i think the coalition is holding we are determined more 
determined than ever 
yesterday i had a meeting with 27 i believe it was other 
ambassadors from other countries the 28 standing together in the 
gulf represented a show of solidarity that i think was read loud 
and clear halfway around the world 
so thats where we are and there is no news to report on the 
proposed secretary of states visit the visit of the secretary of 
state to baghdad or indeed of the foreign minister tariq aziz 
coming here 
so with no further ado id be glad to take questions on any 
subject yeah let me get these first one two 
q are you more optimistic or less optimistic at this point 
about the possibilities of going to war compared to when you made 
the proposal to send mr baker to iraq 
a well if i had to quantify my degrees of optimism or 
pessimism id say its about in the same mode as when it was 
there i do not believe that tariq aziz sic one knows or has 
digested what hes up against in terms of this of this coalition 
force and secondly i think he basically is at best uncertain as 
to whether this force will be used against him and so i cant 
what i think is essential to get the peaceful resolution is that he 
realizes that he simply cannot prevail so i guess im about where 
i was a couple of weeks ago when i made that proposal yeah 
q mr president id like to ask you a question that one of our 
readers of the detroit free press suggested i ask you and its 
from an 18yearold from birmingham mich his question is if the 
war in the gulf escalates how will you get the american people to 
support the war and its a common theme of our readers questions 
it seems to ask whether you think the american public is as willing 
to accept war as an option as your policies seem to be 
a im out i dont want war as an option i want peace as an 
option secondly i think some of those questions stem from the 
fact that some believe this quote will be another vietnam 
unquote and the agony of vietnam is still with us 
people remember a protracted war they remember a war where 
individuals were asked to fight with one hand tied behind their 
back in essence this will not be in my view that kind of a 
confrontation

q mr president on the question of the economy you yourself 
have mentioned that you would support some economic stimulus 
perhaps and im wondering if in the new year youre going to 
propose any tax cuts capital gains in particular or perhaps a cut 
in the payroll taxes for social security 
a well i havent changed my view on the fact that capital 
gains would be stimulative and not costly to the taxpayer i am hit 
regularly on the fact that this is a tax break for the rich i 
dont believe that 
but the problem you have on this is that we have under this 
budget agreement rigid caps and we have to score capital gains 
under existing law the way i think its the cbo or the joint 
committee or somebody says it has to be scored so were talking 
about a 20 billion hit 
what id love to think is that we could change the way we score 
it to a more realistic i would say realistic view the 
treasurys view for example that shows this would lift people up 
would encourage investment and would not be a revenue loss 
so i havent given up on my philosophical commitment to the idea 
that capital gains would stimulate growth and when you have a slow 
or certainly a sloweddown economy in some areas recessional 
it would be good but were faced with this practical problem as to 
what we can do not just on capital gains but on other stimulants 
that cost money there is remember an enormous stimulant one 
that im not very happy about and that is about a 300 billion 
federal deficit 
so i dont know where were going to come down on our state of 
the union message but in concept of growth and opportunity i can 
guarantee you the emphasis is going to be on that and if i can 
find a way to change this this stultified thinking that this is 
this is deficit creating a capital gains cut why then id be 
all for that so were looking at it i dont know where were 
coming out on it 
q are you sympathetic to the idea of cutting the social 
security payroll tax at all 
a well if i can figure out a way to pay for it one of the 
good things about the deficit agreement that was very controversial 
and which had a lot of you know for which i got a reasonable 
amount of criticism id say is that you have to pay for these 
things and whether the same argument can be made i havent seen 
the dynamic argument made on that that i have on capital gains 
so i just dont know the answer to that one if the offsets were 
there you might im a little worried ill be honest with you 
having laid this this tax question down for a while to reopen 
many many aspects of it ive tried to draw the exception because 
i feel so strongly on the capital gains account yeah 
q mr president saddam hussein knows and you know that his 
best shot at cracking the cohesion of the coalition arrayed against 
him is to draw israel into it by direct attack or otherwise 
general scowcroft indicated that there have been specific 
discussions with the israelis and the coalition partners about that 
contingency can you tell us whether theres been any assurance or 
commitment either by the israelis or our coalition partners that 
they would not crack apart if that were to happen 
a if he 
q if he attacked israel 
a if he attacked israel im convinced the coalition would not 
fall apart i cant give you the specifics on it but im 
absolutely convinced of it and you can assume the way ive 
answered the question that weve weve inquired about that 
secondly israel has had a what i would call a lowprofile 
position on all of this for which i salute them it is not easy 
they have their their security they feel could well be at stake 
from some radical act by saddam hussein but i have no argument 
with mr shamir over the way that the israelis have conducted 
themselves nor do i think that the coalition partners on that 
particular point regardless of what their historic relationship 
with israel may have been yeah 
q mr president as the cold war began to wind down first in 
congress and then in your own administration there was talk of a 
peace dividend and in fact on the very day that saddam hussein 
invaded iraq you gave a speech in which you proposed a major shift 
in the structure of the american military a 25 percent drawdown 
over the next five years with the way the force has been stretched 
in operation desert shield are you rethinking that as this ends 
are you going to have to take another look at whether that big a 
reduction in our activeduty military force is actually possible in 
a postcold war world

a i believe we will be able to live with the reductions and 
they were substantial that have been worked out in the last budget 
agreement and i think the fact that we have been able to move this 
much force this dramatically is of its own weight a very a 
marvelous thing 
but as we restructure the defense and as defense has taken 
substantial hits not i would argue in a peacedividend mode but 
just more of a fiscal mode i think we can i think i will be able 
to represent to the american people that we will still have this 
ability to rapidly deploy the besttrained forces in the world so 
yeah 
q if this crisis had occurred five years from now when this 
drawdown thats been agreed on had already been largely completed 
would your options have been as unlimited as they are now 
a good question and im not sure i can answer it but if the 
question is would we have been able to deploy this much force this 
rapidly i think the answer is yes id want to hedge just a little 
bit but i think it is yes gen scowcroft is shaking me off a 
little laughter but because we were talking about this with 
gen powell and general and dick cheney but this is not the 
you know this is not the average disturbance you might say that 
calls for the average deployment of force this is pushing it up to 
the edge of the envelope 
but i think the answer is yes id like wish i could get back 
to you to be sure im not misleading you but i felt comfortable 
when we had the briefing from cheney and powell i think it was 
yesterday on this question yeah way back there 
q yes will the will the forces that have been taken out of 
germany and deployed to the gulf be sent back to europe once this 
crisis 
a im not sure of the answer to that question i cant answer 
it i dont know but one thing i will say about them is the 
earliest day possible i would like to have every single american 
soldier out of the gulf for a lot of reasons and id i think 
that in the first place i think the status quo ante the return 
to where we were before saddam invaded his neighbor is 
unacceptable because i think youre going to see a cry for 
stability and order there security and stability that cannot be 
met simply by a return to the preinvasion borders or the status 
quo there 
so i think youre going to have to have some kind of 
peacekeeping force and i think were going to have to cope with 
the question this gentleman raised of nuclear increased nuclear 
capability today beyond what it was several years ago 
and so were it wont be just the way it was before and 
but i would like to think it would be with some international 
peacekeeping force because i think theres a problem if us forces 
remain on the ground in the gulf for some time this is i dont 
feel that way about naval forces weve been there for a long time 
we will continue to stay there our mission being to protect 
freedom of passage through the straits of hormuz and we have a 
history there of helping keep the peace and of keeping the straits 
open 
so i would not see any change in that force but on whether 
these forces return to germany weve got i think well have some 
obviously you know might be different people but were going 
to have some big discussion over levels in post postiraq forces 
in europe were discussing that anyway right now 
staff one more question 
q mr president are you 
a make it four more one two three four no you regulars 
no laughter four one two three four 
q mr president are you prepared to initiate offensive action 
against iraq without a declaration of war from congress 
a im having the darnedest consultations with congress youve 
ever seen i was very pleased when the leaders at the last 
meeting told me that it was the best in terms of consultation 
theyve been ever had and ill continue to do that and i will 
look at i hope i dont have to cross that bridge because i want 
a peaceful solution to this question but there are so many 
contingencies that its very difficult to answer that question in 
one definitive way and im not going to try yes 
q an article in the recent issue of time magazine mr 
president says that no one in your cabinet has a child serving in 
saudi arabia and that a disproportionate number of us troops 
stationed on the front line hail from minorities and the working 
class is this accurate and if it is why does this condition 
exist 
a well i dont know about the profligacy of my i mean the 
proliferation of my cabinet and where their children are but i i 
dont have any serviceage kids myself but i dont think this 
concept that this is a discriminatory army or an army that is 
discriminating and thus sending more blacks to their fate or 
minorities hispanics or something is proper ive heard it and 
i reject it and the reason i reject it is we have an all 
volunteer army 
we have great opportunity in this army we have the finest kids 
the best trained the best motivated the high achievers not the 
low achievers and so this argument that theres some kind of 
racism which i think your question implies in this deployment i 
reject it out of its the whole cloth 
it is simply not true and if you dont believe me believe 
colin powell and he has pretty good credentials in this field 
outstanding credentials so i want to gun it down just as hard as i 
possibly can and i dont know about my cabinet i am sorry i cant 
answer that i just dont know where their kids are yeah

row row row your boat all the way to 
work 
thats marshall mcgregors idea of the best way to beat the 
commute backup on the san franciscooakland bay bridge 
mcgregor 36 wants to form a catamaran club of several men and 
women who like the idea of grabbing an oar and rowing across the 
bay every morning and night and are willing to pay for the 
privilege 
depending on the route the trip could run four to seven miles 
each way 
im looking for some athletically minded commuters who would 
want an alternative commuting club that combines a health club with 
mass transit said mcgregor the bay is a great source for 
transportation you dont have to build any roads or rails and 
its free 
mcgregors vision includes four or five 35foot aluminumhulled 
catamarans complete with canopies to protect oarsmen and women from 
saltwater spray rowers would depart from points in berkeley 
emeryville or oakland he said and arrive near the ferry building 
in san francisco 
to complete the picture mcgregor needs crews of sporting types 
willing to change from business togs into sweats for the transbay 
row shower facilities would be available at the other end he 
said 
but there are plenty of details yet to be worked out including 
costs 
with the rowing club you no longer have to spend the extra 
time each day going to a health club and youve avoided sitting on 
the bay bridge for 45 minutes he said

once the haven of german speedsters the autobahn 
is now plagued by traffic jams and clogged with slowpoke sedans as 
if that werent enough the government said tuesday it wants to 
charge money to use the highway system 
the bonn government seeking cash to finance german unification 
agreed in principle to charge an annual fee to use the 6325 miles 
of autobahn however concerns about violating european community 
agreements prevented the cabinet from reaching a final decision 
we dont want to decide on something that isnt fully 
guaranteed said volker ruehe the no 2 official in chancellor 
helmut kohls christian democratic union he did not specify the 
possible conflict 
some say the autobahn fun the days of blasting down the 
highway for hours at a stretch with no speed limit to rein in your 
mercedes porsche or bmw is already over 
traffic jams abound some extending as long as 35 miles 
construction causes delays and there are speed limits near cities 
and puttering eastern german tabants along with ladas skodas and 
other east european makes get in the way of western german power 
cars 
under the autobahn fee plan passenger vehicles would pay 66 a 
year with higher amounts for trucks and buses motor vehicles 
would sport an annual sticker to show the owners had paid 
foreigners would not be exempt 
protests already are being heard 
the german automobile club adac said the fees would amount to a 
clear break of kohls promise not to raise taxes to finance 
unification 
kohl had indeed made such a promise but he also made clear that 
he planned to raise fees to finance the historic merger 
that in turn has led to a debate over what is a fee and what is 
a tax in a country where ordinary workers already hand over more 
than 40 percent of their salaries to the government or 
governmentmandated social programs 
even the railroad workers union criticized the autobahn plan 
saying it amounted to an unfair tax that fails to take account of 
the individuals ability to pay 
yet the germans will pay one way or another as the expensive 
rebuilding of eastern germany goes forward besides the autobahn 
fee the government already has plans to raise the cost of 
telephone calls

q youve spoken of this 
a this is an allvolunteer army they are not draftdodging 
remember vietnam and the allegation which i think had a lot of 
truth to it that the kid that got disproportionately there was the 
guy that couldnt get the exemption and that came out of the you 
know kind of the lower rungs of society this is different 
totally different yeah and we ought to get you figures on this 
because it is very very important as to how high a quality this 
army is 
and youll read about one or two that say well i didnt sign 
up to do this i signed up because i thought i could get a free 
education he gets on the phil donahue show a big hero but 
thats a thats the tiny fraction of these kids that are over 
there 
the morale is good and they are motivated and they are 
welleducated and they are dedicated and if youll excuse an 
oldfashioned reference they are patriotic and so it isnt some 
cop out armed services that they are now getting caught up in 
something that they were unaware of i am glad we got that one 
because i really feel strongly on that question yeah 
q youve spoken of this crisis as being not the us against 
iraq but rather the world against iraq 
a yes 
q and im wondering then why the talks with baghdad arent 
being conducted by the secretary general of the un but rather by 
the american secretary of state 
a good question and the answer is the secretary general as 
you may recall tried and he went to baghdad or i think it was in 
baghdad maybe it was in amman but he went there and he went to 
talk within his mandate and his mandate were the un resolutions 
this was before 678 or whatever the last one was 
so he has tried hard and i salute him for that and he would be 
willing i talked to him about this in paris while im up for 
your question and when we were over there for the csce meeting 
and i asked him hes an old friend of mine he and i were un 
ambassadors at the same time and i said javier do you think it 
would be worth trying this again were all trying for the extra 
step he said if i felt we could make some progress within my 
mandate i certainly would try again 
but its not that people havent tried i referred you to just 
touched on it in passing about chadli bendjedid of algeria youve 
heard over and over again various people calling as king hussein 
of jordan did for an arab solution you had tariq aziz go to 
moscow to talk it isnt though people havent tried it is simply 
that as recently as today i think it was the last wire clip i 
saw saddam hussein is still referring to a nation that is a 
member of the arab league and a member of the united nations as 
province 19 of kuwait 
and therein lies the difficulty it isnt that people havent 
tried to go the extra step but i have to give the un credit for 
having the secretary general for really having tried on this 
one and im sure hes quietly tried as well as through this public 
mission that he undertook 
q do you think mr baker will have any more luck 
a i dont im not sure he will im not sure he will but if 
he can do what ive referred to in the beginning if he can 
convince saddam hussein of the truth itll be worth the effort 
because as ive said its not a negotiating session or its 
certainly not a concession session were not going there to 
concede one single inch because if you do that and you want to put 
it in theoretical terms you have diminished instantly the new 
peacekeeping function of the united nations and the coalition is 
demoralized and falls apart and that will not happen 
so what hes going to do is go there and make this very clear 
that there can be theres no concession that the world is united 
and that this force which is overwhelming is there for a purpose 
and i would hope i still hope that gets the message through to 
saddam hussein who had the last one somebody rita 
q thank you mr president as you mentioned on the civil 
rights or the minority scholarship issue the possibility of 
court challenges what is your position on whether or not 
scholarships should be earmarked for minorities in general and 
would you perceive some finetuning of the current new policies 
which i believe now ban federal monies to be earmarked for 
minorities but not private funds 
a well as mr williams pointed out theres a legal question 
my own view has been all along in my own life and everything else 
committed to this concept of minority scholarships clearly it 
should be valid privately and indeed the support that we give to 
the historically black colleges that should maybe someday will 
get challenged i hope it isnt and i hope it would sustain the 
challenge

clearly the support that we give to these institutions 
privately should be above beyond challenge but i dont know the 
answer to your question as to how you know how thatll work out 
in the courts i dont know we had a fascinating almost 
philosophical discussion at lunch with some of the most prominent 
black editors and publishers in this country and i got into a very 
lively discussion on this whole question of philosophy and what 
happens to some kid from one minority group if the scholarships are 
all allocated to one and not to another and i dont know that 
answer because im not a lawyer 
what i do know is that i am for affirmative action and i am for 
trying to help the groups that have been the most disadvantaged 
through scholarships and thats what i think has been resolved in 
the department of education at least in the foreseeable future and 
i hope it i hope it stands but its i dont want to mislead 
people in the country by suggesting that this may not receive a 
challenge and then the courts are going to have to make that 
determination and then if somebody can legislatively correct it 
fairly why id be open for that 
but i dont want to buy into a into a court solution question 
that might happen way down the road but i would recommend that 
everybody take a look at the policy statement that just came out a 
little bit earlier and i think it will define where this stands 
now and what what the likelihood is of its and for how long it 
will continue last one yes 
q mr president you said the persian gulf will not turn into 
another vietnam 
a absolutely 
q could you give another give us some projection of how long 
you believe the conflict would last 
a no 
q as far as weeks months 
a in the first place i dont want to get you guys want to 
get me into talking about conflict all the time and i i 
understand it and as we go down towards the 15th itll probably 
intensify but i want to still talk about hoping that we can get a 
peaceful resolution to this question but that means making saddam 
hussein understand whats at stake 
secondly i just simply cannot help you on the hypothesis but 
it i can i have looked into it enough and talked to enough of 
the planners and those responsible not only in our country but 
the leaders around the world to have to be totally confident and 
tell the american people we are not looking at another 
vietnam that the analogy is totally different in whos 
supporting you what the topography is what the force is what the 
determination of the of the military is its a whole array 
the coalition all of these things come together and argue very 
forcefully this is not another vietnam 
and so again i get back to this very penetrating question by 
the kid that wrote you 18yearold because i can understand it 
i can tell where a guy like thats coming from my own kids ask 
that a few grandchildren and stuff what is this what does it 
mean and so it isnt it is not going to be another vietnam and 
you can get ranges from all kinds of ranges in terms of how quick 
this guy would fold but none that i know of are predicting 
anything like the long drawnout bitter experience of vietnam 
q are there going to be far less casualties sir in the 
persian gulf than there were in vietnam 
a yes but i cant document that and you know they asked the 
question some of you all werent here for it but in the 
pressroom across the street how many and whats how many can 
you cope with whats your whats your you know how many is 
enough or how many is too much one is too much and so what do 
you do 
you plan that if you have to use force to safeguard every 
single precious human life and that is exactly what our colin 
powell and his cohorts are doing over there and thats what i owe 
the parents and the kids and the spouses 
and particularly i like to say that at this time of year with 
our holidays coming up and all of that i mean its a very 
emotional time for these families and i have to understand it 
ive got to understand where this 18yearold correspondents 
coming from and ive got to understand when i get these letters 
mostly supportive still but some fraught with anxiety about their 
own loved ones 
and i can say to them we if force has to be used we will 
have done everything in our power to guarantee the life of every 
single one of our soldiers and so with sailors and marines and 
airmen 
and i will have that off my conscience and then clearly it 
wont work out in a sanitary fashion like that but i would i 
never would want it said that we didnt go the extra mile so i 
took some hits on moving this additional force and thats fine 
that goes with the territory but at least i have the satisfaction 
in my heart of hearing from our chairman of our joint chiefs and 
our commanding gen norm schwarzkopf hey were doing it right 
youve seen these kids out here on thanksgiving and we owe it 
to them to give them the best give them the most to get this job 
done and the brits are looking at it that way i think the 
french are looking at it that way the training thats going on and 
has gone on with some of our other coalition partners are aimed to 
that end too 
listen thank you all for coming and merry christmas to 
everybody

president mikhail s gorbachev said tuesday that 
soviets should vote this winter on private land ownership and a 
union treaty because the issues were too important to be decided 
solely by lawmakers 
but both plans already face opposition from leaders of some 
republics 
such questions as the fate of a government 
selfdetermination and the land on which you and your children 
live these are questions for the people gorbachev told 
reporters and legislators on the second day of the 10day congress 
of peoples deputies parliamentary session 
president boris yeltsin of the russian federation the nations 
largest republic said russia will not agree to a land reform 
referendum because its parliament already approved private 
ownership of land 
russia took a decision and thats it yeltsin said 
yeltins opposition to the initiative was considered a major 
blow to the kremlin 
earlier tuesday officials from estonia and moldavia joined 
those opposing the union treaty which gorbachev said is needed to 
hold the nation together 
we wont sign the union treaty there is no chance of that 
now said dimitru matkovsky a parliamentarian from moldavia 
he and about two dozen other moldavian deputies stormed out of 
the cavernous congress hall because lawmakers had invited 
representatives of two ethnic groups demanding autonomy within 
moldavia matkovsky said moldavians would not participate until the 
groups left 
meanwhile news reports said that explosions rocked the latvian 
capital of riga before dawn tuesday the blasts smashed windows in 
the latvian communist party building the soviet army prosecutors 
office and the latvian prime ministers office 
no injuries were reported authorities said they had no suspects 
or motives 
the russian federations congress of peoples deputies voted 
dec 3 to allow farmers to own land for the first time in 61 years 
that reversed a policy in effect since dictator josef stalin 
carried out a bloody collectivization of land from 192932 
many economists agree with russias approach arguing that 
private ownership of land is indispensable to the creation of a 
free market economy 
gorbachev has proposed that citizens of the 15 republics vote on 
the issue and on the concept of a federated union 
i introduced a suggestion to hold a referendum and those who 
dont want a union let them go and secede gorbachev said 
calling secession a divorce process he reiterated that any 
separation by a republic must take place under soviet law 
if estonia takes the position yes well leave the union we 
want to be like this then this divorce process will occur 
gorbachev wants the congress to endorse a treaty that would 
redefine the relationship among the republics and the central 
government 
if its a renovated federation no one would leave it i 
think because it will mean cooperation because in the entire 
world its just the opposite the 59yearold soviet leader said 
russia however has continued to press ahead without waiting 
for a new union treaty 
on tuesday it signed its third bilateral trade and political 
pact with another republic byelorussia russia has similar 
agreements with the ukraine and kazakhstan 
all the republics have declared some form of sovereignty since 
last march the declarations and subsequent antikremlin laws have 
paralyzed power in the country worsening food shortages and 
hastening economic collapse 
the union treaty would preserve central control over national 
security and such key industries as transportation and energy and 
natural wealth such as gold and diamonds most republics are 
demanding that the national government also hand over the power to 
make economic decisions 
estonian president arnold ruutel on tuesday flatly rejected the 
union treaty byelorussian communist party chief anatoly malofeyev 
urged the deputies to support it as a way out of the political and 
economic crisis

a coalition of 53 business groups is girding 
to battle tougher automobile fuel economy standards fearful that 
the proposal will gain momentum if war erupts in the middle east 
spokesmen said tuesday 
the coalition for vehicle choice was founded by the auto 
industry which this year led a successful fight against 
legislation to require that new car fleets average about 40 miles 
per gallon by the year 2001 
but spokesmen said the coalition had a diverse membership from 
the american farm bureau federation to the international 
professional rodeo association other members represent iron and 
steel manufacturers electrical contractors police chiefs and 
cattlemen 
this debate has been perceived as between the auto industry 
and the environmental movement said jeffrey b conley executive 
director of the coalition the coalition will try to convince an 
array of business and consumer groups that they have a stake in the 
issue he said 
sen richard bryan dnev sponsored a bill that would require 
new car fuel efficiency to improve 20 percent by 1995 and another 
20 percent by 2001 the current minimum required efficiency is 275 
mpg the typical manufacturers fleet of new cars would have to 
average about 40 mpg within a decade 
the bill opposed by the bush administration died in the senate 
after supporters fell three votes short of the 60 needed to break a 
filibuster 
bryan who argued that his bill would reduce us reliance on 
middle eastern oil and reduce the air pollution that causes global 
warming will reintroduce the measure early nextyear spokesman 
jim mulhall said 
the persian gulf situation has given the argument against 
dependence on foreign oil an emotional element that didnt exist 
prior to aug 2 when iraq invaded kuwait mulhall said 
the coalition conley said will sponsor briefings for 
journalists officials and business and consumer organizations 
the coalition will not lobby congress although individual 
members will do so on their own he said 
the groups message will be that proposals such as bryans would 
have a significant impact on americans lifestyles automakers say 
they cannot meet his requirements without reducing car weight so 
drastically that only the smallest vehicles can be sold a 
contention bryan and environmentalists deny

michael l williams vigorous prosecutions of 
ku klux klansmen and other racialterrorism cases during the 1980s 
won him awards at the justice department 
but his assertion last week that colleges receiving federal 
funds cant legally reserve scholarships for minority students 
found little favor with his bosses in the bush administration much 
less the civil rights community 
williams 37 an assistant secretary of education softened his 
position in accordance with white house wishes tuesday and said 
universities still could offer minorityonly scholarships with 
private money designated for that purpose 
his policy declaration a week ago had startled some civil rights 
leaders who had come from earlier meetings impressed by williams 
and his record there was uniform disappointment at what happened 
last week said ralph neas executive director of the 200member 
leadership conference on civil rights 
williams 37 is a midland texas native and childhood friend of 
president bushs son george his parents and his wife who is a 
pilot and mechanical engineer all attended historically black 
colleges while studying at the university of southern california 
he challenged the school to admit more blacks by weighing 
socioeconomic factors as well as test scores 
his resume is nearperfect hes got three degrees from usc a 
law degree a ba and a masters in public administration he was 
once a big brother now he is a reading tutor at a local elementary 
school 
and as a justice department trial attorney from 1984 to 1988 he 
prosecuted an array of highprofile cases north carolina klansmen 
who conspired to obtain stolen military weapons an idaho white 
supremacist who tried to drive black and interracial families from 
their homes a kentucky klansman who firebombed the home of a black 
family and law enforcement officers in alabama arizona north 
carolina and oklahoma who assaulted private citizens 
he went after them with a vengeance and was very successful 
said william bradford reynolds who was assistant attorney general 
for civil rights from 1981 to 1988 he was a very savvy lawyer a 
thoughtful levelheaded kind of guy who learned very quickly and 
did exceptionally well 
personally williams is described as having texas charm and a 
sense of humor worthy of eddie murphy he wears lizard cowboy boots 
and likes to collect things including baseball caps and a plate 
from each state in which hes had a trial 
politically williams served as a domestic policy adviser to the 
bushquayle campaign in 1988 
neas said the scholarship controversy fits into a bush and 
reagan administration pattern of construing civil rights statutes 
so narrowly that they in effect strangle the life out of them 
but reynolds said williams was simply going after 
discrimination he was concerned that scholarships exclusive to 
one race are discriminatory you cant really argue with that 
proposition 
williams owned up tuesday to being politically naive but not to 
being wrong i havent been a lackey for anyone he said the 
position i took was a position i took because i thought it was 
right

bank and thrift regulators in separate 
actions took steps tuesday aimed toward protecting taxpayers from 
paying for financial institutions risky investments 
the office of thrift supervision which regulates 2389 savings 
and loans proposed a rule that would require the stockholders of 
an institution gambling on interestrate changes to put more of 
their own capital behind the institutions investments 
sampls with more capital are better able to absorb losses and 
avoid failure thus avoiding a bailout paid for by the governments 
deposit insurance program 
since november 1989 sampls have been required to hold more 
capital against loans and other investments with a higher risk of 
default and a similar riskbased system takes effect for banks on 
jan 1 
however tuesdays proposal is the first by a financial 
regulator to link capital levels to the danger posed by 
interestrate swings 
meanwhile the board of the federal deposit insurance corp 
voted 50 on tuesday to ask congress for the power to tie deposit 
insurance premiums to risk 
currently all banks and sampls pay the same premium no matter 
how risky their operations banks starting jan 1 will pay 195 
cents per 100 of deposits up from 12 cents this year sampls have 
and will be paying 23 cents 
critics contend this unfairly forces sound institutions to 
subsidize highfliers other kinds of insurance give breaks to 
better customers safe drivers for instance pay less for auto 
insurance and nonsmokers pay less for life insurance 
a study prepared by the fdic for congress recommends exploration 
of two approaches for varying premiums one would charge lower 
premiums to banks and sampls that hold a larger capital cushion the 
theory is that institutions willing to risk more of their owners 
money before failure should pay less for their insurance much as a 
homeowner willing to pay a larger deductible should pay less for 
theft insurance 
another approach outlined by the study is having private 
insurance firms set premiums based on the principal of market 
competition under that concept the fdic would use government 
funds to directly cover 90 percent of a banks deposits it would 
purchase coverage from private firms for the remaining 10 percent 
and set the premium paid by the bank according to the best rate it 
could get from private firms 
the treasury department which has been working closely with the 
fdic is likely to include one of the riskbased deposit insurance 
schemes in a proposal it plans to release next month calling for 
the most dramatic overhaul of the banking system since the 
depression 
small banks represented by the independent bankers association 
of america generally favor the insurance plan linked to capital 
since most small banks have a proportionately more capital than 
large banks the smaller banks fear that private insurance would 
not be available to banks too small to be publicly rated 
the thrift offices proposal on riskbased capital would force 
banks to raise their capital by half of the amount it would lose in 
the event of a 2 percentage point swing in interest rates for 
instance an sampl that would lose 10 million from such a swing 
would have to hold 5 million more in capital than an sampl not 
subject to that risk 
fixedrate loans and bonds held by sampls generally lose value 
when interest rates rise at the same time the institutions have 
to pay more for their deposits 
this is the latest in a series of steps taken to see that 
thrifts safely manage their interestrate risk said thrift 
office director timothy ryan 
the agency noted that in the early 1980s when interest rates 
soared most sampl losses were caused by rising interest rates not 
as is the case now by defaulting loans 
the agency is accepting written comments on the proposal for 60 
days it plans public hearings on jan 31 in washington and feb 14 
in san francisco

the defense department on tuesday said it may 
cancel as early as january its 48 billion contract for 
development of a stealth warplane for the navy 
the department notified the developers mcdonnell douglas corp 
and general dynamics corp that they will be held in default of 
the contract terms unless they present a new plan for resolving the 
projects problems by jan 2 
the announcement was the latest sign of serious trouble for the 
navys proposed a12 avenger aircraft a deepstrike bomber with 
radarevading capabilities it is meant to be the services main 
carrierbased attack plane for the early 21st century the navy 
plans to buy 620 of the planes for about 50 billion 
the pentagons action also is a further blow for mcdonnell 
douglas and general dynamics published reports tuesday said a 
pentagon audit of a12 contract payments found that the government 
had overpaid the companies by hundreds of millions of dollars 
the st louis postdispatch and the los angeles times also 
reported that a separate pentagon audit concluded that the a12 
contractors have a possible chance of bankruptcy 
al spivak a general dynamics spokesman in washington said we 
dont agree with the audits findings mcdonnell douglas also 
contested the results 
spivak also took issue with the pentagon declaration that the 
a12 contractors could be found in default 
there is no way we can be considered in default of the 
contract spivak said in our view the contract itself is the 
major problem and we hope that it will be restructured so that the 
program can continue effectively 
mcdonnell douglas issued a statement in the name of its chairman 
and chief executive officer john f mcdonnell which said we 
believe that we are not in default and we are having discussions 
with the navy and office of the secretary of defense to try to 
assure the continuation of this vital national defense program on a 
mutually satisfactory basis 
just eight months ago defense secretary dick cheney assured 
congress that the a12 project was on schedule and within its 
thenclassified budget a pentagon inspector generals report 
released earlier this month said cheney was not aware of the 
projects serious problems because senior navy and pentagon 
officials failed to pass on information that clearly showed the 
contractors to be far behind schedule 
last friday cheney told navy secretary h lawrence garrett that 
he would order a halt to the project unless garrett could show 
cause by jan 4 why it should proceed 
in tuesdays announcement spokesman pete williams said the 
pentagon formally declared the performance of the two st 
louisbased contractors to be unsatisfactory that gives the 
pentagon the legal basis for declaring the contractors in default 
in the event that their jan 2 proposals are judged inadequate 
everything about the a12 is on hold williams told 
reporters 
the project is at least 1 billion over cost and at least 18 
months behind schedule among the chief technical problems is 
excess plane weight due to the thickness of the construction 
material needed to make the plane strong enough for carrier 
landings according to a navy report released earlier this month 
williams said he could not immediately explain the financial 
consequences of a default declaration 
williams also disclosed that the pentagons no 2 procurement 
officer donald yockey and the navys assistant secretary for 
procurement gerald cann met with unidentified representatives of 
mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics today 
williams said he could provide no information about the 
discussions or the meetings results spivak of general dynamics 
also declined to comment on the meeting

new evidence casts doubt on part of the case 
against john demjanjuk the ohio man convicted of running a nazi 
gas chamber as ivan the terrible and now appealing an israeli 
death sentence the congressman who took up his cause said tuesday 
rep james traficant dohio said they are holding the wrong 
man 
traficant said he believes he can prove ivan marczenko was the 
real name of ivan the terrible and not an alias used by demjanjuk 
as israeli prosecutors claimed in court 2 years ago 
a newly discovered marriage certificate of demjanjuks parents 
helps prove that marczenko and demjanjuk were different people by 
refuting the prosecution contention that demjanjuk took the alias 
marczenko because it was his mothers maiden name the congressman 
said 
demjanjuk who was born in the ukraine had been unable to argue 
that point in court because he did not remember his mothers birth 
name traficant said the certificate shows her name before 
marriage was iulianiya tabachyk 
the congressman said he wants to collect enough evidence to 
force israels supreme court to discount the testimony of witnesses 
who said demjanjuk and ivan the terrible are the same man who ran a 
gas chamber at the treblinka death camp in poland where 850000 
jews were slaughtered 
traficant said he hopes the court will consider statements from 
marczenkos former driver and a woman who told a bbc interviewer 
she was compelled to have sex with marczenko 
both have said demjanjuk doesnt resemble marczenko according 
to traficant

awakenings is a feel good movie it wants to make you 
laugh it wants to make you cry it wants to make you feel good 
about yourself although nothing could match the selfsatisfaction 
of the filmmakers themselves 
the movie is based on dr oliver sacks book about 
postencephalitic syndrome a neurological disorder that left 
victims trancelike virtually immobile for decades the syndrome 
was a result of an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica or viral 
sleeping sickness that occurred from 191727 
the illness was considered incurable until the late 1960s when 
a miracle drug ldopa was discovered sacks working at mount 
carmel hospital in the new york city borough of the bronx tried 
the drug on his patients in the summer of 1969 
the results were truly a miracle within days many of them 
were up and about walking and talking touching and smelling 
functions most people take for granted without condescension or 
pity sacks wrote of their sheer awe and gratitude for having 
another chance there is nothing alive which is not individual 
our health is ours our diseases are ours our reactions are ours 
 
but the downside was just as strong some patients were 
horrified to learn they had slept for so many years gasping as 
they looked in the mirror and saw their nowelderly faces one 
woman who had been ill for more than 40 years awoke believing it 
was still 1926 
soon side effects set in patients developed severe tics or 
experienced drastic mood swings some regressed to their earlier 
conditions and died others lived somewhat better than they had 
before the emergence of the drug but never as well as they had 
that first summer 
the cases of many of those patients are effectively reenacted 
in awakenings notably leonard l as played by robert de 
niro 
unfortunately the simple truths about illness and aging are not 
enough for director penny marshall big and screenwriter steve 
zaillian the falcon and the snowman 
they slap on a contrived love story and good vs evil melodrama 
using stereotypes straight out of daytime soap operas the kindly 
doctor robin williams the lonely nurse julie kavner and the 
unfeeling bureaucrat john heard 
they recruit the worlds nicest hospital staff and arouse 
leonards interest with a girl sweet enough to live up to the name 
of the actress who portrays her penelope ann miller the story is 
built for applause such as when heard insists there is no money 
for the drug and quickly finds a check placed in front of him by 
the evernoble kavner 
heartwarming may have worked for big but applied to 
awakenings it turns a dignified moving story into a jerry 
lewis telethon mercifully its much shorter 
produced by walter f parkes and lawrence lasker with marshall 
arne schmidt and elliot abbott as executive producers the columbia 
pictures release is rated pg13 running time 120 minutes

israels plan to deport four more 
palestinians has pushed the united states into cosponsoring a 
security council resolution criticizing the jewish state diplomats 
said tuesday 
israels action gives the united states a way out of a 
diplomatic dilemma for weeks washington has tried to avoid 
vetoing another antiisrael resolution a move that could alienate 
arab allies arrayed against iraq 
that resolution contains an endorsement of an eventual middle 
east peace conference which washington fears could be seen as a 
concession to iraq 
iraqi president saddam hussein says he will discuss iraqs 
withdrawal from kuwait only in the context of a comprehensive 
middle east peace conference that would include discussing israels 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
a us draft resolution would lift the issue from the resolution 
itself and relegate endorsement of a peace conference to a 
separate nonbinding statement by the security council president 
the statement would also say anew that the persian gulf crisis 
and the mideast peace conference are entirely separate issues and 
must not be linked the diplomats said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
it would have the council deplore israels resumption of 
deportations of palestinians as violating the fourth geneva 
convention of 1949 on the treatment of civilians under military 
occupation 
israel which signed the convention holds the charter bans only 
mass expulsions the conventions exact words however are that 
individual or mass forcible transfers are prohibited 
for palestinians mindful that 700000 of their people fled or 
were driven from their homes when the state of israel was created 
in 1948 deportation is the worst punishment 
the four men ordered deported are all from the occupied gaza 
strip 
on tuesday a military panel heard their appeal and the case 
could go to the supreme court but israeli courts have never 
overturned deportation orders israel has deported 60 residents of 
the west bank and gaza during the 3yearold palestinian uprising 
it stopped the practice in august 1989 reportedly under us 
pressure 
israel and america are major allies and israel is the largest 
recipient of us foreign aid 
the resolution now favored by washington would define parts of 
jerusalem as under military occupation although israel claims all 
of jerusalem as its capital after capturing arab east jerusalem 
from jordan in the 1967 arabisraeli war and subsequently annexing 
it classifying east jerusalem as occupied raises questions 
about its status 
council president abdalla saleh alashtal of yemen said the 
council would meet again on the occupied territories issue on 
wednesday 
he said he was not sure if it would take up the usfavored 
draft or the tougher draft sponsored by cuba yemen colombia and 
malaysia

a northern california county tuesday 
became the first in the nation to approve a law banning unlicensed 
pet breeding to reduce the number of unwanted animals killed each 
week 
san mateo county supervisors approved the ban on a 31 vote 
while a group of citizens protested outside with their dogs 
carrying signs that read sniff out the truth and dont hound 
responsible dog owners 
the intent was never to go after any group of people but to 
rectify an untenable situation in which we kill 10000 pets a 
year supervisor tom nolan said after the vote were entering 
a new territory 
nolan said he hoped the measure which he wrote would inspire 
other jurisdictions to approve similar laws 
the breeding ban was initiated by the peninsula humane society

cholesterolreducing drugs can help unclog 
womens coronary arteries and reduce the risk of heart attacks 
just as the treatment does for men a new study showed 
the study is the first to document the reversal of 
atherosclerosis in women through the use of the drugs researchers 
said 
critics have pointed out that no previous studies have 
provided data on the response of atherosclerotic disease in women 
to bloodcholesterol lowering therapy study author dr john p 
kane wrote in wednesdays journal of the american medical 
association 
cholesterol kills by clogging the blood vessels that feed the 
heart with lesions a combination of cholesterol deposits and scar 
tissue previous studies have shown that lowering blood cholesterol 
levels can reduce coronary artery lesions in men 
in their study over several years authors looked at 41 women 
and 31 men with atherosclerosis 
subjects took bile acidbinding resin and niacin daily which 
along with dietary changes reduced their bloodcholesterol levels 
an average of 381 percent 
after 26 months coronary artery lesions shrank just more than 2 
percent among the 22 women enrolled in the treatment lesions 
diminished under the treatment program at about the same rate as 
they originally developed 
the 19 women in the control group whose blood cholesterol 
levels were reduced about 106 percent through diet changes and 
lessintensive drug treatments showed just more than a 1 percent 
increase in coronary artery lesions the study said 
there are lots of other risk factors besides cholesterol but 
one of the most important risk factors is high cholesterol and 
reversal of atherosclerosis can reduce the chances of a heart 
attack said dr mary malloy coauthor of the study 
the treatments effect on men in the study showed the same 
trends but did not result in a statistically significant 
difference among men the study concluded 
kane is a professor of medicine and biochemistry at the 
university of california at san francisco 
earlier studies concentrated on men because coronary diseases 
occur much more frequently in males between 40 and 60 years old 
than in women said dr david blankenhorn of the university of 
southern california 
blankenhorn said doctors use the same medicines in women as in 
men but theyre less likely to prescribe cholesterolreducing 
medicines in women because the evidence wasnt in regarding what 
would happen 
women who havent undergone menopause also get some protection 
because the level of estrogen in their bodies slows the formation 
of coronary artery lesions malloy said 
because of the effects of estrogen researchers have been slow 
to show that coronary artery lesions can be reduced in women said 
one critic university of wisconsin nutritionist laura vailas 
we do know regression of atherosclerosis can be shown in men 
and i think weve been complacent in showing it in women women do 
suffer risks just as men do ms vailas said

a fire that swept through a neighborhood of 
threefamily houses last week displacing more than 100 people was 
arson fire officials said tuesday 
the conclusion was based on witness statements fire scene 
examination and analysis of physical materials taken from the 
scene said cpl dennis galvin of the state fire marshals 
office 
chemical analysis was still under way to determine the exact 
substance used to start the fire in a vacant building early friday

neighboring buildings and homes a block away it destroyed or 
damaged 11 buildings burning 132 people out of their homes

leading to an arrest in the case 
several leads are being followed but the investigation is not 
focused on any specific suspect at this time galvin said we 
are appealing to the public for assistance and we would like to

two months after the county vowed 
that nevadas most notorious legal bordello had seen its last 
prostitute and a month after it was sold at auction the mustang 
ranch prepared for business tuesday 
we reopened this morning former owner joe conforte said 
we could have opened the day the irs left 
conforte who now is listed as general manager rather than owner 
of the brothel 10 miles east of reno appeared before the storey 
county commissioners as a courtesy 
i didnt have to show up here at all he said im not 
here to ask for a license im here as a common courtesy to this 
board to tell you how it is 
conforte claimed that even though the internal revenue service 
padlocked the 104room brothel in september and sold it two months 
later to recoup some 13 million in taxes owed by him and his wife 
sally his license to operate the business remained in effect 
storey county sheriff bob del carlo said although prostitutes 
began moving back into the brothel during the morning no business 
would transpire until health cards administered through his office 
were issued 
a few weeks after the irs seizure the county commission agreed 
to cancel the special permit that allowed the mustang ranch to 
operate as a brothel because of the circus atmosphere surrounding 
it 
but at least two commissioners earlier this month said they 
would reconsider that action after county revenues lost the 60000 
annual license fee and the 2 percent tax from each of the mustangs 
occupied rooms 
conforte said he paid the county 16500 for his quarterly 
license fee two weeks ago including a 10 percent late fee 
while the commission debated whether it could accept confortes 
quarterly payment for his licenses at the mustang bridge ranch and 
the adjoining triangle river ranch both part of the mustang ranch 
compound conforte sweetened his offer for them and a third small 
operation run by his nephew 
we would like to make a proposal that the license fees for all 
three places whether theyre open or not be raised to 35000 if 
and when the dust settles that would provide 105000 to the 
county 
the county commission took no action 
peter perry confortes lawyer said because of building code 
deficiencies only the smaller triangle river ranch part of the 
mustang ranch compound will resume operations 
perry happens to be listed with the nevada secretary of states 
office as the sole officer of the ranchs new owner mustang 
properties inc 
the mustang closed sept 18 when it entered chapter 7 
liquidation 
bankruptcy trustees spent three days trying to reopen the 
bordello to sell it for the taxes owed by the confortes but the 
irs seized and padlocked the property sept 21 
the brothel and its contents were sold at a tax auction in mid 
november with victor perry the successful bidder on the brothel 
buildings and about 400 acres of land at 149 million on behalf of 
mustang properties inc the company where his brother peter is 
the only listed officer 
although he appeared with conforte at the commission meeting 
peter perry refused to answer questions about investors 
peter perry was a member of a group of attorneys and investors 
known as mustang ranch inc which relinquished its corporate 
status after twice failing to buy the property through public stock 
offerings of nearly 20 million then 10 million 
peter perry filed his incorporation papers the middle of august

in an escalating war of words 
president fw de klerk lashed out at the african national congress 
and other opposition groups tuesday for fanning the flames of 
confrontation 
the speech was likely to increase tensions between the 
government and anc coming two days after the antiapartheid group 
closed a conference by endorsing the continuation of mass protests 
economic sanctions and other hardline stances 
it also threatened to break off talks with the government unless 
it meets several key demands by april 30 
de klerks televised christmas message was moved up a week to 
respond to the anc whose leaders include nelson mandela 
the time has come for the anc to decide what they want de 
klerk said are they prepared for peaceful and negotiated 
solutions or do they want to revert to the confrontation and 
conflict of the past 
the anc had little response to the speech 
spokeswoman gill marcus said the group has taken note of the 
points raised by de klerk and would clarify its position on 
various issues if the government so desired 
at the conference the anc also demanded the return of exiles 
the release of political prisoners an end of political trials 
and the scrapping of security laws de klerk has agreed in 
principle to most of the demands 
de klerk said his reforms have opened the door for grievances to 
be discussed democratically and there can no longer be any 
excuse for political violence and intimidation 
some movements are still caught up in these undemocratic and 
unacceptable strategies he said 
the anc was the only group de klerk mentioned by name but he 
clearly referred to the militant pan africanist congress when he 
said slogans such as one settler one bullet are 
absolutely unacceptable 
the slogan referring to white descendants of the dutch 
settlers is chanted at pan africanist rallies 
de klerks harshest criticism was reserved for the anc which 
has been holding talks with the government over the past year 
intended to clear obstacles to fullscale negotiations on a new 
constitution 
it is disappointing that at its recent conference the anc 
appeared to have reverted to outdated rhetoric and policies that 
form the flames of confrontation de klerk said 
they continued to talk of the transfer of power while they 
know that the purpose of the proposed negotiations is to determine 
how power should be shared and domination avoided he said 
de klerk has pledged to dismantle apartheid and give political 
rights to blacks who outnumber whites 30 million to 5 million in 
south africa but he opposes a simple oneman onevote system 
saying it would replace white domination with black domination 
the president said the anc had refused to acknowledge that any 
fundamental changes had taken place in south africa this despite 
the fact that for the first time in 30 years they could hold a 
conference within the republic 
earlier tuesday de klerk formally offered amnesty to thousands 
of south africans who left the country illegally when the anc and 
other opposition groups were banned 
according to the offer citizens who fled the country illegally 
before oct 8 may return to the country without fear of 
prosecution 
the offer will clear the way for the return of most of the 
20000 anc exiles 
however anc members who took part in the groups bombing and 
sabotage campaign and will have to request amnesty for violence and 
other acts that could be prosecuted as crimes 
those cases will be judged individually the justice department 
said 
the amnesty offer applies to exiles from other smaller 
opposition groups and people not associated with any particular 
political movements

president mikhail s gorbachev on tuesday defended 
his need for more power to hold the soviet union together by saying 
he could have been the strongest dictator in the world 
in an emotional 45minute chat with reporters in a kremlin 
lobby gorbachev also gave a rare glimpse of his inner thoughts 
about the suffering endured by his father and grandfather 
if the nation forgets its past we should be swept away to 
hell he said during a break on the second day of the congress of 
peoples deputies parliamentary session 
the soviet leader spoke about the fragmentation of the soviet 
union saying national authority was being dragged apart piece by 
piece by the republics and at local levels 
the chain is broken electricity stops flowing down the wire 
and the executive power is stalled even if a decision is made 
its killed 
that is why gorbachev said he has raised the issue of greater 
presidential power 
it doesnt mean a return to dictatorship everyone knows that 
i am not going to be a dictator gorbachev said 
i could have become a dictator the power of the general 
secretary was such as no one else had in the world none of the 
pinochets he said referring to chiles former military leader 
gen augusto pinochet and similar strongmen 
he indicated that any decision to seize such absolute power 
would not be an easy one for him 
i made my choice if a dictatorship were to come the greatest 
drama would be mine i cant step on my own throat gorbachev 
said 
he said he was trying to unfold presidential power 
gradually so as not to destroy democracy itself 
gorbachev said the country was on the brink of chaos 
if anyone thinks i cannot see this i do see this 
gorbachev later became emotional when talking about the need to 
remember the suffering and hard work of past generations 
in a new book about gorbachev author gail sheehy writes that 
his paternal grandfather andrei was sent to a labor camp during 
the stalinist terror of the 1930s gorbachevs father sergei was 
wounded on the ukrainian front during world war ii 
gorbachev recalled the life of my family was full of 
injustices but when my grandfather returned after 193839 we once 
sat an entire day and wept when he told us what they had done to 
him he worked for established collective farms headed them 
and can i go against it 
and my father he fought near kursk on the dnieper and was 
badly wounded it undermined his health 
are we going to announce that we didnt live then he said 
his voice rising with emotion we should be swept away to hell if 
we do 
asked about the personal attacks against him by other political 
leaders gorbachev said i am not hurt by criticism 
but i must tell you that even i a person who likes satire and 
humor its my weakness i can see how badly we lack cultured 
criticism 
sometimes i am ashamed but i always think need i defend 
myself let society defend me society will eventually understand 
that lack of respect to the president and authorities who were 
elected democratically means disrespect to the people

the yugoslav presidency on tuesday 
termed unacceptable slovenian plans for a weekend referendum on 
independence and instructed the federal government to take steps to 
preserve national unity 
the collective federal presidency did not specify the steps to 
be taken 
the presidency of slovenia the northernmost of this balkan 
countrys six republics denounced the statement and said the 
federal presidency once again has shown that a democratic way of 
resolving the yugoslav crisis and relations among its peoples is 
alien to it tanjug news agency reported 
slovenes will give an adequate reply to such a behavior and 
pressures at the plebiscite it said 
the dec 23 referendum on full independence for slovenia runs 
counter to federal plans for this diverse country about 241 
million people to settle its worsening political and ethnic 
quarrels in a peaceful way tanjug said 
the state presidency a collective eightmember body including 
one representative from each of the six republics and two provinces 
serves as supreme commander of the armed forces 
defense minister gen veljko kadijevic created a stir this month 
when he suggested the army might intervene directly to preserve the 
federation 
earlier tuesday the influential constitutional commission of 
yugoslavias parliament appealed for a peaceful negotiated 
solution to the power struggle between different republics 
it said parliament should meet dec 27 to discuss how the 
country could stay united while the six republics work out 
yugoslavias future an agreement should be ratified by mid1991 
after elections for a federal parliament it said 
fear of an imminent breakup or of an armed struggle has grown 
since serbias president slobodan milosevic and his former 
communists resoundingly won the first round of the republics free 
elections dec 9 
the us central intelligence agency recently predicted 
yugoslavia may disintegrate within 18 months and civil war could 
break out 
the second round of elections sunday in serbia and procommunist 
montenegro coincides with slovenias scheduled vote on whether 
slovenia becomes fully independent 
croatia and slovenia where centerright parties ousted 
communists in spring elections have threatened to secede serbia 
and montenegro favor a strong federal government 
slovenias senior leaders on tuesday told a news conference in 
their capital of ljubljana the plebiscite does not mean 
secession tanjug said 
it said president milan kucan prime minister lojze peterle and 
the chief of parliament franc bucar assured reporters nothing 
earthshaking or undemocratic would happen after the referendum 
opinion polls have suggested slovenians will vote overwhelmingly 
for independence but the plebiscite is seen as a lastditch effort 
to get other republics to agree to a new loose confederation 
rather than a step toward immediate secession 
the presidency acknowledges that each republic has a 
constitutional right to secede but only after consultations with 
the other five republics 
it said that implementing the principle of selfdetermination 
of the people without going by regulations set out by the 
constitution and the law is unacceptable 
slovenias plans crudely reject and practically thwart the 
initiative launched by the presidency of yugoslavia to rearrange 
yugoslavia in a peaceful democratic legal manner based 
on the constitution it said 
the presidency decides by majority vote and never announces 
whether there are dissenting votes 
the other two republics are bosnia and herezegovina and 
macedonia

the interstate commerce commission voted 
unanimously tuesday to ban smoking on all regularly scheduled 
interstate buses in the united states 
bus companies were given the option of allowing charter 
passengers to smoke if the chartering group agrees it should be 
permitted 
the ban will take effect soon after the issuance of the 
commissions decision in writing and its publication in the federal 
register according to icc spokesman a dennis watson 
lawyers for the icc said the change was supported by a wide 
variety of groups but was opposed by the tobacco industry 
john banzhaf executive director of action on smoking and 
health the organization whose request initiated the icc action 
praised the decision 
smokers can refrain from smoking for several hours and light 
up at bus stops but nonsmokers cannot similarly refrain from 
breathing banzhaf said 
the icc lawyers contended that smoking has been proved to be 
injurious to health and that tobacco smoke cannot be adequately 
ventilated from buses to assure the health and comfort of 
nonsmokers 
the commission began its consideration of a smoking ban last 
march at the request of the american bus association and united bus 
owners of america the national trade associations for the 
intercity bus business 
in april action on smoking and health ash an antismoking 
association filed a similar request but asked that it be imposed 
on all buses including charters 
officials for the bus industry contended that operators of 
charter buses should be permitted to regulate smoking based on 
their passengers desires 
the commission lawyers said officials of the nations charter 
bus industry said they feared some business would be lost i they 
were compelled to enforce a uniform nonsmoking ban 
the icc nosmoking rule affects passengers served by about 300 
bus companies that provide service on interstate routes in 1990 
these companies are expected to serve some 24 million passengers 
greyhound the nations largest bus company banned smoking on 
its own initiative shortly after the icc began considering the 
issue 
as the regulatory process unfolded this year ash contended that 
bus passengers are entitled to the same protection from tobacco 
smoke in the air as those who travel by plane and train 
it noted that amtrak recently banned smoking in the last four 
rows of its superliner lounge cars and in most of its train 
stations there are still smoking cars on trains 
smoking is banned on almost all domestic airline flights the 
only exceptions are flights to alaska and hawaii each lasting more 
than six hours overseas flights are not affected 
ash said that a recent study of air quality in airline passenger 
cabins showed that as many as 440 nonsmokers a year would die of 
cancer if smokers were to continue to light up aboard flights 
lasting two hours or longer 
the antismoking group said bus passengers would be at even 
higher risk if smoking were to continue 
it said the smaller seating capacity of buses forces nonsmoking 
passengers to be seated closer to smokers than on planes it also 
said ventilation on buses often is inferior to that on airplanes 
and it said buses are often the only affordable means of 
longdistance transportation for the poor and elderly 
the bus trade associations also cited the health issue but they 
contended a clear federal prohibition would also eliminate any 
misunderstanding in the effort of individual bus companies to 
enforce limitations on smoking 
they said the current rule limiting smoking to no more than 30 
percent of bus seats is hard to enforce and that efforts by some 
companies to ban smoking could place them at a disadvantage if 
competitors advertised that smoking was permitted 
the tobacco industry contended that health hazards posed to 
nonsmokers on interstate buses are not proved

the czechoslovak embassy in 
washington will stop representing cuban diplomatic interests in the 
united states by march the state ctk news agency reported tuesday 
ctk quoted the foreign ministry as saying the grace period 
should permit havana to cope with the new situation without 
jeopardizing its interests in the usa 
the czechoslovak embassy has represented cuban interests in 
washington since 1977 diplomatic and consular ties between cuba 
and the united states were severed in january 1961 
interests sections enable countries to maintain diplomatic 
contact without having to have fullfledged embassies 
a senior cuban diplomatic official in washington speaking on 
condition he not be identified said the cuban government has no 
alternate plan in mind at present to replace the current 
arrangement with the czechoslovak government 
he said he assumes both the cuban and us governments wish to 
maintain a diplomatic presence in each others capital and that 
cuba will seek a new arrangement 
the official said he had seen news reports about pragues 
decision but had heard nothing officially 
us diplomatic activities in havana have been carried out under 
the auspices of the swiss embassy one diplomatic source suggested 
that cuba may ask the swiss to perform that function for cuba in 
washington 
the source spoke on condition of anonymity 
the news agency quoted an unidentified foreign ministry source 
as saying that the different opinions of the two countries on the 
exercising of human rights and other fundamental differences 
prompted the czechoslovak decision 
czechoslovakia has become a democracy following the revolution 
that toppled the communist leadership one year ago cuba remains 
communistruled 
the ministry source suggested that deteriorating relations after 
czechoslovakia embraced democracy contributed to pragues decision 
ctk said 
he singled out the storming of czechoslovak embassy premises in 
havana in july by cubans who claimed they were dissidents but who 
the czechoslovaks believe were in the pay of the cuban government 
the invasion of the embassy can be rightfully presumed to have 
been intended to discredit the new czechoslovak regime in the eyes 
of the cuban public ctk quoted the source as saying 
efforts to contact the czechoslovak embassy in washington by 
telephone were unavailing

researchers who studied disasters and terrorist 
crimes said tuesday that rescue workers can be as emotionally 
affected as survivors and relatives and need careful counseling 
police officers ambulance workers and firefighters have quit 
their jobs because nobody talked to them about the mental strain 
speakers told 700 delegates at a london conference of the british 
psychological society 
margaret mitchell psychology lecturer at glasgow university 
said we need to learn how rescuers can finally put these 
traumatic experiences behind them and continue to operate 
effectively in their jobs 
britain suffered a dozen disasters that claimed 1000 lives 
within four years in the 1980s including 150 deaths in two soccer 
stadiums 188 on a capsized english channel ferry and 167 in a 
north sea oil platform explosion 
some rescuers involved also went abroad to help after 
earthquakes in armenia iran and the philippines 
on tuesday four london firemen who fought the 1987 kings cross 
subway station fire in which 31 people died were awarded a total of 
66000 in damages for injuries that were almost exclusively 
psychological 
the claim was settled out of court and the men became the first 
members of the emergency services to receive compensation for such 
injuries 
the psychologists meeting was held three days before the second 
anniversary of the bombing of pan am flight 103 which killed all 
259 people on the airliner and 11 others on the ground in 
lockerbie scotland 
mre than 2000 police from strathclyde scottish region were 
sent to lockerbie so that only limited psychological debriefing 
could be carried out said ms mitchell who studied police 
officers working in the lockerbie morgue 
many of them still think about what they saw and some of them 
say they could have got over the stress if there had been 
structured debriefing after each days work but that wasnt 
possible 
there is often a feeling of alienation among the rescue 
services who have seen things that others cannot imagine 
dr david duckworth a leeds university consultant psychologist 
to three police forces said he knew of officers so affected by 
horrors they saw that they were physically sick in the mornings 
before going to work 
the effects of disaster on rescue workers can be as traumatic 
as shell shock and combat fatigue in warfare and as long lasting 
said dr james thompson a psychologist at londons middlesex 
hospital who also runs a stress clinic helping disaster survivors 
in every disaster some people involved are mentally disabled 
because they are carrying such a burden thompson told a news 
conference 
all the evidence we have suggests it is helpful if those 
working on a disaster are encouraged to talk about their reactions 
and decisions with psychologists and social workers even within 
the team with someone who has done it before 
thompson added we find some people are not helped by 
counseling thats a challenge for which we are still trying to 
find the real factors and the real therapy 
he said authorities should tell relatives whatever they wanted 
to know even if the details were very painful and they should have 
a legal right to information 
they should be told everything it would help them get over 
the shock he said 
iris suzuki a medical student who studied stress among 40 
london ambulance workers said the public expects ambulance 
crews to be superhuman and act like it but deep down they react 
like any other human beings 
dr jim swire a country doctor whose daughter flora was killed 
on pan am flight 103 said a deliberate effort was made to stop 
relatives from finding out what had happened 
there were official moves to ensure that available information 
should not go to the relatives and it took a lot of pushing and 
shoving to change it he said 
swire is campaigning for flight 103 families to be told 
everything about the bombing 
he expressed disappointment that the home office which runs the 
police has not set up professional and coordinated support groups 
to help relatives in future disasters 
some people believe the right thing to do is to hide things 
from relatives but nothing can happen to a relative to compare with 
the disaster it is beneficial to relatives to talk about it 
swire said

a lawyer picked to help form a new 
government announced tuesday he quit because of significant 
differences with presidentelect lech walesa over major 
appointments 
jan olszewski 60 who was favored to become prime minister 
said his two weeks of talks settled the main principles of the 
program and tentative decisions on the future composition of the 
government 
because there were significant differences in opinion between 
the presidentelect and myself on the composition of the government 
i resigned from the mission he said in a statement read on 
the evening television news 
walesa spokesman andrzej drzycimski denied the resignation posed 
any problem in naming the next government and said walesa will 
announce his choices for main government posts by saturday 
olszewski said walesa chose him on dec 2 to hold the talks on 
forming a government walesa scored an overwhelming victory in a 
presidential runoff dec 9 and is to be sworn in saturday

anonymity said the disagreement was over the role of finance 
minister leszek balcerowicz in a new government the source said 
she could give no details 
balcerowicz architect of polands tough economic reform 
program is considered essential to persuade western creditors that 
poland is sticking to its program to switch to a market economy

the national solidarity citizens committee and a longtime friend of 
olszewski as saying olszewskis attempt to form a government 
turned into a fiasco

considering at least three alternatives to olszewski for prime 
minister

in the government and will stress concern for the economy and 
young people 
walesa cannot officially nominate a prime minister before he is 
sworn in in the meantime prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and 
his cabinet stay on in caretaker roles following their resignations

fewer than onehalf percent of more than 
120000 recent drug tests in the aviation industry showed the 
presence of drugs the federal aviation administration said 
tuesday 
the tests were conducted among commercial aviation employees 
ranging from pilots to airport security screening personnel as well 
as people applying for such safety or security sensitive jobs the 
faa said 
an analysis of the 120642 tests showed drugs in 561 just 047 
percent of the total the faa said of the 51 345 were in 
preemployment tests and those people were not hired for sensitive 
jobs 
persons already employed who tested positive were removed from 
sensitive positions the agency said 
these statistics indicated that drug use in aviation is not 
widespread but even one drug user is too many and will not be 
tolerated said james b busey the faa administrator 
robert j aaronson president of the air transport association 
the trade association for commercial us airlines said the 
industry was pleased by what he called these exceptional 
results 
while employee drug use remains a concern of the airlines 
these results show we have an effective program for screening out 
drug users before they enter the industry and turning up users 
already employed aaronson said 
the results also indicate that the major airlines have far 
far less of a drug problem than our society at large where one in 
10 people use illegal drugs according to government estimates 
he said 
john mazor spokesman for the air line pilots association said 
the analysis bore out what we have been saying all along that 
they were not going to find any significant amount of drug abuse by 
airline pilots 
we would hope that the government and industry would refocus 
their efforts away from heavyhanded methods mazor said 
aaronson said that 90 percent of employees testing positive have 
resigned with those remaining entering rehabilitation programs 
the drug tests were conducted between january and the end of 
june 
they were required under a new department of transportation 
antidrug program initiated last year 
under the program 32 million other transportation workers also 
will be subjected to drug testing they include interstate truck 
and bus drivers railroad workers sailors on commercial vessels 
and pipeline workers 
some 538000 aviation industry employees are subject to drug 
testing before employment at random or periodically on the job 
after accidents and whenever there is reasonable cause to suspect 
drug abuse 
included are pilots mechanics flight attendants airport 
security screening personnel and aircraft dispatchers 
a breakdown of the test results that showed drug use among both 
applicants and employees revealed 18 pilots or other flight crew 
members 116 flight attendants 300 maintenance personnel 48 
aircraft dispatchers 41 security personnel five flight 
instructors and four private air traffic control personnel 
twentynine persons were not identified by job function 
of the positive tests 346 were attributed to marijuana use 196 
to cocaine 13 to opiates one to the use of pcp and 15 to 
amphetamine use those numbers add to more than 561 because of 
multiple drug use by some people tested

the youngest of three brothers who 
allegedly help run the medellin cocaine cartel surrendered tuesday 
under a govenment offer not to extradite drug trafficking 
suspects officials said 
fabio ochoa vasquez became the first cartel leader to turn 
himself in under the 3monthold offer which also promises 
reduced jail sentences for drug suspects who surrender and confess 
the us extradition request for ochoa alleges he led the 
cartels cocaine distribution center in miami he is also accused 
of participating in the 1986 murder of adler barry seal a us 
drug enforcement administration informant whose testimony helped 
indict several leading traffickers 
the government is very satisfied that decree 2047 is having 
all the effects it should have in colombian life president cesar 
gaviria said speaking over the caracol radio network after the 
surrender was announced 
justice minister jaime giraldo confirmed the surrender and said 
we hope that they all turn themselves in 
in the past month four midlevel drug traffickers surrendered 
ochoa left a communique with family members explaining his 
decision 
i hope this contributes in the best way to peace and 
understanding in colombia ochoa said in the statement read over 
local radio 
a communique from the ochoa family said the drug lord 
surrendered to a court official at a church 12 miles south of 
medellin colombias second largest city and home base to the 
worlds most violent cocaine cartel 
ochoa will have to confess at least one of his crimes if he is 
to avoid extradition 
further legal guarantees were offered in another presidential 
decree monday including human rights safeguards for surrendering 
traffickers 
ochoa 33 has been named in three federal indictments in the 
united states and was cited by attorney general dick thornburgh as 
one of the dozen most wanted colombia drug defendants in august 
1989 
he allegedly helped run the cartel with his brothers jorge luis 
and juan david 
my brother decided to turn himself in to colombian justice 
because he believes in it said marta nieves ochoas sister 
speaking on the rcn radio station 
she added that the family plans to release a videotape of ochoa 
surrendering in caldas 
jaime cordoba human rights director at the attorney generals 
office said that rights delegates will be appointed to oversee 
ochoas case 
radio reports said ochoa was taken to a maximumsecurity prison 
near medellin 
in late november the medellin drug bosses said as many as 300 
traffickers were willing to surrender in return for government 
guarantees they will not be extradited to the united states and not 
be treated as common criminals 
ochoa was named in a 1986 federal indictment in baton rouge 
la linking him to the slaying of seal the same year he was 
indicted on drug traffickingrelated charges in miami 
in 1989 he was also named along with his brother jorge luis 
ochoa and cartel leaders pablo escobar and the late gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha in an 11count indictment in jacksonville fla 
that grew out of the successful drug trafficking prosecution of 
carlos lehder rivas 
escobar reputedly the cartel chief remains at large it was 
not clear if ochoas brothers were also preparing to surrender 
the medellin cartel has been blamed for killing 550 colombians 
since the government and traffickers declared war on each other 16 
months ago 
thousands of others have been killed in gang violence and 
scoresettling in the drug trade 
the cartel has released four of nine journalists it kidnapped 
recently 
the cartel said earlier the kidnappings were a response to 
rights abuses by police in medellin they were also apparently 
trying to pressure the gaviria administration to gant pardons

classmates because he wears a ponytail will continue his studies in 
isolation and keep up his legal battle with school officials his 
mother said tuesday 
officials say zachariah toungates 7inch ponytail violates his 
schools dress code but he and his parents claim the code 
discriminates against boys because girls are allowed to wear long 
hair 
state district judge hr towslee denied a temporary order to 
put zach back into class last month tuesday the judge gave the 
familys attorney until jan 10 to file expanded arguments telling 
how zachs isolation has harmed his mother september toungate

the temporary order

for the past 2 months mrs toungate said after the hearing her 
son is frustrated in the room but wants to keep his ponytail and 
continue the battle 
hes hanging in there she said 
school superintendent paul flemming said the issue is whether 
students must obey the rules

the question is can a school district allow a student to 
willfully and continuously disobey rules 
zach has received letters from people who support him mrs 
toungate said 
we are overwhelmed from the response from around the world 
from the persian gulf to canada to germany its truly amazing

the us economic recession probably began in 
august and will continue through the first half of 1991 a group of 
california forecasters said tuesday 
how much the economy shrinks and for how long will be 
determined more by banks and the federal reserve board than by 
saddam hussein said economists at the ucla business forecasting 
projects yearend conference 
lenders cautiousness could keep a lid on real estate and other 
industries despite actions such as the feds lowering of the key 
discount rate to 65 percent tuesday said david g hensley the 
acting director of the forecast 
even if the fed does bring rates down financial institutions 
might be so riskaverse that they will not lend money rendering 
fed policy ineffective hensley said 
construction is an important avenue of recovery from 
recessions and a shutoff of real estate lending would likely 
inhibit the vigor of the recovery he said 
the economists said current economic indicators point to a short 
downturn they estimated the core annual inflation rate at just 36 
percent in september and october and said manufacturers 
inventories have been wellmanaged 
consumption spending and business fixed investment were strong 
in the third quarter of 1990 despite a plunge in consumer 
confidence they said 
the ucla forecast generally wellregarded is also known as one 
of the gloomiest put out by californias economic forecasters 
it said californias economy is in recession along with the 
nations dragged down by aerospace industry trauma and the stalled 
housing industry 
the bleak evidence on employment housing helpwanted 
advertising and retail sales reflected in budget problems 
throughout the state strongly suggests that california will 
participate fully in the national downturn hensley said 
the forecast said the gross national product was expected to 
decline by 09 percent in 1991 with a sharp downturn in the first 
half followed by recovery later 
ucla forecasters currently assume that a diplomatic solution 
will be reached to the confrontation in the persian gulf over 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait even if war comes they feel it 
will have less effect on the economy than might be expected 
some economists have argued that war would provide a huge 
boost to the economy hensley said but considering that any 
conflict would follow the biggest military buildup in us 
peacetime history the near term stimulus is likely to be 
marginal 
he said a temporary spike in oil prices resulting from a 
shooting war would offset any possible uplifting effects on the 
economy

portauprince haiti ap supporters of the former duvalier 
dictatorship said tuesday they would fight to overturn the expected 
presidency of the rev jeanbertrand aristide using legal means 
well decide after the results are in how we are going to act 
but it wont be in a violent way said serge conille executive 
secretary of the union for national conciliation the duvalier 
political party 
two days after haitis first democratic elections the 
independent electoral council had released only a fraction of the 
vote because of difficulties communicating with remote areas 
international observers said however that aristide was a clear 
winner and a council source said on condition of anonymity that he 
agreed 
under haitian law the electoral council has 10 days from the 
election to publish the results it was expected to complete the 
count by the weeks end 
aristide 37 a leftist priest and champion of the poor has 
made no public appearances since sundays election electoral law 
prohibits candidates from declaring victory on the basis of 
projections 
with 194820 votes or about 10 percent counted aristide had 
127099 votes or 652 percent former world bank official marc 
bazin had 22320 or 115 percent agronomist louis dejoie jr 
21437 or 11 percent and evangelical preacher sylvio claude 
6044 or 31 percent seven other candidates also were in the 
race 
dejoie conceded defeat bazin made no statement but his 
sisterinlaw danielle bazin a party official said we are 
very disappointed but we are democrats if thats what the people 
want its ok 
after a day of huge victory celebrations the capital of 
portauprince returned to normal tuesday with streets and markets 
crowded as usual 
the celebrations came to an abrupt end monday when a pregnant 
woman was killed at a rally outside aristides former church in the 
slum of la saline radio reports said the woman was shot by police 
who pulled up in a pickup truck and opened fire on the crowd 
the army however said the woman had been run over by a 
vehicle police had intervened in the area and fired into the air 
to disperse demonstrators who were about to attack an unidentified 
person an army statement said 
an autopsy was scheduled on the dead woman said to have been 
seven months pregnant 
the womans death heightened fears that rightwing supporters of 
the 29year dictatorship of francois papa doc duvalier and his 
son jeanclaude baby doc would instigate violence to prevent 
aristide from taking office 
but conille said the duvalierists would use only legal means to 
overturn the election which international observers said was free 
and fair he did not elaborate 
conille is the righthand man of roger lafontant the 
selfproclaimed former leader of the hated tonton macoute militia 
that enforced the duvalier rule 
lafontant returned last summer from five years exile in 
neighboring dominican republic to run for president the electoral 
council however disqualified him on technical grounds including 
his alleged failure to produce a birth certificate and because he 
had not been cleared of financial wrongdoing when formerly in 
office as interior minister 
lafontant is fighting the ruling in the courts 
former president leslie manigat who won armycontrolled 
elections in january 1988 and was deposed by a military coup five 
months later has brought a similar case in the supreme court he 
was barred on grounds that the constitution prevents any president 
from serving two consecutive terms 
the duvalier dictatorship ended on feb 7 1986 when the 
younger duvalier fled into exile in france after a popular 
uprising since then haiti has been ruled by five governments 
four controlled by the army 
the new administration is to replace the interim civilian 
government of president ertha pascaltrouillot a supreme court 
judge appointed in march to lead haiti to its first fully 
democratic elections

boston police violated individual civil rights in 
using stopandsearch tactics and appeared to have coerced 
witnesses to testify in the stuart murder case the massachusetts 
attorney general said tuesday 
in a report based on a nearly yearlong investigation james 
shannon said he found a broad pattern of civil rights infringements 
in search tactics in which police randomly stopped and frisked 
minority youths in bostons inner city 
police commissioner francis roache called shannons allegations 
totally unjustified and completely lacking in due process 
the murder of sevenmonthspregnant carol stuart who was white 
in october 1989 generated widespread publicity her husband 
charles who was seriously wounded told police a black mugger 
abducted them in their car and shot them 
william bennett a black man whom police were investigating in 
connection with the shooting was absolved when charles stuart 
jumped to his death off a bridge and police implicated him in his 
wifes slaying 
shannon who leaves office jan 3 stopped short of bringing 
court action saying such a move would prove timeconsuming and 
ineffective instead he recommended that a civilian review board 
be established to monitor police 
before the stuart slaying black community leaders complained 
that police wrongly stopped and searched black youths the outcry 
intensified when police seeking a suspect in the stuart case 
kicked down doors and stripsearched young black men 
there is no excuse for forcing young men to lower their 
trousers or for a police officer to search inside their underwear 
on public streets and hallways shannon said in the report 
that practice must be condemned in the strongest possible 
terms 
roache in a statement issued after shannons report was 
released stressed that no one has filed a complaint against the 
department 
it is crucial to note that the attorney general has concluded 
that there are no grounds for any legal action the statement 
said 
the report found that homicide detectives appeared to have 
threatened coerced or offered favors to obtain testimony that 
would implicate bennett shannon said his report on the allegations 
of coercion was incomplete because police had refused to cooperate 
with the probe 
but two men who were picked up by police for questioning dereck 
jackson and eric whitney told investigators police threatened them 
with jail and denied them access to attorneys 
jackson and whitney were questioned by police after jackson told 
whitney he had heard william bennetts nephew jokingly say he 
thought bennett killed stuart 
shannon said complaints about searches should be referred to his 
office or the us attorneys office to be evaluated in the past 
the police departments internal affairs unit has overseen such 
inquiries 
but internal affairs has not done the job here shannon 
said until the bpd has demonstrated that it can police its own 
officers effectively it must be carefully scrutinized by an 
independent law enforcement agency 
shannon denied that his report was little more than a slap on 
the wrist for police who are under no obligation to abide by its 
recommendations 
litigation would accomplish nothing shannon said i think 
the public is going to demand these changes the findings are so 
substantial that they cannot be ignored 
louis elisa head of the boston chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people praised shannon 
for his comprhensive review 
but he said the report came so late in shannons term and 
suggested that shannon pass his findings on to the us attorney to 
take action 
shannon alleged in the report that frank mcgee a lawyer for the 
boston police patrolmens association advised officers not to 
cooperate with the investigation 
mcgee said the allegations were false and that shannon was 
retaliating for the unions endorsement of scott harshbarger who 
defeated shannon in the attorney general race

reynaldo trevino spends more time 
preaching than selling auto parts now that hundreds of people daily 
ignore his fan belts and radiator hoses to view what they believe 
is the virgin marys image on a bathroom floor 
the image varying shades of gray that trevino said used to be 
one color appeared dec 3 on the cement floor of the shower stall 
in the rear of his progreso auto supply 
he said something within his heart told him to spread the 
message that the presence on the floor symbolized the way many 
neglect their faith 
so i started telling every customer who came in trevino 
said tuesday before i sold them a part i took them back 
the word spread quickly a steady procession of faithful and 
curious now enter the store daily in the tiny town by the mexican 
border in the lower rio grande valley 
some days more than 1000 visit about 100 per hour stopped at 
the store tuesday morning 
only a few came to buy auto parts 
over and over trevino told visitors the message he believes the 
virgin told him to spread share with your brothers pray the 
rosary fast and look for jesus and put him at the center of your 
hearts 
they had to wind their way behind the counter and down a narrow 
corridor past the shelves of inventory before reaching the restroom 
at the back corner 
some knelt to pray by the shower stall next to a toilet others 
made the sign of the cross or touched the image they saw 
they see the virgins image in the varying shades of gray 
cement a dark area about a foot wide appears in the shape of 
common representations of the virgin what could be interpreted as 
facial features are vaguely discernible 
others see more including a woman tuesday who said she saw an 
earring flowers and an angel to the side 
shes so beautiful so beautiful 14yearold bonnie 
maldonado said tears flowing from her eyes after leaving the 
store 
her mother ernestina maldonado said she found it painful to 
see the virgin on the floor 
i feel guilty she said i feel very very guilty because 
i feel like im part of this world im part to blame for where she 
is in the process of trying to get ahead we have lost our 
values 
trevino 45 is roman catholic like most who believe they see 
the virgin mary at his store some dont see anything special he 
said 
to aid viewing trevino placed in the shower a small picture of 
the virgin along with a fluorescent desk lamp 
he said he plans to make no money from the image and that his 
business actually has suffered from his devotion of so much time to 
his new religious mission 
trevino planned to sell the store until he saw the image now 
he said he awaits guidance from god on what to do with the 
business 
he discourages photographs

the chaotic start of a sweepstakes promotion that 
promised to put an american aboard the soviet space station became 
even more tangled tuesday when the official soviet news agency 
called the contest a hoax 
complicating matters still further texas officials said they 
were investigating to see whether the contest by space travel 
services violated state lottery laws 
the houstonbased company announced monday that callers to a 900 
number had a chance to win six months training a trip aboard a 
soviet rocket and a week on the space station mir 
so many callers dialed the number to enter the sweepstakes at 
299 a shot that they knocked the dallasbased phone system out 
of service periodically monday and tuesday 
weve been rather overwhelmed james davidson senior vice 
president of space travel said tuesday 
the companys glee turned to confusion later in the day when 
tass denied reports of any deal involving americans and glavkosmos 
the soviet space agency and said it was a hoax 
the glavkosmos does not know anything about this project 
tass reported 
organizers in houston termed the denial a misunderstanding 
theres a limit to how much we can do to control soviet 
bureaucracy and theres a limit to what we can do with tass 
said david mayer president of space travel 
we basically have our contract in hand so we know that were 
basically straight he said its just a matter of us finding 
out whats going on behind the scenes in the soviet union to find 
out where the confusion lies its obviously just a 
misunderstanding and i dont think it will be that difficult to 
clear up 
space travel services corp has a legal contract with npo 
energia for a trip to the mir space station aboard a soyuz 
vehicle company spokesman george nelson said two contracts 
are involved one between space travel and space commerce corp of 
houston and a second between space commerce and npo energia of 
moscow 
space commerce corp is the company that negotiated with npo 
energia on behalf of space travel npo energia is the soviet agency 
that builds rockets and negotiates commercial deals for the soviet 
space program but glavkosmos must approve any contracts 
nelson said the energia contract was signed by uri pavelovitch 
semenov general designer in energias moscow office and was 
delivered to space commerce with a cover letter signed by vp 
nikitskiy deputy chairman of npo energia space travel also has a 
letter from alexander i dunaev chairman of glavkosmos ussr 
confirming that energia has full authority to sign and execute that 
contract 
there were no deals on the subject tass quoted vladimir 
zenkin deputy commercial manager at the energia agency 
a harris county assistant district attorney said tuesday that 
mayer and davidson were subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury 
wednesday for questioning about the contest 
nobodys been charged with anything said russell 
turbeville head of the district attorneys consumer fraud 
division theres just so much information coming from so many 
sources so fast we just had to look into it 
we were concerned that even if it was not a hoax and the 
arrangements were made properly with the soviets the sweepstakes 
would violate state lottery laws turbeville said 
it is a felony in texas to charge people for a chance to win 
something 
davidson said because people could enter the sweepstakes by mail 
at no charge the contest did not violate state laws mayer said he 
would submit to the grand jury a written opinion from his lawyers 
saying the sweepstakes did not violate texas laws 
earlier davidson said if the project fell through callers 
would get refunds 
the contest is to culminate in december 1991 when an american is 
selected in a random drawing for six months training a trip 
aboard a soviet rocket and a week on the russian space station in 
late 1992 or early 1993 
thousands of calls made to the 900 number monday caused the 
circuits at wholesale telephone to overload 
we got a little bit buried but im not embarrassed were 
getting a lot of calls said larry summers president of 
wholesale telephone im kind of a space nut myself so im real 
excited to see that 
he estimated that about 5000 calls were missed overnight from 
the service disruption he said he worked all night to expand his 
computer systems capacity to handle the volume 
summers and davidson said they didnt know how many calls had 
been received davidson said the system was able to handle 200 
phone calls at once 
for 200 people to call and lock up the system would require 
several thousand people calling every hour davidson said 
summers said the calls to the 900 number are stored on digital 
tape with 17686 messages per tape winners will be chosen by an 
accounting firm that will randomly designate a location on a part 
of the tape he said 
the grand prize includes the space ride plus 500000 in cash 
space travel said or the sweepstakes winner can opt to stay on 
earth and collect 15 million in cash a backup astronaut will be 
picked from 11 potential candidates selected in the drawing 
davidson said 
contest rules require that entrants be at least 18 and residents 
of the united states they are not required to be us citizens 
space travel said because of local laws residents of new york 
florida or rhode island would not be eligible for the flight 
deadline for the contest is dec 1 1991 
the exact cost of the trip was not disclosed but space travel 
officials have said it was more than the 12 million paid by a 
japanese broadcast company to put a reporter aboard the station 
besides income from the 900 number for which space travel gets 
more than 50 percent of the 299 per call the company hopes to 
lure advertisers eager to put their logos on the winners spacesuit 
and on the spacecraft or have the american cosmonaut endorse 
certain products from space

an iraqi official on tuesday claimed that 
more than 2000 children aged 4 or under have died because of 
shortages in baby food and medicine caused by the un embargo on 
trade with iraq 
health minister abdulsalam mohammed said blamed president bush 
for the deaths in a statement distributed by the official iraqi 
news agency 
documented evidence of this high rate in childrens death will 
stand to condemn the crimes committed by bush and his partners 
ina quoted the minister as saying 
he said 600 of the 2042 children died in hospitals this month 
mainly due to shortages of vaccines that caused the spread of 
contagious diseases like measles diphtheria tetanus and whooping 
cough 
said claimed on dec 3 that 1416 children had died because of 
shortages resulting from the sanctions the un security council 
imposed on iraq as punishment for its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
western diplomats in baghdad have discounted the reports of 
shortages noting that the security council decided in october to 
allow shipments of essential food and medicines to iraq 
the diplomats note that since midoctober nearly 120 tons of 
medicine have arrived from humanitarian groups worldwide earmarked 
for iraqi children 
most of the shipments were in exchange for western hostages 
helped by iraq until president saddam hussein announced a blanket 
release on dec 6 
last week alone iraqs red crescent the islamic equivalent of 
the red cross announced it had received 22 tons of medical 
supplies from italy and another 28 tons from the united nations 
children fund unicef 
but government hospitals still report shortages of vaccines 
antibiotics and baby formulas 
iraqis say they can buy medicine at pharmacies and on the black 
market but the prices are at least five times higher than normal 
some diplomats and medical personnel in baghdad suggested last 
month that iraq might be stockpiling medicine in case of war and 
that some of the reported shortages resulted from profiteering 
a government rationing plan enforced in september limits each 
child under age 1 to three 16ounce cans of baby formula a month 
at government subsidized stores each can costs 225 at the 
official exchange rate 
iraqis are forced to supplement their babies diet with powdered 
milk bought on the black market at prices well beyond the means of 
most iraqis

financial news network inc suffered losses 
totaling 724 million for its 1990 fiscal year the cable 
television concern disclosed tuesday 
the reasons for fnns reversal of fortune included accounting 
changes totaling 65 million the company said the changes regarded 
improperly documented lease transactions new product development 
costs and payments to its sister company united press 
international 
fnn and upi are subsidiaries of infotechnology inc 
fnn said it was in the process of revising its quarterly reports 
for the first three quarters of 1990 to reflect a review conducted 
by by fnn and its new accountants coopers amp lybrand 
last month fnn said it expected a net loss of 725 million for 
the 1990 fiscal year 
last year for the fiscal year ending in 1989 fnn recorded a 
profit over 3 million but those figures were unaudited the 
companys fiscal year ends june 30 
financial news network provides business sports and market data 
to cable systems in the united states and canada fnn and 
infotechnology collectively own 51 percent of the learning channel 
and infotechnology also has investments in other media 
communications and biotechnology companies 
in october fnn dismissed c steven bolen chief financial 
officer for improper financial dealings fnn also dismissed its 
auditors deloitte amp touche in a disagreement over accounting 
methods 
the fnn annual report stated that a company investigation 
concluded bolen had payments made to himself totaling 794061 that 
were not properly authorized and not properly identified on 
fnns books 
through his counsel mr bolen claimed that such payments were 
earned by him as incentive compensation for arranging financing for 
the company the filing stated 
fnn said it was considering suing bolen to recover the money 
originally at issue in the dispute with deloitte amp touche was 
how fnn was reporting its 28 million investment in a new service 
deloitte contended the investment should have been deducted from 
quarterly earnings which would have put fnn in the red rather 
than spread out over several years 
because of the dispute fnn was unable to file its annual 
financial reports with the sec for the fiscal year ended june 30 
in addition deloitte withdrew its opinions on fnns and infotechs 
1989 financial statements 
last month fnn said it expected a net loss of 725 million for 
the 1990 fiscal year

dr e donnall thomas whose pioneering bone 
marrow transplants offered new hope to leukemia patients donated 
his half of the more than 700000 nobel prize award to a cancer 
center 
thomas gave the money to seattles fred hutchinson cancer 
research center where he is a physician and a researcher 
thomas shared this years nobel in medicine with dr joseph e 
murray of boston thomas and murray were credited with performing 
critical experiments that opened the door to successful organ 
transplantation in humans 
thomas 70 announced his gift to the cancer center at a 
reception and dinner monday night 
thomas said he felt he couldnt keep the money for himself 
because the decades of research that led to his prize were the sums 
of efforts involving many hutchinson staff members and several 
other seattle hospitals 
we even want to pay income tax on this money thomas said 
we thank all of you for this wonderful occasion 
he was given two long standing ovations 
thomas also a professor of medicine and oncology at the 
university of washington performed the first human bone marrow 
transplant in 1956 on sets of identical twins in which one twin had 
severe leukemia while the transplant was successful and not 
rejected the patient with the cancer eventually died from the 
disease 
most medical researchers then dismissed marrow transplantation 
as impossible but thomas and his colleagues persevered 
thomas helped refine the procedure during which cancerous bone 
marrow is replaced with healthy marrow from a donor 
today bone marrow transplantation is considered the preferred 
treatment for some leukemia and lymphoma patients who otherwise 
would not survive 
thousands of such operations have been performed at hutchinson 
murray 71 and a retired harvard medical school professor in 
1954 performed the first successful kidney transplant in identical 
twins at what is now the brigham and womens hospital in boston

arab lawyers from jerusalem and the occupied 
west bank on tuesday urged the international community to intervene 
to stop israel from deporting palestinian activists 
the plea came as an army judicial panel considered the appeal of 
four leaders of the moslem fundamentalist hamas movement who have 
been ordered expelled by the israeli government 
the expulsion orders also gave america room to back a proposed 
un resolution criticizing the jewish state diplomats said 
speaking on the condition of anonymity 
the deportation orders were issued after hamas slogans claimed 
responsibility for the stabbing deaths of three israelis last 
friday 
the government has not accused the four men of involvement in 
the killings but said they incited others to violence all four are 
from the occupied gaza strip 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said us support of the un 
resolution opposes the american interest at this time 
because in essence any decision against israel in the security 
council is liable to be an achievement for saddam hussein iraqs 
president shamir said 
saddam has tried to link a resolution of the persian gulf crisis 
with the palestinian issue a nonbinding section in the resolution 
would endorse a mideast peace conference but it stresses the gulf 
crisis and the conference are not linked 
at a news conference in arab east jerusalem palestinian lawyers 
said they feared israel planned extensive deportations 
news and reports have confirmed the existence of another list 
containing tens of palestinians who will be candidates for 
deportation said ali ghuzlan president of the arab lawyers 
committee 
the committee charged israel was paving the road before the 
collective transfer of palestinians from their homeland 
we as lawyers strongly condemn this policy and urge the local 
israeli and world opinion to ask for the immediate cancellation 
of the emergency regulations under which the deportations are 
ordered its statement said 
israeli had been reported planning 14 expulsions in all later 
reports said the number was scaled back because of us objections 
nazem oweida a gaza lawyer for the hamas activists complained 
tuesday of insufficient time to prepare his case 
we were surprised to get hundreds of pages of material some 
of it blurry and not translated oweida said we asked for a 
week to look at it and we got only 24 hours 
oweida said he would appeal to the supreme court if the military 
panel ruled against them deportation orders have never been 
overturned by israeli courts 
israel reinstituted its deportation policy after a lapse of 16 
months to try to calm rising public fears over arab attacks on 
jews 
the decision drew immediate criticism from the us state 
department which said the expulsions violated the fourth geneva 
convention protecting the rights of peoples under occupation 
before deportations were suspended in august 1989 reportedly at 
us urging 60 palestinians had been expelled for alleged 
involvement in the now 3yearold uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
shops and offices in the west bank and arab east jerusalem were 
closed tuesday in a strike called by hamas to protest the expulsion 
orders 
the israeli government also drew criticism from its rightwing 
supporters 
agriculture minister rafael eitan of the farright tsomet party 
described the planned deportation of four moslem activists as 
very late and in a very small amount 
he urged the government not to make public in advance its 
deportation plans to avoid any international outcry let the 
press find out about it two weeks later eitan said on army 
radio 
eliahu benelissar a senior member of shamirs likud bloc was 
quoted in israeli newspapers as saying the government was failing 
to protect israelis 
the governments policy will in the end bring about the 
abandonment of judea and samaria he said using the biblical 
terms for the west bank 
retaining control of the west bank and gaza which israel seized 
in the 1967 middle east war is a pillar of likuds platform

a segregationist who has stood trial twice 
in the 1963 ambush slaying of civil rights leader medgar evers 
faces a third trial after being indicted on new evidence 
byron de la beckwith 70 of signal mountain tenn is charged 
with murder in the shooting death of evers field secretary for the 
national association for the advancement of colored people 
justice can be only served if there is a final conclusion 
once and for all district attorney ed peters said tuesday 
peters said the reindictment was issued friday by a grand jury in 
jackson 
beckwith who is in poor health and advancing years still 
espouses white supremacy and flies the confederate flag outside his 
home 
he was arrested monday at his house on a fugitive warrant issued 
by the state of mississippi 
beckwith was released on 15000 bond after a court appearance 
in chattanooga tenn his next court appearance was set for feb 
22 
beckwith said he intends to fight extradition 
im going to resist tooth nail and claw because i think all 
this is nonsense poppycock and something to stir the people up 
and incite the lower forms of life to force and violence against 
the country clubs he said during his court appearance 
if extradited beckwith will stand trial in the june 12 1963 
death of evers 37 who was shot while standing in the driveway of 
his jackson home 
beckwith can be tried again without double jeopardy because no 
verdict was ever reached his two previous trials ended with 
deadlocked juries also no statute of limitations exists in murder 
cases 
although beckwith was vigorously prosecuted in 1964 those 
prosecutions did not have the benefit of certain evidence 
accumulated during the course of our investigation peters said 
peters did not disclose the new evidence and refused to answer 
questions from reporters 
he did say however that individuals both black and white 
have taken the courageous step of coming forward he said their 
identities would not be revealed but that they had agreed to 
testify 
evers led black voter registration drives in mississippi and 
filed complaints with the federal government concerning civil 
rights violations 
the assassination helped focus national attention on the civil 
rights struggle in mississippi and helped push forward civil rights 
reforms 
beckwiths fingerprint was found on a rifle discarded near the 
scene he claimed the rifle had been stolen from his home 
after his two trials in 1964 both times before allwhite 
juries the murder charge against beckwith was dismissed in 1969 
the investigation was reopened amid allegations of jury and 
evidence tampering by the state sovereignty commission a state 
segregationist watchdog agency that went out of business in 1973 
prosecutors later said they found no evidence of jury tampering 
without a conviction in this case we must believe that 
everything medgar fought and died for was meaningless said 
evers widow myrlie evers of los angeles 
i hope that it is the foreteller of the kind of justice 
attitude that becomes a reality said aaron henry president of 
the state naacp since 1960 
its about time for us to clean up our act and see that 
justice is done in this case said vicksburg mayor robert walker 
who was field secretary of the state naacp during 198084 
in a telephone interview saturday beckwith said another trial 
would be a popularity contest but that he expected to be cleared 
whites are the most numerous i know where the power and 
the authority in mississippi lays because i was raised in the 
middle of it he said 
if i didnt know what was going on down there i wouldnt be 
so cheerful up here he said from his home 
beckwith has been an outspoken opponent of integration since 
1954 when he joined the prosegregation citizens council after 
his trials in the evers slaying beckwith ran for lieutenant 
governor in 1967 collecting 34675 of the 665539 votes cast and 
finishing fifth among six candidates 
in 1973 he was convicted in louisiana of possessing dynamite 
without a permit and served five years in prison

their wives and colleagues at heathrow airport after arriving from 
amman jordan the two traveled via baghdad 
it is tremendous to be home if a little cold said weston

president bush on tuesday was still mulling 
over a list of candidates for national republican party chairman 
and a top aide said he was not likely to make the selection before 
the end of the week 
among the names emerging as strong contenders according to 
administration officials were those of gop political operative rich 
bond and outgoing new mexico gov garrey carruthers 
carruthers was summoned to the white house on tuesday by chief 
of staff john sununu his new mexico office said sununu earlier 
asked him to replace outgoing drug policy director william bennett 
but carruthers turned it down said his press secretary eddie 
binder 
arriving in new mexico tuesday evening carruthers said he made 
a commitment to help in the bush reelection campaign but he 
declined to say whether he was offered to position of party 
chairman 
however the administration sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said other names were still live prospects for rnc 
chairman as well they said bush was keeping very close counsel on 
the matter and was likely to announce the decision on very short 
notice 
one senior official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
there was a chance of less than 20 percent that bush would make a 
final decision on the matter before leaving at the end of the week 
to spend the christmas holiday at the presidential retreat at camp 
david md 
the official said there was no real pressure to make a quick 
decision since the republican national committee which 
technically will choose its chairman does not meet until jan 25 
the rnc is expected to rubber stamp bushs choice 
the official said aides had given him a list of 12 to 15 
possible candidates and that bush was adding and subtracting his 
own candidates 
the search has resumed since bushs first choice outgoing drug 
policy director bennett accepted and then rejected the offer 
saying he had too many financial aspirations that might pose 
conflict of interest questions 
many white house officials are lining up behind bonds 
candidacy going with his strength as a political strategist in 
lieu of a bombastic public speaker like bennett according to some 
sources 
after bennett rejected the post administration officials were 
divided on whether it would be better to find a flashy public 
personage or pick someone who had more campaign strategy 
credentials 
among the potential candidates in the former category the names 
of transportation secretary sam skinner housing secretary jack 
kemp and outgoing sen william armstrong rcolo were mentioned 
along with attorney general dick thornburgh 
in the political operative category names that still were 
mentioned on tuesday were former rep tom loeffler now a texas 
attorney and michigan gop chairman spencer abraham a political 
aide to vice president dan quayle 
bond who organized the iowa caucuses for bush in the 1988 
presidential campaign and then served as political director is 
credited with helping to solidify the republican base for bush he 
now has a virginia consulting business 
carruthers was elected governor in 1986 and was barred by law 
from seeking a second term this year his term is up jan 1 and he 
has indicated he would like to take some time out from public life 
he told sununu that when he was offered a chance to be considered 
or drug czar said binder 
carruthers also served as state gop chairman in new mexico and 
was an assistant interior secretary from 1981 to 1984

a judge tuesday revoked 300000 bail for the 
accused murderer of rabbi meir kahane and said he received death 
threats for his handling of the case 
the judge alvin schlesinger said virtually all of hundreds of 
letters and telephone calls he got urged him to keep el sayyid 
nosair in jail but he said they had no influence on his decision 
to revoke bail 
he had stayed the bail pending the hearing and nosair was never 
released 
schlesinger said he changed his mind because he was able to 
drag out of assistant district attorney william greenbaum 
information that nosair had used five different addresses for 
questionable reasons 
with respect to the threats on my life my reaction to those 
has been revulsion contempt and outrage the judge said 
schlesinger refused to say who or where the threats came from 
but said some of the individuals who contacted him ought to know 
better 
greenbaum told the judge nosair had manuals on gun use and bomb 
making in his cliffside park nj home and police recovered a 
bulletpocked wall that had apparently been used for target 
practice 
schlesinger said he noticed that the last name of nosairs wife 
and child on their passports were different from his he said 
nosairs passport had the last name abdulazziz all were united 
states passports 
a vial of sodium cyanide that greenbaum said was in nosairs 
locker in the courthouse basement where he worked in manhattan 
could be used to poison someone or to commit suicide schlesinger 
said 
greenbaum told schlesinger perfect ballistics matches were made 
between the gun found on the street next to nosair when he was 
captured and the bullets that came out of kahane and other victims 
it appears to me that the prosecutor has what we refer to in 
the courthouse as a rather strong case schlesinger said 
the judge chided the prosecutor for not giving him enough 
information in the first bail hearing two weeks ago to make an 
intelligent decision about whether nosair ought to be remanded 
nosair 35 is an egyptian immigrant who came to this country in 
1981 he is charged with murder for allegedly shooting the zionist 
rabbi through the neck nov 5 as kahane finished speaking to a 
jewish group in manhattan 
nosair is also charged with the attempted murder of two men he 
is accusing of wounding as he allegedly tried to get away 
one of the defendants alleged victims us postal service 
police officer carlos acosta shot nosair in the neck between his 
chin and throat nosair recovered and has been moved from bellevue 
hospital to rikers island 
schlesinger scheduled nosair for another hearing march 5

japans financial contribution to the gulf 
crisis was defended by a senior japanese diplomat tuesday as not 
less than what the united states requested 
i think the japanese contribution is comparable to the whole 
of western europes which has an economy twice the size of 
japan said takayuki kimura deputy chief of his countrys 
washington embassy 
he appeared at a news conference to answer accusations that 
japan was shirking a fair share of crisis burden considering its 
status as the worlds second strongest economic power and its heavy 
dependence on middle east oil 
kimura was asked repeatedly if the 4 billion japanese financial 
contribution shown in tables handed reporters was considered enough 
in light of the possibility that us and other lives may be 
sacrificed if the crisis brings war and a reported 30 billion 
cost to america for the military buildup 
the tables and other information disclosed that much of the 
contribution pledged by japan has not yet been disbursed and much 
of 2 billion to help egypt turkey and jordan as countries 
particularly hurt by the international trade embargo against iraq 
is in the form of loans rather than grants 
all the loans are untied meaning they need not be spent in 
japan kimura said grants would have required timeconsuming law 
changes while low one percent interest rates and long 30year 
repayment terms make the loans worth 80 percent as much as grants 
he added 
to suggestions that approximately 2 billion in financing 
equipment and transportation for us forces is too little and 
too slow kimura said the pentagon prefers payment in kind and 
military procurement simply takes time about 600 million of the 
first 1 billion has been spent or contracted and an additional 1 
billion just approved by parliament will soon be paid the embassy 
said 
the us government has a general idea of how much more 
japan would contribute if the crisis led to war kimura said it 
was up to the united states to disclose the amount of its requests 
he said adding in answer to a question that the japanese 
conribution was not less than what they asked 
the un security council and the usled multinational 
military force have set a jan 15 deadline for iraq to withdraw 
from kuwait japanese and german forces are not part of the 
27nation multinational force as a result of restrictions on 
sending soldiers overseas that stem from their defeat in world war

a federal judge tuesday extended the daily news 
right to employ hawkers in subway and railroad stations in an 
eightweek strike 
us district judge miriam g cedarbaum granted the tabloid a 
preliminary injunction that replaces a previous order which was to 
expire thursday 
the daily news says it depends on hawkers to distribute the 
newspaper because virtually all newsstands stopped carrying the 
paper after nine of its 10 unions went on strike oct 25 
the judge said the injunction would remain in effect until the 
news lawsuit against the metropolitan transportation authority is 
resolved 
the lawsuit claims the daily news first amendment right to free 
speech was violated when the transit authority rescinded permits 
late last month that had allowed hawkers to sell the news in the 
transit system 
the transit authority said it terminated the permits because of 
concerns that striking newspaper employees would set up picket 
lines that would be honored by transit workers 
the judge noted that it would be illegal for the transit workers 
to honor picket lines because public employees are barred under law 
from striking 
transit authority spokesman tito davila said lawyers were likely 
to appeal cedarbaums ruling 
the news has published daily during the strike but has had major 
problems in circulation and advertising 
before the strike it was the thirdlargest metropolitan daily 
with circulation of 109 million the news circulation is now 
about 600000

a former member of the hull board of assessors was 
accused tuesday of taking revenge against an exgirlfriend by 
helping raise her property tax bill 
the state ethics commission accused stephen malcolm of violating 
the massachusetts conflictofinterest law 
according to an order filed by the commission malcolm became 
romantically involved with a hull resident in march 1987 and the 
relationship ended a couple months later with bad feelings on both 
sides 
later that year malcolm told a subordinate that the 
exgirlfriend wanted her tax assessment increased because she was 
planning to put her house up for sale and she wanted to ask a 
higher price than what was reflected by its assessment at the time 
the order said 
the woman had no plans to sell her house and didnt request a 
reassessment the order said 
the assessment on her property rose from 40300 to 122700 
resulting in a 2000 tax increase later the board of assessors 
reevaluated the property and approved a tax reduction 
malcolm said the charges were ludicrous 
he said the home was assessed too low and his actions had 
nothing to do with his feelings about the woman

the states top judge violated the us 
constitution when he banned the filming of the bonfire of the 
vanities from the essex county courthouse a federal judge ruled 
tuesday 
us district judge nicholas politan harshly criticized robert 
wilentz chief justice of the state supreme court saying he 
violated the first amendment by banning the filming 
wilentz said he would appeal 
i have advised all assignment judges that pending the outcome 
of the appeal no filming will be allowed in the courthouses of new 
jersey this order does not apply to the filming or televising of 
actual court proceedings which may continue as in the past he 
said in a statement 
wilentz barred filming of the movie scenes inside the ornate 
courthouse in may he argued that the depiction of rioting black 
characters would undermine what little faith blacks have left in 
the justice system 
wilentz said in an affidavit that he is constitutionally 
permitted and even dutybound to consider whether the content of a 
movie scene is inappropriate for the judiciary to be associated 
with 
essex county executive nicholas amato sued wilentz in may 
claiming the chief judge trampled on the first amendment and 
deprived the county of a 250000 donation from warner bros 
politan ruled in the countys favor but did not grant the 
250000 monetary award the county sought 
by acting to further his concern for the welfare of the black 
community wilentz egregiously trammelled a fundamental bulwark 
against the spread of governmental despotism politan wrote 
wilentz had offered to let the company film if they would change 
a scene but producer fred caruso declined 
the film based on tom wolfes novel looks at new yorks legal 
system illuminating the citys racial and class divisions 
the film is not about nor is it designed to document rioting 
blacks any more so than it is designed to malign drunken english 
reporters or greedy philandering white men politan wrote

the states highest court tuesday struck 
down a state rule forbidding health insurane companies from 
considering hiv test results when deciding on applications 
the court of appeals unanimously affirmed without comment 
lower court decisions against the state insurance department 
regulation 
the policy banned insurance companies from considering the 
results of hiv blood tests in deciding insurability for small group 
and individual plans a person testing positive for the human 
immunodeficiency virus is considered likely to develop symptoms of 
aids 
the department argued there were questions about the reliability 
of hiv tests testing positive for the hiv virus also doesnt mean 
a person is sick with aids and should be denied insurance the 
department said 
were disappointed in the decision said kevin foley 
spokesman for the insurance department we obviously saw it in a 
different way were going to review our policies and continue to 
look for ways to make sure the health insurance system is as 
inclusive as possible 
a lawyer for the health insurance association of america which 
challenged the rule said he believed the decision was fair to the 
groups clients and customers the lawyer chris petersen said the 
legislatere should decide such policy questions 
if theyre going to talk in terms of social policy its more 
important to go through the legislative process petersen said 
the department adopted the new rule in 1987 but it was 
challenged by the insurance industry before it could ever take 
effect while the rule has been tied up in litigation insurance 
companies have been allowed to take hiv test results into account 
when making decisions foley said 
since test results arent taken into account in large group 
insurance policies and people who already have insurance who 
develop aids symptoms remain covered petersen said the rule was 
likely to affect a relatively small number of people 
new york state with 33674 reported aids cases since the 
epidemic started through the end of october has more aids patients 
than any other state in the country the state health department 
said

police detained two people in connection 
with the deaths of 12 worshipers who suffered carbon monoxide 
poisoning during a religious ceremony authorities said tuesday 
the two including a daughter of one of the victims may be 
charged with abandonment said jose nunez de carceres the tijuana 
state judicial police chief 
the pair found the victims thursday in a shantytown home where 
the group had been participating in a religious rite but they 
failed to notify authorities nunez said 
instead of calling the authorities when they found the people 
lying on the floor they went to look for a medium to see if she 
could revive them nunez said but when they returned the 
police were there 
the pair were held at a tijuana jail nunez said the case would 
be turned over to the district attorneys office which will 
determine whether charges will be filed 
meanwhile san diego fbi agents were unable to confirm reports 
that the state government of baja california has asked for 
assistance in identifying and locating two us citizens who 
reportedly participated in the ceremony 
that is possible but we havent received any formal request 
special agent bob harmon said tuesday 
baja california police released a report monday confirming that 
the 12 victims had died of carbon monoxide poisoning 
authorities also said tissue and blood tests indicated that the 
victims had not consumed alcohol or another toxic substance as 
first suspected 
those findings should end speculation that they were poisoned 
deliberately through food or a fruit punch served at the ceremony 
said jaime sam fierro the state judicial police commander in 
tijuana 
there is no evidence that the food or punch was 
contaminated fierro said 
more tests will be conducted on organ tissue samples of the 
three female victims those results are not expected to indicate 
another cause of death pallares said 
doctors at the tijuana hospital where five survivors were taken 
have said that the patients symptoms indicated they had ingested 
some type of poison 
the allnight ceremony which began wednesday on the feast day 
of the virgin of guadalupe the patroness of mexico was led by 
federico padres mexia a selfstyled spiritual leader padres 61 
had conducted similar sessions for about the past month at his 
house in a shantytown east of tijuana 
authorities say the carbon monoxide that asphyxiated the victims 
was emitted by a leaky butane gas lamp used to light the 
unventilated residence homes in the neighborhood dont have 
electricity forcing residents to rely on gas tanks inside their 
homes for heating and light 
three survivors including padres were still in a coma and 
listed in grave condition tuesday 
two other survivors alfredo osuna hernandez 22 and his 
8monthold daughter ana karina were discharged monday and 
returned to their family home in culiacan sinaloa

public television station kcet on tuesday 
renewed south africa now a news magazine whose recent 
cancellation generated protests 
the renewal announcement came one day after a conservative media 
watchdog group which had claimed credit for the shows 
cancellation asked the federal communications commission to yank 
kcets license 
the committee on media integrity filed a petition monday with 
the fcc requesting that kcets license not be renewed and that a 
kcet request for a new transmitter also be denied 
william kobin kcet president and chief executive officer 
called the groups demands preposterous 
david horowitz a spokesman for the conservative group said the 
petition would be withdrawn if the public broadcasting system 
station establishes an elected board of directors and hires an 
ombudsman 
kobin said the groups requests were part of a longstanding 
effort to control the stations programming 
these charges and demands are preposterous and are clearly an 
attempt to use the processes of the fcc to further their private 
interests certainly not those of the general public kobin said 
in a prepared statement 
south africa now was originally canceled in october after 
kcet judged it did not meet journalistic standards for objectivity 
the news show presented from a black perspective was temporarily 
renewed for six episodes 
tuesdays statement announcing the shows longterm renewal said 
the station would continue to air the show in its 9 am sunday 
time slot but with a disclaimer identifying it as a point of 
view series the station said

the leader of one of the wests largest communist 
groups tuesday proposed an international conference to help 
redefine communism and overcome its troubles since the collapse of 
east bloc regimes 
georges marchais opened the fiveday french communists national 
congress by proposing a talks between revolutionary parties to 
help give communism a a second wind 
but he also promised support to the soviet union as it struggles 
with westernstyle reforms 
marchais ruled out any resumption of cooperation with the 
governing socialists saying president francois mitterrand has 
forsaken the left and implemeneted the policies sought by big 
money the policies of the right 
marchais in a nearly fourhour speech to more than 1700 
delegates said his party had been a longstanding advocate of 
reform in eastern europe but had underestimated the extent of the 
crisis faced by the toppled communist regimes there 
with us there was shortcoming of analysis and 
understanding he said 
the french communist party claims 600000 members and holds 26 
of 577 seats in the national assembly communists control municipal 
councils in 1097 communities including dozens of workingclass 
suburbs around major cities but their support in recent national 
elections has dropped below 10 percent 
the party congresses held every three years are the 
highestlevel forum for choosing leadership and setting policy 
this one marks the 70th anniversary of the partys founding and 
was the first since the fall of communism in eastern europe 
the french communists envisioned a society completely 
different from the socialist societies that exist now or used to 
exist he said 
referring to the soviet union marchais said the situation there 
is far from attractive he also criticized the soviets 
decision to authorize use of force against iraq in the persian gulf 
crisis saying this move deeply disappointed the people of 
france 
this war cannot be our war he said 
marchais however expressed empathy for soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reform initiatives 
marchais defended his partys decision to invite a chinese 
delegation to the congress but reiterated his denunciation of 
the murderous repression against prodemocracy demonstrators in 
beijing last year 
marchais is heavily favored to win reelection as party leader

tuesday after trying to reach the hospital room of nancy cruzan 
who was disconnected from her feeding tube last week in a landmark 
righttodie case 
the protesters clutched rosaries and bibles as they were pushed 
from the missouri rehabilitation center in wheelchairs and taken to 
jail on charges of trespassing and unlawful assembly 
the 19 people arrested were among about 25 protesters who showed 
up at the hospital tuesday morning at least 11 made it to the 
second floor they were stopped by a small army of police officers 
from getting to ms cruzans private room they knelt and prayed in 
the hallway before being dragged off the floor 
ms cruzan 33 has been in a persistent vegetative state since 
a 1983 car accident a judge granted her parents joe and joyce 
cruzan permission friday to disconnect her feeding tube 
doctors predict she will die in six days to two weeks 
ms cruzan was the subject of the us supreme courts first 
righttodie decision in june when the court blocked her parents 
from halting food and water in the absence of clear and 
convincing evidence she would want to die 
the parents later presented to a state court testimony from 
coworkers who recalled ms cruzan saying she would never want to 
live like a vegetable 
the rev ted coleman hospital chaplain said the cruzans were 
with their daughter when some protesters reached the second floor 
they said they were aware they said were private people 
we just want to be left alone coleman said 
the rev joseph foreman of montreat nc director of prisoners 
of christ which he described as a prolife group was among the 
protesters arrested 
if he could meet the cruzans foreman said i would plead with 
them that for whatever reason they wont feed their daughter there 
are many many people who are volunteering to care for her be 
merciful and let them do it 
shes going to be dead soon if someone doesnt intervene 
foreman said citizens have got to stop standing by silently and 
letting people die 
one of the protesters carried a cup of water he said he wanted 
to take to ms cruzan 
if youre going to kill her just put a pillow over her 
head said the protester who identified himself as gary tebbets 
of kansas city 
a state appeals court rejected without comment a petition from 
tebbets and gary rickman that ms cruzans food and water 
immediately be restored 
don lamkins the hospital director initially said the 
protesters could stay in the firstfloor chapel and in the 
stairwell but he later decided to have them arrested after talking 
with police 
they were blocking the fire exit and essentially the 
hallway lamkins said they wouldnt talk to us they wouldnt 
move and they indicated they were staying because they wanted to 
be arrested 
the protesters were held on a standard 500 bond on each count 
lt ken perkins the chief jailer for lawrence county said the 
protesters were fasting and all claiming to be nancy cruzan 
refusing to give their real names 
they cant make bail until we get their names they are all 
nancy cruzans right now he said

the captain of the barge that broke loose 
from its moorings and slammed into a bridge in october may have 
been negligent because he failed to drop a second anchor the us 
coast guard said tuesday 
the barge knocked out a 370foot section of the herbert c 
bonner bridge the only link between hatteras island and the 
mainland on oct 26 stranding thousands of residents and 
tourists 
state transportation officials say the bridge will be out at 
least until the end of january a ferry now shuttles people and 
cars from the island to wanchese on the mainland but service is 
intermittent 
the coast guard said unexpected rough weather drove the barge a 
dredge called northerly island from its moorings and was the cause 
of the accident 
but the barge captain apparently contributed to the accident 
because he failed to use the dredges second anchor after the 
vessel became grounded about 250 feet from the bridge the coast 
guard said in a statement from its office in portsmouth va 
in its report the coast guard said the barges captain william 
cliett chose to try to free the vessel rather than secure it with 
a second anchor 
under the circumstances it would have been prudent to use all 
means available and a second anchor may have added sufficient 
holding power to prevent the accident the masters failure to 
use the second anchor constitutes evidence of negligence on his 
part the coast guard statement said 
cliett who lives in savannah ga has an unlisted telephone 
number and could not be reached for comment tuesday night 
he told investigators previously that he didnt think a second 
anchor would have prevented the dredge from drifting toward the 
bridge

carnation co will begin advertising 
good start baby formula directly to mothers next month joining 
gerber products in a strategy opposed by the american academy of 
pediatricians 
the academy and other health organizations maintain such ads may 
discourage mothers from breastfeeding they support only ads 
directed at doctors who in turn recommend products to nursing 
mothers 
we have certainly opposed consumer ads with the gerber 
formula and would oppose it with the carnation formula said 
denver pediatrician james e strain the academys executive 
director 
carnation president timm crull said the move is necessary to 
compete with the giants of the infant formula industry abbott 
laboratories similac and bristolmyers squibbs enfamil which 
dominate the 15 billion yearly business 
in november 1988 carnation introduced its good start formula 
for younger infants and good nature for infants who have begun to 
eat solid foods 
crull said the pediatric academy guidelines banning consumer 
advertising benefit the abbottbristolmyers oligarchy at the 
expense of new competitors 
the federal trade commission is investigating possible unfair 
competitive practices by the infant food industry including a 
review of the voluntary ban on consumer ads 
carnation is a glendalebased unit of the swiss foods giant 
nestle which was the object of a worldwide boycott over formula 
marketing practices in third world countries

gov robert p casey on tuesday signed the 
potty parity bill to help cut long lines women endure when 
using public restrooms 
new public buildings and those undergoing extensive renovation 
will have to include sufficient restrooms for women 
the law applies to buildings leased or owned by the state and 
certain other public facilities 
the law which takes effect in four months leaves it to the 
department of labor and industry to determine how many more toilets 
are required for women than for men the law doesnt apply to 
hotels and restaurants 
supporters said the shortage of restrooms for women force them 
to stand in long lines at concerts sporting events and other 
recreational activities 
rep ruth rudy dcentre a sponsor of the bill said it was a 
step forward for women 
im very pleased that we finally achieved something for women 
in the commonwealth she said im hoping that it will lead to 
fewer lines at womens restrooms even though its going to be a 
long drawnout process 
the law requires the added womens toilets in renovations of 50 
percent or more of a building but ms rudy said she hoped owners 
of buildings undergoing less extensive renovation will add more 
womens restrooms anyway

danny ray harris won a stay late 
tuesday just hours before his scheduled execution for the slaying 
12 years ago of a man who stopped to help him and his brother when 
their car broke down 
harris faced lethal injection for the killing of timothy michael 
berka a texas aampm university employee who was fatally beaten with 
a tire iron in what became known as the samaritan slaying 
harris received a stay from the 5th circuit court of appeals in 
new orleans earlier in the day a state appeals court and a 
federal judge rejected requests to delay his execution 
assistant texas attorney general bob walt had said the state 
would not oppose requests for a stay 
testimony showed danny harris 30 devised the plan to kill 
merka so the brothers and their companions could steal merkas 
pickup truck witnesses said he held down merka while his brother 
beat him with a tire iron 
harris brother curtis paul harris also was sentenced to 
death 
one of their companions james manuel received a 25year prison 
term the other valarie rencher testified against the harris 
brothers and received no prison time 
no date has been set for curtis harris execution 
the federal appeals court issued the stay at 945 pm danny 
harris had faced lethal injection shortly after midnight 
he said in a recent interview that his death would not make up 
for merkas death and would not achieve justice 
what justice is there in that harris said speaking about 
his execution is it taking one life for another life 
harris would be the fifth texas inmate put to death this year 
and the 38th since the state resumed capital punishment in 1982 
the total is the highest in the nation among states with the death 
penalty 
it would be the 144th execution in the united states since the 
1976 us supreme court ruling allowing states to resume use of the 
death penalty

it started sometime last week america the 
first few salvos of the television onslaught that has become a 
yuletide ritual the annual its a wonderful life marathon 
theres no way to count how many times director frank capras 
1946 classic will reach television sets this holiday season 
whether by terrestrial broadcast satellite coaxial cable 
videocassette or laserdisc 
its 129 minutes of classic americana boy finds savings and 
loan boy loses savings and loan taxpayers bail out boy saving 
the savings and loan 
why do we like it so much 
how could we not like it were americans 
as in previous years the fear greed amp power incarnate cable 
system plans to air the movie continuously from 6 pm tonight to 
midnight dec 25 
naturally we expect some viewer burnout said one fgamppi 
publicist speaking on condition of anonymity but hey were 
giving them what they want and want and want 
fgamppi will air the original black and white version the 
colorized version where donna reeds graduation party dress is 
yellow and the other colorized version where the dress is blue 
then theyll show the descriptive narrative version for the 
vision impaired george looks down into the torrent a 
worldweary pain settles across his face above him clarence 
jumps george dives in after him 
and in a final mindboggler fgamppi will air the aberrant 1977 
madefortv remake it happened one christmas starring marlo 
thomas as a kind of georgina bailey costarring cloris 
leachman and wayne rogers 
other lessimaginary cable operators are reducing their 
exposure of its a wonderful life this season possibly fearing 
just the viewer burnout that four viewings in as many days can 
induce 
so why do we like this film so much 
its a wonderful life is the dark haunting story of a 
decent man named george bailey who dreams of building skyscrapers 
and milelong bridges once he flees his hometown bedford falls 
ny where his father runs the local sampl 
then life happens his fathers death forces george to shelve 
his dreams and run the sampl he marries settles down and scrapes 
along his dreams getting dustier until he is financially ruined 
by a drastic reverse on christmas eve 
then in a frightening outburst of neurotic rage he curses his 
life wishes he were never born and stands on a bridge at a river 
contemplating suicide 
enter the angel clarence sent from above to thwart his 
suicide he grants george his wish a nightmare vision of bedford 
falls transformed into a sleazy nighttown of alienated hard cases 
who dont even recognize george bailey 
george sweaty panicked eyes rolling like a crazed horses 
finally understands the influence that one good man has on the 
world he begs to be restored to his life and his family and 
miraculously he is all ends well 
yes but why do we like it so much capracorn was what the 
directors sneering contemporaries called his movies wholehearted 
embrace of american values home church community this is the 
90s man 
the movie opened dec 20 1946 was nominated for five academy 
awards and against the best years of our lives won none it 
broke even at the box office some said the suicide was 
offputting and lapsed into obscurity 
so why do we like it today 
we like it because its free said one television executive 
speaking on condition that he be fictional 
in 1974 you see someone forgot to renew the films copyright 
it went into the public domain that meant that any station 
anywhere could air the film as many times as it cared to without 
paying a thin dime they did 
thats why the tv stations showed it to us all these years that 
it happens to be good cinema is just our luck awful colorized 
versions of the film can be copyrighted but the classic black and 
white is still anybodys game 
yes but what is there about this film that would prompt say 
an exotic dancer to take the stage name zuzu petals 
its a wonderful life is probably one of james stewarts 
greatest films it is a comedy masking as a drama or perhaps the 
reverse it is full of magic angelic behavior and good feelings 
and worse its a unabashedly sentimental treatment of many 
aspects of love 
it celebrates the love of family of wife and husband of parent 
and child the love of country love of community it is exalts of 
basic virtues that nice guys dont finish last and that life is 
indeed worth living 
take that away and yes its just another movie get out your 
handkerchiefs and tune in fgampip now playing in your neighborhood

cab driver claude jacques learned english and 
his way around new york at the same time 
one time this guy asked to go to the garden said jacques 
who arrived from haiti 10 years ago i start going to central 
park the guy screams madison square garden man no tip from 
him 
but those were more freewheeling days now before new cabbies 
hit the streets there are classes to take and tests to pass 
with the citys cab fleet becoming increasingly international 
91 nations and at least 72 languages represented among drivers at 
last count officials have made the license requirements more 
challenging in an attempt to improve service and stem passengers 
complaints 
on nov 1 the english language test was made more rigorous to 
simulate reallife conversations the mandatory 40hour course has 
been expanded to include city tours and geography lessons 
the final exam enlarged nearly threefold since the mid1980s 
now covers questions on how to maneuver through obscure 
neighborhoods and the channels of city bureaucacy the failure rate 
is now close to 40 percent up from about 10 percent before the 
revisions 
were dealing with the whole city here said jack lusk 
chairman of the citys taxi and limousine commission without 
standards it would be crazy 
of the 40000 licensed cabbies in new york in 1984 twothirds 
were born outside the united states according to a taxi commission 
study the percentage is likely close to 85 percent now some 
experts say 
lusk said the changes were made in part to halt criticism that 
cabbies did not know enough of the city or failed to fully 
understand englishspeaking riders 
the image of the new york cabbie as the cigarchomping 
philosopher who talks about sports and politics is way out of 
date said paul herzich a director at federated employment amp 
guidance service which operates the taxi commissions two training 
schools theyre an endangered species 
about 6000 applicants a year pass the english test and enroll 
in the two schools an americanborn student is an oddity said 
herzich 
one recent taxi school class included three haitians two 
pakistanis two egyptians and a moroccan 
ok who can tell me what famous buildings in on east end 
avenue asked teacher bob schneider a former cab driver 
the students flip through their maps of upper manhattan 
schneider didnt wait for an answer 
gracie mansion the mayors house he said by the way 
you can always pick up good fares there at night 
jean bruny a 32yearold haitian jotted down the tip he lost 
his job when the machine factory were he worked relocated to 
pennsylvania 
hey i need work and i need money bruny said if i pass 
the test im on the road im my own boss 
with the us economy apparently recessionbound some cab 
industry experts foresee a return of some native new york drivers 
these days a fulltime driver can bring home up to 600 a week 
the taxi drivers are like a barometer of political economic 
and social unheavals said anne morris director of the center 
for logistics and transportation at the city university of new york 
graduate center 
it seems the tougher the times in a country the more we see 
immigrants from those countries looking to become cabbies 
presently there is an influx of drivers from pakistan india 
and other asian countries with high unemployment and struggling 
economies said ms morris who has tracked the citys cab industry 
since the early 1980s before the fall of haitian dicator 
jeanclaude duvalier in 1986 haitian cabbies dominated the 
newcomers 
for many driving a cab is the first step toward the american 
dream she said its a modern immigrants story 
she said the persian gulf crisis could lead to a rise in cabbie 
applicants from yemenis filipinos and other others who fled jobs 
in kuwait 
but life behind the wheel in new york is not easy said lusk 
twentyone percent of the cabbie dont renew their license after 
the first year some worn out by the long hours or moving on to 
other professions 
the taxi commission says more than 40 percent of the 
foreignborn cabbies have at least two years of college 
sherman appel is a hallmark to cabbie longevity for 32 years 
he has cruised the streets of his native city above his cabs 
visor he keeps a copy of a creased daily news article on new york 
high school graduates who went onto fame 
the foreign cabbies remind him of his parents russian jews who 
emigrated just after the turn of the century 
years ago you came to this country and worked in a factory 
he said now they come and drive a cab different time 
different jobs

robert fisk one of the last western journalists 
left in the cauldron of beirut believes quite a lot could have 
stayed if done with great caution and care 
but as fisks justpublished book makes clear luck and 
instinct are equally important for a risktakers survival in the 
killing fields of lebanon the braking of a car just before a round 
explodes in its path the precious inches separating the quick and 
the dead during an artillery barrage or car bombing the fortuitous 
intervention of an outsider in the midst of triggerhappy gunmen 
pity the nation published by atheneum relates in often 
gory detail the nearmisses fear and horror fisk experienced and 
witnessed during his 14 years of covering civil war two israeli 
invasions the massacre at the sabra and chatila refugee camps and 
bombings of the us embassy and marine barracks in lebanon 
the book is subtitled the abduction of lebanon an allusion 
to repeated disastrous foreign interventions in the ancient land 
of cedars whose revenge was to welcome all her invaders and kiss 
them to death 
a reviewer of the books british edition who had followed fisks 
adventurous reportage for the times of london and later the 
independent confessed i am amazed to see that he is still 
alive and writing 
the 44yearold british correspondent says the book was inspired 
in part by his friend and colleague terry anderson the associated 
press middle east correspondent who was kidnapped on a west beirut 
street in march 1985 anderson the longest held of 13 western 
hostages in lebanon paid the price for staying on the story 
fisk wrote 
fisk stayed because he too felt a commitment to a protracted 
violent story which you cant cover long range 
andersons dignified behavior in captivity has done nothing 
but enhance the standing of journalists fisk said in an 
interview i hear nothing bad said about terry in beirut 
fisk himself narrowly averted abducion by gunmen a year earlier 
after a french connectionlike car chase through the darkened 
streets of west beirut 
in his book fisk writes that andersons kidnappers were not the 
faceless terrorists the reagan administration professed them to 
be 
his principal captor was so well known that american agents 
tried to arrest him near paris when he was on holiday in france 
the french mindful of their own hostages forced the americans to 
leave him alone fisk wrote 
western intelligence agencies have fingered imad mughniyeh 
leader of the islamic jihad as the probable mastermind behind 
scores of kidnappings including that of anderson mughniyeh is 
wanted by the united states in the 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner 
in which a us navy diver was killed 
fisks book is critical of the lowprofile approach taken by the 
associated press in the immediate aftermath of andersons 
kidnapping fisk favored a direct personal appeal for aid to 
syrian president hafez assad whose troops control a wide area of 
lebanon 
andersons kidnapping prompted most western news organizations 
to withdraw their american and european staffers from beirut fisk 
and his wife lara marlowe of the financial times wound up as the 
last western correspondents living in moslem west beirut 
toward the end of the book fisk writes it seemed that 
lebanon had become an epic of lost souls of missing men and women 
people who had disappeared had been arrested and not returned 
kidnapped tortured dead 
nearly six years after andersons kidnapping fisk reports 
the traditional respect for journalists as impartial observers is 
not dead though critically damaged in lebanon 
but he sees signs of hope now that moslem and christian militia 
men are withdrawing from beirut some areas are safer than a year 
ago at the moment it has gotten a lot less worrisome to report if 
they the lebanese combatants are sure of your good intentions 
fisk said 
fisks reporting from the arab side of the middle east conflict 
has led some israeli officials and supporters to challenge fisks 
good intentions and objectivity israeli president chaim herzog is 
quoted in the book as telling his irish counterpart garret 
firzgerland in 1985 that fisk was a virulent hater of israel 
fisk was then also writing for the irish times 
all journalists who work in the arab world are forced to 
report what they see fisk said if israeli air raids killed 
women and children it was our duty to report it you cannot change 
the rules and integrity of your profession if you happen to report 
on israel in an arab country 
while the bulk of the book deals critically with the 1982 
israeli invasion of lebanon and its bitter consequences fisk also 
disapproves of the conduct of the palestinians the syrians the 
various lebanese militias and the united states us troops who 
came as peacekeepers and left as combatants were withdrawn from 
beirut after the 1983 truckbombing of the us marine barracks 
killed 241 americans 
fisk sees some parallels between american entanglement in the 
lebanese conflict and their present buildup in the persian gulf 
fisk refers in the book to the american onetwothree school of 
politics which we in beirut so derided military action followed 
by political aims followed by a solution 
the gulf buildup he said involves the same illusion the 
notion that the united states can remain israels best friend and 
still be the honest broker in the middle east

as you might expect those involved in real 
estate in its many forms are searching for answers wondering what 
happened and looking for flickers of hope 
there is grim reality for example as expressed by douglas

the days of selfdelusion are gone says tibbetts any 
thought of a soft landing in real estate is gone as well 
we are in a cleansing stage like in a washing machine this 
is the hot water wash now then well rinse out a lot of the people 
in the industry and take a tossing and tumbling for a while in the

newsletter for housing executives tell you about it

will be a short one the current quarter will be the first to see 
minus growth it is hard to imagine the first or second quarter of 
1991 will perform any better 
lowering interest rates is clearly a good move but 50 basis 
points are not going to make much difference there is very little 
the administration burdened with so much debt can do to stimulate 
the economy 
the sampl crisis will take several years to settle add to this 
the problems with the banks and other financial intermediaries and 
we will be in a financial squeeze for some time 
but there is hope too an article in realtor news a weekly 
publication of the national association of realtors tells why it 
begins this way 
lower mortgage interest rates could be a key factor that sets 
the national singlefamily home sales rate back on an upward path 
this coming spring presaging a decade of healthy growth 
it cites forecasts by three economists who monitor the housing 
industry 
roger brinner chief economist for the mcgrawhill financial 
services co sees strong housing markets for the remainder of the 
1990s housing is going to be a growth industry he said 
mortgage rates will fall said john tuccillo the nars own 
economist and barbara allen a housing analyst for kidder peabody 
amp co the investment firm said the baby boomers will remain a 
strong force in the market 
why there may even be more than hope there might be 
opportunity in the midst of the gloom not sometime in the future 
but now ready to be pounced upon by aggressive investors and not 
just good opportunities but perhaps better than have been seen in 
a decade 
richard grillo an international real estate investment adviser 
and partner in the new york firm of weatherall green amp smith 
presents this view 
for those american real estate companies willing to accept the 
challenge europe offers a window of opportunity that wont be open 
long most appealing are yields on prime investmentgrade real 
estate in the united kingdom 
in practice a mixed uk portfolio with suitably staggered 
rent review patterns should provide us investors with a 
combination of stability and capital growth unheard of in the us 
over the last 10 years 
no you cant keep them down long the real estate buyers 
sellers developers and financiers in fact the fundamental real 
estate problem may be to constrain the enthusiasm of participants 
that enthusiasm gets them into trouble they just love to hear 
the tumble and grind of the concrete mixer at a new building site 
and because they do they often end up in the washing machine 
instead tumbled about and spun dry

among inhouse white house headaches a 
reversed ruling against minority scholarships is likely to prove 
more troublesome for president bush than the embarrassment of 
naming a republican party chairman who quit before taking the job 
both episodes point to disarray in an administration undergoing 
some secondyear remodeling both were the sort of surprises 
presidents do not like both came in areas where the white house 
already had problems civil rights and political management 
bush got no warning and there was no consultation with his top 
aides before an assistant education secretary ruled that 
scholarships reserved for blacks and other minorities were out of 
bounds at colleges and universities that receive federal funds the 
same official overhauled his ruling on tuesday at white house 
insistence the new version permits such scholarships so long as 
they are privately financed 
bush said he didnt think it was a flipflop 
there was a flipflop though the politically awkward exit of 
william j bennett two weeks after bush announced he wanted the 
former drug policy boss to become chairman of the republican 
national committee 
bennett withdrew on dec 13 saying a second reading by the 
white house lawyer raised doubt that he could properly accept 
speechmaking and consulting fees during the next year if he took 
the job 
it was his old government job not the party position that 
posed the problem federal ethics law forbids former federal 
officials from lobbying their old colleagues on behalf of private 
employers for a year after leaving office in bennetts case that 
could have been construed as applying to contacts he might have 
made as party chairman on matters of interest to private 
organizations that paid him for speeches 
the party job pays 125000 a year and other chairman in both 
parties have earned outside income to add to their salaries 
bennett said the difference is that they came out of private life 
not executive branch jobs 
bennett made 240000 in speech fees during the four months he 
was out of the government between tours as ronald reagans 
secretary of education and bushs drug policy director he also has 
a book contract that paid him an advance of 187500 
his circumstances didnt change during the three weeks from 
choice to announcement to withdrawal the advice changed 
bennett said in withdrawing 
a president ought to be able to count on better more durable 
advice than that when he chooses somebody for an appointment the 
bennett affair drew taunts from democrats and from conservative 
republicans as well 
the conservatives first suspected that the choice of bennett was 
an attempt to control a voice that might have joined theirs in 
dissent against bush for what some of them say is a turn away from 
ronald reagans legacy when he withdrew they began suggesting 
that bennett had been pushed because he wasnt willing to take his 
commands from john h sununu the white house chief of staff 
john sununu is a close friend of mine bennett said he is 
and this is a message partly to my fellow conservatives one of 
the best and most longstanding conservatives in america 
except as a political footnote that chapter will close when the 
republican national committee confirms bushs backup choice for 
chairman on jan 25 
the scholarship issue may persist although the administration 
got it turned around before congress convened recess hearings on 
the subject it may well come up again next year when 
congressional democrats renew their drive for the civil rights bill 
they could not push past a bush veto this fall 
the democrats say the initial ruling against racebased 
scholarships fits the pattern set in republican administrations 
and they may write into their 1991 bill a provision to guarantee 
that colleges and universities can reserve scholarships for blacks 
and other minority students 
bush said he thinks the scholarship question eventually will be 
settled by the courts he said he might be open to legislation on 
it the president praised michael j williams assistant secretary 
of education for civil rights who issued the ruling and the 
amendments williams a black lawyer with a long record in civil 
rights said he had been naive not to anticipate the controversy 
theres more of it coming

piles of garbage choke streets drug 
deals and murders are common housing projects have been flooded 
with raw sewage and weedinfested vacant lots checker the city 
east st louis is a 47 million sinkhole a city so burdened by 
debt that some of its police cars lack tail lights and city hall 
was sold to pay a court judgment 
to mike riddle its a place where houses fall down and nothing 
comes back up 
when they tear down a house they dont put another one up 
and the weeds just take over its just rundown said riddle a 
school custodianand longtime resident 
to sandra woods its a place so rough that cabbies wont come 
when called fear of crime makes for sleepless nights and her 
grandchildren wait in the rain for school buses that dont run on 
time 
its pitiful she said 
east st louis once was bustling with chemical metal and glass 
works but labor troubles crime and corruption in the 1960s led to 
white flight the population was 82000 in 1960 but has shrunk to 
40000 today the city is virtually all black 
the citys 63 slayings in 1989 gave it the highest percapita 
murder rate in the fbis national rankings and police say they are 
overwhelmed by drugrelated crime residents talk about their fears 
of gang fights and driveby shootings 
last year east st louis crumbling sewers flooded a school and 
a housing project with raw sewage the city in january was 
convicted of reckless conduct for endangering police officers by 
failing to outfit squad cars with working radios head and tail 
lights and other basics 
east st louis has so little money that a judge awarded its 6 
million city hall building as a damage payment to a man who was 
beaten in the city jail by another inmate the beating victim has 
sold the building to an undisclosed buyer but the city is 
appealing the damage award 
in the poorest parts of town drivers inch cars between 
3foothigh piles of trash that squeeze streets to one lane two 
years ago the city stopped picking up garbage and people cant 
pay anyone else to do it 
burned and abandoned downtown buildings are left to rot and 
fall within sight of the skyscrapers and gateway arch of more 
prosperous st louis across the mississippi river 
potholes create caverns in virtually every street and on some 
days the air stings with the smoke of burning tires dumped and 
torched in vacant lots 
there are bright spots in some neighborhoods the ranchstyle 
homes are lovingly maintained with flower beds manicured lawns 
and freshly paved driveways 
but bars over the windows tell of the citys dangers and next 
to a house that would fit in any middleclass suburb is a 
dilapidated home with a junked car outside 
such contrasts are the legacy of those who refuse to leave and 
those who cant 
a lot of people stay here because they cant afford to go 
anywhere else said russell hudlin president of the chamber of 
commerce and owner of a gas station and convenience store 
others stay because the city offers familiarity proximity to 
jobs and shopping in st louis and a thriving night life hudlin 
said 
downtown east st louis many bars offer rhythm and blues 
liquor and liveliness long after st louis clubs must close 
hudlin considers the night life a chance for municipal growth 
but the city cannot raise enough revenue to make improvements or 
hire workers despite having one of the highest property tax rates 
in the state homeowners pay 950 for every 100 of assessed 
value 
most major industries sit outside the city limits providing no 
tax base and its estimated that more than half of city residents 
get government aid 
in 1989 132 percent of east st louis residents were without 
work not including the chronically unemployed or those on welfare 
according to the illinois department of employment security 
city officials now pin their hopes on gambling and the state 
east st louis has been chosen to receive one of five riverboat 
gambling licenses in illinois and pending state approval of 
private operators officials hope to develop a riverboat port 
within a few years 
the city also expects 34 million in state loans including 4 
million for immediate needs such as police and firefighting 
equipment road repairs and garbage pickup the rest will be used 
for longterm improvements and debt consolidation 
the entire sum being raised by a statebacked bond issue must 
be repaid over several decades 
the catch is that the mayor and aldermanic council must get 
their annual budget approved by a stateappointed bailout 
authority and spending is monitored by an investment banking firm 
working for the state 
if the state doesnt like the budget it can take control of 
city finances and intercept bailout payments 
the authority has been holding back a 375 millionloan 
installment because the city missed the deadline to submit its 1991 
budget the aldermanic council this month finally approved a 57 
millionbudget at the demand of the authority 
last month residents voted to have city officials hire a 
professional city manager 
on the whole we are at ground zero and we can only go up 
said hudlin the chamber of commerce head you can only imagine 
if we pay our debts and get back on our feet again what we can 
do 
riddle seemed to agree as he stood across the street from a 
vacant lot and abandoned building 
i believe the people of east st louis dont give a hoot who 
owns the city they just want to see it improve he said 
theres a lot of people who love this city

americans might put off buying a new car or 
stereo until the economy improves but will they be shopping 
differently at the supermarket 
yes no and maybe food industry analysts say 
food in general is pretty recessionproof compared to durable 
goods even higherpriced items do well said max busetti editor 
of the food industry newsletter in alexandria va people who 
want to treat themselves will buy dove bars and cut down on more 
expensive durable goods 
pastas soups cereals potatoes and beer are considered classic 
recessionproof food items to this list busetti adds a 90s 
update budgetpriced convenience foods 
the past decade witnessed a surge in carryout and convenience 
foods and busetti said theres no going back to scratch 
people dont have time for scratch he said they will 
concentrate more on convenience products that will give them 
value 
busetti singled out gourmettype frozen meals which already are 
showing declining sales as a product that would suffer 
theyre going to stop buying le menu at 350 a pop and go 
back to swansons i expect theyll go back to pot pie he said 
but john mcmillin food industry analyst with prudentialbache 
securities in new york predicted people would not change their 
shopping habits appreciably 
theyll still buy hellmans instead of the storebrand 
mayonnaise if thats what they like except maybe theyll cut 
coupons for it mcmillin said 
the real savings will come from breaking the eating out habit 
he said 
we spend 8 percent of our disposable income on food at home 
we now spend almost that much on food away from home unless we 
have a pretty severe recession i think most people will cut 
corners by simply eating at home more he said 
that view was challenged by industry analyst phil lempert of 
the montclair nj based lempert report 
people wont eat out less but will go to less expensive 
restaurants he predicted and folks definitely will bargainhunt 
at the supermarket 
the three analysts did agree that value was the buzzword of the 
90s 
during the mid70s downturn gourmet items came into their own 
lempert said 
people who couldnt afford to buy a new car or refrigerator 
would buy fancy food for the image it presented if i can buy 
brie at 5 a pound i can show my friends im still doing well as 
a matter of fact im not sure upscale items like brie would have 
mae it without a recessionary period he said 
health concerns fat salt cholesterol have turned shoppers 
into label readers and theyll use that skill to determine if a 
product offers value for the money lempert said 
when asked if his remark about splurging on dove bars applied to 
more extravagant purchases like champagne or 30apound chocolate 
truffles busetti said the mood is different even if they can 
afford it people dont want to present an extravagant image they 
might still buy chocolate but they might not buy godiva 
chocolate 
not surprisingly godiva chocolatier president thomas fey said 
his product would do well 
i think chocolate in the past and foods packaged as gift 
items in general have proved fairly recessionproof he said 
godiva is an affordable luxury you can buy a halfpound for 15 
you cant buy too many luxury items for that price 
similarly ken himmel vice chairman of sutton place gourmet 
inc stressed value in his companys pricy goods sutton place 
gourmet with offices in rockville md operates three fancy food 
stores in the washington area 
people are working harder and working longer because of the 
economy which no longer provides time for eating out or preparing 
foods he said 
so the thai shrimp and scallops at 1598 a pound may sound 
steep but its cheaper than eating in a restaurant he said 
the hansen caviar company in englewood nj was one of the 
few food purveyors to admit that retail sales were down from last 
year but spokesman richard bernstein said overall sales were up 
because the company has expanded its mailorder and executive gifts 
departments 
hansen learned from the 1973 recession that customers reverted 
to entertaining at home a boon to the mailorder side bernstein 
said people also are buying lesser grades of caviar such as 
sevruga and osetra instead of beluga he said 
and then theres a more prosaic foodstuff soup 
david hackney a spokesman for the campbells soup company in 
camden nj said soup is living up to its reputation as a food 
that does well during hard times 
in october campbells introduced 20ounce cans of its most 
popular condensed soups that sell for 15 percent less than two 11 
ounce cans 
the 80s trend toward singleserving sizes is out although the 
portability of the companys 8ounce microwave soup adds value to 
the product because someone can economize by taking it to the 
office and heating it up there rather than go out for lunch 
hackney said 
people seem to be moving back to what we call the center of 
the supermarket buying more canned packaged and dry goods less 
stuff from the supermarket deli and bakery he said 
does that mean a return to eating spaghetti in cans 
god forbid said lempert

they spent their youth fighting the 
communists in china and their middle age building an economic 
miracle in taiwan under us protection now they are old and want 
to go home 
falling leaves should return to the roots said an aging 
member of the chinese nationalist party we dont want to be away 
from home forever 
he and other diehard anticommunists long for reunification and 
the strength of their desire is pulling taiwan apart 
many native taiwanese who account for 85 percent of the 
islands 20 million people say they want to remain apart from the 
huge poor authoritarian country on the mainland 
they fear the success of taiwans developing democracy and 
powerful economy will evaporate if beijing takes over 
relations between the rival governments have thawed in recent 
years and hundreds of old nationalists have visited china several 
have met contemporaries who lead china like president yang 
shangkun whom they fought in the civil war that ended with a 
communist victory in 1949 
in may deng xiaoping paramount leader of china held his first 
meeting with a nationalist party member in more than 40 years 
many in taiwans old guard want reunification talks to begin 
now while they still hold power most will be forced out of the 
government by the end of 1991 under a program to dismantle an 
authoritarian system that has ensured nationalist rule 
look germany has united and south korea is talking with the 
north said yen 86 an electoral college member who spoke on 
condition only his surname be used our leaders keep saying there 
is only one china but if we dont hold talks at all there wont 
be reunification in 100 years 
hsu hsinliang a leader of the opposition democratic 
progressive party bemoans what he calls the romanticism of people 
like yen 
we are more worried that these oldsters would join hands with 
the communists to attack nationalist liberals and thus hamper 
taiwans democratization he said 
in a letter to president yang and premier li peng of china the 
democracy alliance in taiwan accused the old nationalists of 
making their last try to sell out taiwan before retiring 
president lee tenghui born in taiwan has pledged to seek 
reunification but is proceeding cautiously as conditions for 
talks he said in a recent speech that china must promote democracy 
and a free economic system renounce the use of force and end its 
policy of isolating taiwan diplomatically 
members of the nationalist old guard in a remarkable reversal 
of past attitudes have described lees position as too harsh 
its like asking your enemy to cut his tongue before you agree 
to talk to him yen said bitterly how long must we wait before 
they practice democracy in 10 years all of us oldsters will die 
how will talks proceed then 
chang yujen an 84yearold national assemblyman and former 
general agreed it was time for reunification he led nationalist 
troops against communist rebels in central china in the 1940s but 
now has a different attitude toward his old foes 
whats left of chinese communism is but a scaffold without a 
building he said its rise was a tragedy of the times it has 
now fallen the trend is for dialogue and reforms 
yen and chang revisited china recently and say their wish is to 
see reunification talks begin before they die the old leaders in 
beijing echo the feeling 
deng said in a meeting with retired nationalist gen teng wenyi 
in beijing in may that he hoped for peaceful reunification in three 
years both are 86 and they once were schoolmates 
president yang told visiting editors of china times a major 
taiwan newspaper the problem should be resolved while the old 
communist and nationalist party leaders still live 
chang and yen are among more than 600 officeholders who were 
elected in china before 1949 and left in office to support the 
nationalist claim to be the sole legitimate government of all 
china 
they fear new deputies who replace them under the 
democratization plan will vote to declare taiwan independent of 
china which has threatened military action if it happens

in the vast rolling countryside 
of the northern transvaal efforts to end apartheid have sown 
conflict between white farmers and millions of blacks who want 
land 
the government has promised that laws prohibiting blacks from 
owning property in most of the country will be scrapped next year 
instead of easing tension plans to repeal the land acts have 
illuminated the deep divisions between blacks and whites about 
south africas future 
historical injustices resulting from landgrabbing over three 
centuries cannot easily be rectified now the star newspaper said 
in an editorial 
under the land laws 87 percent of south africa is reserved for 
the 5 million whites most of it agricultural land owned by fewer 
than 50000 farmers 
the 30 million blacks can own property only in black townships 
around cities and in the 10 tribal homelands on the remaining and 
worst 13 percent of south africas land 
how to undo the disparity is a contentious issues for the 
government and such black opposition groups as the african national 
congress as they negotiate a new constitution that will give blacks 
political power 
to blacks reform means reversing decades of injustice when 
laws perpetuated the white expansion that drove them from the land 
of their ancestors 
most delegates to a recent anc workshop on land reform approved 
a statement saying the state should play the principal role in 
effecting a major redistribution of land 
many white farmers see land reform as a leftist plot to strip 
them of their godgiven heritage as the proper caretakers of the 
land 
we feel there is no way the blacks are going to go onto our 
land said bill ruthven a supporter of the proapartheid 
conservative party 
south africas land acts of 1913 and 1936 forced blacks with 
small farms to give them up and move to homelands or work for 
whites the anc and other antiapartheid groups say those who lost 
their land should get it back and large portions of the country 
should be turned over to blacks 
the existing inequitable distribution of land must end said 
joanne yawitch coordinator of the private national land committee 
in order to redress the apartheid legacy theres going to have 
to be a strong policy of affirmative action 
ms yawitch also is an administrator of the anc land commission 
a central recommendation of the anc workshop was a strong 
government role in redistributing land including a program of 
loans and grants available to people of all races 
president fw de klerks government has offered no formal land 
policy but said current title deeds of farmers and landowners 
are safe 
the south african development bank which provides government 
loans for homeland developmewnt has suggested turning over 5 
million acres of stateowned land to blacks it also recommends 
that about 1000 white farmers with heavy debts to the government 
land bank sell their land to blacks in exchange for debt 
writeoffs 
such proposals smack of socialism to ruthven and other white 
farmers 
most are afrikaners the descendents of dutch settlers who 
dominate the government they were raised on the doctrine that god 
chose them to live in south africa and farm the land 
afrikaner farmers generally believe de klerk has betrayed his 
people by seeking to share power with blacks some belong to 
extreme rightwing groups that have organized private armies and 
vowed to keep their land 
piet swart director of the allwhite south african agricultural 
union said i dont think we need any government agency going 
around and telling people to whom to sell and for how much 
it isnt only a question of changing land ownership you have 
to have the wealth and entrepreneurial skills i think change is 
going to come not only in agriculture its going to take time it 
must take time 
his organization contends market forces alone should determine 
who buys and sells property after the land acts are gone 
swart granted such a policy would maintain the status quo since 
few blacks would have the money to buy farmland 
johann hartman of the transvaal agriculture union the most 
conservative chapter of the national organization said the debate 
should focus on how best to use the land 
agricultural land should be utilized for maximum production 
to feed the people of the land and not for political purposes he 
said 
ruthven a burly bearded man of 53 fears the government or 
independent agencies will provide loans or grants for blacks to buy 
land he also opposes affirmative action programs intended to help 
blacks become farmers 
for 300 years the white people have been doing this for 
blacks he said now were weaning them were not 
breastfeeding them anymore my nipples are sore

in this country there arent 
enough white people to handle all the managerial positions 
johann haasbroek said you have to use people of other 
cultures 
driving a pickup over bumpy trails cut through maize and wheat 
fields northwest of johannesburg the 57yearold farmer explained 
why he began promoting black workers more than a decade ago 
such radical action was considered suicidal in the rightwing 
world of south african farming but it worked for haasbroek who 
runs a successful family farm and is setting up another for his 
son 
he employs five whites and about 60 or 70 fulltime blacks 
at the main farm some of the black workers hire seasonal work 
crews and manage specific areas of the operation 
when i was young youd very seldom get a black man who wanted 
to be a foreman haasbroek said there was a lot of 
superstition more than now among the blacks they thought 
something would happen to them 
then need and ambition combined and about 12 years ago one 
of my black workers said he was willing to train as a foreman he 
said when pressed the farmer acknowledged encouraging the man 
i said you know it would be much easier if i could have one 
of you guys as foreman it would take a lot of responsibility off 
my hands he recalled 
new responsibilities led to new commitment on both sides 
haasbroek said workers displayed a better attitude he said and 
he let them open a school for their children on the farm 
some of the workers attended courses on farm management at 
government training centers at their employers expense 
they give the basics of how it should be done not only seen 
from a job point of view but communication among themselves and 
other things he said of the training centers 
the result of it all in haasbroeks view is a stable group of 
workers who take pride in the farm 
id never say it was expressed in words but in their way of 
doing things taking responsibility and doing it for themselves 
theyre all very proud of the farm he said 
for instance we have two soccer teams they always want to 
win theyre very proud of the team 
people are like trees haasbroek said with some growing taller 
and straighter than others 
the big thing is to be able to identify the bloke who can do 
it he said theres a lot of potential in these people waiting 
to be developed

slovak nationalism bottled up 
during generations of czech and hungarian domination often breaks 
loose in bratislava but hasnt affected this quiet village 40 
miles away 
a slovak woman who identified herself only as agneta said many 
children speak both languages in povoda a farming community of 600 
ethnic hungarians and 400 slovaks 
our only kindergarten is hungarian language she said 
most slovak parents send their children there it hasnt been a 
problem in the past and i dont see it as one in the future 
the people of povoda say they live in harmony 
as far as remaining part of czechoslovakia is concerned we 
all have more pressing daytoday worries ladislav dohnansky 
told a visitor 
down the street 5yearold dusan said my pop is slovak and 
my mom is hungarian and i feel both hungarian and slovak he 
switched languages during the conversation 
with the end of restrictive communist rule a year ago slovaks 
in czechoslovakias eastern republic gained the freedom to express 
their resentment of historic domination by hungary and more recent 
control by the majority czechs 
some nationalists show anger by painting over hungarian names one university 
but unless we have a big 
freeze that shouldnt continue 
the various changes put the index for all consumer goods and 
services at 1338 in november that means a hypothetical selection 
of goods and services that cost 100 on average in the 198284 base 
period cost 13380 last month up from 12590 a year ago 
in a separate report the labor department said americans real 
earnings increased a seasonally adjusted 05 percent still over 
the past year wages have not kept pace with inflation average 
weekly earnings for both fulltime and parttime nonsupervisory 
workers were 34849 in november up 3 percent from a year ago 
for the first 11 months of the year consumer prices rose at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 64 percent the worst rate 
since 1981 and well above last years 46 percent rate 
however economists expect the inflation rate to subside to 
between 3 percent and 4 percent next year as the slumping economy 
further weakens demand and as oil prices turn down

to the reviews of the sean connerymichelle 
pfeiffer spy movie the russia house add this one from david 
cornwell an 8 or 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 
whos david cornwell hes better known by his nom de plume 
john le carre he wrote the novel the russia house and a 
string of other books about the world of spooks and moles he is a 
softspoken benignlooking man with surprisingly strong opinions 
especially about how his works have been dramatized 
the russia house im very pleased with the film and 
very grateful its a very classy movie i think it contains 
the best performances of any dramatization of my stuff id give it 
an 8 to 9 out of 10 for my requirements 
its not my vision of the story and i dont expect it to be 
its got to function as a movie as long as the characters are not 
cast they live separately in everybodys imagination physically 
my barley the english publisher who is enlisted in the spy plot 
looked more like peter otoole gangly and more strange 
the spy who came in from the cold 1966 i thought it 
was pretty good and it stands up it was a terrible pity that it 
was shot in black and white i was never comfortable with richard 
burton i thought that he at that time was beginning to look 
debauched rather than experienced i wished we had had somebody 
like a trevor howard or a peter finch somebody more rugged i 
always thought that burton had a soft center 
the deadly affair 1966 sidney lumet made a little 
movie of my first book with james mason simone signoret max 
schell harry andrews it didnt quite work 
the looking glass war 1969 a perfectly dreadful film 
which to my mind didnt rate at all it was embarrassing and 
disappeared quickly 
the little drummer girl 1984 one of those failures 
which in retrospect annoy me deeply there was no studio 
interference george roy hill could make the film he wanted to it 
should have been a lovely movie but we somehow got the wrong spine 
out of it the wrong thread in my view in retrospect it was 
terribly miscast diane keaton was the spy it was embarrassing 
and i was quite pleased when it left the screen 
le carre said that the longform of the pbstv miniseries 
sometimes better suited his books tinker tailor soldier spy 
was absolutely wonderful and smileys people was not at 
all bad alec guinness played the burnedout george smiley in 
both 
we spoke of an actors limiting ones perception of 
characters said the author alec didnt do that he left the 
possibilities of smiley open in the eyes of the beholder 
john le carre has been the premier chronicler of cold war 
espionage but he feels no loss from the wars end 
for me it was absolutely wonderful he said i was sick 
of writing about the cold war the cheap joke was to say poor old 
le carre hes run out of material theys taken his berlin wall 
away 
the reverse was true i wondered what more there was to be 
said about a lockedup confrontation that was going on and on and 
on everything was becoming so stereotyped i was trying to thaw 
the ice in my own imagination i thought i had ended the cycle in 
smileys people then i went back to it with a perfect spy 
then the russia house i really thought was ending it 
le carre figures he makes the break with his new book the 
secret pilgrim 
ned who is played by james fox in the russia house is 
approaching 60 and is the head of training in british 
intelligence he said he invites smiley to address the 
passout dinner when new agents go out to their assignments 
through that device we go back through a series of linked episodes 
in neds life it makes it a kind of fictional autobiography of the 
cold war then a pondering on who we are now that the eastwest 
confrontation is over 
who we are is really a serious mystery to us because we have 
been identified by our enemies for a long time capitalism was seen 
as the godly version of communism if you like that convenient 
kind of reference has disappeared communism is now a minority 
religion 
in a strange way were a force without an opponent we can 
talk about saddam hussein but we cant turn islam into 
communism 
he remains astounded by the onrush of events in eastern europe 
but le carre has no concern about finding new material 
the spy story has only to pack up its bags and go where the 
action is he said the whole world wants intelligence on the 
middle east on central america south america what the hell is 
going to happen to cuba now that its a leftover imperial colony 
with no empire to control it africa is constantly in flames 
southeast asia is a mystery will the new wave take over in china 
these are massive requirements of the intelligence system 
insofar as the spy novel goes ahead of that or behind that the 
espionage industry is having a boom time

bill laimbeer was embarrassed 
the baddest of the detroit pistons bad boys groaned meekly and 
squirmed like a boy just kissed by his sister 
he was on the radio with jp mccarthy detroits king of the 
airwaves 
with mccarthy painting a kinder gentler picture of the pistons 
swaggering scowling basketball forward laimbeer was reduced to a 
mushy 6foot11 slice of humble pie 
hes the no 1 guy around laimbeer said of mccarthy whose 
610 am radio show consistently tops the local ratings hes a 
powerful guy i wouldnt want to have him on my case 
heady stuff from a guy whos made a career of offending 
millions 
but thats the sway joseph priestley mccarthy holds after 26 
years as the top radio personality in americas sixthlargest radio 
market 
mccarthys power rests on the audience he has built 
politicians business executives and other community leaders 
frequently appear on his show to get their message out even those 
who rarely give interviews to other news media people 
what mccarthy has been able to do is sit down and converse 
with the ford worker the housewife in troy or the janitor down in 
toledo said don fitzpatrick president of don fitzpatrick 
associates a television talent and management recruiting company 
in san francisco 
with a mellifluous pullupachair voice that could melt the 
polar ice cap mccarthy hands out compliments on his morning show 
and the early afternoon focus interview program like a letter 
carrier delivers the mail 
hes got a captivating personality a voice that sounds like 
heres a guy that wouldnt fool with you said neal shine 
publisher of the detroit free press the morning newspaper in the 
city of about 1 million 
but mccarthy is more than a backslapper 
he can converse freely and without preparation with presidents 
and pitchers millionaires and mothers if theres a question that 
needs asking hell ask it straight answers usually follow 
if he asks you a tough question you feel obligated to answer 
it shine said 
born in new york and raised on detroits east side mccarthy got 
his first broadcasting job in 1955 with armed services radio in 
fairbanks alaska 
he worked three months at wtacam in flint mich before 
starting at detroits wjr in 1957 he spent two years at kgoam in 
san francisco in the early 1960s and then returned to detroit and 
wjr on dec 7 1964 
mccarthy said he came back to wjr with an eye on bigger things 
i really thought i wasnt going to be here very long he 
said i thought i was going to los angeles or new york but you 
get caught up in something thats going pretty well 
arbitron co a new yorkbased marketing information service 
company estimates about 36 million people over age 12 those who 
count in marketshare studies live in detroit and surrounding 
counties 
but jp is heard by many more folks because of wjrs 
50000watt clearchannel signal which federal regulations 
protects from competition within a 750mile radius the stations 
regular daytime audience extends throughout michigan and into 
canada northern indiana northeastern illinois most of ohio and 
western pennsylvania 
partly because of his popularity and partly because of wjrs 
range there are few people mccarthy cant get on the air 
he talked with george bush on a live telephone hookup the day 
before he was sworn in as president govelect john engler was in 
the studio the morning after he upset gov james blanchard 
jeopardy game show host alex trebek was a recent focus 
guest 
i look forward to different people for different reasons 
mccarthy said my favorite interview will be the next good one i 
have 
abctv says mccarthy was among the leading candidates to take 
over as host of good morning america when david hartman retired 
in 1986 but mccarthy says hes still bitter because he feels he 
wasnt given a fair shot at the job which went to charles gibson 
mccarthy had a television program on wjbktv in detroit in 
198386 and he says hed go back to tv for the right opportunity 
but im really quite happy where i am he said 
he gets eight weeks vacation a salary that industry experts 
estimate between 300000 and 500000 a year national advertising 
contracts with chrysler and kelly services a work day that 
invariably ends at noon and farflung influence 
he gets more time off than johnny carson said basketball 
commentator dick vitale a former pistons coach and a regular guest 
on mccarthys show when he was told on a recent program mccarthy 
was on vacation 
mccarthy said he enjoys the privileges he has earned 
i kind of like being jp mccarthy i suppose i enjoy the 
power its fun

theres no hiding the festive spirit inside the 
spectacular apartment where imelda marcos lives high above the 
manhattan skyline with a sweeping view of the east river 
there are not one but two artificial christmas trees in the 
living room one snowwhite and festooned with pink ribbons and 
another traditional green tree with ornaments in one corner mrs 
marcos plays the piano as members of her staff look on admiringly 
but appearances can be deceiving all is not going well for mrs 
marcos 
though she was acquitted on all counts following a lengthy trial 
on federal racketeering and fraud charges in july she faces a 
myriad of civil lawsuits 
a multimilliondollar civil suit based on the same racketeering 
charges as the criminal trial has been lodged against her by the 
philippine government in los angeles federal court that case 
should go to trial in about a year 
the us government also intends to retry mrs marcos on those 
same charges in a separate civil suit next year 
worse still she says because she is viewed as a security 
threat mrs marcos is required to notify and receive permission 
from the us justice department at least 48 hours before she wants 
to leave manhattan 
she has no passport and her current lawyer james linn of 
oklahoma city said the federal government has not indicated when 
it might lift the travel restrictions against her the filipino 
government does not want her back 
the former filipino mother of the nation has become a 
reallife prisoner of second avenue tethered to her home near the 
united nations 
i am beleaguered said mrs marcos during a recent interview 
in her 42ndfloor apartment on dag hammarskjold plaza one of 
several she rents in the building 
do you know what its like to survive without freedom in a 
foreign country you try to uphold your dignity but youre living 
in a vacuum youre not in your own country youre uprooted 
all she wants mrs marcos said is to return to the philippines 
so i can flourish and grow and live and love again she also 
wishes to bring back the remains of her husband for a proper 
burial 
its overwhelming mrs marcos said of her predicament 
its good that im oriental im attuned to the spirit of zen 
buddhism that you are nothing and everything at the same time 
ferdinand marcos died in hawaii in september 1989 three years 
after he was swept from power in a peoples revolution led by 
corazon aquino 
his declining health and his demise meant he was spared a trial 
on charges that he and his wife illegally transferred 160 million 
from the philippines and defrauded financial institutions of 165 
million 
mrs marcos went to trial and was acquitted six months later 
she continues to protest her innocence and that of her husband 
marcos was not bad he was not considered a thief until he 
landed here she said the cia interpol they all knew marcos 
for 20 years then all of a sudden he is a thief it is all a 
mistake 
she displays sheaves of documents attesting to the marcoses 
finances and even an affectionate letter that president reagan 
wrote to them shortly after they arrived in hawaii in exile reagan 
called marcos a patriot 
now she said she has become a pariah as a result of what she 
sees as an unfounded and puzzling public persecution 
the marcos issue has become so humongous that every leader in 
this country is afraid to touch me with a 10foot pole she said 
as she talked mrs marcos sat at the dining room table 
clutching a rosary she wore a black dress with a beaded necklace 
and scarf and matching black suede shoes her nails were polished 
in a pink and white french manicure 
she also wore a pair of diamond sapphire and ruby earrings with 
a matching ring two pieces of the jewelry she says she hurriedly 
stuffed into her grandchildrens diapers when she and her husband 
were given one hour to clear out of malacanang palace in manila in 
february 1986 
though even her former lawyer gerry spence labeled her a 
worldclass shopper during her trial mrs marcos insisted that 
most of her purchases were for the good of her country 
i shopped for my country because for 400 years the whole world 
shopped on my country she said i started buying paintings and 
all sorts of things to bring the world back to the philippines i 
wanted to rebuild our cultural identity 
mrs marcos infamous shoe collection remains in manila she 
said she now has only about two dozen pairs in her manhattan 
closets 
but mrs marcos said she has no attachment to material 
things 
i would shop more for others she said most of my jewelry 
and valuables were given to me by my family and my husband 
she said she has no regrets allowing that if she did do 
anything unseemly it was merely out love and responsibility 
for her country 
one makes mistakes but they arent deliberate she said 
if there was an excess it was because my love for my country was 
in excess 
her extravagant life in manila she said was fueled in part by 
her belief that a first lady is someone who the people want to 
look up to you had to be a star 
the woman who had 15000 people at her wedding after a courtship 
that lasted 11 days now lives quietly with a small household staff 
and a fw old friends who check on her regularly her son 
ferdinand jr lives in new york her two daughters are abroad 
she said she needs no more than two or three hours of sleep a 
night and fills her days conferring with her lawyer about pending 
cases most of of her former entourage known as the blue 
ladies rarely contact her she said out of fear they will be 
punished by the current filipino regime 
she is not entirely gloomy she eagerly shows photographs of her 
visits with world leaders from fidel castro to saddam hussein she 
proudly displays pictures of cultural centers and hospitals she 
built in the philippines 
she giggles flirtatiously with her lawyer and a photographer as 
members of her staff hover and look at her in adoration 
things dont faze me she said i dont miss being in the 
palace because the palace is in my heart 
but she does miss the philippines 
im a widow she said my husband is dead and im 
orphaned from my motherland its inhumane and immoral

sam eagle staff still mourns the death 
of the several hundred sioux who fell in a cold grassy valley when 
us cavalry troops opened fire on an indian camp a century ago 
we feel it was a murdering of our people without weapons 
says eagle staff whose uncle was one of the victims what 
happened there must have been a nightmare something hard to live 
with if you were there 
the dec 29 1890 bloodshed at wounded knee was the last major 
armed conflict between government troops and indians it also wiped 
out the siouxs last dream of ridding their lands of white 
invaders 
the army called it a battle 
the sioux call it a massacre a needless slaughter of mostly 
unarmed indian men women and children by cavalry troops seeking 
revenge for lt col george custers death at the battle of the 
little big horn in montana more than a decade earlier 
though they still feel hurt and sorrow many indians also see 
the 100th anniversary as a chance to mend the sioux nations sacred 
hoop their spiritual and cultural traditions 
riders on horseback are retracing the trail chief big foot took 
to wounded knee a century ago and ceremonies will be held saturday 
in memory of those slain at the southwestern south dakota site 
the lakota which is what the sioux call themselves see new 
hope for better race relations since south dakota gov george 
mickelson proclaimed 1990 as the year of reconciliation between 
indians and whites 
the anniversary offers the sioux a chance to tell their side of 
the story and to continue their effort to recover land 
particularly the nearby black hills which they consider sacred 
we want to send a note to everyone in the country and the 
world that this type of thing will never happen again to any 
indians or any nationality said eagle staff a leader of a group 
of descendants of wounded knee victims 
the site lies in a valley flanked by pinedotted ridges that 
provide the name for the pine ridge indian reservation the home of 
the oglala sioux tribe 
in a tiny cemetery atop a small knoll a chainlink fence 
surrounds a mass grave where 146 indians were buried in a long 
trench a tattered white flag flies over the site and pieces of 
cloth and bird feathers hang from the fence and flutter in the 
wind 
a stone monument for big foot and the people who died with him 
stands to the side of the burial trench part of the message carved 
in the stone says many innocent women and children who knew no 
wrong died here 
what happened still is debated accounts from indians and the 
cavalry differed greatly 
government records show about 150 indians were killed and 44 
were wounded while 30 or more soldiers died the sioux argue that 
at least 300 indians and perhaps more than 400 were slain at 
wounded knee 
the sioux had been the dominant tribe in the northern plains for 
about a century after getting horses from other tribes and guns 
from french traders the sioux warrior society peaked in 1876 when 
they defeated custer 
their fortunes rapidly went downhill after that however when 
treaties stripped them of land and forced them onto reservations in 
south dakota 
by 1890 the ghost dance religion had arisen with a promise that 
the land and the decimated buffalo herds would be restored to the 
sioux and the white man would be swept away 
after sioux leader sitting bull was killed miniconjou chief big 
foot led a band of about 400 sioux from central south dakota to 
seek refuge at the pine ridge indian reservation in southwestern 
south dakota 
cavalry troops found big foots band and by dec 29 the 
rebuilt 7th cavalry that custer had commanded at the little big 
horn joined the other soldiers big foots camp was flying a white 
flag 
accounts differ as to who fired first but the shooting began 
when the troops were collecting the indians guns according to the 
most common story two soldiers wrestled with an indian holding a 
gun and the weapon fired 
army officers said a warrior took a rifle hidden under a blanket 
and shot when they heard that the soldiers opened fire the ghost 
dance shirts worn by some of the indians did not protect them 
william horn cloud 84 of pine ridge heard the story of 
wounded knee from his father who was 14 when he survived the 
fight he and other descendants say soldiers drank heavily the 
night before and wanted to settle an old score 
they wanted revenge for custer says horn cloud they were 
there for one reason and i guess they had a barrel of whiskey with 
them 
since they were in a circle soldiers who died at wounded knee 
probably were killed by their own gunfire horn cloud says the 
same fusillade that cut down women and children as they tried to 
escape to a nearby ravine 
those soldiers were shooting those screaming kids down he 
said 
each december for the past four years alex white plume and 
others have mounted horses and followed the trail that led big 
foots band to their death they rode he said because they wanted 
to change the future of the sioux 
this years trail ride is the last one 
white plume whose greatgrandfather died at wounded knee said 
sioux holy man black elk described how the sacred hoop of the sioux 
nation was shattered at wounded knee seven generations later the 
sioux must mend the sacred hoop and rebuild themselves he said 
white plume is not the only sioux who is intent on looking 
forward the tribe lauds the governors reconciliation effort 
there is prejudice here in south dakota we hope to eliminate 
this some day said eagle staff it can be done but its going 
to take a long long time this is just the beginning 
the wounded knee survivors association asked congress to issue 
an apology pay compensation to descendants and create a national 
monument at wounded knee in october congress passed a resolution 
expressing deep regret for wounded knee many sioux said it 
wasnt much of an apology 
but eagle staff said members of the survivors group decided to 
accept the congressional resolution as an apology based on a 
pledge that more attention would be paid to the national monument 
and the compensation issue 
still there is a lingering distrust some want the government 
to revoke the congressional medals of honor given to soldiers who 
were at wounded knee 
horn cloud describes his idea for a monument some cannons on a 
hill with a statue of a soldier firing into a huddled group of 
indian children 
his chest would be all filled up with medals for bravery 
horn cloud said

a hundred years later theyre still fighting 
the battle of wounded knee in congress 
in october congress passed a resolution expressing the 
governments deep regret for the bloodshed that ended the 
indian wars on dec 29 1890 sen daniel inouye dhawaii 
chairman of the senate indian affairs committee said the 
resolution amounted to an official apology 
but the word apology was stricken from the draft that the 
descendants wanted passed and congress did not act on accompanying 
demands for reparations and a national monument 
we were promised things and then the promises never 
materialized said mario gonzalez a lawyer for the wounded knee 
survivors association which has 70 to 80 members 
members of south dakotas congressional delegation say theyll 
pursue compensation and a monument next year and the bush 
administration has embraced the idea of a monument 
the tangled politics and historical disputes that still surround 
the events of 100 years ago surfaced when frustrated descendants 
bitterly attacked the delegations two democrats 
sen tom daschle and rep tim johnson are rightwing indian 
haters at heart said gonzalez 
he called daschle the david duke of the north referring to 
the former ku klux klan leader who ran for us senate from 
louisiana 
theres a real macho cowboy attitude out there said suzan 
harjo a lobbyist for indian causes in washington if the 
congress of the united states had said we apologized i 
dont think that would have meant the end of the republic as we 
know it 
daschle said he intended to work doubly hard this next 
congress to see if we can obtain the necessary funds for a 
memorial that to me is critical 
the delegation also hopes to win compensation in the form of 
tribal health education housing and job benefits he said 
that would lead to the greatest reversal of many of the 
things that have happened in the last 100 years daschle said 
a bush administration official called wounded knee a massacre 
because of the deaths of women and children and noncombatants 
and unarmed men it is a massacre it is not an incident that 
should pass on december 29 without recognition on part of the 
government said knute knudson a former south dakotan who is 
deputy chief of staff for the us interior department 
between 150 and 400 sioux depending on the historical account 
were killed by us army cavalry troops at wounded knee on the pine 
ridge indian reservation in southwestern south dakota 
the descendants wanted congress to declare the site a national 
monument which would make it a part of the national park service 
and pay for the estimated 20000 in property that was taken from 
the victims plus interest 
the congressional delegation however was divided on the 
requests no committee hearing was held until late september and 
money for a park service study wasnt requested until october when 
it was too late 
south dakotans have widely differing opinions johnson said 
some wholeheartedly support the indians request others say 
indians were to blame for the killings 
the survivors association initially refused to accept the 
resolution as an apology but reversed itself after inouye promised 
to pursue the other requests next year 
i would sincerely hope that the wounded knee survivors 
association would reconsider accepting the resolution as the 
fulfillment of a welldeserved apology from the united states 
government inouye wrote 
the interior departments official position is that fewer people 
were killed than descendants claim but the department wants to do 
a yearlong study and plans to ask congress for the money next 
year knudson said

alejandro morfin ran his fingers over the 
hairline cracks creeping into the diego rivera mural of peasants 
bending over a bountiful wheat harvest 
these fissures didnt exist and theyre beginning to work 
their way up the art restorer said looking toward the top of 
the wall 
la era is one of 124 panels of frescoes rivera painted at 
the public education department one of the prolific muralists 
major works like other landmark buildings nearby the early 
20thcentury structure is shifting on the spongy clay lakebed under 
the citys historic downtown 
severe cracks from the big 1985 earthquake and the buildings 
structural faults add to the deterioration 
frescoes are painted directly on walls before the plaster dries 
and arent made to move as the building has settled some of the 
scenes of workers peasants revolutionary soldiers and high 
society painted on the walls of its inner patios in the 1920s have 
cracked 
six panels of the national treasures have had to be removed a 
risky tedious process used only as a last resort 
dozens of others have been sealed with cloth foam rubber and 
plywood bandages to protect them from further damage during 
restoration work on the building 
forests of crosshatched timbers shore up arches around the 
patios 
if it werent propped up it would have begun to fall down 
said morfin who heads a team of four protecting the murals until 
repairs are complete 
a jagged crack from the devastating earthquake of sept 19 
1985 splits the north and west walls from the top floor to the 
ground at morfins feet a crack breaks the red tile floor snakes 
up the 14foot walls on either side where murals had been removed 
and into the ceiling 
adding to the problems a huge staircase built in the 1940s 
pulls on the building it vibrates from traffic and construction 
work cracks run through it like networks of nerves to relieve 
pressure weight was removed the building moves to adjust 
the pumping of water to keep the excavated ruins of the aztecs 
great temple dry and on display has worsened the sinking problem 
for the education department metropolitan cathedral national 
palace and other buildings in the area said morfin and officials 
of the governments national center for conservation of artistic 
works 
the building is compressing its working with different 
pressures morfin said 
and as in many old buildings humidity seeps through its walls 
when the conservation center part of the national fine arts 
institute gave morfin responsibility for the rivera murals in 
march onethird were slated for special protection while the 
building is repaired now there are more than 60 
only the north and south walls were contemplated now we have 
to cover almost all the west he said 
rivera began the murals in early 1923 he had spent more than a 
decade in europe then returned in mexico to become reacquainted 
with his people and their problems after the 191021 revolution 
rejecting abstract art he directed his painting toward the 
masses rather than the elite creating a nationalist educational 
school that became internationally recognized 
scenes of peasants and laborers struggling to improve their 
lives meetings of the proletariat contrasting with fancy dinners 
of capitalists revolutionary martyrs heroes and soldiers are the 
result 
since the public education department more than any other 
public building is the building of the people the theme of its 
decoration could not be anything other than the life of the people 
themselves rivera is quoted as saying in an education department 
book on the murals 
on the second floor and part of the third a series of 
graytoned frescoes painted to look like low reliefs depict 
science architecture research dance music medicine and other 
intellectual pursuits they contrast with the rich colors of the 
other murals 
removing frescoes is a tricky business 
animal resin is applied then gauzy cotton and the painting is 
pulled off upside down on a table in a room set aside for the 
restoration project it is flattened under weights when the team 
is satisfied its turned right side up and a steam chamber is 
created to soften it hot compresses are applied and the cotton is 
peeled off gingerly 
its only done when theres a great risk of losing the work 
its a last resort said alejandro flores another member of the 
team 
of the six murals removed one is on display at a museum and the 
others are in storage or being restored 
officials hope to have the murals on display again in 1992 but 
say the project may take longer 
some of riveras other murals such as those at the national 
preparatory institute and the national palace are awaiting 
conservation teams 
dream of a sunday afternoon in alameda park was moved to a 
museum built behind the park after the del prado hotel was heavily 
damaged by the 1985 earthquake that mural was not painted directly 
on the wall however 
rivera also painted murals in san francisco detroit and new 
york murals done for rockefeller center in new york that included 
a portrait of lenin were destroyed

some bankers say theyre willing to chip in more 
to help rescue the governments ailing deposit insurance fund but 
say they want substantial reforms in banking regulations 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman william seidman on 
monday floated a proposal to boost the insurance fund by 24 
billion 
the proposal comes as industry officials and regulators ponder 
ideas to dramatically restructure the nations banks which have 
been beset by a stagnant economy strong foreign competition 
declining real estate values and rising loan defaults 
in the past 3 years 734 banks with 102 billion in total 
assets have failed according to the federal deposit insurance 
corp the failures have drained the governments deposit insurance 
fund from 183 billion in 1987 to an estimated 9 billion this 
year the fdic reported the fund is used to repay up to 100000 
in individual deposits in the event of a bank failure 
i think theres no question the fund needs to be replenished 
that one way or another the industry is going to have to pay for 
it thats been the history since its been established said 
john rau president and chief executive officer of lasalle national 
bank in chicago 
but bankers say if theyre asked to help rescue the fund they 
want federal banking laws reformed they complain that current 
regulations hamper them from competing with securities firms and 
other large corporations that offer loans credit cards and other 
such financial services 
richard a kirk president of american bankers association said 
any deposit insurance rescue must come with modernization of 
the financial system if future problems are to be prevented 
kirk and others dont question the fdics grim predictions of 
the funds solvency but says the banking industry overall is 
healthy the nations 12400 banks enjoyed a 13 percent increase in 
profits for the third quarter of 1990 he said 
seidman in prepared testimony before the house banking 
subcommittee on financial institutions fell short of endorsing the 
24 billion plan 
a similar strategy was used in 1984 when congress voted to 
strengthen the credit union fund under the bill credit unions 
were required to deposit 1 percent of insured shares into the fund 
he said 
seidman also suggested annual deposit insurance premiums should 
be raised to 23 cents per 100 in deposits he also discussed other 
options such as requiring banks to buy preferred stock in the 
fdic 
he said the proposals would add only marginally to bank 
failures 
that view was disputed however by three private economists 
r dan brumbaugh of san francisco robert litan of the brookings 
institution and james barth of auburn university who presented a 
report to the house panel 
brumbaugh said a one percent assessment on deposits would cost 
banks the equivalent of two years of earnings litan said it would 
cause additional failures costing 3 billion to 8 billion 
seidman also raised the possibility that regulators may hold off 
shutting down weak banks that appear likely to recover citing the 
success of such a policy toward struggling farm banks in the 
mid1980s 
many bankers declined to comment on seidmans statements until 
they had a chance to review the proposals in detail 
our reaction in general has always been that every participant 
in the financial services industry should be regulated by the same 
standards said fraser seitel spokesman for chase manhattan 
corp he like others in the industry endorses changes in banking 
regulations to provide a level playing field with nonfinancial 
corporations that provide some financial services 
they object for example that atampt can offer its universal 
credit card without facing the same regulations as banks 
fritz elmendorf spokesman for the consumer bankers association 
in arlington va said most bankers are willing to pay more into 
the fund and avoid a taxpayer bailout along the lines of the 
savings and loan scandal failures of the nations savings and 
loans are estimated to cost the nations taxpayers billions of 
dollars 
its an argument on how much the industry can truly afford 
and thats where its unclear said elmendorf

zenith electronics corp may have leapfrogged 
into the lead of the highdefinition television race with a 
proposed alldigital system that offers better picture resolution 
than its competitors analysts said 
on paper it still looks to me like the best of the 
proposals james magid an analyst with needham amp co in new 
york said of the project that zenith and american telephone amp 
telegraph co announced monday 
the hdtv system that zenith is developing jointly with the atampt 
would transmit 1575 horizontal picture lines every onethirtieth 
of a second compared with competing systems based on 1125 or 1050 
lines the pictures on todays tv sets are composed of 300 
horizontal lines 
the companies are competing with four other groups for the 
coveted hdtv standard to be selected by the federal communications 
commission 
the standard will be the sole format used by cable satellite 
and major commercial networks to provide americans with the 
crystalclear pictures and compactdiscquality sound of hdtv 
analysts said zenith had to come up with an alldigital system 
to keep pace with two other contenders general instruments corp 
and a consortium of nv philips of the netherlands thomson of 
france the nbc network and the david sarnoff research center 
which previously made alldigital proposals 
the other contenders for the hdtv standard are the japan 
broadcasting corp and the massachusetts institute of technology 
fully digital systems can transmit hdtv signals in the ones and 
zeros of computer language making for clear reception even on the 
fringe of a broadcasters range zenith previously had proposed a 
partially digital system 
david lauchenbruch editorial director of television digest an 
industry journal said zenith appears to have caught up with its 
competitors in the alldigital area and may have surpassed them in 
picture resolution 
but he noted that the systems relative merits wont really be 
known until the fcc tests them one by one beginning next april 
these things i think exist mainly on computers 
lauchenbruch said 
zenith spokesman john taylor said zenith and atampt already were 
working toward an alldigital or mostly digital system prior to the 
proposals made earlier this year by general instruments and the 
philips consortium 
we did it to reap the benefits of digital technology to 
provide interferencefree and snowfree pictures taylor said 
the test period for zeniths system begins in late october 
taylor said the fcc hopes to select a standard by june 1993 
backers of hdtv say it could revitalize segments of the us 
electronics industry and through military educational and 
medical spinoffs be the linchpin for us economic growth in the 
next century 
zenith the last major usbased television manufacturer is 
gambling heavily on its system being chosen as the hdtv standard 
the company sold its computer division in 1989 and has committed 
50 million to hdtv research in which it is cooperating with atampt 
and its bell labs subsidiary

american and united airlines are lined up to fly 
into london but questions about whether they will be allowed to 
land at the citys choice airport heathrow cast doubts on the 
carriers plans 
united agreed in october to buy most of pan ams london routes 
for 400 million american said sunday it would buy twas london 
routes and others overseas for 445 million 
a treaty between britain and the united states says only twa 
pan am and their corporate successors can fly transatlantic 
routes from heathrow which is the closest airport to london and 
served by the citys subway system 
negotiators for the british and us governments are scheduled 
to meet later this week in london to discuss whether that means 
united and american can gain entry to heathrow 
since 1977 the british government has disallowed any new 
carriers at heathrow forcing them to gatwick and other airports 
several british carriers also want slots at the airport and 
argue that american and united qualify as new carriers rather than 
as two that are merely assuming existing routes 
whether theyre right or wrong for doing it british 
carriers will try to read more into this paul karos an airline 
analyst for first boston said monday 
entry to heathrow is key to both the unitedpan am deal and the 
americantwa deal 
all were suggesting is one airline be allowed to substitute 
or take the place of another which does not seem unreasonable to 
us given the changing fortunes of companies in the world of 
business said robert crandall president of fort worthbased 
american 
united chairman stephen wolf has also said the carriers 
agreement with pan am would not proceed without access to heathrow 
both airline executives think they will be allowed to fly to 
heathrow 
this matter is likely to be resolved at least in part on the 
longstanding goodwill between the united states and the united 
kingdom and by the fact were not really asking for anything 
except to substitute one carrier for another crandall said 
american already flies to gatwick from miami anddallasfort 
worth gatwick has fewer connections than heathrow 
if the deals are completed united and american will both serve 
london from los angeles and two new york airports kennedy and 
newark 
american will also fly between london and chicago boston 
philadelphia st louis and baltimore while united will also fly 
between london and washington san francisco and seattle 
american bought a chicagolondon route from twa last december 
but the deal has not been finalized pending the outcome of 
negotiations over heathrow 
it was uniteds purchase of pan ams routes that got american 
dealing with twa crandall said when the unitedpan american 
deal was announced that raised our awareness and that raised twas 
awareness he said 
american plans to help finance its purchase by issuing new 
common stock during the first three months of 1991 crandall said 
he did not say how large the stock offering would be but expected 
preliminary registration papers filed with the securities and 
exchange commission late this week 
americans deal with twa also gives it an option for twas 
unused overseas routes a year after the deal is complete six to 10 
routes are likely to be picked up said donald carty americans 
executive vice president of finance and planning he said the 
routes to italy spain and portugal are the most attractive

private deposit insurance funds have not 
had a tremendous track record bank runs have brought down insurers 
in ohio and maryland and now the collapse of a small rhode island 
bank threatens another 
nonetheless as rhode island regulators piece together the 
remnants of heritage loan and investment co and the private 
agency that insured it proposals are being floated to spin off 
federal deposit insurance to the private sector 
proponents say the idea is to reform a system that allowed a 
debacle such as the savings and loan scandal 
our first line of belief is private insurance can handle the 
whole thing said dwayne welsh general counsel of the national 
deposit insurance corp of dublin ohio the way youre going to 
solve this insurance problem is privatize this thing and charge 
people depositors for the insurance 
welsh whose firm is the largest of 10 private insurers of 
credit unions in the country warns that without reform the 
federal deposit insurance corp protector of americans 
commercial bank deposits could go the way of the nowdefunct 
federal savings and loan insurance corp 
he thinks the sampllike failures in ohio maryland and rhode 
island were anomalies created by criminal wrongdoing or by state 
and federal regulators more intent on satisfying politicians 
demands than on policing an industry 
a private company he argued would be insulated from that kind 
of pressure to prop up a failing institution 
his opinion is far from universal 
people are just looking around for ways to bring market 
discipline to the system and private deposit insurance is a thing 
that a lot of academics have suggested said ellen lamb of the 
conference of state bank supervisors based in washington its a 
good theory but weve seen a lot of cases where it doesnt work 
the most recent case has been at heritage loan a small 
operation in providences federal hill neighborhood the base for 
new england organized crime 
news reports have linked bank president joseph mollicone jr 
for whom an arrest warrant has been issued with mob figures but 
lawenforcement authorities shy away from revealing details of 
their investigations 
heritages insurer the rhode island share and deposit indemnity 
corp pumped cash into the bank but that seriously drained 
risdics 25 million fund covering 16 billion in deposits at 35 
credit unions and 11 banks in the state most of the members of 
risdic since have applied for federal coverage although some of 
the credit unions are looking to walshs private fund 
peter nevola risdic president said he believed his members 
applied to the federal system reluctantly because state 
regulators suggested that otherwise they would sometime down the 
line have no insurance 
but he argues the heritage crisis proved the soundness of his 
type of fund when its reserves dipped below 1 percent of all 
member institutions deposits the banks and credit unions were 
reassessed to replenish the capital and all heritage depositors are 
recovering their money and no taxpayers are footing the bill he 
said 
i think were demonstrating that its probably the best idea 
yet he said 
nonetheless the crisis has led rhode island leaders to wonder 
whether the private insurance fund has outlived its usefulness and 
whether federal coverage should be required 
i think those kinds of questions are going to be asked again 
this year said gov edward d diprete who conceded that simply 
transferred potential problems onto the backs of taxpayers 
thats who pays for most things around here the governor 
said 
business regulation director frederick j franklin said he has 
seen a trend away from private insurance to federal insurance 
that was largely what happened after private funds in ohio and 
maryland were seriously depleted by crises in 1985 but as rhode 
islands small banks and credit unions look toward protecting their 
deposits with the treasurybacked funds fundamental questions 
about the soundness of the federal insurance are being debated 
three separate studies examining the health of the nations 
deposit insurance are to be completed during the next several 
months reforming the existing system is likely to dominate the 
next session of congress 
its no 1 on the agenda for the house banking committee 
everybodys going to jump into it said tom seppy a staffer on 
the panels subcommittee regulating financial institutions which 
commissioned one of the studies 
either supplementing or replacing the existing funds with 
private insurance is just one of the many ideas being offered but 
it is one that has aroused plenty of interest among people who 
believe the government failed to safeguard taxpayers when the sampls 
spun out of control and took a big chunk of the treasury along with 
them 
currently the mood if you will on capitol hill seems to be 
to find some way to limit the governments risk or exposure due to 
bank failures said david barr an fdic spokesman in washington 
to this point nothing is really being endorsed over another 
idea

texas financier t boone pickens boone co says 
all of the shares it holds in a japanese auto parts maker are 
pledged as security for a loan the finance ministry said tuesday 
boone the largest stockholder in koito manufacturing co had 
said in a report filed on dec 7 that an unspecified number of 
shares were used as collateral for the loan from japanese stock 
speculator kitaro watanabe 
watanabe was the source of a large block of the shares 
the finance ministry asked boone to specify how many shares were 
pledged as collateral 
an official of the finance ministrys security bureau speaking 
on condition of anonymity said the ministry received an amended 
report monday specifying that all of boones 264 percent stake in 
koito was used 
pickens has demanded seats on koitos board of directors and 
charged that the company is unfairly discriminating against foreign 
investors 
koito has refused the demand for seats saying it questions 
pickens intention in buying the shares 
noting the report that all of the shares were used as security 
tamotsu aoyama koitos director and general manager said our 
claim was justified boone co isnt a real stockholder that bears 
the responsibility for a risk 
koito contends that watanabe actually holds the shares and that 
pickens is a front for a greenmail attempt in greenmail a 
company fearing a takeover attempt pays a premium to buy out some 
shareholders 
under a japanese law that took effect dec 1 investors who 
purchase more than 5 percent of the ttal shares of a public 
company must report information such as the source of funds and 
purpose of the investment to the finance ministry

a california billionaire ignored chrysler corp 
chairman lee iacoccas plea that he promise to limit his stake in 
the automaker to less than 10 percent documents say 
chrysler has tightened its antitakeover provisions despite kirk 
kerkorians assurances he has no plan to seek control of the 
nations no 3 automaker after buying 98 percent of its stock for 
272 million 
on monday kerkorian filed papers with the securities and 
exchange commission that said he bought about 22 million shares of 
chrysler stock during the last two months for investment purposes 
in the filing kerkorian said he bought about 5 million shares 
of chrysler stock on nov 19 and met with chrysler officials dec 
9 at that meeting he rejected iacoccas request he sign a promise 
not to acquire 10 percent or more of chrysler stock 
following the meeting kerkorian bought 10 million shares in two 
transactions dec 10 and lst wednesday through his tracinda 
corp the filing said 
chrysler motors chairman bennett bidwell said monday that 
chryslers board tightened its poisonpoll provisions on friday 
in response to kerkorians stock purchases 
i dont think the action of mr kerkorian and the action of 
the board are coincidental bidwell said 
the board lowered to 10 percent from 20 percent the amount of 
stock an investor may hold before triggering a provision offering 
chrysler stock to shareholders at a discount 
that in turn prompted shareholder arun shingala of new york to 
file suit in delaware on friday seeking to overturn the poisonpill 
provision as harmful to shareholders interests he also asked the 
suit be made a class action 
chrysler officials just seem very insecure to me said terry 
christensen kerkorians los angeles attorney kerkorian and 
tracinda have offered to be consistently supportive of lee iacocca 
both before during and after the furor 
chrysler officials told the detroit news the company last year 
discussed business deals with kerkorian including his possible 
purchase of its gulfstream aircraft subsidiary 
no deal materialized the officials said in a story in todays 
editions of the paper 
chrysler was the most active stock onm the new york stock 
exchange with 188 million shares traded monday it closed at 
1287 a share up 625 cents a share from fridays close 
bidwell in charge of chryslers car and truck operations said 
chrysler has no idea what kerkorians motives may be 
all we know is the track record of the guy he said were 
playing waitandsee 
kerkorian a 73yearold billionaire last month sold mgmua 
communications co for 13 billion to italian financier giancarlo 
parretti he is also known for his investments in airlines and las 
vegas hotels and casinos 
in the past he has bought the companies sold off divisions or 
subsidiaries and then sold the organization making millions of 
dollars along the way 
kerkorian said in the sec documents that he has no plans for 
an extraordinary corporate transaction such as a merger 
reorganization or liquidation involving the company or any of its 
subsidiaries 
kerkorian also said he has no plans to boost his chrysler 
holding beyond 98 percent but noted he may increase or decrease 
his holding depending on general economic money and stock market 
conditions 
analysts recently have viewed chryslers stock as undervalued 
at 12 a share chrysler is valued at about 27 billion just a 
shade more than ford motor co paid for the british luxury car 
maker jaguar plc early this year

the daily news has sued its striking unions on 
charges they have used violence to disrupt the publication and sale 
of the newspaper 
the news on monday accused the unions of violating federal labor 
law in a lawsuit filed in us district court in manhattan 
it was the second lawsuit brought by the newspaper against the 
unions since the strike began oct 25 
the first lawsuit brought nov 29 under the civil racketeering 
statute accused the nine striking unions of coordinating a violent 
conspiracy to force a favorable labor settlement or the sale of the 
newspaper 
the new complaint claims the unions violated the 
labormanagement relations act which prohibits unions from 
interfering with the business of parties not involved in a labor 
dispute 
the defendants and agents acting on their behalf have mounted 
a campaign of violence and intimidation against the news dealers 
and advertisers in an effort to disrupt the publication and sale of 
the newspaper the lawsuit said 
the lawsuit asks for more than 50 million in losses the news 
claims it incurred as a result of the campaign which it said 
included many hundreds of incidents of arson assault 
vandalism threats and harassment 
theodore kheel a labor attorney and adviser to the unions 
denied the allegations he cited recent testimony by senior police 
officials who said investigations found the violence was committed 
by individuals and was not part of a coordinated conspiracy 
kheel said the news lawsuits against the unions constituted 
harassment 
he said the suits will if successful destroy the unions or 
come close to destroying the unions by the cost in time and money 
the unions will have to spend defending themselves 
the news has published every day during the strike but the 
majority of the citys 12000 newsstands and vendors have stopped

regulators bankers politicians and 
economists agree the fastfading government fund that guarantees 
bank deposits will soon need an infusion of billions of dollars to 
keep it alive during a recession 
but they are vigorously debating who should be the donor 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady says the banking industry 
is healthy enough to bail itself out and he got backing monday 
from l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp 
any strengthening of the bank insurance fund can and should be 
financed by the banking industry not by the american taxpayers 
seidman told the house banking subcommittee on financial 
institutions 
bankings problems do not amount to another savings and loan 
crisis he added 
subcommittee members with memories of voters reaction to being 
forced to pay for the 500 billion sampl debacle generally welcomed 
his words 
we need to make certain that the taxpayers of this nation 
are not asked to bail out the banks said rep frank annunzio 
dill the panels chairman 
however several other members noted a similar determination 
within the reagan administration regarding sampls and wondered if it 
would be better to face up to hard truths now 
you only have two choices you pay a little now or a lot 
later said rep charles schumer dny 
seidman is advancing a plan that would transfer 24 billion to 
25 billion into his fund by assessing banks a fee equal to 1 
percent of their deposits he also would raise the industrys 
annual insurance premium to 6 billion nearly triple last years 
rate 
that should be enough to handle failures in all but a deep and 
long recession in that case the fdic could borrow from the 
treasury seidman said 
in addition seidman suggested that some weak banks be permitted 
to remain open under tight supervision by regulators a tactic 
known as forbearance that was adopted successfully to handle 
troubled farm banks in the mid1980s 
if economic conditions continue to erode we must explore 
means to reduce losses and improve credit availability by 
preventing failures we cannot let weakness in the financial system 
bring on recession or worse in the economic system seidman said 
however three economists who prepared a study on the health of 
the insurance fund for the subcommittee said forbearance would 
allow bank managers to take a chance on resurrection by gambling 
with deposits 
it could be that forbearance would work but its a 
highrisk gamble a very highrisk gamble said robert litan of 
the brookings institution 
he and his colleagues james barth of auburn university and r 
dan brumbaugh of san francisco said it is better to inject 
taxpayer money into the insurance fund so failed banks can be 
closed promptly and consolidated into healthier institutions 
lita and barth favor a loan from the treasury to the fund to 
be repaid by banks if they are able brumbaugh said surviving banks 
should not have to repay the money 
seidman estimated his fund will lose 4 billion this year and 5 
billion next year when around 180 banks will fail that would 
reduce reserves to 4 billion to guarantee 2 trillion in 
deposits by the end of next year 
our best assessment of the situation is that the bank 
insurance fund remains solvent and will be solvent at the end of 
1991 but it is very weak he said 
refunding should be in place before it is actually needed in 
other words action should be taken early next year seidman 
added 
the economists say even a mild recession likely would produce 
bank failures through 1993 costing 31 billion to 43 billion 
enough to bankrupt the fund a severe recession would cost up to 
63 billion they said a figure seidman called too low

christies international plc plans to eliminate 
146 jobs following a 50 percent drop in its autumn season sales 
the auctioneer said tuesday 
christies said it would lay off a tenth of its worldwide work 
force from clerks to art experts over the next few weeks 
the company said in a statement that it also would freeze the 
salaries of senior staff members as part of the costcutting 
program 
christies sales sank to 645 million in the months of august to 
december from 13 billion in the same period a year ago 
chairman lord carrington said that christies has decided to 
take prompt action to reduce our cost base significantly enough to 
weather the current climate but in a way which will not erode our 
ability to take full advantage of the next upturn in the market 
despite the sales dip carrington added that the medium to 
longterm prospects for the company and the art market were 
encouraging as a whole particularly in continental europe and 
asia

is 1991 the year we learn how high mario 
can jump 
mario that highstepping hero of video games has helped 
nintendo of america inc remain the top toy in america for the 
past three years but how will nintendo hurdle a recession 
some toy experts think the video game craze has peaked at least 
in its latest incarnation but even if sales do fall off they say 
nintendo wont vanish from the scene especially if it launches a 
planned new entertainment system next year 
executives at nintendos north american headquarters here say 
the nintendo entertainment system now is in nearly one out of every 
three us households 
this year they estimate nintendo and its licensees will sell 
41 billion worth of game systems cartridges and related 
products thats 14 billion more than in 1989 
nintendo of america a subsidiary of japans nintendo co ltd 
has more than 80 percent of the entire us home video market 
nintendo projects the entire us video game industry will tally 
51 billion in sales for 1990 a 17 billion gain over last year 
toy and hobby world magazine has listed nintendos game machine 
as the nations topselling toy since january 1988 last month the 
trade magazine also listed four other nintendo products in its top 
10 the super mario brothers 3 game as no 2 the game boy 
handheld set at no 4 the tetris game in sixth place and 
super mario brothers 2 at ninth 
nintendo wont make its 1991 forecasts until after the christmas 
season spokesman tom sarris said 
but a shaky economy and the prospects of poor retail sales this 
christmas dont add up to good news says analyst paul valentine 
of standard amp poors corp 
theres no question the signs are unmistakable that the video 
game fad is slowing down he says 
valentine notes that some video game cartridges are now selling 
for 20 apiece when they sold for 35 or 40 a year ago sales of 
the game sets also are down with nintendo predicting it will sell 
75 million units this year compared with 91 million in 1989 
nintendo has been sizzling for the past few years valentine 
said its unrealistic to think that sort of momentum to support 
video games will go on indefinitely 
david leibowitz an analyst with american securities corp in 
newyork disagrees 
taken as a totality nintendo will be the biggest seller this 
year this christmas will do nothing to diminish the appeal of the 
line he said 
sure times are tough leibowitz said but the children of 
america will not be denied 
toy retailers are hedging their bets the child world chain has 
slashed prices kaybee stores has offered 10 percent discounts 
and toys r us has held a 100 million clearance 
sales for the nintendo game system have slowed but demand for 
the games and for game boy is strong said angela bourdon a toys 
r us spokeswoman 
though older game cartridges such as zelda and punch out 
are included in the clearance the hot ones like super mario 
brothers 3 have not been discounted bourdon said 
peter main nintendo of americas vice president of marketing 
says things may be tougher this holiday season but christmas 
still happens 
nintendo games are big value items stuff that gets played 
with beyond dec 26 which should strengthen its appeal to 
moneytight consumers main said he also noted that the last video 
game boom led by the atari system in the early 1980s came in the 
middle of a recession 
to help boost firstquarter 1991 nintendo is launching a major 
new game startropics the day after christmas main said the 
game is a fantasy adventure similar to past hits legend of 
zelda and zelda ii the adventure of link 
main said nintendo also has been targeting adults more in its 
marketing with people over 18 accounting for 50 percent of the 
hardware purchases this year game boy especially is a hit with 
adults he said and new games such as nes play action football 
and dr mario a sequel to tetris were designed to appeal 
to older players 
nintendo which employs about 1500 people in this seattle 
suburb is betting on its future with plans for a 
300000squarefoot automated warehouse on a 110acre site in north 
bend about 25 miles east of seattle the warehouse to open early 
next year will double nintendos plant space in the seattle area 
valentine and leibowitz said nintendo could recharge its 
business with a planned new entertainment system a 16bit machine 
that offers substantially better graphics sound and action than 
the current 8bit device the new machine was launched in japan 
this fall and was well received leibowitz said 
nintendos main competitors sega and nec already have 16bit 
players on the market 
main said nintendo has been criticized for the past two years 
for not bringing out the new machine but he said nintendo didnt 
want to do that while demand remained high for the older 
entertainment system existing nintendo game cartridges cant be 
played on the new machine 
sarris said nintendo is looking at the second half of 1991 
to introduce the game but no specific date had been chosen 
valentine said even if video games fade nintendo wont vanish 
he said he has made predictions before that nintendo would suffer 
the same fate as other fads in the volatile toy industry 
ive always felt that the history of the toy business is 
cyclical he said ive been maybe 18 months early predicting 
the end of the video game fad while nintendo was laughing all the 
way to the bank

japanese businessmen are extending a tentative 
lifeline to the ailing soviet economy even though their government 
has avoided wider ties pending resolution of a longstanding 
territorial dispute 
a number of companies have signed contracts or worked behind the 
scenes to aid the soviets herculean task of converting to a 
marketoriented economy experts say 
if gorbachev is ousted and perestroika fails it will be a 
very big setback so some politicians and corporations have decided 
they must help it succeed said hiroshi kato a professor at 
tokyos keio university who specializes on the soviet economy 
kato said these groups feel its in their best interest to help 
even though there has been no breakthrough in a dispute over a 
group of islands north of japan seized by moscow at the end of 
world war ii soviet president mikhail gorbachev is widely expected 
to make a major concession on the islands when he visits tokyo next 
spring 
if perestroika fails kato said japan will have to help 
with refugees fleeing from siberia inflation will become terrible 
and cause a complete economic failure 
and then the japanese will have to pay even more than now to 
bail the soviets out 
foreign ministry officials say the business community has not 
applied direct pressure on the government to drop recommendations 
against expanding contacts with moscow before the island dispute is 
resolved still tokyo appears to be going along 
the government is doing what it can to help the soviets and 
the private sector is doing what it can one senior ministry 
official said on condition of anonymity 
while japan continues to rule out official financial aid to the 
soviets until the islands are returned it is providing some 
emergency medical relief 
and major japanese trading houses and banks are carefully 
finding ways to help moscow that wont entangle them in 
unprofitable trade deals experts say trading companies also seem 
to have abandoned their traditional fear that doing business with 
the soviets will lead to harassment by extreme rightwing groups 
it is natural for the soviet union and japan to consider more 
cooperation said yohei mimura chairman of mitsubishi corp 
japans largest trading house we should do what we can to help 
ensure the survival of perestroika in this historical age 
mitsubishi recently signed a 300 million contract to build 18 
cargo ships for the soviet shipping firm sovcomflot 
mitsui busan another major trading firm said it reached a 
preliminary agreement with the soviet ministry of oil and gas 
industry for two offshore oil and natural gas projects near the 
eastern soviet island of sakhalin the project will provide the 
soviets with offshore oil extraction technology and boost soviet 
petrochemical exports the company said 
in midnovember five commercial banks agreed to lend the soviet 
union 400 million to buy steel pipes and pay for goods already 
imported from japan industry sources said the loans will be 
guaranteed by trading houses involved in japansoviet trade 
seiji tsutsumi head of the saison group of retail and travel 
companies says he is writing a book with other major businessmen 
to help the soviets follow the japanese example of rebuilding after 
the war 
the twoyearold soviet policy of allowing 14000 enterprises to 
make their own deals with foreign companies without going through 
the central government has bred great confusion 
no one knows whos in charge in the past you could depend on 
the government to back up soviet firms but now you cant trust the 
system said michitaka hatori economist at the japan association 
for trade with the soviet union and socialist countries of europe 
soviet businesses also have been told to become selfsufficient 
because they can no longer rely on the state to bail them out 
foreign creditors have been unwilling to come to the rescue of 
ailing soviet firms and as a result some exporters have stopped 
shipments to the soviet union 
estimates of unpaid soviet trade debts to japan range from 
several hundred million to as much as 1 bilion 
when soviet companies sought delays of up to nine months to pay 
for steel from japan supplies were cut off until a partial payment 
was made japanese officials say matsushita electric co started 
requiring advance payment for exports after soviet buyers fell 
behind in payments 
direct trade fell 64 percent in the first nine months of 1990 
from the corresponding period a year earlier because of such 
embarrassments 
if you read the newspapers it looks as if a lot is going on 
but its not trade hatori said

digital equipment corp has found some 
technical problems in its new line of mainframe computers 
prompting the company to retrofit the machines to make them more 
reliable a spokesman said today 
digital unveiled its vax 9000 machines last year entering the 
mainframe market that has been dominated by rival international 
business machines corp 
but some customers have reported troubles with the machines 
which are designed to handle massive amounts of information 
according to digital the problems caused the machines to crash 
every few days in certain applications 
mark steinkrauss director of investor relations for digital 
said the problems arose in a handful of customers who run the 
machines for lengthy periods 
he said many customers did not experience the trouble although 
digital expected there might be some problems when the company 
introduced the machine 
it would be unrealistic to think youre not going to get a 
glitch here or there he said 
david lynch a digital spokesman said the enhancement was being 
made on all vax 9000s its important that they be at top 
reliability he said 
lynch said digital did not consider the situation a serious 
problem 
the company has been looking to the vax 9000 to help boost weak 
revenues that led to digitals firstever quarterly loss earlier in 
the year 
some analysts say the vax 9000 has been hurt by production 
delays although the company insists the machines are being 
wellreceived 
this is a headache but not a disaster said terry shannon 
a consultant with international data corp digital is bending 
over backwards to make sure these things run right 
michael a guider a vice president at litel communications 
inc a regional longdistance carrier in worthington ohio told 
the wall street journal that the retrofit eliminated a serious 
problem that had plagued our machine 
but guider also praised digitals support and said the retrofit 
would not disrupt his operations

two allcomedy cable services that have battled 
each other since april fools day said today they are ending their 
war of the chuckles and merging into a single cable network called 
comedy tv 
home box offices the comedy channel begun in november 1989 
and mtv networks ha the comedy network on the air since april 1 
will start their merged service early next year company officials 
said 
each is a 24hour operation and each has faced difficulties 
getting onto cable systems due to a shortage of available channels 
they made it official less than than a month after two proposed 
rival cable services devoted to law in court and american 
courtroom network also said they would merge into one service 
called american courtoom network 
time warner inc which had hoped to launch one of the alllaw 
networks owns hbo 
the comedy channel is seen in 85 million homes ha whose 
parent company is owned by viacom international inc is in 65 
million homes their union will give the new service 15 million 
homes they said 
allsports espn serves the most cable homes 559 million 
followed by turners cable news network which serves 544 million 
the advertisersupported comedy tv network that will result from 
ha and the comedy channel will be a 5050 venture with a 
programming lineup drawn from each network the two companies said 
each network will continue its respective operations until the 
new service begins in early 1991 hbo said 
the president of the new network will be recruited from outside 
the two companies and the new network will be staffed by ha and 
the comedy channel employees 
hbo chairman michael fuchs in a statement said the merged 
comedy service is not only a very positive move for both 
companies but should have a salutary effect on the cable industry 
as a whole 
about 12 new cable services plan startups in coming months 
according to one estimate by erica gruen a cable analyst at 
saatchi amp saatchi advertising the hopefuls range from a 24hour 
talk show channel to the cowboy channel

the us merchandise trade deficit hurt by a 
huge foreign oil bill and an unexpected surge in car imports 
climbed to 1161 billion in october the biggest imbalance in 
almost three years the government reported today 
the commerce department said both us exports and imports hit 
alltime highs leaving the october deficit a giant 245 percent 
higher than septembers deficit of 933 billion 
the countrys october trade performance surprised economists who 
had been looking for the number to remain virtually unchanged some 
analysts said the sharp deterioration would make the start of the 
new recession even more severe than had been expected 
economists said the october report suggested that what had been 
the one bright spot in a lackluster economy a narrowing trade 
deficit would not be available to help cushion the start of the 
downturn in the octoberdecember quarter 
they also said the big rise in imports suggested that retailers 
will be stuck with bloated inventories which could dampen 
production and make the length of the downturn last longer 
this is a bad number david wyss an economist with 
drimcgraw hill said of the october trade gap it suggests that 
we are not going to get as much help from net exports as we had 
hoped and it suggests there is more inventory out there than we had 
thought 
much of the deterioration came from a 17 percent jump in 
americas foreign oil bill reflecting the huge jump in world 
prices following iraqs august invasion of kuwait 
oil imports rose to 723 billion in october the highest 
monthly total since april 1981 
the total trade gap widened to its largest imbalance since a 
1256 billion deficit in february 1988 
us exports climbed 86 percent hitting an alltime high of 
3477 billion 
this increase was viewed as good news that americas export 
boom the source of much of the economys strength in the past 
three years was continuing 
but imports were up in october by an even larger amount 
climbing 122 percent to 4638 billion 
the big jump in oil imports reflected a rise in price from 
2431 a barrel in september to 2904 in october the volume 
imported actually fell slightly to 803 million barrels a day down 
from 848 million barrels daily in september 
the other big increase in the import category came in shipments 
of new cars which soared 39 percent to 451 billion in october 
in other economic news today the labor department reported that 
the cost of living rose a moderate 03 percent in november the 
first inflation break for consumers since oil prices shot up after 
the invasion of kuwait the seasonallyadjusted increase in the 
consumer price index followed an increase of 06 percent in october 
and even larger rises of 08 percent in september and august 
the bush administration had been hoping that the trade deficit 
would drop below 100 billion this year for the first time since 
1983 however octobers big surge left the deficit for the first 
10 months of the year running at an annual rate of 103 billion 
down only slightly from last years 1094 billion deficit 
as usual the biggest deficit in october was with japan a 490 
billion imbalance which was the largest since a deficit of 491 
billion in october 1989 
the deficit with canada americas largest trading partner rose 
to 14 billion in october while the deficit with china was 12 
billion and the deficit with taiwan was 11 billion

industrial output in germanys five new 
eastern states has dropped nearly 50 percent from 1989 the 
economics ministry said tuesday 
the figures clearly show that the new eastern states remain in a 
serious restructuring process as they move from a centrally 
controlled economy to a market economy the report said 
the industrial output dropped 35 percent from autumn of 1989 to 
july and decreased another 14 percent from july to august the 
report said however output increased about 25 percent in 
september and another one percent in october 
the report attributed the slight improvement to a 95 percent 
increase in energy production and a 21 percent increase in the 
production of foodstuffs 
no data was available to determine if the big drop of output in 
the summer months was traceable to seasonal factors 
it was also not clear whether the slight increase in production 
was due to a reorientation of consumers toward easternmade 
products after a rush to buy western products following monetary 
union on july 1 the report said 
separately the report said that new orders for production 
dropped 15 percent in august from july and another 10 percent from 
august to september 
however new orders for industrial products increased by 2 
percent from september to october 
east germanys industrial output started sagging last fall when 
tens of thousands of mostly skilled young workers fled to the 
west the problem was compounded when the borders were opened 
giving easterners free access to betterquality western products in 
former west germany which for the most part had been denied them 
for four decades 
after monetary union when the west german mark became the 
official currency western products took over many shelves in the 
east further cutting demand for locally produced items 
experts have predicted that many of former east germanys 
outdated factories and other businesses will be forced to shut down 
in the restructuring process and that up to half of the estimated 
8 million workers in the eastern states could be jobless by the end 
of 1991

agreement is near between the united states 
and the 12 governments in the european community on sales of 420 
million worth of american corn and sorghum to spain and portugal a 
us official said tuesday 
a fouryear accord was due to expire at the end of the year and 
would be renewed for another year said an official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
renewal would remove a threat of retaliation by the united 
states against a similar amount of europeanexports to this 
country 
the proposal for a years renewal was made to the 12 governments 
monday by the european commission their joint executive 
the dispute arose when spain and portugal became members of the 
community also known as the common market under community rules 
the two new members were bound to give preference to goods from the 
other members 
president reagans administration protested that american 
farmers would lose sales so it was agreed that spain and portugal 
would continue to buy an annual two million tons of american corn 
and 300000 tons of sorghum for the four years 
expiration of the agreement and retaliation by the united states 
would have damaged hope for progress in the uruguay round of trade 
talks among more than 100 countries on a wide variety of products 
and services negotiations were stalled earlier this month by a 
clash between the united states and the community over subsidies 
for farm products 
another meeting has been called in geneva switzerland on jan

like a party reveler sprawled on the dance floor after too many 
drinks the american economy awoke to a sobering skullthumper in 
1990 from the indulgent 1980s 
an addiction to foreign imports corporate takeovers and debt 
finally took its toll on the longest peacetime expansion in us 
history 
the downturn now official by almost any measurement has put a 
million people out of work since june and caused thousands of 
companies to fail or seek shelter from creditors in bankruptcy 
court 
homebuying and construction have fallen to levels not seen since 
the last recession eight years ago banks are weak the stock 
market is sick car sales are anemic and consumers spent sparingly 
for christmas 
people are postponing the postponable said jerry jordan 
chief economist at the first interstate bancorp in los angeles 
all over the place people are just sitting on their hands 
the us economy built on the free enterprise forces of supply 
and demand is accustomed to cycles of boom and bust but this 
time things are different external shocks to the economy from 
the persian gulf crisis and the savings and loan bailout for 
example are exacerbating the slide 
the gulf standoff has added a war premium to oil prices and 
stoked the embers of inflation the thrift bailout has added to the 
already enormous debt burdens of the federal government and 
increased the ultimate bill to taxpayers some experts worry that 
the pressures are too severe for the economy to bounce back 
quickly a few expect the worst is yet to come 
if somebody asked me not too many years ago whether we would 
have a major downturn similar to the great depression of the 1930s 
i would have said no said james barth a finance professor at 
auburn university in alabama and a former economist at the 
governments office of thrift supervision 
but now its to the point where people are talking about it 
barth said that registers on the economic richter scale im not 
willing to say it just wont occur 
the hard times have inspired an aggressive hunt for scapegoats 
the highest flyers of the 80s donald trump michael milken and 
sampl fraud defendant charles keating have become targets of 
editorials and the butt of latenight tv monologues the young 
babyboomers on wall street have been generally cursed for sapping 
the productive energies of american businesses by weighing them 
down with excessive debt 
theres a fixation on trying to blame some people some 
institutions for excesses in which many of us shared said jerry 
sterner author of an offbroadway hit play about a hostile 
takeover called other peoples money 
i think trump keating and the boys were a reflection of what 
we were taken to a much larger level sterner said its 
easier to blame them bums 
the question for 1991 is not whos to blame but where will it 
end whats going to happen to pull the economy out of its nose 
dive 
amid the gloom some suggest the comparisons to the 30s are 
misplaced 
for one thing the economy is more diversified and efficient 
than it was 60 years ago strengthened by an array of systems to 
transmit goods services knowledge and ideas that are the envy of 
the world 
for another the federal reserve the central bank recently has 
taken steps to loosen credit rather than tighten as the fed of the 
1930s did that classic blunder precipitated an avalanche of 
failures because even healthy businesses couldnt borrow to pay 
their bills 
the fed is keenly aware were in a recession now said david 
bostian chief economist at jesup josephthal amp co a new york 
investment firm the fed has woken up to the realization that it 
needs to aggressively ease 
some studies indicate the present downturn could be shallow and 
short the university of michigans forecasters predicted at their 
recent economic outlook conference that growth would show a modest 
decline in the final quarter of 1990 but revive in early 1991 
the parisbased organization of economic cooperation and 
development released a surprisingly optimistic assessment in late 
november that said the united states is facing a period of slow 
growth but not a downturn 
some economists suggest the national perception has been skewed 
by heavy reporting of bad news on the east coast where the economy 
is slowest 
meanwhile texas and its neighbors are rebounding the west 
coast remains relatively healthy and an export boom is 
strengthening vast parts of the midwest notably around the great 
lakes which could become the catalyst for the next national 
economic resurgence 
milwaukee for example devastated by a loss of manufacturing 
jobs during the 198182 recession is thriving because factories 
have since retooled with modern equipment it is now one of the 
nations leading job producers 
in cleveland once a recessionscarred industrial hulk and now a 
model american city companies learned the hard way to cut costs 
through automation and smaller work forces during the 1980s 
running lean and mean running scared has become a way of 
life said adrian dillon of eaton corp an electrical and 
automotive component manufacturer that is one of clevelands key 
industries 
a recent study by the american express co on the outlook for 
small and midsized businesses the main generators of new jobs 
showed companies in the pacific states should fare well in a 
recession while those in the northeast and middle atlantic regions 
would be hit hardest

some economists have dismissed recession talk altogether and 
argue that the united states is about to embark on a period of 
stunning growth they base this outlook partly on the premise that 
many us companies are much tougher than they were just a few 
years ago battlehardened by foreign competition and recent cost 
cutting 
john rutledge senior economist at the claremont economics 
institute a forecasting concern in claremont calif contends the 
yawning trade deficits american manufacturers agonized over last 
decade masked a critical advantage they enjoyed the availability 
of affordable foreign machinery to modernize and get back into the 
game of making money 
a lot of turnaround stories of the 1980s were businesses using 
imported machines to retool he said if you look at what we 
imported it wasnt all hershey bars and hondas it was things we 
used to build other things 
now rutledge said we have survivor managers good managers 
the capital stock has been groomed and rebuilt were all dressed 
up and ready for a party if theres enough money to make that 
happen 
whether theres enough money is the key question 
federal government debt driven by repeated budget deficits has 
risen more than 60 percent in the past five years to 325 
trillion or more than 13000 for every american 
business debt has swollen just as dramatically largelybecause 
of the mergers buyouts and restructurings of the last decade 
drimcgraw hill inc an economic forecasting firm in lexington 
mass said corporate liabilities totaled 22 trillion in 1990 
about double the figure of five years ago and triple the total in 
1980 
a very substantial portion of corporate cash flow 35 to 45 
percent goes into servicing existing debt a historic postwar 
high said robert hormats chief economist at goldman sachs amp 
co a wall street investment bank this means there is less 
money available for new investment it also means companies are 
very vulnerable to interest rate increases or declines in 
earnings 
on the personal level debts have been inflated by the 
proliferation of plastic to finance creditcard purchases by 
drimcgraw hills estimate total consumer debt exceeded 735 
billion in 1990 42 percent more than the level in 1985 and 146 
percent more than the level a decade ago 
but the debt pileup has led to some natural corrections 
businesses are increasingly using bankruptcy court to reorganize 
federal figures show more than 725000 bankruptcy cases flooded 
into the system for the year ended june 30 double the number of 
1981 
a morgan stanley group analysis of companies that borrowed 
heavily in the 1980s shows a majority were stable businesses like 
public utilities and food processors cyclical industries like 
retailers increased their debt only modestly 
that means the united states may be able to battle its debt 
hangover much better than the merchants of gloom believe the 
economist magazine recently speculated 
debt accumulation by consumers also is slowing along with 
spending suggesting that americans may be making healthy 
adjustments in their personal finances 
major banks by putting billions of dollars aside as reserves 
against loan losses are demonstrating the discipline needed to 
return to profitability 
even on wall street which has been mired in a slump since the 
crash of 1987 some say prices have fallen so far they could be 
poised for a rebound as investors look for bargains 
a forecast from jesup josephthal amp co says the dow jones 
industrial average could double to 5000 as early as middecade

visions of pizza parlors danced in the heads of the managers at 
panteras a small midwest restaurant chain that borrowed 65 
million during the easymoney 80s to buy much larger pizza inn 
inc 
but first they overvalued and then mismanaged the dallasbased 
chain of 600 restaurants morale deteriorated training evaporated 
employees quit franchisers pulled out 
in october 1989 2 years after the leveraged buyout pizza inn 
couldnt pay debts and sought protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code new management was 
appointed and creditors were paid about 150 restaurants closed 
but today pizza inn survives 
i was amazed at the opportunity this provides a company to 
save the baby and not liquidate the whole thing company 
president jeff rogers said the bankruptcy gave us a clean 
start 
pizza inn is a parable for the 1980s in which wideeyed 
managements exploited loose credit to expand via lbos financed by 
highrisk junk bonds the moral is found in the companys recovery 
under americas benevolent bankruptcy code 
the term bankruptcy is derived from the italian banca rotta 
which means broken bench in medieval times if a trader couldnt 
pay creditors they smashed his trading bench for centuries in 
britain debtors went to prison 
but us bankruptcy law was designed to allow companies to rise 
from the ashes of collapse the belief that failure is a forgivable 
outgrowth of entrepreneurship is considered uniquely american 
the 1990s are putting that notion to test an ailing real estate 
market lbo debts tightening bank credit increased foreign 
competition and new legal tactics are straining the nations 
bankruptcy system as never before 
federal statistics show more than 725000 business and personal 
bankruptcies were filed in the year ended june 30 double the 1981 
figure ten of the 25 biggest bankruptcies in history have occurred 
in the last 18 months beard group inc a washington research 
firm reports dun amp bradstreet corp says 55000 businesses failed 
in the first 11 months of 1990 165 a day 
we just ran out of space in our file room in phoenix for 
1990 said kevin obrien clerk for arizonas two bankruptcy 
courts if nothing happens soon we wont have anywhere to put 
91 
arizona is inundated with bankruptcies stemming from the 
collapse of the real estate and savings amp loan industries annual 
filings have more than quadrupled since 1980 to a projected 18500 
in 1990 the states five judges handled 216 chapter 11 cases 
apiece in 1989 three times the national norm 
in new york handwritten signs point to rooms containing the 
files of bigname bankruptcies such as eastern airlines drexel 
burnham lambert lomas financial and ames department stores boxes 
of documents are stacked in hallways 
bankruptcy ironically has spawned a vibrant industry 
corporate debt restructuring is one of the few growth areas at wall 
street investment houses workout firms help companies 
repackage debt to delay payments without declaring chapter 11 
businesses even have sprung up to help manage the regulatory and 
paperwork maze finding opportunity in others misfortune 
speculators invest and trade in the debt of distressed companies 
law firms are bulking up what 10 years ago was a necessary but 
unglamorous area many specialists in the field say bankruptcy law 
is to the 1990s what mergers and acquisitions law was to the 1980s 
its a hot area because of economic necessity said alan 
miller a partner at the new york law firm of weil gotschal amp 
manges which has the nations largest bankruptcy group 
the first permanent federal bankruptcy law was enacted in 1898 
but was based on the british model under which creditors forced 
companies into liquidation to collect debts the idea of using 
bankruptcy to help companies survive wasnt enshrined in the law 
until 1938 
us bankruptcy statutes remained unchanged for another 40 
years until congress in 1978 overhauled the depressionera laws to 
account for the nations more sophisticated business environment 
under the reform business reorganizations of all sizes were 
combined into chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code existing 
management was allowed to run a company during bankruptcy instead 
of a courtappointed trustee 
but none of the reformers envisioned todays multibilliondollar 
cases with multiple tiers of complicated debt and more creditor 
committees than teams in the national hockey league 
when i became a judge in 1973 i never heard of a junk bond 
said robert l ordin who stepped down from the los angeles 
bankruptcy bench in 1983 and now is with the law firm loeb amp loeb 
the costs of reorganizing in bankruptcy court also have 
escalated a typical case spins off big paychecks for attorneys 
investment bankers and accountants those fees can siphon millions 
of dollars from a debtors estate that could otherwise be used to 
pay creditors 
the costs for big companies are simply off the charts said 
stephen weinroth chairman of integrated resources inc which 
staggered into bankruptcy court 10 months ago 16 billion in debt 
the financial firm expects to spend more than 50 million on 
professional fees during its reorganization 
drexel is paying up to 18 million every three months to 
professionals hired by three creditors committees and a 
shareholders committee including those hired by drexel about 20 
law firms four accounting agencies and three investment advisers 
are involved in the bankruptcy 
some judges are fighting back in the drexel case judge howard 
buschman iii slashed lawyers fee requests by 25 percent in north 
carolina judges are forcing debtors and creditors to streamline 
cases to save time and money for smaller companies 
the chapter 11 law was designed for the large corporation 
said judge a thomas small in raleigh nc who has cut case 
completion time to six months from the national average of 18 to 24 
months it just doesnt fit for small ones 
in a chapter 11 companies continue operating but all debts and 
other legal obligations are put on hold creditors fight with the 
debtor and each other over who gets how much secured creditors 
such as banks are first in line shareholders typically are last 
the two sides negotiate and vote on a reorganization plan 
but the process can be nasty bankruptcy disputes increasingly 
are feeding a wave of legal wrangling that can prolong cases 
sometimes by years 
its become way too litigious said harry dixon chairman of 
the american bankruptcy institute even as recently as five years 
ago lawyers and judges got together and these things got settled 
with a great deal less expense than today 
one increasingly popular method of speeding the process is the 
prepackaged bankruptcy in which the debtor and creditors agree on 
a reorganization plan before declaring chapter 11 southland corp 
owner of 7eleven stores is in a prepackaged bankruptcy now 
it cuts down on the amount of fees and costs involved judges 
love them said thomas salerno a phoenix lawyer who shepherded 
signmaker kroy inc through a prepackaged bankruptcy in six 
months 
but new techniques alone arent enough demand is growing for 
reform and more judges experts predict the number of chapter 11 
filings to increase as more companies fail to honor debt 
obligations 
about 23 billion in highinterest junk bonds went into default 
in 1990 said richard lehmann editor of the defaulted bond 
newsletter a miami lakes fla trade publication another 50 
billion is expected to default in 1991 and 1992 
theres a lot of this stuff out there and we dont know how 
its going to shake out said nathan c thorne head of 
restructuring at merrill lynch amp co its like a snake just 
swallowed a great big animal

for stockmarket investors and people who work 
in the securities industry it hasnt been easy to see much bright 
promise in the early days of the 1990s 
stock prices have spent most of 1990 in a bear market that 
surpassed the crash of 1987 in duration if not in severity 
at the same time wall street itself languished in the fourth 
year of a stubborn industry slump 
the endofanera signals in 1990 seemed hard to miss in 
february the firm of drexel burnham lambert kingpin of the 80s 
junkbond boom abruptly collapsed and disappeared from the scene 
nine months later its foremost financier michael milken drew a 
10year prison sentence 
but in the midst of these backwardlooking events many analysts 
argue that the ground is being cleared and the seeds being sown for 
more bounteous times in the investment world as the decade 
progresses 
the economy has tumbled into a serious recession said erich 
heinemann chief economist at ladenburg thalmann amp co in new 
york the financial structure is at risk even so the year ahead 
could be surprisingly good for wall street 
with an assist from the federal reserve we expect the economy 
to rebound during the second half of 1991 this has exciting 
implications for financial markets 
to put a number on his optimism david bostian at jesup 
josephthal amp co forecasts that the dow jones industrial average 
will climb to 5000 as early as middecade 
this recession is providing painful but valuable lessons to 
governments corporations and individuals that will improve their 
economic conduct in the 1990s he maintains 
the new decade will see savings and investment favored 
relative to consumption and equity favored over debt to cite only 
two critical changes 
like many optimists in other areas of the economy wall streets 
bulls are counting on the present crunch ultimately to serve as a 
purgative and restorative rather than destructive force 
one central theme in this kind of argument is that the debt mess 
of the 1980s with all the problems it has caused will be cleaned 
up before too long but not forgotten 
says bostian i think the banks may have learned a 
longtoberemembered lesson on the importance of lending for 
productive economic activity rather than financial speculation 
what is more some observers argue a reborn distaste for credit 
excess is likely to help foster a longlasting decline in interest 
rates 
now that recession is clear to everyone anxiety about 
inflation will evaporate contends robert barbera economist at 
shearson lehman brothers inc 
backtoback decades of low inflation are likely to break the 
back of inflationary expectations as a consequence interest rates 
should decline more than inflation as real rates fall as well 
for investors who spent the past 10 years in money market 
funds or certificates of deposit the collapse of high real rates 
on cash instruments is not good news 
we believe that to obtain higher returns in the 1990s 
investors will need to accept the volatility associated with stocks 
and bonds and these of course would benefit from such a change in 
strategy 
whether they accept such reasoning or not some analysts suspect 
there is more pain to be endured before any party gets started 
to establish a bona fide bottom to the bear market they assert 
investors in greater numbers will have to be driven from the scene 
in discouragement or disgust 
this never again mood is not yet manifest in such important 
arenas as mutual fund activity indeed through the first 10 months 
of 1990 while the stock market was sagging investors snapped up 
56 billion in new shares of stock mutual funds challenging a 
record of 67 billion set in 1987 
at past market bottoms hardly anybody wanted any part of stock 
funds 
observers looking for extremes of pessimism say the requisite 
gloom is much easier to find however within the securities 
industry itself where talk abounds that the good days are forever 
gone 
aside from the business of money management executives in the 
brokerage business these days seem hardpressed to find any facet 
of their operations that promises much money to be made 
wall street has been through its own private recession for the 
past three years says heinemann firms have cut back they 
have pared their costs

not so long ago americans were carefree 
consumers armed with credit cards they went cheerfully into debt 
satisfying needs and whims with few worries about the future 
but the broadening recession has made oncespendthrift shoppers 
timid as evidenced by a sharp downturn in spending yet some 
observers see a silver lining to these hard times and say consumers 
may emerge as wiser and more demanding customers 
if consumers start retrenching and saving more that might 
make more money available for investment which could stimulate 
the economy said sandra shaber an economist with futures group in 
washington 
the slowdown in consumer spending may just be a mixed blessing 
its bad in the sense that its going to aggravate the 
downturn in the economy in the shortterm said lawrence 
chimerine a senior adviser with drimcgraw hill inc a 
forecasting concern in lexington mass but in the longterm a 
lot of families have been loaded with debt and they need time to 
make an adjustment 
still consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of the 
gross national product must remain buoyant enough for the economy 
to recover 
over the past few months growth in consumer credit has dropped 
sharply in october consumer credit was growing at an annual rate 
of 24 percent down from a 46 percent growth rate in september 
and 5 percent in august 
a year earlier americans were taking on debt much more freely 
credit rose at an annual rate as high as 6 percent in august 1989 
the great heyday when consumers were borrowing even more 
rapidly than what their income growth was came in 86 ms shaber 
said but for the next two years debt continued to grow but at 
about the same pace as income and since the beginning of 1990 it 
has fallen behind the rate of income growth she said 
ms shaber attributed the recent slippage in consumer debt to a 
slowdown in income growth that began in 1989 and continued into 
this past year people have less money to spend and theyre going 
to buy less she said 
other factors also have helped bring consumer spending levels in 
line with income the tax reform act of 1986 which phased out the 
deduction for most consumer debt made some americans realize they 
had to take a more responsible attitude toward spending 
many consumers have put spending on nonessentials such as 
clothing furniture and appliances on hold as the unemployment 
rate climbs and the middle east crisis looms as a huge uncertainty 
the reluctance to spend money in department and discount stores 
has forced retailers to become more lean by cutting their 
inventories and buying less merchandise with less demand for goods 
at us factories production is down and that has meant layoffs 
for hundreds of thousands of workers in recent months 
it doesnt end there consumers who are not working have even 
less money so they are scaling back spending and the cycle begins 
all over again 
harry l davis a professor of marketing at the university of 
chicago graduate school of business found another silver lining 
people having little money to waste on goods that wear out or 
break down easily are becoming better consumers 
they have learned how to say no this quality isnt high 
enough davis said 
a consumers decision to put off a big purchase may be the 
result of being to some extent better informed and wanting to buy 
things that are going to be longerlasting values he said 
this growing sophistication among consumers is putting pressure 
on us manufacturers to come up with better ideas and products 
automakers must now market their cars based on durability and 
safety instead of image while mcdonalds is spending a lot of 
time grappling with consumer demands for healthier food davis 
said 
manufacturers are not the only ones having to shape up 
retailers facing tougher competition for fewer consumer 
dollars must come up with better merchandise at the right price 
they have to improve customer service and make their stores 
convenient and attractive 
the consumers are providing more challenge to companies 
davis said

if you read the lips of george bush and saddam 
hussein in 1990 youre probably wondering how youre going to pay 
the oil and tax bills this coming year 
those two elements of the economic equation suddenly turned into 
wild cards but the news isnt all bad 
higher taxes for one could help trim the us budget deficit 
which many economists call the main problem others fear a bigger 
tax bite will hamper economic expansion 
higher oil prices might revive energy conservation but it seems 
doubtful they will last the persian gulf crisis also has prompted 
the government to speed efforts at developing a national energy 
policy 
but in the short run the higher tax and fuel bills wont be 
much fun for anybody except perhaps the tax collectors and the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
consumers have to cut back on their spending because theyre 
spending more money on fuel and heating oil said edwin s 
rothschild of citizen action a washingtonbased consumer group 
businesses are having to spend more and people are being laid 
off the airlines are having a hard time 
rothschild estimated that before this cold season ends the 
average household that uses home heating oil will have to pay 
between 300 and 500 more to keep warm 
consumers also were paying about 30 cents a gallon more for 
gasoline as the year drew to a close experts pointed out however 
that when inflation is taken into account fuel prices were much 
cheaper in 1990 thn they were in the early 1980s when the 
aftershocks of the iranian revolution pushed oil prices higher 
regardless the effects of the expensive oil will ripple through 
the economy which is already running into hard times 
it is a major contributing factor to the recession that we are 
entering rothschild said 
although many economists and wall streeters were proclaiming a 
recession throughout the fall the government carefully avoided 
uttering what has become known as the dreaded rword 
the administrations deeds spoke louder than words however 
when bush abandoned his read my lips pledge of no new taxes 
the government instituted a sweeping package of higher taxes on 
income gasoline cigarettes and liquor 
the gasoline tax increase of 51 cents a gallon added to the 
burden of higher fuel costs brought on by the persian gulf crisis 
economists say it will hit working people and the poor hardest 
during 1990 americans had to work fulltime from jan 1 to may 
5 before they had paid off their entire tax burden according to 
the tax foundation a washington watchdog group 
its too early to pinpoint the date of tax freedom day for 
1991 but the foundation estimates it will be pushed back again 
it really cant help but make it even worse tax foundation 
spokesman bill ahern said the only thing that could prevent the 
day from getting worse would be a phenomenal economic recovery for 
1991 that doesnt seem to be in the cards if you look at the taxes 
they are substantial 
many economists see the tax burden as a bigger threat to the 
family budget than expensive oil because oil is plentiful despite 
the gulf crisis 
in december opec ministers agreed to reinstate production 
quotas once the turmoil ends but oil analysts predict the cartel 
will have a tough time executing that plan 
the american petroleum institute a leading industry trade 
organization said if crude prices come down and stay down the 
prices of refined petroleum products will have to follow 
as 1991 progresses it could reveal whether the united states 
has changed any of its energy priorities after suffering the oil 
shock of 1990 
the energy department is expected to release a longawaited 
energy strategy that will include expanded uses of alternative 
fuels as well as proposals for drilling for oil in the arctic 
national wildlife refuge

after years of haggling with the third world 
over unpaid loans commercial banks began a new decade with a new 
crisis in their own backyard 
a recession higher oil prices sagging real estate markets and 
growing corporate debt put the industry in more red ink over the 
past year many were forced to tighten lending cut dividends lay 
off staff and restructure operations to stay afloat 
id say the banking industry is probably overall in the worst 
shape its been since weve been rating banks in the early 1970s 
said christopher mahoney a banking analyst for moodys investors 
service in new york we have more troubled banks more large 
troubled banks than ever before 
while others agree they say current problems arent likely to 
escalate into another savings and loan fiasco nor are they making 
many comparisons to the 1930s when the list of bank failures was 
as long as bread lines 
in fact some say a healthy dose of costcutting and lending 
discipline could rejuvenate the industry 
we have weathered this kind of storm before and we will 
weather this one as well treasury secretary nicholas brady said 
recently 
stephen berman banking analyst with county securities usa in 
new york agreed this is a troubled industry coming to grips 
with its problems 
theyre establishing reserves for the weak real estate 
cycle which will cause losses this year and next year but they 
will be stronger 
experts recall the real estate recession in the mid70s the 
collapse of the oil states and the rust and farm belts a few years 
later and the third world debt crisis in the last decade 
banks dumped billions of dollars into special reserves to cover 
losses from developing countries whose deteriorating economies 
forced them to put off or halt bank loan payments by the start of 
1990 big banks had amassed reserves to cover on average about 
half their total loan exposure according to a moodys report 
just as they did with third world debt banks have set up 
reserves or written off troubled real estate loans 
by sept 30 these loans made up 61 percent of the nonperforming 
loans of 23 large bank holding companies studied by 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york loans that are 
nonperforming may be delinquent or in default 
during the third quarter bank earnings slid 29 percent over the 
previous quarter according to the latest data from the federal 
deposit insurance corp itself under financial strain 
the fdic report noted however that 89 percent of the nations 
12400 commercial banks made money in the quarter and that the 
money losers were largely comprised of banks in the 
recessionplagued northeast but it said that was likely to change 
by 1991 as more banks particularly on the west coast report 
problems with real estate loans 
twothirds of the nations loan officers admitted to tightening 
lending standards on construction and land development loans a 
recent federal reserve survey found about a quarter restricted 
credit for residential mortgages by requiring higher down payments 
and bigger household incomes 
consumers can still get money unless theyre 
overleveraged county securities berman said 
overleveraging or piling up more debt than one can easily 
handle was the name of the game during the 80s and banks were 
all too eager to accommodate the binge but the buying spree ended 
as the economy worsened 
banks are recognizing that maybe they did go beyond the bounds 
of conservative lending said charles j orabutt a vice 
president at duff and phelps inc in chicago 
bad loans from highly leveraged transactions made up 12 percent 
of the nonperforming loans of the 23 banks surveyed by 
prudentialbache in the third quarter some experts predict that as 
many as 20 percent of highly leveraged companies will require some 
form of debt restructuring 
chase manhattan corp charged off 35 million of a loan to an 
unnamed highly leveraged corporate borrower in the third 
quarter analysts believe it was a reference to cashstrapped 
developer and casino owner donald trump who restructured some of 
his bank loans 
banks scaled back foreign operations while consolidating and 
strengthening domestically to save money and to meet stricter 
standards for capital reserves which take full effect in 1993 
citicorp for instance announced a major reorganization just 
before the holidays that included laying off as many as 8000 
employees and cutting its dividend to shareholders by 44 percent 
the nations largest bank also decided to close twothirds of its 
commercial real estate and corporate banking offices in north 
america 
security pacific corp eliminated its entire merchant banking 
division which lent money to large corporations and underwrote 
securities overseas 
chase reduced its staff by about 5000 and halved its dividend 
while chemical banking corp slashed its dividend 63 percent 
through the 1990s well see most banking companies concentrate 
on establishing strong domestic operations said robert dugger 
chief economist for the american bankers association trade group 
dugger also predicted more bank marriages of convenience 
i suspect there will be many mergers of banks to economize on 
their operations interstate and intrastate and improve 
profitability he said this consolidation process will 
continue through the 1990s

the big three automakers have fresh management 
teams and their employees have new contracts but dont be fooled 
the us auto industry is facing old problems requiring action 
car and truck sales tumbled in 199 profits fell and the 
specter of losses reappeared bluecollar workers wondered weekly 
if they would be at home or on the assembly line the industry was 
declared to be in a recession 
in a climate of unprecedented competition that includes japanese 
companies building cars in the united states executives and labor 
union leaders are looking for new ways to make money 
we are facing an extremely competitive struggle which is 
not going to go away chrysler motors president robert lutz said 
the economy can turn around but the japanese transplants and the 
offshore producers will still be there 
weve got to tell the fords the chryslers the hondas the 
nissans that weve got a product for them said joseph 
hasenjager union president at a general motors corp brake 
component plant in dayton ohio thats the only way you get job 
security 
union and management leaders are hopeful that new threeyear 
contracts between gm chrysler corp and ford motor co and the 
united auto workers will create harmony and avoid disputes that 
could further hurt the industry 
the contracts cover more than 450000 active autoworkers the 
companies have committed billions of dollars to provisions for full 
wages for workers laid off from plants closed because of sales 
slumps 
it is essential that we retain the good will we have ford 
president philip benton said the contract has reinforced that 
atmosphere 
the industry will need all the good feelings it can muster and 
more to reverse losses in market share 
at the end of november the big three held just over 70 percent 
of the us car and truck market to about 24 percent for japanese 
automakers in 1989 gm ford and chrysler had a 737 percent share 
to 224 percent for the japanese 
the industry appeared to be ready for a recovery in the late 
summer when iraq invaded kuwait oil prices skyrocketed and car 
and truck sales fell in the last three months of 1990 the big 
three companies are expected to record their first quarterly loss 
since 1981 
profits are under enormous pressure in north america and they 
started out from an abysmal level benton said 
analysts expect big three profits to fall about 75 percent in 
1990 from 84 billion the previous year that means intensified 
competition for the fewer car and truck buyers 
gms is making the challenge from spring hill tenn site of 
its saturn car project the sevenyear 3 billion effort is aimed 
directly at the honda civic nissan sentra and toyota corolla 
but car buying tanked as the first car rolled off the assembly 
line executives predicted that up to onethird of firstyear sales 
would come from owners of other gm vehicles 
saturns quality control resulted in far fewer cars being 
shipped to dealers than expected some dealers who had invested 
millions in saturn were asked to delay openings or had only one or 
two cars on the showroom floor 
it didnt make for good public relations in an industry that has 
stressed vehicle quality recognizing the reputation of japanese 
automakers for reliability 
management shakeups also are part of the big threes hopes for 
revival 
within 10 hours of officially succeeding roger smith in gms top 
job robert stempel unveiled a new management structure at ford 
harold poling took over from donald petersen but only for three 
years 
at chrysler vice chairman gerald greenwald took early 
retirement to head a union effort to buy united airlines the bid 
failed but greenwald still received a reported 9 million 
as the industry worried about the erosion in americans devotion 
to american cars chrysler chairman lee iacocca faulted greenwald 
for leaving the struggling automaker 
he grew up with me hed been in the car business for 32 
years same two companies as me ford and chrysler said 
iacocca who delayed his 1991 retirement plans isnt there 
anything sacred anymore isnt there any loyalty to anything

ten years after a flood of lowcost imports 
devastated americas steelmakers one of the nations historic core 
industries is competitive again 
it took a great deal of pain and suffering but the industry 
is now awake and in some cases remarkably astute and smart said 
john jacobson an analyst with aus consultants in philadelphia 
the pain came in the form of 200000 job reductions hundreds of 
mill closings and billions of dollars in spending to increase 
efficiency the gain is evident in falling imports and rising 
profits 
lower production costs and a weaker dollar have boosted american 
steels competitiveness us steelmakers now produce a ton of 
steel in about 5 manhours lowest in the world and nearly half 
the time it took in 1980 
still the united states remains the worlds biggest steel 
importer foreign rivals especially japan and the european 
community arent standing still 
the japanese already were further ahead and theyre running at 
a much faster pace said hans mueller an economics professor and 
consultant at middle tennessee stae university the americans 
are just catching up 
in the first nine months of 1990 imports comprised about 17 
percent of the us steel market making america the worlds 
largest importer according to the american iron and steel 
institute a washington trade group most imports came from europe 
and japan followed by canada south korea brazil and many other 
countries 
the ec and japan are the worlds leading exporters of finished 
steel the united states exported about 46 million tons in 1989 
far less than the top exporters 
the relative value of international currencies more than 
anything else will determine the global competitiveness of 
american steel in the 1990s said charles a bradford a metals 
expert for union bank of switzerland in new york 
the steel industry may be the biggest beneficiary of the 
weakness in the dollar he said the biggest cost of an 
integrated steelmaker is wages if you compare wages around the 
world its all a matter of the value of the dollar 
the united states was the dominant force in the international 
steel market following world war ii and led the world in steel 
production in the 1950s 
but japan and european countries rebuilt their postwar 
industries from scratch using modern technology as us mills 
rusted imports cracked 15 percent by the 1970s and reached an 
alltime high of 264 percent in 1984 
american steelmakers lost about 119 billion from 1980 to 1986 
when hundreds of mills closed and more than 200000 workers 
nationwide left the payrolls 
the picture is brighter now steelmakers made about 15 billion 
in profits in 1989 the cost of halting production while plants 
were modernized was a major factor in 1989 and will continue to 
hurt profits 
the cost of modernization is taking its toll but in the long 
run theyre much better off bradford said this is what you 
need to do if you want to be competitive 
in 1980 about 20 percent of american steel was made in modern 
continuous casters which turn molten steel directly into slabs 
skipping costly and timeconsuming steps 
today about 66 percent of american steel is made that way and 
the figure is expected to reach about 90 percent by the year 2000 
said sheldon wesson a spokesman for the american iron and steel 
institute in 1989 japan made about 94 percent of its steel and 
belgium about 91 percent in continuous casters 
the effort goes on nobody is satisfied wesson said the 
industry says it has spent in the last 10 years perhaps half what 
it would have liked to spend on mill modernization 
you look at the profit picture and you wonder where the next 
billion is going to come from he said this is all 
selffinanced this is all pulling yourself up by the boot 
straps

a city that relies on the auto industry 
to avoid the recession gripping the rest of america its happening 
in nashville 
economists said this southern city took its economic lumps early 
and has settled into a period of stability as other regions are 
forced to retrench the consolidation and weeding out already has 
occurred 
i think what has happened in nashville is that the boom growth 
levels have slowed down said william fox an economist at the 
university of tennessees center for business and economic 
research 
and in that sense nashville might have taken its economic 
lick early he said 
leading the way in nashville are a budding automotive 
manufacturing industry a diversified services sector and an early 
brush with negative growth economists said 
construction for example took a beating in 1989 and a 
little into 1990 fox said but at a time when manufacturing 
is generally going down nashville is being held up by the auto 
industry which is kind of odd 
car and truck sales and industry profits dropped in 1990 but 
two big manufacturers have chosen sites near nashville for new 
factories on which they are pinning hopes for buoyant sales 
general motors corp built its 19 billion saturn corp plant 
in spring hill about 40 miles south of nashville the plant and 
its more than 3600 employees and 700 contract workers began making 
the car in october 
more than 3500 people are employed by nissan motor 
manufacturing corp usa in smyrna about 25 miles southeast of 
nashville 
nissan is in the midst of an 490 million expansion that will 
add 2000 production jobs for total employment of 5500 by 1992 
the expansion will raise nissans smyrna investment to 12 
billion 
gm embarked on the sevenyear saturn effort to develop a car 
that could compete with the honda civic nissan sentra and toyota 
corolla 
saturn is in the early production stages and has not yet reached 
full output unlike aging plants that automakers are closing 
elsewhere in the country 
nissan and saturn dont look like theyll be a factor in 
recession fox said 
saturn intended to start slowly nissan is still in its 
expansion mode so they are not influenced by the business cycle 
he said they very well may be influenced three years from now 
nissan plans to build 165000 sentras at smyrna in the 1991 
model year the plant has a production capacity of 180000 cars a 
year nissans manufacturing president jerry benefield said 
the japanese automaker which also produces light pickup trucks 
in smyrna will add a third vehicle line which has not been 
disclosed with theexpansion 
nashville also is weathering the decline facing other big cities 
because of a broad and recessionproof services sector of 
insurance companies hospitals and the headquarters of hospital 
corp of america 
it has a nice diversified economy and its very well 
located fox said this place is very well situated for growth 
and theres no reason to worry about it

viewed as a mechanical structure the us 
economy needs retooling reconditioning rebuilding parts have to 
be rehoned bolts and rivets tightened and the whole works needs a 
lube job 
it hasnt collapsed like the soviet system and it isnt likely 
to do so it doesnt need junking either because nothing better 
has been invented to replace it but it is badly worn abused by 
the greed and grind of the 1980s 
the greatest erosion was from debt and the resolution trust 
corp has the job of liquidating or selling off hundreds of 
collapsed savings and loan associations with the total bill 
conceivably reaching 600 billion 
throughout 1990 banks were forced to write off billions of 
dollars in failed corporate deals and loans with real estate 
developers and third world nations the total bank bill could only 
be surmised but the extent of the damage was illustrated when just 
one chase manhattan corp took a 1 billion charge against 
earnings to cover bad debts 
one of the oddest twists in the credit disaster was that banks 
themselves found it difficult to raise money bankers accustomed 
to hearing tales of woe from wouldbe borrowers had worse problems 
of their own chase the nations second largest commercial banking 
enterprise was forced to offer 13017 percent to sell 200 million 
of notes citicorp parent of the largest bank suffered the 
indignity of having its own credit rating lowered 
industrial companies many loaded with debt showed the strains 
standard amp poors corp found that dividend increases in 1990 fell 
to their lowest levels in 20 years 23 percent fewer than in 1989 
the payout money just wasnt there 
dun amp bradstreet said that in the first 11 months of 1990 
55000 companies failed up 19 percent from 1989 also disturbing 
was that the size of liabilities was up sharply indicating that 
more large companies were filing for protection from creditors 
nearly every industry was affected by failures failures among 
real estate companies which floated the debt among financial 
institutions which helped them raise the funds and among 
insurers which bought the highyielding debt rose more than 30 
percent 
what was the extent of that corporate debts this 
nonfinancial corporate borrowing as a percentage of gross 
national product rose to 67 percent in 1989 from 47 percent 20 
years earlier and 39 percent 30 years ago 
in the late 1980s half the funds raised by nonfinancial 
corporations came from debt issues with the other half from equity 
offerings but as recently as the 1960s and 1970s the average was 
only 24 percent debt 
in the 20 years through 1989 the ratio of interest expense to 
corporate earnings more than doubled to 40 percent 
since the market plunge of 1987 securities firms had been 
shrinking their own businesses disbanding departments that had 
helped arrange takeovers and junkbond offerings laying off 
workers and closing entire offices the pace quickened in 1990 
with the economy sinking dealmaking was done and rather than 
christmas bonuses many highpaid employees received pink slips 
consumers were in debt up to the limit of their visa cards or 
the caps on their home equity loans personal bankruptcies rose 15 
percent in 1990 and would likely rise again in 1991 late in the 
year home mortgage delinquencies also rose 
uncle sam of course remained in debt unable to balance his 
budget by some estimates the budget deficit could exceed 300 
billion in the coming year this after a tortuous round of 
socalled budget trimming 
economic growth inevitably succumbed to such impossible 
circumstances and the big question now is how deep the downturn 
will be the consensus of forecasts including that from the white 
house is that any recession will be shallow and brief probably 
ending during the summer 
however many of the forecasts come with a caveat that never 
in the postworld war ii era have similar conditions been 
encountered forecasters point to the rickety condition of the 
financial underpinnings and ask if those loans can be repaid in an 
orderly way or whether the structural rivets will give way 
clearly a new era is here in the old era credit was cool in 
the new debt is dumb businesses seeking to rid themselves of debt 
are offering lenders equity instead rjr nabisco inc taken 
private in the biggest debtfinanced buyout ever offered just 
before christmas to trade stock and cash for some of it 
highyielding junk bonds 
lenders are biting the bullet and writing off loans that once 
they claimed were still collectable consumers are cutting 
consumption 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady hinted that legislation 
affecting banking would be on the agenda for 1991 the 
administration of president bush he said was committed to 
promoting legislation and encouraging regulations that will allow 
banks to reshape their activities to operate profitably and soundly 
in business environment made new by technological changes 
meanwhile businesses and households are seeking to cut waste 
work more productively and get those bills paid in short america 
is banking on a return to the old verities chief among them the 
exercise of common sense

hard times could put a squeeze on research and 
development spending by us businesses but experts warn against 
cutbacks that divert americans from the global technology race 
its an easy but foolish place to cut said richard shaffer 
editor of technologic computer letter a computer industry 
newsletter 
despite gloomy talk many experts say us scientists and 
engineers continue to make breakthroughs in a variety of fields and 
hold their own in a number of technologies 
i dont think were any less innovative and creative than we 
were 20 years ago even though some people think were becoming 
soft and the japanese are going to run over us said donald 
wilson an assistant professor of management at rochester institute 
of technology 
still some financially struggling companies have little choice 
its selfdefeating in the long run but if youre worried 
about surviving this year you dont worry about the long run 
said david wyss research director of the economic consulting firm 
drimcgrawhill inc 
the need for us companies to maintain research and development 
spending is especially acute in light of steppedup research 
efforts by japanese companies particularly in this country 
in recent years many japanese hightechnology companies have 
opened us research centers to which they attract us scientists 
with high salaries japanese companies also have boosted research 
spending at us universities 
wilson said these moves are an admission that the united states 
is a hub of innovation were seen as kind of the creative 
leaders he said 
us companies overall spend more than twice as much on research 
and development as their japanese counterparts but a smaller 
amount as a percentage of gross national product 
japans science and technology agency says that nations 
research and development spending equaled about 285 percent of its 
gnp in 1989 compared with 253 percent in the united states 
in 1990 us corporate rampd spending is expected to total about 
108 billion with 357 billion of that coming from the federal 
government the national science foundation says 
as for the year ahead a trade group called the industrial 
research institute is optimistic its survey of 137 major 
researchoriented companies shows 41 percent plan to spend at least 
6 percent more on rampd than in 1990 only 16 percent expect a 
decline 
but the group notes the respondents combined rampd as a 
percent of sales is not expected to change from 1990 to 1991 a 
sluggish economy therefore would restrain actual rampd spending 
increases 
the national science foundation says it began detecting a drop 
in annual growth of rampd spending by us companies as early as 
1986 such spending grew 4 percent to 10 percent a year in the 
early 1980s after adjusting for inflation but fell to 2 percent to 
3 percent a year since 1986 the group says 
one of the main reasons was simply a slowdown in sales and 
profit expectations said foundation spokesman john jankowski 
an additional drag on corporate rampd spending has been the 
decline in the federal defense budget he said 
some xperts believe the recession will force us companies to 
change the emphasis of their research 
i think they will try and do more with less which really 
means we will see a substantial focusing down peripheral areas or 
research with longerterm horizons will disappear said g 
steven burrill director of high technology for ernst amp young the 
accounting and consulting firm 
david methe another rochester institute of technology 
management professor says the real danger in a recession is that 
us companies may lay off research workers these employees 
represent repositories of knowledge and receptors of knowledge 
from outside that could not easily be replaced he said 
experts say they dont expect the recession to have the same 
impact on rampd in japan where companies are said to have a much 
longerterm focus 
i see them going the other direction with increased 
research spending burrill said 
while the total amount of us corporate research spending is 
important experts say they are equally concerned if not more so 
about the ability of us companies to turn innovations into 
products 
us companies have long excelled at basic research but have a 
spotty history of capitalizing on these breakthroughs in the 
marketplace that is an area in which the japanese appear to have a 
clear lead 
when you look at almost any product the basic work of it was 
done in the us and europe and when the products came out they 
were japanese whether its cds or video tapes said wyss 
experts trace part of the reason to the greater number of 
engineers in japan as a percentage of the population than in the 
united states another factor they cite is that japanese research 
is often more pragmatic and productoriented

it was the year manhattan apartment prices 
actually went down and some california builders staggering under 
unsold inventories gave away a new car with each house sold 
in florida new homes and condos sat empty because retirees 
could not sell their homes up north wouldbe home sellers in 
affluent new york suburbs slashed asking prices by 100000 and 
more and still no takers 
it was the year when lucille balls mansion in beverly hills 
an enclave where common economic trends arent supposed to apply 
sat unpurchased even after the asking price was cut from 78 
million to 56 million 
it was the year in which even the redhot seattle market turned 
as cool as the squalls off puget sound 
in short it was a time when regional weaknesses in home sales 
the northeast since the stock market crash of 1987 the oil states 
before that threatened to engulf the country in a national real 
estate recession 
or at least both coasts in many parts of the south and midwest 
home prices and sales levels have remained at more modest levels 
sales were up 3 percent during the first 11 months of 1990 at 
remax of northern illinois said betty hegner the president of 
the operation with 116 offices and nearly 2000 agents 
i have to say there are some markets where there definitely 
is a softening of the market especially during the last quarter 
she said 
expensive homes those priced above 200000 were selling 
slowly recently in part because their owners wont reduce prices 
she said but we have a lot of bright spots too we think its a 
good time to buy 
even on the coasts was it a recession or merely the end of a 
cycle that was still unclear in many regions take the northwest 
where few could believe that 1989 and early 1990 sales and prices 
could long be sustained any more than the increases in california 
in 1988 could go on forever 
we had phenomenal appreciation said maria bunting 
executive vice president of windermere real estate in seattle 
for a real estate agent it was as good as the wildest dreams of 
what they would like it to be 
by spring houses flooded the market as prices peaked buyers 
pulled back sellers panicked and home prices began to fall over 
the summer 
it was an adjustment period ms bunting said describing 
the region as now having a normal buyerseller balance 
lower prices brought home ownership closer to millions of 
people national association of realtors statistics showed a 
decline from july to october of 98300 to 92800 in the median 
price of a home the price at which half of the sales were for 
more half for less 
jill and robert mccarty saw both sides of the equation and 
figure they came out ahead the couple he an accountant and she a 
manicurist bought their dream house in december a fourbedroom 
2100squarefoot new home with a threecar garage in saugus an 
outer suburb north of los angeles 
they sold their first home a fixerupper they bought six 
years ago for 105000 in the working class sun valley area of los 
angeles for 207000 
we listed it at 229000 which would have been the fair price 
a little while ago but after two weeks we dropped the price when 
we saw what was happening she said 
meanwhile they returned to the tracts in more comfortably 
middleclass saugus and found builders cutting prices and throwing 
in extras with abandon 
we had been looking for two years up there and couldnt find 
anything we could afford she said so when the market got 
slow we said lets see what we could do we got a 310000 home 
for 250000 
that price included 5000 in closing costs paid by the builder 
and another 5000 in luxury carpet 
were never moving again mccarty said we would never 
have been able to do it if the market hadnt been like this

grain and soybean futures prices fell modestly 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade as traders waited in vain for

dull said victor lespinasse an assistant vice president in the

buy as much as 600000 metric tons of us corn and 100000 metric 
tons of us meal using credit offered last week by the bush 
administration 
but no official confirmation of grain sales surfaced during 
tuesdays session lespinasse said traders were hoping for new 
developments from london where us and soviet negotiators were 
meeting to discuss terms of the aid package 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 251 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cents lower with december at 225 a bushel oats were 
2 cents to 4 cents lower with december at 106 a bushel

the federal reserve board announced today it 
was lowering its key bank lending rate from 7 percent to 65 
percent effective wednesday 
action was taken against the background of weakness in the 
economy constraints on credit and slow growth in the monetary 
aggregates the announcment said the reduction in part 
realigns the discount rate with market interest rates 
the fed said the board acted on requests from fed banks in 
boston new york richmond atlanta chicago st louis 
minneapolis kansas city and dallas 
the vote was 60 
a decrease in the feds discount rate often signals that other 
shortterm loans such as adjustablerate mortgages and car loans 
also will become less expensive 
it was the first change in the discount rate since the central 
bank raised it from 65 percent on feb 24 1989 and the first 
reduction since august 1986 
the discount rate epresents the interest the federal reserve 
charges on loans to banks and other financial institutions 
the board acted on the same day its monetary arm the federal 
open market committee met behind closed doors to consider whether 
to ease credit conditions 
the reduction also came amid signs the already weak economy may 
be sliding into a recession the fed began boosting the rate three 
years ago to slow the economy and thus dampen inflationary 
pressures 
as evidence mounted that the economy was becoming dangerously 
weak the central bank slowly eased shortterm rates that peaked in 
the spring of 1989 
the bush administration had been pressuring the central bank to 
ease interest rates aggressively in an effort to lessen the 
severity of the recession that many economists think has begun

lands end inc is performing a 
difficult juggling act this christmas like most retailers the 
company is trying to keep its sales buoyant despite the recession 
but its also gambling on new merchandise lines and a new marketing 
scheme aimed at expanding and reinvigorating its business 
the catalog giant known for its turtleneck shirts denim jeans 
and softsided luggage ran in the red for the first three quarters 
of its current fiscal year following a disastrous christmas 1989 
the firm is resting its hopes for a rebound on a shift in its 
strategy 
after selling for years through a general catalog one that 
included all of its stock lands end is putting out specialty 
catalogs featuring particular lines such as mens shirts and ties 
childrens wear or bed and bath products 
the company has also expanded its main catalog to add novelty 
gifts and pet products including a 75 pillow for dogs and a 10 
brass silent dog training whistle 
analysts said the strategy is positive and appears to extend the 
firms reach into upper class markets already served by two big 
lands end competitors spiegel and ll bean 
the new approach also delivers products more efficiently to 
traditional customers by creating special catalogs for consumers 
with special needs the analysts said 
this company is not changing from polka dots to stripes 
theyre seeking to raise their appeal level to core customers 
said paul shain vice president of research for broker robert w 
baird and co in milwaukee 
richard c anderson lands ends president and chief executive 
officer agreed with the analysts predicting significant sales 
boosts from the specialty catalogs and their new products 
he said the company would update its styles with new colors and 
fabrics but does not plan any radical fashion changes 
we are classic and simple and generally understated 
anderson said its our belief that classic clothing will never 
go out of style 
lands end founded in 1963 in chicago initially supplied 
sailboat hardware and equipment by mail but in 1976 the company 
changed its focus to leisure clothes 
while the company is enthusiastic about its new strategy it is 
tempered somewhat by the fact that it will difficult to increase 
sales while consumers are cutting back their spending in a weak 
economy 
they need to expand and theyre moving in that direction but 
when the economys lousy people are cutting back on purchases 
said marsha raley an analyst with dain bosworth in minneapolis 
for the first nine months of this year sales rose 9 percent to 
3746 million but lands end recorded an operating loss of 
259000 
the company has blamed its troubles in part on the consumer 
spending slowdown that has afflicted most retailers 
we saw some fairly early signs of the recession said 
anderson we experienced some softness in sales it was something 
we couldnt do a heck of a lot about 
lands end also lost money because of the costs of selling off 
large inventories after a disappointing christmas 1989 
a year ago the company overestimated its sales and ended up 
saddled with 857 million in inventory up 28 percent from the 
year before lands end was forced to liquidate much of the 
overstock at bargain prices and at the expense of its profits 
the company declined to comment on how it is doing so far in the 
current quarter 
with the new strategy the companys success will depend 
somewhat on its ability to forecast sales with greater accuracy and 
avoid being caught with too large an inventory said liz armstrong 
an analyst with johnson redbook in new york 
the companys slump this year has been a disappointment for the 
3200 residents in dodgeville the rural community nestled in 
southwestern wisconsin where lands end located its sprawling 
facilities in 1979 
there wont be any profit sharing this year there arent any 
profits to share said hank van epps an electrician and one of 
hundreds of dodgeville residents who work for lands end 
company officials said its too early to estimate profits for 
the current fiscal year which ends jan 31 since the fourth 
quarters holiday sales will determine how well lands end fares

the stock market spiked higher today following a 
surprise announcement that the federal reserve was cutting a 
critical lending rate 
prices languished until the final hour of trading and then 
soared on news that the fed was lowering the discount rate by 05 
percent to 65 percent 
the change in the discount rate the interest the fed charges on 
loans to banks and other financial institutions marked the first 
time the rate has moved lower since august 1986 
although economists had been calling for an easing of credit to 
bolster the stumbling economy the announcement was a surprise 
because it came while the financial markets were still open 
analysts lauded the fed action the fed has got to get this 
economy turned around said gene jay seagle a vice president at 
gruntal financial inc he likened the move to lighting a fuse that 
would allow money to flow into the stock market 
this will put a cap on what was developing into a pessimistic 
attitude toward stocks he said 
but other market watchers were more skeptical over how much of 
an impact a half a percentage point cut can actually make the 
immediate response in the economy will be long delayed and were 
going to have to slug through some very difficult quarters in 
91 said michael metz a vice president at oppenheimer amp co 
this does not signal the end of the recession by any means 
he added 
traders had hoped that todays labor department report showing 
the consumer price index advanced a moderate 03 percent in 
november would give the fed impetus to ease credit 
the report indicated inflation was being held in check giving 
the fed more leeway to ease rates without fanning the fires of 
inflation but traders still were surprised by the timing of the 
move which came while the feds policy making arm was holding a 
private meeting in washington

the board that makes the nations accounting 
rules has approved a farreaching change in the way businesses 
report healthcare costs for retired workers a move spurring 
companies to reduce retiree benefits 
the new rule which takes effect in 1993 requires companies to 
subtract from their annual earnings a portion of the costs of the 
benefits they have promised to future retirees 
experts say a handful of large companies already have instituted 
cutbacks in retiree health benefits to reduce the rule changes 
financial impact on their earnings statements 
the financial accounting standards board a federally sanctioned 
body that sets the standards for how companies report their 
financial condition approved the change dec 7 said fasb project 
manager diana scott the board gave preliminary approval to the new 
rule in october 
scott said detailed copies of the rule change will be made 
publicly available beginning friday 
theres going to be a lot of costcutting in the next 23 
years said dale yamamoto a group actuary with towers perrin a 
benefits consulting firm 
previously businesses reported only the current years outlays 
for retiree benefits in what was commonly called a pay as you 
go basis 
but the accounting profession argued that this gave investors 
and other company stakeholders an inaccurate picture of a companys 
financial health by understating what their longrange obligations 
actually were 
the new rule does not require companies to set aside money for 
future retirees but it has the potential to slash billions of 
dollars from companies financial earnings in the short term 
hurting their appeal to investors experts say 
at the same time it may help their longterm performance by 
forcing them to prepare for a fiscal future darkened by the rising 
cost of health care 
health care costs have been increasing at annual rates of about 
14 percent for many large companies consultants say far exceeding 
the nations inflation rate for companies with particularly large 
numbers of retirees such as automakers and steelmakers for 
example the benefit obligations are enormous 
for many future retirees the rulechange is generally not good 
news benefits consultants say that companies that have already 
moved to reduce their health care costs include trw american 
airlines american telephone amp telegraph and pillsbury 
while businesses do not have to start subtracting projected 
retiree benefits until their 1993 financial statements many 
already have taken measures because the magnitude of the 
obligation has gotten a lot of companies to focus on what they have 
promised and to amend that said fasbs scott 
the options that companies have instituted or are considering 
include having future retirees share the cost of paying for health 
benefits requiring them to use costcontaining health management 
organizations and relating the contributions retirees kick in to 
their number of years with the company 
in the latter instance workers who have worked more years would 
pay less 
another more drastic costsaving measure companies are 
exploring is capping the total amount paid per year in medical 
benefits to each retiree 
other companies may simply choose to report a significant 
liability on their balance sheets but that option is not expected 
to be widely used 
some companies are very sensitive to reported earnings said 
jeffrey gathers a towers perrin consultant 
under the new rule companies have the option of reporting their 
entire financial obligation to future retirees on the annual 
financial statement or to amortize or spread out that expected 
obligation over the next 20 years said richard j poccia a 
partner at coopers amp lybrand one of the leading us accounting 
firms 
its hard to say which way companies will go he said 
some companies could have the view its worth getting behind 
them

oil prices shot up late tuesday as some traders 
made lastminute purchases of crude to cover their losses from 
erroneous speculation that peace prospects in the persian gulf 
would send prices down 
you play the game you get hurt sometimes said brendan 
dolan a broker with dean witter reynolds inc people looking for 
a down move didnt get it 
light sweet crude oil showed little change most of the day on 
the new york mercantile exchange near the end of trading as the 
contract for crude delivery in january was about to expire oil 
jumped up sharply hitting 175 per barrel higher at the close 
crude settled at 2786 per barrel up 81 cents for january 
delivery 
the expiration of the nextmonth contract forced late buying by 
traders who had gone short or agreed to sell oil on the theory 
that prices would drop they got trapped into a round of 
shortcovering as crude hovered at a higher level than they had 
hoped analysts said 
before the late surge oil prices had been fairly dormant as 
persistant war fears were not strong enough to lift the market out 
of some early holiday doldrums 
the possibility that a peaceful resolution could end the middle 
east crisis was keeping a damper on the generally bullish mood 
fueled by the continual failure of the united states and iraq to 
set up meetings for discussing the turmoil 
the market seems to kind of be stuck on the one hand by the 
perception that maybe war is more likely but the fear is that if 
there is an eleventhhour diplomatic solution it would send it 
down said peter beutel an oil analyst with pegasus econometric 
group inc in hoboken nj 
natural gas prices which have taken a heavy hit lately amid 
warmish fall weather tumbled another 129 cents settling at 
2046 per 1000 cubic feet on january delivery contracts which 
also expired tuesday 
in october natural gas for january delivery had traded as high 
as 290 per 1000 cubic feet but the weather has stripped away 
almost a third of that futures price by the time the industry was 
getting set to arrange deliveries of natural gas for january over 
the next week or so 
prices are declining in the cash market because of the very 
warm weather weve had so far said annlouise hittle a senior 
oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
futures prices for refined petroleum products showed little 
change tuesday 
home heating oil for january delivery was up 94 cent at 7567 
per gallon unleaded gasoline for january delivery was up 39 cent 
at 6672 per gallon 
unlike crude oil and natural gas their contracts for january 
delivery will be traded until later this month 
after the oil market was closed the american petroleum 
institute reported the nations crude supply had risen last week 
as had gasoline stocks although the home heating oil supply was 
down a bit 
the crude oil stockpile was at 3415 million barrels up from 
3321 million barrels a week earlier but down from 3478 million 
barrels a year earlier api said in its weekly survey 
the gasoline stockpile was at 2246 million barrels up from 
2217 million barrels a week earlier and down from 2265 million 
barrels a year earlier 
the supply of distillates which include home heating oil were 
at 1326 million barrels down from 1334 million barrels a week 
earlier but up from 1162 million barrels a year earlier

stock price were whipped into a late rally 
tuesday by a surprise announcement that the federal reserve will 
cut a key lending rate 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials jumped 3341 points to 
close at 262673 after languishing for most of the session 
advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 5 to 3 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
969 up 577 down and 501 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 17646 million 
shares up from 11856 million in the previous session 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 21456 million shares 
stock and bond prices spiked higher in the final hour of trading 
following the announcement that the fed will cut the discount rate 
from 7 percent to 65 percent effective wednesday 
the move long sought by economists and politicians to prevent 
the economy from stumbling into an unnecessarily deep recession 
marked the first easing of the rate since august 1986 the news 
caught the markets by surprise in part because it came while 
trading was still under way 
some analysts argued however that the cut was not important 
from a technical standpoint since it merely brings the discount 
rate into alignment with other interest rates that already have 
been reduced 
but all agreed the feds action was critical from a 
psychological perspective it sends a message to the markets and 
to consumers a very loud and strong message that the fed is 
aware the economy is slowing and is doing something about it 
said hugh johnson a senior vice president at first albany corp 
therefore it might be one of the many pieces that helps 
stabilize consumer confidence which has been rapidly 
deteriorating he added 
the rate cut helped draw buyers jolting the market higher but 
analysts were divided over how long the cut might influence 
trading 
gene jay seagle a vice president at gruntal financial inc 
likened the fed action to lighting a fuse and allowing funds to 
flow into equities he said it could put the dow average on track 
to challenge the 2700 level 
but on the economic front michael metz a vice president at 
oppenheimer amp co countered that this does not signal the end of 
the recession by any means were going to have to slug through 
some very difficult quarters in 91 
economists generally agree that it usually takes between six and 
nine months for a change in monetary policy to filter through and 
have an impact on the economy 
the fed announcement followed a labor department report showing 
a moderate 03 percent rise in the consumer price index in 
november traders felt the report which indicated inflation is 
restrained gave the fed room to ease rates 
among actively traded big board issues citicorp rose to 14lsqb

orange juice futures prices soared in panicked buying tuesday on 
the new york cotton exchange as forecasts for a frosty christmas 
weekend in much of the country tripped memories of last years 
disastrous florida freeze 
but analysts and meteorologists said fears of a similar killing 
frost in the next week were unfounded because freezing temperatures 
from the cold wave are unlikely to reach florida and the orange 
harvest is running far ahead of last years 
on other commodity markets oil futures rallied strongly 
precious metals rose grains and soybeans retreated and livestock 
and meat futures were mixed 
frozen concentrated orange juice futures prices settled 49 
cents to 575 cents higher with the contract for delivery in 
january up 575 cents at 10975 a pound a fourweek high 
orange juice futures have climbed by nearly 10 cents or about 
10 pecent since dropping below 1 a pound on dec 10 for the first 
time in more than four years 
the market generally has been falling since midoctober when 
the agriculture department projected a florida orange harvest of 
165 million 90pound boxes a 45 percent increase over a year ago 
the forecast was unchanged in last weeks usda crop report 
orange juice prices spiked above 2 a pound last january after a 
christmas eve freeze ruined an estimated 30 percent of the flrida 
orange crop 
a florida freeze looks unlikely for this weekend although much 
of the central and western united states is in for bitter cold 
said peter r leavitt executive director of weather services corp 
in bedford mass 
were not expecting this to be a threat to florida at least 
over the next five days he said on the contrary temperatures 
over the next few days in florida will be well above normal 
judith ganes orange juice analyst with merrill lynch amp co 
said the rally began when traders holding obligations to sell 
orange juice began buying offsetting contracts to even up their 
positions ahead of the fourday holiday weekend 
she said that buying prompted rumors of a florida freeze threat 
and then you saw people starting to panic it was a snowball 
effect 
but ganes said that even if a freeze similar to last years did 
occur the damage would be much less because the crop now is 
concentrated farther south than a year ago and at least 25 percent 
of it already has been picked compared with 8 percent at the same 
time last year 
oil prices shot up late in the session on the new york 
mercantile exchange as some traders made lastminute purchases of 
crude to cover their losses from erroneous speculation that peace

the dollar fell moderately against most foreign 
currencies tuesday in a flurry of trading prompted by a 
longawaited move from the federal reserve board to lower its key 
bank lending rate 
gold prices were mixed 
however traders said the dollars decline was cushioned by the 
continued potential for a war in the persian gulf to disrupt 
foreign economies heavily dependent on imported oil 
in a normal market the drop would be a lot bigger said 
walter simon vice president at bank julius baer amp co 
the central banks lowering of the discount rate from 7 percent 
to 65 percent effective wednesday had been expected for some 
time but traders took it as a further indication of the slumping 
us economy which generally erodes the dollars value against 
foreign currencies 
action was taken against the background of weakness in the 
economy constraints on credit and slow growth in the monetary 
aggregates the fed said in announcing its first discount rate 
reduction since august 1986 a decrease in the feds discount rate 
often signals that other shortterm loans such as adjustablerate 
mortgages and car loans also will become less expensive 
this is displaying to the market the lack of confidence in the 
economy the fed has said simon 
traders said the dollar displayed its greatest weakness against 
the german mark amid a trend of rising interest rates in that 
country 
they speculated that some european economies may move this week 
to firm up their interest rates to stabilize their currencies 
against the german mark this could further weaken the dollar 
the markets response has been stronger buying marks instead 
of selling dollars said chris mendell a vice president at 
security pacific national bank 
the dollar closed at 14780 german marks in new york down from 
late mondays 14870 in europe the late dollar rate was 14840 
german marks down from 14867 late monday 
the dollar decline on the feds move came after an earlier 
weakening on the worst us monthly trade deficit numbers in almost 
three years the government reported that the trade deficit climbed 
to 1161 billion in october the biggest imbalance since february 
1988 
it cost 19305 in new york to buy one british pound unchanged 
from late monday in london sterling rose to 19350 from 19290 
late monday 
the dollar weakened in new york to a closing 13272 japanese 
yen down from 13310 late monday in tokyo the dollar fell 007 
yen to a closing 13303 yen and later in london it was quoted at

pan am corp officials met with trans world 
airlines inc chairman carl c icahn soon after getting his latest 
buyout offer a pan am spokesman said tuesday 
we have had a meeting with him since then jeff kriendler 
said kriendler declined to provide any details on who attended the 
meeting when or where it had occurred or what if anything had 
been accomplished 
icahn did not immediately return a phone call placed to his 
office in mt kisco ny 
over the weekend icahn announced plans to sell all of twas 
london routes and other assets to healthier rival american 
airlines in a package worth 625 million 
at the same time icahn said he had written pan am chairman 
thomas g plaskett in a letter dated sunday in which he offered to 
buy pan ams 150 million outstanding shares for 150 a share in 
cash and 1 a share in either preferred stock or notes 
in these extremely complicated and troubled times for the 
airline industry a combination of twa and pan am might offer both 
of us the opportunity to compete with the three major us 
airlines icahn wrote saying the offer was good through friday 
some analysts had viewed a twapan am merger as a good move for 
each of the struggling airlines although others doubted it would 
ever come off 
pan am has the movie scenes inside the ornate 
courthouse in may he argued that the depiction of rioting black 
characters would undermine what little faith blacks have left in 
the justice system 
wilentz said in an affidavit that he is constitutionally 
permitted and even dutybound to consider whether the content of a 
movie scene is inappropriate for the judiciary to be associated 
with 
essex county executive nicholas amato sued wilentz in may 
claiming the chief judge trampled on the first amendment and 
deprived the county of a 250000 donation from warner bros 
politan ruled in the countys favor but did not grant the 
250000 monetary award the county sought 
by acting to further his concern for the welfare of the black 
community wilentz egregiously trammelled a fundamental bulwark 
against the spread of governmental despotism politan wrote 
wilentz had offered to let the company film if they would change 
a scene but producer fred caruso declined 
the film based on tom wolfes novel looks at new yorks legal 
system illuminating the citys racial and class divisions 
the film is not about nor is it designed to document rioting 
blacks any more so than it is designed to malign drunken english 
reporters or greedy philandering white men politan wrote

the federal reserve cut a key lending rate by 
onehalf percentage point on tuesday sending its strongest signal 
to date that it intends to battle the growing weakness in the 
american economy with easier credit 
the fed announced that it was lowering its discount rate the 
interest it charges to make loans to banks from 7 percent to 65 
percent 
it was the first reduction in this interest rate in more than 
four years analysts predicted the cut would prompt a reduction in 
a variety of business and consumer loan rates including banks 
benchmark prime lendingrate 
the announcement came hours after the release of two government 
reports showing that consumer prices rose a moderate 03 percent in 
november and that americas trade deficit soared in october to 
116 billion its highest level in 2 years 
analysts said the good news on inflation gave the fed room to 
lower interest rates while the trade report showed the urgent need 
to do so by raising the possibility that the new recession could be 
more severe than previously expected 
the fed took the unusual step of announcing its action 30 
minutes before new york financial markets closed the move prompted 
an immediate rally on wall street with the dow jones industrial 
average rising 3341 points to 262673 
many analysts interpreted the feds timing as an effort to 
impress upon investors how committed the central bank is to 
bolstering the economy 
this aggressive and decisive easing move by the federal 
reserve is an attempt to stop a runaway downturn and to set the 
stage for recovery said allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co an investment advisory firm the fact that the fed 
acted before the close of the markets was a clear signal that 
the fed is not going to stand by and let the economy dive into a 
severe downturn 
for the last two months the fed had been making more modest 
moves at easing credit conditions by engineering reductions in the 
federal funds rate the interest banks charge each other from 8 
percent to the current 725 percent 
a reduction in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the 
fed can send of its intention to fight economic weakness with lower 
interest rates 
the bush administration concerned by the signs of widespread 
economic weakness had been pushing for some time for a more 
assertive crediteasing campaign on the part of the fed 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
hailed the fed decision as welcome news 
it should be helpful in promoting growth in the economy in the 
months ahead fitzwater said this move appears justified by 
the budget agreement and the general slowdown 
until tuesday the fed had resisted administration entreaties for 
an aggressive easing out of fear that financial markets would be 
panicked into believing the central bank was abandoning its fight 
to restrain inflation at a time when the persian gulf crisis had 
sent energy prices soaring 
however economists said that the december report on consumer 
prices which showed them rising at a moderate annual rate of 37 
percent had given the central bank confidence that the initial oil 
shock following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait was beginning to 
abate 
in addition the steep widening of the trade deficit raised 
concerns that the already bleak prospects for the economy in the 
fourth quarter would be even worse by removing one of the few 
remaining sources of strength 
bruce steinberg an economist at merrill lynch said the fed was 
pursuing the right course 
it needs to be worrying about the economy going down more than 
it needs to be worrying about inflation he said 
the feds decision to lower the discount rate was the result of 
a 60 vote by the feds board of governors the vote came at the 
end of a closeddoor strategy session of the central banks top 
policymaking group the federal open market committee composed of 
members of the board and presidents of the feds 12 regional banks 
in advance of tuesdays meeting many analysts had predicted 
that the fed would ease rates further although few had been 
expecting a cut in the discount rate this soon 
many thought the central bank would wait until january to see 
whether a shooting war broke out in the middle east an event with 
the potential of greatly increasing inflationary pressures by 
pushing oil prices higher 
in a statement the central bank said it had taken the action 
against the background of weakness in the economy constraints on 
credit and slow growth of the nations money supply 
it was the first change in the discount rate since the central 
bank raised it from 65 percent on feb 24 1989 and the first 
reduction since august 1986 when thenfederal reserve chairman paul 
volcker was fighting widespread economic weakness with lower rates 
economists said they had no doubt that the fed policymakers are 
convinced the country has entered its first recession since the 
198182 downturn although federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
has stopped short of using that term instead calling the current 
weakness a meaningful downturn 
the discount rate cut comes after a string of economic 
indicators pointing to widespread weakness industrial output has 
fallen for three consecutive months while the nations unemployment 
rate has risen to 59 percent its highest level in three years 
adding to the gloom was tuesdays report on merchandise trade in 
october 
export growth and a narrowing trade deficit have been two of the 
few bright spots in an otherwise lackluster economy analysts said 
a rising trade deficit means even this source of strength will be 
removed in the final three months of the year the period most 
forecasters are pinpointing as the start of the recession 
this is a bad number david wyss an economist with 
drimcgraw hill said of the october trade deficit it suggests 
that we are not going to get as much help from net exports as we 
had hoped and it suggests there is more inventory out there than we 
had thought 
wyss said he had subtracted an additional onehalf percentage 
point from overall economic activity in the fourth quarter based on 
octobers trade number putting the decline in the gross national 
product according to his forecast at a sharp annual rate of 35 
percent 
much of the deterioration in the trade deficit came from a 17 
percent jump in americas october oil bill which climbed to 723 
billion the highest monthly total since april 1981 
the volume of imports was little changed at 803 million barrels 
daily but the average price per barrel shot up 473 to 2904 
for october imports rose 122 percent to an alltime high of 
4638 billion while exports also set a record rising 86 percent 
to 3477 billion 
the trade gap the difference between imports and exports was 
at its highest level since a 1256 billion deficit in february 
1988 
through the first 10 months of 1990 the trade deficit was 
running at an annual rate of 103 billion putting the country on 
track for its seventh consecutive year of deficits above 100 
billion

a dramatic restructuring by the nations largest 
bank and the federal reserves first discountrate cut in more than 
four years have underscored the deep troubles afflicting the 
banking industry 
but some analysts predicted tuesday that further action looms to 
nurse ailing banks and the economy as a whole back to health 
citicorp said it would lay off 8000 workers planned to slash 
its annual dividend 78 cents to 1 per share and set aside 350 
million to cover bad commercial loans the shakeup is estimated to 
provide citicorp 800 million in annual savings 
the layoffs are planned over the next three years citicorp 
said 
later in the day the federal reserve wielded its most powerful 
tool to stimulate economic growth by cutting the discount rate the 
interest it charges to make loans to banks by percent to 6 
percent 
stocks and bonds rallied on the fed announcement with the dow 
jones industrial average rising 3341 points to 262673 
citicorps stock rose 75 cents a share in heavy trading 
it was the discount rates first drop since august 1986 and 
appeared to be part of a larger plan by the fed to loosen credit to 
stimulate economic growth 
they are obviously separate reactions to a similar problem 
said jim chessen of the american bankers association in washington 
falling real estate values and a widening national recession 
have led to problems in the banking industry not seen since the 
great depression of the 1930s many banks have closed others are 
cutting operations and the federal insurance fund protecting 
depositor accounts is running out of money 
chessen the abas deputy director for policy development said 
the moves are a response to slackening demand for loans and 
problems with credit quality in parts of the country particularly 
recessionstruck new england and the southwest 
the economic downturn has been blamed on the failure of 734 
banks nationwide in the last 3 years which has drained the 
governments deposit insurance fund on monday federal deposit 
insurance corp chairman william seidman discussed proposals to 
revive the fund with 24 billion from a 1 percent assessment on all 
bank deposits 
wayne ayers chief economist for the bank of boston said 
cticorps restructuring is symptomatic of much of the problems 
affecting the banking industry 
citibank is not alone said chessen referring to the 
companys banking subsidiary 
the banking company said the layoffs would lead to a onetime 
cost of 300 million bringing a projected fourth quarter loss to 
300 million to 400 million it said it was making the 
announcement to keep stockholders appropriately informed 
the announcement on loan loss reserves followed an detailed 
examination of its loan portfolio by the us office of the 
comptroller of the currency a comptroller spokeswoman said banking 
audits are confidential and the results wont be released 
the company said it would discuss the developments in greater 
detail following release of its yearend results in midjanuary 
based in new york citicorp is the nations leading banking company 
with assets exceeding 2306 billion 
the feds cut in the discount rate generally precedes a 
reduction in a banks prime rate an important rate that is often a 
benchmark for a range of other consumer loan rates such as 
mortgages norwest bank of minneapolis minn cut its prime rate 
percent late tuesday to 975 percent 
norwest president james r campbell said the company is the 
first major us bank to lower their rate 
norwest bank is the largest banking affiliate of norwest 
corporation a financial services organization with 296 billion 
in assets three small banks cut their prime rates on dec 7 after 
the fed dropped to 7 percent the rate charges for federal funds 
the rate which banks charge each other for overnight loans 
how quickly other banks follow and cut their prime rates is open 
to speculation analysts said 
the abas chessen said banks will take slow measured steps in 
lowering their prime rate theres a lot of uncertainty in the 
market and they will react cautiously
