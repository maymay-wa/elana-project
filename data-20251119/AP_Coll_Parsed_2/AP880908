amnesty international said on thursday that it has 
appealed to the united nations security council to act 
immediately to stop the massacre of kurdish civilians by iraqi 
forces 
meanwhile the leader of the kurdish rebels said that iraqi 
government troops are still attacking guerrillas and civilians in 
northern iraq despite the governments amnesty offer 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights 
organization said in a statement that it made its first direct 
appeal on wednesday night to the 15member un body in new york 
because the systematic and deliberate killings call out for 
immediate action by the security council 
the statement charged iraq wants to punish the kurds for their 
political sympathies and in retaliation for opposition kurdish 
activities more than 100000 iraqi kurds fled across the border to 
turkey and many of them gave consistent accounts of the use of 
chemical weapons the statement said 
amnesty last week accused iraq of killing hundreds of kurdish 
villagers with chemical weapons in mountainous northern iraq and of 
employing helicopter gunships tanks and artillery in duhok mosul 
and arbil provinces 
iraqs ambassador to britain mohammed sadiq almashat denied 
chemical weapons were used he was summoned to the foreign office 
in london on tuesday and was told of british concern over the large 
numbers of kurdish refugees and the reports of chemical weapons use 
the latest amnesty statement gave a qualified welcome to the 
iraqi amnesty for kurds saying it received reports in the past of 
kurds being imprisoned and executed after responding to previous 
amnesties 
massoud barzani president of the kurdistan democratic party 
said in a telex sent to the associated press office in cyprus on 
wednesday that the kurds will not accept the general amnesty 
offered by iraq the day before 
the kurds have not struggled to be pardoned but to acheive 
their national and democratic rights within autonomy barzani 
said our struggle will continue until these goals are 
fulfilled 
iraq launched the offensive against the kurdish rebels after a 
ceasefire in its eightyear war with iran went into effect aug 
20 iraqs 35 million kurds have been struggling on and off for 50 
years for an autonomous homeland 
the kurdistan democratic party has said that nearly 2000 
civilians have been killed and another 5000 injured many by 
chemical weapons 
in his statement wednesday barzani said the amnesty offer was 
an attempt by iraq to deflect attention from its use of chemical 
weapons

republican george bush stunned an 
american legion convention wednesday by mistakenly saying sept 7 
marked the anniversary of the attack on pearl harbor that led 
america into world war ii 
the gaffe which he corrected after prompting from the audience 
overshadowed a campaign day in which the vice president also 
stumped for jewish votes at a bnai brith convention in baltimore 
md 
bush said he opposes creation of an independent palestinian 
state in the middle east but also cautioned israel against 
annexation of the occupied territories or exercising permanent 
control by military occupation 
in another matter signaling a departure from the reagan 
administration bush told knightridder newspapers wednesday he 
will soon outline a proposal calling for some adjustment in the 
minimum wage 
the administration opposes raising the minimum wage which is 
now 335 an hour but campaign sources told knightridder that 
bush was expected to link a raise in the minimum wage to a 
subminimum wage training differential for teenagers and other 
new hires congress has opposed such a differential in the past 
we ought to maintain a minimum wage differential for training 
people bush said bush has been criticized by his opponents as 
insensitive to the needs of working people 
the vice president received encouraging news from the latest abc 
newswashington post poll which found bush leading dukakis by an 
eightpoint margin 
the survey of 1104 likely voters found that 51 percent favored 
bush while 43 percent prefer dukakis the poll conducted aug 31 
to sept 6 had a margin of error of 35 percent 
on the question of a palestinian state bush sharply criticized 
democratic rival michael dukakis although he didnt mention him by 
name anyone who has trouble making up his mind on this issue or 
who proposes to leave it open just doesnt understand the dangers 
to israel and to the united states just doesnt understand the 
very real threats that continue to exist bush said 
bush opened the day in louisville with a speech before about 
6000 veterans at their 70th annual meeting 
departing from his prepared remarks bush said i wonder how 
many americans remember today is pearl harbor day fortyseven 
years ago to this very day we were hit and hit hard at pearl harbor 
and we were not ready 
in a bush administration that lesson would not be forgotten 
said bush who was a navy flyer decorated for combat missions 
during the war it would guide my defense and foreign policy 
the words were barely out of his mouth before the crowd turned 
uneasy a buzz of mumurs rose among the audience as legionnaires 
began whispering about it i thought nobody would forget that 
date one veteran commented to another 
a minute after his mistake bush stopped dead in his speech 
alerted by the stir in the audience and people waving at him over 
his error 
did i say sept 7th sorry about that bush said adding 
quickly that the correct date of the attack was dec 7 1941 the 
audience applauded his correction and generally gave him a warm 
polite reception 
bush told reporters later i just got messed up i wanted to 
work pearl harbor in and just got carried away 
it was the second rocky day in a row for bushs campaign 
following a booing jeering reception from shipyard workers in 
portland ore on tuesday 
sheila tate bushs press secretary said the vice president had 
ad libbed his pearl harbor remark perhaps because it was 44 years 
ago this week that bush a decorated navy flyer in the war was 
shot down on over the pacific 
the gaffe marred bushs attempt to highlight differences with 
dukakis 
he accused dukakis of trying to cancel and delay our strategic 
modernization with what amounts to an undeclared unilateral 
freeze 
bush noted that dukakis opposes the mx and midgetman missiles 
the strategic defense system and has called for cancellation of two 
aircraft carrier task forces 
bush said dukakis has opposed the stealth bomber in the past 
although this may be changing 
let me be clear bush said i do not question his 
patriotism but patriotism is not the issue the issue is how best 
to deter war to keep the peace to fulfill our countrys special 
responsibility as leader of the free world 
bush said i think america wants tough tested experienced 
leadership i am proud of having served my country in combat i 
believe i have the fiber and the experience to lead this country 
later in baltimore bush underscored the closeness of 
usisraeli relations 
no threat no stone thrown is strong enough to divide us no 
wedge will be driven between us bush pledged 
in warning against israeli annexation of the occupied 
territories bush said there has got to be another way and 
thats what the peace process is all about 
bush said he opposes creation of a palestinian state on grounds 
it would be a threat to israel as well as to jordan which he said 
is crucial to any lasting peace settlement 
moreover he said it would be contrary to american 
interests 
on the flight from louisville to baltimore bush said that 
antiabortion protestors who disrupted dukakis speech tuesday in a 
chicago suburb in my view went too far 
bush who opposes abortion in most instances said i would 
ask any supporter of mine to resist carrying their right to 
demonstrate to an extreme 
explaining his gaffe bush explained i just got messed up i 
wanted to work pearl harbor in and just got carried away and then 
i looked up and saw incredulity on the face of one particular guy 
down to my left and i thought whoopsmy heavens ive done it 
so i was glad to correct it

tiny riverside fairy shrimps 
can keep splashing around in their swimming hole thanks to county 
supervisors who ordered developers to help save the recently 
discovered freshwater crustacean 
developers planned to bulldoze a lowlying pond and build more 
than 2500 homes unaware that the species whose ancestors date 
back millions of years occupied the seasonal pool 
riverside county supervisors on tuesday ordered the tolman co 
of irvine to preserve the threatened habitat after they were 
alerted by biologists who discovered the fairy shrimp species two 
years ago 
the 22legged fairy shrimp is about as wide as a pencil and 1 
inches long it has been described by biologists as the most 
primitive crustacean living in fresh water 
a group of biologists named the species the riverside fairy 
shrimp after finding them in 15acre skunk hollow pond and five 
smaller ponds in southern riverside county about 80 miles 
southeast of downtown los angeles 
the fairy shrimp population survives dry summer months by 
burying eggs in the clay soil of the seasonal pools the eggs of 
some desert species have been known to survive for as long as 25 
years between adequate rains 
the board of supervisors gave the developer and the biologists 
until sept 27 to come up with a proposal that would permit the 
survival of the fairy shrimp and tolmans proposed 2571unit 
housing project

robert wilke parlayed 500 and frugality into 
a quartermilliondollar estate but after eight decades of tending 
his finances growth his harvest is heartache at age 103 his 
yield is unhappiness 
a family feud has grown up over who should handle his money and 
how his estate should be divided as a result the courts have 
declared him incompetent and placed him and his personal wealth 
under guardianships 
advocates for the elderly say proposed reforms in pennsylvanias 
guardianship law might have spared him anguish and indignities in 
old age including three medical examinations and the loss of many 
of his rights 
on the one side are wilke and his two sons robert 60 and 
william 54 on the other side are his two daughters frances 
mcaleer 62 and sylvia eaborn 50 who successfully petitioned a 
judge to declare him incompetent and to appoint guardians to make 
his personal and financial decisions 
it was in the midst of the incompetency hearings in april that 
wilkes wife of 63 years amelia died at age 89 and his mourning 
for her mixes with bitterness toward his daughters with whom he no 
longer speaks 
both daughters wanted to take everything over that i worked 
all my life for wilke contends even though an audit found no 
impropriety when mrs mcaleer was handling his daytoday finances 
i cant even spend my money after saving it complains 
wilke who started work at age 15 for a dollarandahalf a week 
when you think you got money you aint got nothin 
he never earned more than 4200 a year in 57 years of work as a 
machinist and maintenance engineer he retired at age 72 
he started saving when he was 29 by putting 500 from his share 
of the family house sold upon his fathers death into five banks 
shopping for bargains and rarely traveling wilke saved and 
saved his will provided that each of his children would receive 
onefourth of the accumulated wealth 
after he and his wife entered a nursing home he asked his elder 
daughter in late 1986 to help with his billpaying and other 
accounts and gave her legal authority under a power of attorney 
still he continued to monitor his finances and at one point 
their figures conflicted father accused daughter of being unable 
to explain how 20000 was spent 
last october wilke transferred his power of attorney to his 
sons he also changed his will to make the sons executors instead 
of the daughters 
i cried the whole day mrs mcaleer testified my heart 
was broken that my father would do this to me without telling me 
mrs mcaleer and her sister filed the incompetency petition 2 
weeks later and an orphans court judge declared wilke incompetent 
on june 1 naming the pittsburgh national bank as his financial 
guardian and a lawyer as his personal guardian 
the incompetency petition upset wilke so much that he rewrote 
his will in march now the daughters are to receive 10 percent 
each the sons 40 percent each 
the daughters declined to be interviewed but their lawyer 
geoffrey p wozman said they apparently wanted protection 
after mrs mcaleer was accused 
i dont think they particularly thought the sons were going to 
take his money they didnt think the sons were the proper people 
to take care of it they didnt think they were either no matter 
who controls the money someone is going to complain theyre not 
doing something right wozman said 
explaining why the guardianship was sought the lawyer said the 
old man was not rational in terms of financial affairs 
a psychiatrist testifying for the daughters said wilke was 
incompetent due to the infirmities of old age another 
psychiatrist testified for the sons that while wilke needed help 
managing his finances he found no evidence of incompetency a 
third psychiatrist appointed by the court examined wilke seven 
weeks after he was declared incompetent and concluded that he is 
suffering from some mild cognitive impairment 
when the guardianship was declared wilke lost the right to 
vote to make decisions about his own health care and to travel 
without approval from his guardian 
against his wishes he was initially ordered back into a nursing 
home later the judge allowed him to continue to live with son 
william in suburban green tree where he had moved after his wifes 
death the elder wilke is permitted to keep his monthly 537 social 
security check and his 210 pension check for expenses and for 
spending money 
i think the wilke case provides an example of flaws in our 
current state law said dr linda m rhodes secretary of the 
pennsylvania department of aging 
among proposed legal changes now before the legislature is a 
provision to authorize limited guardianships for people who are 
only partially incapacitated as two doctors found wilke to be 
a number of states already allow such guardianships which 
tailor assistance to specific areas such as managing a persons 
income and assets while leaving most rights intact 
current pennsylvania law does not recognize partial incompetence 
and allows only for a blanket guardianship under which virtually 
all decisionmaking is turned over to someone else 
heres an individual who could use some assistance in 
financial planning but certainly he can make choices we all make 
every day mrs rhodes said of wilke 
at a department of aging hearing last month wilke himself 
testified in favor of the reform bill which would also eliminate 
infirmities of old age as a reason for a finding of 
incompetency an individuals faculties not birth date should be 
the deciding factor department officials have argued 
meanwhile wilke is challenging the incompetency finding a 
hearing is set before an orphans court panel sept 12 
as he sits in a rocking chair watching the news or the pirates 
ballgames the whitehaired man ponders what hell do if hes 
declared competent and gets control of his money again 
hell pay off some bills he says and visit his son robert who 
lives in tallahassee fla william says his father also feels he 
should pay him and his wife margaret for his care and shelter no 
more than 1000 
but reconciliation with his daughters is not in the cards 
theyre looking out for themselves not me he said it 
hurt me a lot i just cant forget

garankuwa south africa ap a creation of apartheid 
politics south africas black medical school is producing 70 badly 
needed doctors a year and even those who oppose it concede it is 
advancing black medicine in the country 
south africa has 26 million blacks but only about 800 black 
doctors as opposed to more than 21000 white doctors among its 5 
million whites 
when the medical university of southern africa was established 
11 years ago in the homeland of bophuthatswana however many 
activists rejected the school as an inferior institution built to 
keep medical training segregated 
however modern facilities and a qualified staff have helped the 
university graduate 273 doctors who work in some of the countrys 
best hospitals as well as remote rural areas where health workers 
are in severely short supply 
the students reject the idea of segregated education but we 
accept that we are getting good training said a 26yearold 
student asking to be identified only as gwen 
the schools new buildings and landscaped grounds sit behind a 
barbedwire fence 20 miles outside pretoria the capital the 
pristine campus appears out of place in dusty rundown garankuwa 
a sprawling collection of dirt roads and squatter shacks 
many of the prospective doctors come from similarly impoverished 
communities some students arriving for the sixyear program live 
with electricity for the first time and most have little or no 
experience in laboratories 
when students come here they face tremendous adjustments 
said the vice principal len karlsson who is white as are all the 
top administrators the pace and the intensity of the program is 
unlike anything theyve experienced previously 
he said black public high schools do not adequately prepare 
students for the rigors of medical school and therefore the 
university often selects older students with some practical medical 
experience 
about half the students are at least 25 years old and most have 
worked in the health care field before enrolling said karlsson 
the university offers remedial courses in most basic subjects 
but the failure rate remains high about 40 percent of the 120 
firstyear students fail although they are given the chance to 
repeat 
the university is expanding its entering class annually and is 
one of the largest medical schools in africa with about 1500 
students including its denistry veterinary nursing and 
postgraduate programs 
the school referred to by the acronym medunsa produces half of 
south africas 140 new black physicians each year the rest come 
from schools that are predominantly white such as the university 
of the witwatersrand in johannesburg 
medunsa is producing some outstanding doctors said dr 
nthato motlana a prominent antiapartheid activist who runs a 
clinic in soweto the black township outside johannesburg 
motlana and other activists initially opposed medunsa calling 
it a racist plan to build black medical school out in the bush 
motlana still opposes segregated schools but says medunsa has 
served to increase the meager supply of black doctors 
health services remain segregated and the shortage of doctors 
and facilities is acute in most black areas 
johannesburgs main white hospitals are about 50 percent empty 
while an average of more than 200 patients sleep on the floor each 
night at sowetos 2700bed baragwanath hospital the only 
fullservice health facility for the townships 25 million 
residents 
despite the overcrowding at black hospitals in urban areas the 
quality of care is much higher than in rural areas where the 
doctors are far too few and the facilities often inadequate or 
nonexistent motlana said 
medunsa encourages graduates who want to work in rural areas 
but most students are from the cities and see no incentive to 
relocate school officials and students said 
to combat the dearth of rural doctors black homeland 
governments provide scholarships for medunsa students who then are 
required to return to work in the territories for several years 
after graduation 
until its becomes attrative for doctors to practice in rural 
areas most blacks will have trouble getting adequate health care 
said motlana medunsa has helped the situation but it is not 
enough by itself 
the university is financially supported by the south african 
government but students are required to pay a tuition the 
equivalent of about 2500 a year 
virturally every student receives some form of financial aid 
however 
school officials say us companies were generous with 
scholarship money but many of them have pulled out of south africa 
because of its apartheid policies and no longer donate funds 
school officials didnt have exact figures on the reduction in 
american assistance but said its amounts to thousands of dollars 
annually some usbased firms still operating in south africa 
including 3m colgate and johnson and johnson continue to provide 
scholarship money

buddhists in burma kill each other 
while saffronrobed monks shake fists against the government 
violating a 2500yearold rule against taking life and a tradition 
of buddhist clergy shunning politics 
buddhist societies from sri lanka to south korea burma to tibet 
have proved as prone to violence as others in recent times despite 
the precepts of lord buddha the great religious teacher of the 5th 
century bc 
cambodia once a land of 90000 monks in scores of quiet 
temples was turned into a killing field by the savage khmer rouge 
the current government says 3 million died in the 197578 reign of 
terror 
in wartime south vietnam protesting monks set themselves afire 
more recently conflict between the majority sinhalese buddhists 
and hindu tamils have left more than 8000 dead in sri lanka 
a monk in burma told an american visitor if the government 
doesnt change the only way to prevent shedding the peoples blood 
is to fight them to the death 
the image of buddhist gentleness persists however proponents 
like to say buddhists have not waged crusades or burned heretics at 
the stake as christians did or established anything akin to 
todays strident islamic states 
southeast asias theravada buddhism one of the religions two 
major branches places special emphasis on tolerance equanimity 
and nonconfrontation 
william klausner an american expert on thai culture says 
buddhists try to avoid the confrontational behavior a sharp word 
a push a slap others might employ in a situation of conflict 
violence is the last resort he said but when the 
eruption comes its going to be more dramatic the thais say there 
is little maneuvering room between the smile and the knife 
chatsumarn kabilsingh a religion professor at bangkoks 
thammasat university believes buddhism to a large extent explains 
why the burmese put up with 26 years of authoritarian misrule 
before rising up last month 
demonstrating along with students and workers were monks who at 
least in theravada tradition are enjoined to restrict their 
activities to the sprititual 
but monks marched gave fiery speeches and were said to have 
largely replaced the government in mandalay burmas secondlargest 
city and a great religious cener 
klausner said in an interview that monks in sri lanka burma and 
to some degree vietnam had legitimized a politial role for 
themselves 
when britain was the colonial power in burma it reduced the 
power of the monkhood or sangha and the buddhist clergy 
assumed a political role helping expel the alien christian 
conquerors burma became independent in 1948 
some analysts say many monks similarly regarded the socialism of 
military strongman ne win as an alien ideology and resented his 
efforts to coopt and control clergy after he seized power in 1962 
a strain of aggressiveness is a longstanding characteristic of 
mahayana buddhism practiced in japan korea china and tibet 
buddhistbacked groups in 16th century japan would band together 
to overthrow feudal lords and the monks of the shaolin temple in 
china were noted for truculence and their skill as warriors the 
shaolin temple remains a center for the study of martial arts 
about 70 people have been injured in recent fueding between the 
main chokey sect in south korea and its rivals the antagonists 
including monks have attacked one another with clubs iron pipes 
and knives 
although tibets exiled religious leader the dalai lama urges 
nonviolent resistance to chinese rule young buddhist monks led 
riots last year and in march they were involved in throwing rocks 
burning vehicles and the death of a policeman who was beaten and 
flung from a monastery window 
in a littlepublicized conflict buddhist rebels called chakmas 
raid villages and battle authorities in eastern bangladesh to halt 
government efforts to settle moslems on land traditionally held by 
buddhists at least 4000 people have been killed by official 
count 
thailand which calls itself the land of smiles has one of 
asias highest homicide rates periodic outbursts of brutality 
faced with mounting evidence in the early 1980s that thai 
pirates were killing and raping vietnamese boat people several 
officials said the equivalent of they cant be thais thais are 
buddhists and buddhists wouldnt act like that 
buddhist scholars say much of this violence and political 
activism by the clergy results from rapid modernization economic 
inequalities and political repression 
chatsumarn the bangkok professor said in an interview 
buddhism molds the mentality to be tolerant to bear all but 
even good buddhists cant live solely on religion basic needs must 
be met and stomachs filled

the elderly manager of a 
hardware store in this farming village remembered brian mullin as 
a friendly lad a bricklayer who often dropped by for supplies 
he just got caught up in the troubles because he knew nothing 
else the manager said hes only one of hundreds of young men 
in the area who have been harassed every day by the security 
forces 
mullin 25 and two other local irish republican army men died 
in a british army ambush aug 30 as they drove along a country road 
near drumnakilly 5 miles north of here 
their funerals over the weekend drew mourners from all around 
the area and hundreds of riot police the mourners mostly 
catholic and the police mostly protestant faced each other in 
stony silence physically they were inches apart mentally a gulf 
separated them 
police said the three dead men were armed and dressed in ski 
masks when they died the london newspapers called them terrorists 
murderers and ira rats 
but in the countryside of county tyrone many residents knew 
these parttime guerrillas or their families and spoke of them in 
sympathetic terms 
their deaths helped exacerbate the divisions between local 
catholics and the iras most frequent targets in rural districts 
the police and the ulster defense regiment 
theres a majority of protestants with nothing wrong with 
them said a 28yearold decorator sitting on a grassy bank 
outside dunmoyle catholic church on saturday waiting for mullins 
hearse to pass 
its those that join the security forces we cant live with 
he said glancing at policemen searching mourners at a crossroads 
at the start of a twomile trek to mullins family farm outside 
sixmilecross 
like the store manager he spoke on condition of anonymity 
fearing retaliation for criticizing the police 
if you come up this road at 2 or 3 in the morning and youre 
stopped by them youre sure to get a kicking because of who you 
are he said the police force would be welcome surely if 
they were 5050 catholicprotestant and they were fair 
the police and army say they cant get catholic recruits because 
the ira would kill them as collaborators 
william gallagher 53 of strabane in neighboring county 
fermanagh said he was a political activist with two sons 
serving lengthy prison sentences for ira bombings 
the british never listen to anything except a gun he said 
you couldnt name three countries the british have not been at 
war with 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
predominantly protestant northern ireland and unite it with the 95 
percent catholic irish republic 
like many ira recruits in rural districts alongside the irish 
republics border the slain men led double lives their ira 
activities camouflaged by ordinary civilian pursuits 
brothers gerard and martin harte who were buried friday in 
their nearby home village of loughmacrory were leading players in 
the local gaelic football team 
gerard harte a 29yearold architect designed his own 
grandiose house overlooking the village his 21yearold brother 
was a carpenter both were married martin harte to mullins 
sister and each had an infant son 
police said gerard harte was the commander of the iras 
midtyrone unit and that his brother was responsible for selecting 
ira targets from police and ulster defense regiment ranks 
mullin whose elder brother patrick is serving a life sentence 
for the 1977 ira murder of a bus driver was questioned after a 
bomb killed eight british soldiers aug 20 in a bus in nearby 
ballygawley he was released without charge after five days 
news reports said the trio were on their way to kill an offduty 
member of the ulster defense regiment when soldiers ambushed their 
stolen car the government says the ira men fired first 
at mullins funeral riot squads massed to block any repetition 
of the ira gun salutes that have sparked clashes with police at 
previous burials 
the 2000 mourners inched along narrow country lanes flanked by 
long lines of police in helmets guns and riot shields they 
trudged through rainsodden fields climbing over ditches and 
hedges and scattering cows and sheep 
when one policeman fell over a barbedwire fence the crowd 
roared approval 
police ringed the church walls during the mass sometimes 
banging batons against shields in what sounded like a tribal beat 
three officers videotaped the crowd and a helicopter clattered 
overhead almost drowning out the graveside prayers 
when the service ended the crowd quickly dispersed the weather 
switched from driving rain to warm sunshine and the tensions from 
the 3hour service lifted

four decades after its founding north korea 
remains an isolated secretive state with an enigmatic leader who 
shows no signs of handing over power to his designated heir his 
son 
the democratic peoples republic of korea celebrates its 40th 
anniversary friday with praise for president kim il sung 76 the 
communist strongman 
the country plans a huge celebration with senior foreign 
emissaries including president yang shangkun of china and soviet 
kgb chief viktor chebrikov representing north koreas two major 
allies 
no political figures or journalists from the west have been 
invited and requests from western news agencies to cover the 
anniversary have gone unanswered north korea rarely allows western 
journalists into the country 
the ceremonies friday will include a mass rally a sports 
competition and cultural performances in praise of kim 
koreans respect kim il sung as a prominent leader in 
antijapanese warfare and hero of the korean revolution said 
choe kwan ick an official of the pronorth korean general 
association of korean residents of japan chongryon he goes to 
every corner of the country among farmers and workers to solve 
problems they face the people respect this and that is why he has 
remained in power so long 
a 1986 us state department report called kim the object of 
an intensive and farreaching personality cult probably unequalled 
in the rest of todays world 
huge statues of the great leader as kim is known stand 
throughout the country and almost all north koreans wear badges 
with his picture 
similar public loyalty to kims son kim jong il 46 is 
encouraged the elder kim plans to hand power over to his son in 
what may be the worlds first communist dynasty 
it has been a troubling year for north korea world attention 
has focused on rival south korea and on the upcoming olympic games 
which begin in seoul sept 17 south korea has stressed security 
preparations against a possible terrorist attack from the north 
north korea finally stated this week that it would not use 
military or other means to interrupt the olympics 
as for terrorism it is utterly alien to us and the united 
states itself is the chieftain of state terrorism as already 
exposed to the world the north korean foreign ministry said 
tension remains high along the demilitarized zone with north 
koreas deployment of sovietmade missiles and jet fighters 
including mig23s and mig29s the north has an estimated 850000 
troops the worlds fifth largest army against 650000 south 
korean and 42000 american soldiers 
north korea failed in its attempt to share in the glory of the 
olympics and is now watching allies china yugoslavia hungary and 
probably poland establish trade relations with seoul 
eclipsed by south korea in industry and foreign trade the 
country faces two formidable tasks ensuring a smooth transfer of 
power and modernizing its economy 
the country has a foreign debt of about 42 billion against 
foreign trade of only 35 billion annually according to western 
estimates last yearnorth korea was declared in default on its 
foreign loans 
trade is modest amounting to only 17 billion annually with 
the soviet union north koreas largest trading partner and main 
economic benefactor 
they north korea import machinery and vehicles but lack 
parts and skill and cant get them repaired a japanese 
intelligence official said 
to earn badly needed foreign currency north korea is on a 
building spree of luxury hotels and sports and cultural facilities 
but theyre building everything literally by hand with shovels 
and wheelbarrows the official said 
it reminds me of japan in the 1950s said masaru nishida a 
literature professor at tokyos hosei university who has visited 
the country three times 
strapped for cash north korea has been shifting some of the 20 
percent of its gnp currently spent on the military to joint 
ventures with the soviet union according to the japanese official 
the products include household goods clothing shoes and are sold 
in siberia 
north korea wants to cut down military expenditures because 
theyre a waste of money said choe authorities have demobilized 
200000 soldiers in the last two years and shifted them to economic 
reconstruction he said 
how to solidify the political position of kims son is a more 
delicate issue little is known about kim jong il but he clearly 
lacks the charisma of his father the japanese official said 
kim pyong il 34 kim jong ils halfbrother has been posted as 
ambassador to hungary in an apparent move to avoid a challenge to 
kim jong il the official said 
a major question is when kim il sung will abdicate in favor of 
his son or be forced to for health reasons during a visit to 
mongolia in july he had difficulty climbing slopes and once 
abandoned an attempt to enter a pavillion because he could not 
negotiate the stairs the japanese official said 
kim il sung wants quickly to give reins to his son the 
official said but the domestic situation doesnt allow that 
right now he said moscow and beijing had been pressuring kim not 
to put his son in power yet because they do not have complete 
confidence in him

dont try to tell joe camerada about madonna 
tom selleck or elvis hes got his own idol barnaby jones 
i just like his easygoing style camerada says 
camerada is not alone he is one of more than 800 members of the 
barnaby jones fan club dedicated to the memory of the venerable 
detective who ambled across the nations television screens from 
1973 to 1980 and in countless reruns 
unlike most fan clubs the members of this one actually get to 
meet their idol regularly buddy ebsen who played jones is a 
frequent guest at the clubs weekly meetings at a restaurant off 
times square 
its a cult now says ebsen 80 i love them theyre 
great guys 
the great guys are mostly retired executives men of ebsens own 
generation they include former president richard m nixon a fan 
of the show who joined the club at ebsens suggestion 
this fan club collects no dues sells nothing follows no rules 
and only loosely organizes an occasional golf outing it is 
instantaneous you walk in and youre a member said member joe 
desimone 57 
it really was a sincere grassroots germination ebsen said 
president alfred lamberti said the club started some years ago 
when a retired army colonel was hospitalized for an operation each 
day the patient watched barnaby jones reruns and soon he and his 
visitors were hooked 
thereafter they met for lunch or drinks each week they would 
send ebsen birthday cards each year his curiosity was piqued and 
one day he dropped in to la vertgalant official meeting place of 
the bjfc 
now whenever hes in town ebsen is a regular and when he 
shows up the bartender whips up an alcoholic drink that looks like 
the favored drink of the clubs favorite detective a glass of 
milk 
the meetings are not like trekkie conventions there are no 
trivia contests with questions of what color tie barnaby wore in 
episode 33 there is no swap meet of barnaby memorabilia 
mostly the guys talk about sex fights baseball and dirty 
jokes 
its like a family said gordon mckay 60 
the club has attracted ebsen lookalikes and a scottish man who 
like jones drank only milk there are members in ireland 
california and florida 
then there was the visit from nixon ebsen who is on the board 
of directors of nixons library said he recruited nixon into the 
club when nixon asked him why the barnaby jones private detective 
show was taken off the air in new york and how he could help get it 
back on 
now said ebsen hes a cardcarrying member 
when nixon stopped by more than 40 members gathered at the 
restaurant and listened to plenty of behindthescenes stuff as 
lamberti recalls 
he was going to stay a half hour but he stayed two hours he 
said he told us things about washington that i cant tell you 
he said of all the clubs he ever went to this was the greatest 
because there was no ulterior motive 
nixon also figured in another big moment in club history the 
time members rented a yacht and followed ebsen in a race around 
staten island 
i had a richard nixon mask on lamberti said with a chuckle 
ebsen said he recalls racing in the liberty regatta there 
tagging along behind him was a yacht bearing a large banner 
go barnaby the sign said

a visitingcard case made from the skin 
of executed 19th century mass murderer william burke was bought at 
auction for 1785 by a man whose business takes tourists to the 
scenes of notorious crimes 
the price was much more than burke and william hare his 
accomplice received for all the bodies of their victims which 
they sold to anatomists said robin mitchell who bought the 
relic in a sale at knowle in central england 
burke and hare who began as graverobbers went on to murder at 
least 15 people in edinburgh in 1827 and 1828 a time when medical 
professors could not get enough bodies for demonstrations to their 
students 
burke was hanged in 1829 on the evidence of hare who fled the 
city and disappeared 
burkes body was flayed after dissection by edinburghs medical 
authorities and part of his skin was used by one of those surgeons 
to make the ornate case with gold tooling which passed to his 
descendant who sold it wednesday 
a notebook covered in burkes skin is still in the possession of 
edinburghs royal college of surgeons 
mitchell is a partner in an edinburgh guide business which 
takes tourists to the scenes of notorious crimes 
we will be showing the case to our clients on the tours he

quiba jamal zubag kubla khan and six 
pals give new meaning to the expression dogs life 
every canine should be as lucky as the 10 silky salukis who 
share a posh marin county doghouse with color television art 
gallery and raised beds with white fur blankets 
i just thoroughly love them sandra wornum said wednesday of 
her pampered purebreds 
wornum built the 15000 enclosed kennels partly to appease 
neighbors who complain about noise and worry about property 
values but also out of devotion to her thin elegant hounds 
believed to be the worlds oldest breed 
the carpeted dog home designed by wornums architect husband 
michael also features four redwoodandglass bedrooms and a 
bathroom with a moroccan tile shower and clawfooted bathtub 
salukis which resemble greyhounds were developed in the middle 
east as early as 4000 bc for hunting gazelles wornum like other 
lovers of the breed say their animals are delightfully different 
from other dogs 
their demeanor is much more like a cat she said they are 
reserved quiet intense they like to sit up high and observe 
they are not ground sleepers

a baggage handler may keep the 10000 he 
found at greater pittsburgh international airport authorities say 
but his wife says she still feels bad for whoever lost the cash 
we had kind of hoped the guy who lost it would have gotten 
it said gloria shergi 
allegheny county deputy solicitor ira weiss said wednesday that 
patrick shergi may keep the cash because the owner hasnt turned up 
to date no one has satisfactorily established that he or she 
is the owner of the property weiss wrote 
the law states that reasonable time must elapse before a 
finder may claim the goods weiss said a month is sufficient 
shergi found the hundred 100 bills aug 3 in a bag beside a curb 
publicity about the discovery brought claims of ownership from 
more than a dozen people who telephoned police but none was able 
to provide convincing evidence 
mrs shergi said her husband never thought twice about turning 
the money over to authorities 
he is probably one of the most honest people ive ever met 
she said he never would have been able to sleep worrying about 
whether someone had lost the money and really needed it

oliver kingsley jr a retired navy 
man with more than 20 years experience in nuclear energy was hired 
wednesday to succeed steven a white as head of the tennessee 
valley authoritys nuclear program 
white 59 has run tvas nuclear program since january 1986 
five months after the federal utility shut down its fivereactor 
system because of safety and management concerns 
since then unit 2 at sequoyah nuclear plant outside chattanooga 
has returned to operation and unit 1 is scheduled for restart later 
this month browns ferry unit 2 is expected to be back on line by 
next spring 
kingsley vice president of nuclear operations for systems 
energy resources inc in jackson miss will join tva on oct 1 
and assume command of the nuclear program a month later 
tva chairman marvin runyon revealed kingsleys appointment and 
whites resignation during a tva board meeting in tupelo miss 
steve white has done an excellent job of starting the tva 
nuclear program on its way to complete recovery runyon said in a 
statement released in chattanooga 
his assignment is essentially complete and he has stated 
several times that he wants to return home to his farm in virginia 
tva appreciates the work he has done in making our nuclear program 
safer runyon said 
white indicated in recent weeks that he would probably leave the 
355200ayear job in january 1989 when his contract expires to be 
with his family in charlottsville va 
the retired admiral who once headed the navys nuclear submarine 
program has also been under fire from congressional staffers 
critical of tvas nuclear program 
the us department of justice is still investigating claims by 
the nuclear regulatory commission that white lied in march 1986 
when he told the nrc that tvas unlicensed watts bar nuclear plant 
near spring city tenn met certain safety standards 
white has denied the charges and gerald charnoff an attorney 
for tva said he expects the investigation to be dismissed soon 
like white kingsley is an exnavy officer retiring in 1971 to 
join alabama power co as senior engineer in nuclear production 
unlike him he will be paid as a tva employee not a contractor 
and his 77200 salary will be governed by a federal pay cap he 
also will receive a 100000 cash relocation incentive and 40000 
in retirement benefits

the air force officer who heads the nations 
antimissile program says tens of billions of dollars could be cut 
from the program to develop a star wars system 
lt gen james a abrahamson says in an interview in todays new 
york times that the design of the weapons to be used in the system 
can be simplified and that the reagan administrations deployment 
date of the late 1990s still could be met 
he said the savings can be made by changing the design of a few 
major components including the spacebased antimissile rockets 
that would be the most expensive element of the program 
were not trying to restructure the program abrahamson 
stressed 
he said his proposal was developed over the last several months 
at the request of defense secretary frank c carlucci and will be 
presented to top pentagon officials in about two weeks 
the pentagon told congress last year that development of the 
first phase of the strategic defense initiative would cost between 
75 billion and 150 billion 
estimates of the longterm cost of the program have ranged as 
high as 1 trillion

windblown embers from a 
165000acre forest fire ignited rooftops wednesday inside the old 
faithful geyser complex of yellowstone national park after 
hundreds of tourists evacuated the area 
at least 17 buildings were destroyed as the big north fork fire 
moved into the outskirts of the complex wednesday afternoon when 
40mph winds shifted creating a wall of flame that forced 40 
firefighters to retreat from the lines 
when that firestorm went through there we had to move our 
people out of there said denny bungarz fire incident commander 
when you can feel the heat inside your car its time to move 
embers rained down on firefighters who wetted roofs inside the 
complex and activated a sprinkler atop the historic old faithful 
inn to protect the 84yearold log building a national historic 
landmark since 1987 
two cabins in the employee housing area were destroyed by the 
wall of flame and winds gusting to 50 mph showered sparks into the 
complex igniting the roofs of 14 other guest cabins and a utility 
shed bungarz said 
as winds died down late wednesday night authorities began to 
hope that the fire threat near the parks most popular attraction 
again was over i would consider it over bungarz said the 
main fire front passed through here it really fireproofed this 
area 
wednesdays evacuation of the geyser complex was the first in 
the 116year history of the oldest us national park ordered as 
the fire burned to within a halfmile of the parks most popular 
attraction 
about 800 visitors calmly left the 320room inn which park 
officials decided to close for the season more than a month early 
later however park officials decided to allow day visitors in the 
area 
inside the complex firefighters hosed down buildings to protect 
them from flames as a handful of tourists sightseeing when the 
flames erupted were held in the area until fire activity slowed 
its the safest place to be in spite of what it feels like 
bungarz said 
ive been coming up here a long time said ken miller a 
visitor from denver thank god ive got a lot of pictures of the 
way the park was because ill never see it like that again 
bungarz said he expected winds to subside by midnight and 
weather to remain calm thursday and friday but he added forecasts 
called for a return of high winds by the weekend 
the national weather service said a storm front could bring 
significant precipitation to yellowstone by sunday or monday 
forecaster mike oard in great falls mont said the storm was 
looking more likely all the time 
in washington wyomings us sens malcolm wallop and alan 
simpson asked interior secretary don hodel to declare their state a 
disaster area eligible for relief because of the forest blazes in 
and around yellowstone 
the two republicans also called for the resignation of national 
park service director william penn mott for his services policy of 
letting naturallysparked fires burn unless they threaten manmade 
structures or people 
however in the last month yellowstone officials have tried to 
suppress all new fires whether caused by man or nature but 
unusually dry conditions and gusting winds thwarted efforts by 
thousands of firefighters 
fires in the greater yellowstone area which includes nearby 
national parks in montana have charred close to 1 million acres 
park spokeswoman marsha karle said 
on yellowstones northern border a river of fire flowed within 
feet of two small tourist towns and firefighters hoped winds would 
continue to shepherd the storm creek fire past cooke city and 
silver gate mont 
nearly 550 firefighters and a fleet of bulldozers were moved to 
the island park area across the state line in idaho to keep the 
north fork fire from spreading there 
forest fires also burned in california washington idaho and 
utah 
officials expected winds of 30 to 40 mph from midday to 
midnight he said 
bungarz said the 13 fires in the greater yellowstone area had 
advanced a total of about 80000 acres on tuesday 
the fires burning in the park which has a total of 22 million 
acres are the worst by far in the parks history in no year has 
the acreage consumed by fire exceeded 30000 acres park 
naturalists say 
elsewhere in the greater yellowstone complex 
the 260000acre clover mist fire made a 10mile run toward 
the east entrance of yellowstone fire information officer dave 
damron said the fire grew 20000 acres tuesday night and endangered 
the pahashka tepee which was buffalo bill codys original hunting 
lodge 
the east and northeast gates to the park were both closed 
wednesday two fires in montana have cut off access to the roads 
leading to the northeast entrance 
the 224600 mink fire 15 miles northeast of moran junction in 
the teton wilderness continued to burn to the northeast near the 
boundary of the bridgerteton and shoshone national forests 
the 53275acre huck fire spread to the southeast into the 
teton wilderness in the bridgerteton 
the 22195acre fayette fire five miles east of pinedale 
wyo continued to burn 
in southern california firefighters extinguished the last in a 
series of wildfires that blackened more than 25000 acres 
a shift in winds and weather and the use of irrigation systems 
spared central washingtons orchard belt from a 30000acre fire 
the fire 50 percent contained on wednesday was not expected to be 
completely contained before friday officials said 
in utah residents of more than 60 canyon homes were allowed to 
return home as firefighters neared containment of a 5600acre fire 
east of salt lake city officials said fire bosses hoped to 
contain the fire by late thursday 
a fire in idahos nez perce national forest in idaho spread from 
25900 acres monday to 36780 by tuesday night 
the boise interagency fire center the coordinating office for 
firefighting in the west said fires this year have charred 365 
million acres an area larger than connecticut slightly more than 
2 million of the acres are in alaska during the last big fire

an expected 11 percent drop in wheat exports 
in 198889 will cut into the us share of the world wheat trade 
according to agriculture department analysts 
world market share may fall from 43 percent in 198788 to 
about 40 percent says the departments economic research 
service reduced sales to the soviet union are expected to 
account for most of the decline in volume 
the droughtbattered northern plains which produces most of the 
springplanted durum wheat used in spaghetti and other pasta 
products suffered low yields this year the report said tighter 
us durum supplies may result in some market loss in north africa 
some renewed activity in wheat sales resulted from the 
departments export enhancement program or eep which provides 
subsidized sales to selected foreign countries the report said 
new offerings were made this summer to india china and algeria 
a rise in world grain prices has resulted in a reduction in eep 
subsidies the report said the subsidies or bonuses are paid to 
exporters in the form of governmentowned surplus commodities so 
the companies can sell wheat at reduced prices to meet foreign 
competition 
bonus levels have declined averaging 1780 per metric ton of 
wheat between aug 1 and aug 22 only about half that of a year 
earlier 
the rising export price for wheat and the smaller eep bonuses 
imply that eep importers are picking up a greater share of the 
total cost the report said 
the european economic community which is expected to produce a 
bumper wheat crop this year is expected to be the major us 
competitor in many export markets however the eec was said to 
have limited exports through this month due to budget constraints 
and relatively tight wheat supplies 
other major competitors will not have the supplies to compete 
effectively with the united states in many markets the report 
said canadas carrying beginning inventory stocks are low and 
the drought is expected to leave canada with only 16 million tons 
of exportable supplies canadas exports at this level would be 32 
percent below the 198788 record and the lowest since 197980 
australia and argentina were also said to have reduced or 
belowaverage wheat availability for export in the coming year 
but higher wheat prices are expected to encourage minor 
exporters such as eastern european countries and turkey 
particularly for durum wheat the report said primary markets for 
these exporters will be north africa the middle east and the 
soviet union

the environmental protection agency says the 
two sellers of chlordimeform a pesticide used on an eighth of the 
nations cotton crop which causes cancer in lab animals are giving 
up their federal licenses for the product and will recall leftovers 
from farmers 
the agency said wednesday it would make the distribution or use 
of the chemical used to destroy the eggs and larvae of the tobacco 
budworm and the cotton bollworm illegal after feb 19 
pesticide recalls are rare and a spokesman for one of the 
companies cibageigy corp said in greensboro nc he could 
recall none that took products back from farmers 
recalls will begin in four or five weeks after use for the 
current growing season is over said the spokesman steve powell 
farmers will receive refunds for unused amounts and reimbursement 
for any shipping expenses 
its our hope that little will be left over he said 
the other license holder is noram chemical co of wilmington 
del powell said he did not know whether noram bought its product 
from cibageigy or manufactured its own at noram spokesmen who 
could discuss chlordimeform were not immediately available 
cibageigy has sold chlordimeform under the trade name galecron 
while noram sold it under the name fundal about a million pounds 
annually had been used in recent years

private exporters have sold the soviet union 
an additional 300000 metric tons of us corn for delivery during 
the coming year says the agriculture department 
more than 2 million tons of corn have been sold in the last 
week according to usda announcements all have been for delivery 
in the 198889 which began on sept 1 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 300000 tons of 
corn would be about 118 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 272 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale announced wednesday could have a farm value of around 32 
million 
as with the other recent sales no indication was given whether 
the new sales of corn would count under the current longterm grain 
supply agreement between the two countries or be carried forward 
separately in case a new pact is forthcoming 
the current fiveyear pact is set to expire sept 30 and 
negotiators are trying to work out a new one or at least an 
extension of the current agreement to take effect oct 1

women in the san jose area over a threeyear period ending in 
december 
the santa clara municipal court hearing which began wednesday 
is to determine if there is enough evidence for a trial and is 
expected to last up to a month 
although the assailant usually wore a ski mask or other facial 
covering two of the women who testified said they caught glimpses 
of their attacker but could not identify sanchez as the assailant 
two of the women identified items found in sanchezs home as 
property that had been stolen from them

disposable medical supplies of the type that 
turned up on east coast beaches this summer would have to carry 
identifying marks under a bill passed by a house subcommittee 
the measure sponsored by rep james saxton rnj was 
approved wednesday by the house merchant marine and fisheries 
subcommittee on oceanography 
it would require creation of environmental protection agency 
regulations forcing manufacturers to imprint some identifying mark 
on the items to help investigators track the origins of medical 
waste that turns up on beaches and shorelines 
the measure one of a series of medical waste bills working its 
way through congress also would impose stiff fines and prison 
terms on illegal medical waste dumpers and require the epa to issue 
regulations for generators haulers and disposers of the infectious 
materials 
its time to end the litter and crack down on polluters 
saxton said 
the original version of saxtons bill provided maximum penalties 
of 100000 in fines and one year in prison 
but the subcommittee meeting on the first day congress returned 
from its august recess approved an amendment by rep claudine 
schneider rri to increase the maximum penalties to 250000 in 
fines and five years in prison 
another amendment by rep robert davis rmich would extend 
the bills coverage to the great lakes 
in other action the subcommittee approved a measure by rep 
mike lowry dwash to move the us sea boundary from three miles 
to 12 miles offshore a move designed to make it more difficult for 
soviet vessels to detect us submarine movements

urban air cleanup programs are neglecting 
sources of pollution that might be killing trees in rural areas 
according to an environmental researcher 
by concentrating on efforts to limit emissions of hydrocarbons 
rather than nitrogen oxides the urban programs could be allowing 
nitric acids to form ozone in other areas said james j mackenzie 
one of the authors of a report released today by the world 
resources institute 
an official of the environmental protection agency gerald 
emisson said the agencys latest computer models showed no such 
result at least for the northeast 
ozone which damages the lungs is believed by many researchers 
to be helping to kill highaltitude red spruce in the eastern 
united states and several species in west germany it is formed 
from the reaction in sunlight of volatile hydrocarbons such as 
gasoline and the nitrogen oxides emitted in all combustion 
quite small concentrations of nitrogen oxides in contact with 
hydrocarbon compounds from trees can form ozone according to 
research completed within the past year 
the hydrocarbons from trees mainly terpene or isoprene in 
the presence of almost trace amounts of nitrogen oxides about 1 
part per billion can produce fairly large amounts of ozone 
noted a report authored by mackenzie and institute vice president 
mohammed t elashry 
in trying to bring 68 cities and other areas into compliance 
with federal clean air standards for ozone epa seeks lower 
emissions of compounds such as gasoline in polluted urban areas 
reductions in nitrogen oxides can increase ozone at first before 
eventually reducing it 
all that nitrogen oxide emitted in urban areas is going to 
go somewhere its going to increase ozone in rural areas 
mackenzie said in an interview 
i think epas policy is a mistake in urban areas you 
have to reduce both hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides he said 
emisson head of epas office of air quality planning and 
standards at research triangle park nc said that with computer 
models when we have looked at the northeastern united states on 
a very crude scale we dont see big ozone concentrations taking 
place if you dont control nitrogen oxides very tentative 
results do not lead us to say theres a big problem in the 
forests 
the institute surveyed the latest research on the effects of 
ozone and acid rain on crops and forests like many other 
environmental groups and several proposals in congress it called 
for a 50 percent reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide from 
industrial and utility fossil fuel burning a major precursor of 
acid rain and a 25 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen 
oxides which become nitric acid and increase rainfall acidity 
todays typical rural concentrations of ozone are roughly twice 
normal background they probably reduce overall crop yields by 5 
percent to 10 percent resulting in the loss of about 5 billion a 
year the report said 
ozone on rural mountain peaks in the east can approach levels 
epa has defined as unhealthy and the frequent clouds shrouding the 
peaks can be 100 times more acidic than rainfall the report noted 
the report itself did not examine epas urbanair strategies 
heavy doses of ozone have long been known to kill trees 
directly the report outlined theories by which the acids and ozone 
in combination could be killing trees by leaching out nutrients or 
leaving them too ill to resist drought or insects 
a 1987 scientific paper cited in the report said in the 
absence of manmade nitrogen oxide emissions isoprene 
contributes little to ozone formation 
a simultaneous reduction of both nitrogen oxides and 
hydrocarbons still might initially increase ozone in some urban 
areas said jennifer logan an atmospheric chemist at harvard 
university emisson agreed noting that no one knows yet which 
cities might reduce nitrogen oxides without increasing ozone 
locally 
an approach that helps ozone in urban areas might not do a lot 
of good in rural areas ms logan said its important to 
recognize that this is being actively investigated and people are 
only beginning to grasp the science but policymakers could find 
themselves forced to favor trees or people she said 
in a lot of the northeast it doesnt make a lot of 
difference to ozone formation whether urban nitrogen oxides are 
reduced but if you get into the more forested areas it can make 
a difference ms logan said

the stage is set for a showdown over a bill 
guaranteeing jobprotected leave to new parents with supporters 
urging politicians to put your votes where your mouths are or 
risk being turned out of office 
if politicians truly want to capture womens votes they must 
go beyond profamily rhetoric and photo opportunities with 
children said judith lichtman president of the womens legal 
defense fund its really quite simple put your votes where your 
mouths are 
added irene natividad chairman of the national womens 
political caucus we need a response beyond window dressing 
the caucus is among more than two dozen womens groups ranging 
from church women united to the national abortion rights action 
league mounting an intensive lobbying drive for the family and 
medical leave act it is scheduled for a house vote next wednesday 
the bill has 151 cosponsors but only 16 of them are 
republicans compromises are being discussed with conservative 
lawmakers many of them southern democrats as supporters attempt 
to secure a majority for the bill before the floor vote 
the act would require businesses employing more than 50 people 
to offer unpaid jobprotected leave of at least 10 weeks to parents 
of newborn newly adopted or seriously ill children at least 15 
weeks would have to be available to employees suffering a serious 
illness themselves an elder care provision would permit leaves 
to care for seriously ill parents 
the elder care section is likely to die either in the house or 
later in the senate supporters acknowledge and the bill may 
ultimately guarantee workers a single 12week leave for either 
illness or parental responsibilities 
lichtman cited several cases that illustrate why the legislation 
is needed she described a baker who lost his job because he took 
off a day to be with his daughter during her heart operation a 
postal worker denied a week of unpaid leave after his wife had 
twins and a hospital supply technician who returned from an 
approved maternity leave to be told her job was gone 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis has endorsed the 
family leave bill the reagan administration opposes it but one 
womens group official said vice president george bush the gop 
nominee was reevaluating his position late last week 
we think the bush campaign is showing some very good signs 
said linda dorian executive director of the bipartisan national 
federation of business and professional women there is room for 
some productive dialogue on this 
small businesses are planning a major lobbying effort next week 
against the family leave measure 
what plant closings was to large business this is to small 
business said mary tavenner a founder of the 160member 
concerned alliance of responsible employers its even more 
dangerous theyre telling americas employers we dont care 
who needs it and who doesnt this is what youve got to do 
whether or not you can afford it

the likelihood of injury from a car accident 
ranges widely among different car models but for the most part 
safety increases with automobile size according to an insurance 
industry report 
the report on injury claims involving 207 popular models shows 
that small cars have by far the highest injury loss records while 
station wagons and large cars often afford the greatest protection 
according to the insurance group the mercedesbenz sdlsel 
sedan which is equipped with a driverside airbag had the best 
safety record with injury losses that were 58 percent lower than 
the average for all cars close behind was the pontiac safari 
station wagon 
the least safe car was the 4door chevrolet spectrum which had 
injury losses that were 78 percent above average followed by the 
4door chevrolet sprint and 4door hyundai excel both of which had 
losses 67 percent above average the report said 
of the 10 cars with the best injury loss record nine were 
categorized as large cars including five station wagons and 
vans the saab 9000 was the only midsize car in the top 10 
vehicles ranking fifth best with injury losses 51 percent lower 
than average 
the 10 vehicles with the worst injury loss record were all in 
the small sedan or small sports car category 
exceptions to the general trend that small cars afford the least 
protection include another saab model the saab 900 as well as the 
volkswagen vanagon the toyota van porsche 944 coupe and mercedes 
benz 380560 sl convertible all are in the small category but 
had better than average injury loss records 
but except for the saab 900 all 60 of the small sedan 
models had higher injury losses than average 
the report by the highway loss data institute an insurance 
industry research group covered 198587 model cars but spokesmen 
said the findings can be used as a guide for later model vehicles 
as well 
the loss experience of most cars is consistent from one model 
year to another said brian oneill the institutes president 
the report said the results were adjusted to take into account 
various nonvehicle factors such as types and ages of drivers 
that might be associated with particular vehicles 
the 2door chevrolet cavalier was the only midsize car to have 
substantially worse than average injury losses 36 percent 
worse than average for all vehicles 
all but two of the 35 large cars station wagons vans and 
speciality cars had lower than average injury losses the 4door 
oldsmobile delta 88 and cadillac fleetwooddeville were the 
exceptions ranked as average 
of the 207 cars and vans included in the study 40 had safety 
records that were characterized as substantially better than 
average while 32 were substantially worse

philadelphia electric co has decided not to 
contest a nuclear regulatory commission fine of 125 million for 
failing to prevent control room workers from sleeping on duty at 
pennsylvanias peach bottom nuclear plant officials said 
the fine is the largest ever imposed by the nrc 
the utility is expected to announce later this week or monday 
that it intends to pay its share of the fine which amounts to 
about 531000 according to philadelphia electric officials who 
spoke wednesday on condition of anonymity 
three other utilities in new jersey and delaware are liable for 
portions of the fine because they are part owners of the plant at 
delta pa near the pennsylvaniamaryland border according to 
philadelphia electric the plant operator 
the fine was assessed on aug 11 for failing to detect report 
and deal with inattentive operators and supervisors who condoned 
it thirtythree present and former peach bottom reactor 
operators have been fined between 500 and 1000 by the nrc for 
sleeping andor other acts of inattention to duty 
last month the nrc called the levy a proposed fine 
explaining that the utility had 30 days either to admit or deny the 
proposed violations if it admits the allegations philadelphia 
electric is required to list any corrective actions 
philadelphia electric spokesman william jones said wednesday 
that a decision had been made but obviously im not at liberty 
to say what it is 
however two officials said the company had decided to pay the 
fine in the interest of putting the issue behind it and focusing on 
getting the plant restarted 
if it admits the allegations jones said philadelphia electric 
will be liable for about 531000 or 4249 percent of the fine 
that is the percentage share of peach bottom held by philadelphia 
electric which operates the plant 
public service electric and gas co of newark nj also owns 
4249 percent of the plant other coowners are atlantic electric 
co of atlantic city nj and delmarva power and light co of 
wilmington del both with 751 percent 
the peach bottom fine is the largest since congress gave the nrc 
authority to issue civil penalties in 1969 but it pales in 
comparison to the 100 million that philadelphia electric has 
already lost because of the cost of purchasing replacement power 
peach bottom which is capable of producing 1 million kilowatts 
of electric power was ordered shut down by the nrc on march 31 
1987 because operators sleeping on duty were said to pose a safety 
threat 
since then philadelphia electric has shuffled management at the 
plant and ordered reactor operators retrained

the senate is preparing to act on proposed new 
limits on textile apparel and shoe imports giving little heed to 
complaints that it is reverting to protectionism 
the textile and apparel industries will be extinct in a few 
years unless the flooding of our markets is stopped sen strom 
thurmond rsc said wednesday as the senate voted 6829 to force 
action on the longstanding issue 
the senate voted to limit debate giving opponents of the 
proposed restrictions no more than 30 hours to express their 
objections as a result action on the bill is expected by friday 
at the latest 
senate allies of the textile and apparel industries were in 
command of the debate at all times critics who say us 
manufacturers are exaggerating their problems to win special 
treatment were reduced to giving their adversaries a futile 
daylong tonguelashing 
you are being absolutely shameless declared sen phil 
gramm rtexas who opposes the measure 
under the bill this years textile and apparel imports would be 
frozen at 1987 levels and growth would be limited to 1 percent 
annually in succeeding years nonrubber footwear imports would be 
capped at 1987 levels 
the president would be authorized to compensate countries hurt 
by the restrictions by negotiating tariff cuts 
textilestate lawmakers and their freetrade critics butted 
heads over just how much the industry is earning 
sen bob packwood rore told the senate that beforetaxes 
earnings of us textile companies zoomed 26 percent last year 
that brought thurmond rushing to the floor with figures suggesting 
a 12 percent drop in profits thus far this year 
prospects for the bill remain clouded despite the senates 
action the house has passed a differing version and it is unclear 
whether compromise can be reached in the month remaining before 
lawmakers adjourn a veto also is a possibility 
president reagan vetoed a similar bill in 1985 and the 
administration is suggesting that the same fate may await the 
latest version 
a wave of asian textile and apparel imports jolted us 
manufacturers in the early 1980s and they have been seeking 
congressional import curbs ever since 
textile and apparel companies as well as their allies in the 
shoe industry and a variety of labor unions say such restrictions 
are needed to salvage jobs in an industry whose very existence they 
claim is threatened by foreign competition 
the reagan administration and lawmakers from exportminded 
states however have been pointing to an upturn in textile 
industry earnings they say a steep fall in employment represents a 
shakeout traceable largely to increased productivity and efficiency 
layoffs came at the same time as a modernization of many us 
textile plants with automated equipment the upgrading came in 
large part as a response to increased competition from overseas 
manufacturers mainly in asia 
but apparel manufacturing has not been able to automate to 
anything near the same extent as a result laborintensive 
lowwage companies in korea and elsewhere in asia have enjoyed a 
substantial advantage in many cases

vice president george bush who stunned 
democrat michael dukakis with a barrage of tough attacks on the 
presidential campaign trail last month is trying for a different 
image in his opening television ads 
i want a kinder and gentler nation bush said in his 
convention acceptance speech that moment and others like it are 
now being replayed for california audiences in two 30second spots 
the kinder and gentler pitch was designed in large part to 
increase bushs lagging support among women voters it is being 
replayed in an ad called the future in which domestic images 
of bush cooking at the stove bush eating at a picnic and bush 
kissing a grandchild are mixed in with excerpts from his speech 
im a quiet man but i hear the quiet people others dont 
i hear them and i am moved bush continues 
the president intones a honeyvoiced narrator the heart 
the soul the conscience of the nation 
a second bush ad also running in california features another 
moment in his acceptance speech after describing his years serving 
a great president bush says it all comes down to the man at 
the desk and who should sit at that desk 
cheers break out on the convention floor as he declares my 
friends i am that man scenes of the convention alternate with 
shots of the white house strikingly lit in the dark of night 
dukakis is competing with bush on both the compassion and 
competence fronts mostly in texas like california another 
critical battleground 
a dukakis spot running in texas shows a padlocked plant gate as 
a narrator asks shouldnt there be a law to give you and your 
community 60 days notice george bush says no and dan quayle led 
the fight in the senate against making it a law 
the ad says the massachusetts governor had one of the first such 
laws in the country passed and touts texas sen lloyd bentsen his 
running mate as the man who won the fight to make 60day 
notification law the two are shown in their shirtsleeves 
chatting genially with a group of workers at a plant 
who cares about your life a narrator asks in closing the 
choice is clear 
dukakis also has revived an ad called new era which ran in 
a limited fashion during the republican convention and started up 
wednesday on national network television the spot features 
excerpts from his acceptance speech and a list of his 
accomplishments as governor 
neither campaign is using negative ads yet but the democratic 
national committee unveiled one wednesday and said it would start 
airing late this week called hey pal the spot charges that 
the gop is responsible for tripling the federal deficit from 900 
billion in 1980 to 26 trillion this year we cant afford the 
republicans it concludes 
the generic ad was scheduled to play in several battleground 
states but the campaign declined to specify which ones 
a group called americans for bush not associated with the bush 
campaign has prepared two ads slamming dukakis record on crime 
and plans to show them on several national cable networks the ads 
were to be shown at a news conference today

here are the cars ranked as having 
substantially better and substantially worse injury loss 
records according to the highway loss data institute an insurance 
industry research group 
these vehicles have injury loss records of at least 30 percent 
greater or 30 percent less than the average for the 207 vehicles 
examined 
the number in parenthesis after each vehicle represents the 
relative injury loss rate the lower the number the better the loss 
rate 100 is the average for all vehicles for example a 40 would 
mean a loss rate of 60 percent below average a 140 would be a loss 
rate of 40 percent greater than average

it was an ambush 
more than a dozen youths waited menacingly outside the entrance 
in blacksburg va where in a few minutes an older wealthy man 
was expected to emerge 
would he give them what they wanted 
what the fraternity brothers from sigma nu at virginia tech 
wanted it seems was a secret handshake and they wanted it from 
sen lloyd bentsen the democratic vice presidential nominee who 
had just addressed a rally at their school 
more than 40 years ago bentsen was the president of his sigma 
nu chapter at the university of texas and the virginia tech 
students wanted to give him a proper sendoff 
a handful of reporters waited in suspense to see if he 
remembered 
exactly what he was supposed to remember could not be 
determined a conversation with one of the sweatshirted frat 
members went something like this 
what does your secret handshake look like 
you cant see it 
how will you know when he does it 
well know 
do you think hell remember it 
hell know 
the media watched anxiously as bentsen emerged he started 
shaking hands moving toward the gathering between him and his car 
suddenly there was a puzzled look in his face a moment of 
hesitation then a smile and the sigma nus cheered they posed 
gleefully for pictures with their older frat brother who beamed 
later on his campaign plane bentsen confirmed what reporters 
could not see he had remembered 
yes thank the lord he said with an exaggerated sigh of 
relief 
what was it exactly that he did he was asked bentsen just 
smiled the secrets good with him 
evidently some other secrets are safe as well 
when a reporter asked for some stories about life back at sigma 
nu bentsen scolded get back to the back of the plane 
bentsens wife ba was monitoring that exchange

by far the most frequent nonpolitical topic of conversation 
among reporters covering the campaigns this year is airplanes 
several times campaign jets have been grounded because of 
malfunctions and safety concerns earning planes nicknames such as 
sky pig pilots have been dubbed captain crash 
but when campaigning with bentsen its clear he still sees 
romance in the air despite surviving a couple of crash landings in 
his life 
in his political rhetoric bentsen talks about the republican 
opposition being on autopilot and says america needs to set 
its sights on something recalling his world war ii days as a 
bomber pilot 
after his big boeing 737 campaign jet was grounded in jackson 
miss last month bentsen was forced to travel to hot springs 
ark in a fleet of three small twinengine propeller planes 
along the way he reminisced about flying his own small plane 
with lyndon johnson to retrieve lady bird one time when the lbj 
ranch was flooded and he recalled how johnson had forty years ago 
campaigned for the senate by helicopter when those craft were so 
rare that excited crowds would form at the pulsing sound of the 
rotors arriving in town johnson would throw his cowboy hat from 
the chopper and then greet the gatherings when he went to retrieve 
it 
well modern campaign jets certainly didnt have the same 
panache but what about a fleet of those smaller planes 
barnstorming around the country 
a bentsen air force 
we could fly down the runways in formation and then peel off 
one at a time bentsen said demonstrating with his hands 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for four days before labor day bentsen disappeared from the 
campaign trail for some relaxation at a friends ranch in wyoming 
responding to reporters questions on his first outing on labor 
day bentsen said he played a lot of tennis rested and went 
fishing with what he claimed was great success 
hold up your hand he told a reporter a few rows back on the 
plane she did 
bentsen held up his own hand facing hers and declared thats 
how big it was

bacteria can pass on to their offspring 
characteristics they acquire during their lifetimes according to a 
discovery that challenges one of the central tenets of charles 
darwins theory of evolution 
john cairns and colleagues at the harvard school of public 
health in boston reported today that bacteria threatened with 
starvation can size up their troubles and mutate in ways that 
enable them to survive 
cairns said in a telephone interview that the inheritance of 
acquired characteristics can probably occur in other singlecelled 
organisms like algae and fungi but is unlikely to occur in higher 
animals 
franklin stahl a professor of molecular genetics at the 
university of oregon in eugene said of cairns finding it will 
be very interesting to a lot of biologists whether its important 
it wont do anything to reduce the national debt 
the idea that acquired characteristics could be passed on to 
succeeding generations was proposed early in the 19th century by 
jean de lamarck but lamarckism as the theory was called was 
generally discarded early in this century said stahl 
if lamarckism is correct it would mean that a blacksmith for 
example who developed strong muscles during his lifetime would be 
destined to have children with strongerthanaverage muscles said 
cairns 
the idea fell out of favor cairns said because biologists 
could never explain how changes in muscles could lead to changes in 
sperm and eggs which would be necessary if the blacksmiths 
acquired characteristics were to be passed on to his children 
cairns and his colleagues julie overbaugh and stephan miller 
report their findings in nature magazine in an accompanying 
article stahl said the job of biologists now is to explain how 
bacteria can do this 
natural selection darwins theory that stands in opposition to 
lamarckism says that mutations arise spontaneously in organisms 
and by chance some of those mutations may allow an organism to 
survive better than others of its kind 
cairns showed that the lifesaving mutations in the bacteria he 
studied were produced in response to the stressful situation they 
were not naturally occurring variations that simply turned out to 
be advantageous

profits at the nations commercial banks are 
soaring toward record levels this year after hitting bottom in 1987 
when big banks wrote off billions in third world loans the 
government says 
the federal deposit insurance corp said wednesday that 13403 
banks reported 105 billion in earnings for the six months ending 
june 30 that is the biggest sixmonth profit since the agency 
began keeping track in 1934 topping the 97 billion in net income 
for the second and third quarters of 1985 
we think we will see record profits for the year if the 
economy continues on its current level said fdic chairman l 
william seidman whose agency insures commercial bank deposits up 
to 100000 
the most profitable year for banking was 1985 when the industry 
posted earnings of 181 billion 
in the first half of 1987 banks lost 54 billion and went on 
for the full year to post the weakest earnings since the 
depression 37 billion 
the poor performance was almost entirely attributable to huge 
reserves set aside by the largest banks for expected losses on 
loans to third world countries 
banks havent seen the need to build those reserves further this 
year and are thus earning strong profits they set aside only 916 
million on foreign loans in the first six months of this year 
compared with 164 billion in the same period a year ago 
but even as industrywide earnings are climbing the number of 
bank failures also seems certain to set a postdepression record 
more than half of the failures have been in texas a state still 
reeling from the worldwide depression in the oil industry and the 
resulting slump in southwestern real estate prices 
texas banks lost 29 billion in the first half with 23 
billion of that attributable to a single institution first 
republicbank corp of dallas which has since been rescued with 4 
billion in federal money elsewhere in the oildependent southwest 
banks earned modest profits 
seidman said he hoped that the condition of banks in texas would 
improve now that so many have been closed or merged with healthier 
institutions at the end of august 173 banks had failed or 
required government assistance to stay open ninetyseven of those 
including 42 first republicbank subsidiaries were in texas 
seidman said failures would continue at the same rate this year 
setting a postdepression record but then decline next year 
in the midwest battered earlier in the decade by farm bank 
failures the profitability of most banks has been restored in the 
first half just 7 percent of banks in iowa kansas minnesota 
missouri nebraska north dakota and south dakota lost money 
compared with nearly double that amount a year ago 
farm losses caused by this year drought may check the 
improvement in banks in the region but seidman said midwestern 
banks should be able to weather any difficulties because theyve 
lent more carefully than in the past and because of government aid 
to farmers 
other figures cited by the fdic include 
the number of unprofitable banks has dropped from 2243 in the 
first six months of 1987 to 1729 this year 
banks on the fdics problem list dropped from a peak of 1601 
at midyear 1987 to 1455 on june 30 of this year 
bad loans those on which payments are not being made totaled 
734 billion in the second quarter 3 percent less than a year ago 
bank lending in real estate and to consumers grew at the 
expense of traditional commercial loans to business much of the 
expansion in real estate loans was to build commercial projects 
such as offices and shopping centers much of the growth in 
consumer lending was in home equity loans 
seidman also noted that growth in commercial bank deposits 
barely matches inflation and is not keeping up with growth in the 
economy meanwhile deposits at savings and loan institutions have 
grown twice as fast he said 
many insolvent sampls which have not yet been closed by 
regulators are paying high interest rates in order to attract 
depositors

un officials are caught in a maddening 
situation sitting on a 72 billion nest egg they cant touch 
while planning to close the world body next month for lack of cash 
members countries owe the united nations 602 million in dues 
twothirds of it is owed by the united states which has been 
withholding funds to try to force the world body to implement 
fiscal reforms 
undersecretarygeneral joseph v reed the top us official at 
the united nations says the organization will be unable to meet 
its payroll and other fixed expenses by late october if the united 
states doesnt pay some of its 467 million debt 
meanwhile the untouchable pension fund managed by the united 
nations since 1949 has grown to a gross value of 72 billion a 
un official said wednesday speaking on condition of anonymity 
the united nations manages the pension fund for its employees 
and those of 16 related agencies such as unesco the world health 
organization and the international labor organization 
about 43 percent of the fund is invested in stocks 34 percent 
in bonds 11 percent in real estate funds but not in any actual 
property and 12 percent is in shortterm investments said the 
official 
the investments are spread among 27 different currencies in 44 
nations so the un pension fund wont be sapped by currency 
fluctuations 
the fund grew at an average rate of 223 percent each year for 
five years while riding the stock market boom a cycle that went 
bust last october when the markets crashed because of the 
diversity of the fund it lost only about 5 percent of its value in 
the crash the official said 
about 54000 participants are paying into the fund and about 
27000 people are receiving benefits he said 
while the pension fund is solvent the un budget is about to 
go bust 
the united states is assessed onefourth of the regular un 
budget which in 1988 was 876 million congress appropriated 144 
million this year toward un dues but washington has paid only 60 
million 
the united states began withholding a portion of its dues early 
in the 1980s due to displeasure over antius and antiisrael 
rhetoric in the general assembly and to save funds at a time when 
the us budget deficit was growing rapidly 
more recently funds have been withheld in an effort to force 
the united nations to cut its staff by 15 percent reduce expenses 
and make personnel changes 
in particular the united states wants soviet un staffers 
converted from temporary contracts to permanent international civil 
servant status thus making them independent of the kremlins 
policy goals at least in theory 
the soviet foreign ministry has said it will transfer some of 
its un staff to the international civil service but so far none 
of its un employees has been reassigned 
trimming spending in the uns regular budget is an ongoing 
battle currently being fought in the uns key budget committee 
the committee for programs and coordination 
that committee consists of 34 nations including the united 
states and the other large contributors they began meeting on 
tuesday for two weeks to consider the uns budgets for 1990 and 
1991 
un officials hope the united states will be satisfied enough 
with the proposals presented to the committee to release more than 
100 million in back dues 
the general assembly opens sept 20 the day after the committee 
finishes its work 
president reagan may face a chilly reception when he addresses 
the general assembly on sept 26 if the united states is still as 
deep in arrears un staff and diplomats say

an electionyear bookkeeping change pushed by 
the reagan administration will cause official estimates of the us 
trade deficit to drop 15 billion a month even though the actual 
imbalance wont have changed at all 
the change is being made two months before a presidential 
election in which democratic nominee michael dukakis has repeatedly 
attacked soaring trade deficits calling them examples of failed 
reagan administration economic policies 
commerce undersecretary robert ortner defended the change at a 
briefing wednesday telling reporters it was not an effort to 
manipulate government statistics for political purposes 
it doesnt change the basic story he said either way the 
trade deficit is still large but it is now improving 
substantially 
the monthly merchandise trade report due out next week will be 
the first to reflect the new accounting procedure 
it will show that the united states is importing about 15 
billion less each month even though the total amount of color 
televisions cars and other foreign products purchased by americans 
will not have changed at all 
since the official import figure will be on average 15 billion 
lower the closely watched monthly trade deficit the difference 
between imports and exports also will be 15 billion lower 
since 1979 the government has included the costs paid to 
foreigners to ship and insure their products as part of the 
countrys total import bill 
before then the monthly merchandise trade figures did not 
include shipping and insurance costs for imports these payments 
were classified as a service and were added to a quarterly trade 
report known as the current account which reflects us 
transactions in both goods and services 
former sen russell long dla sponsored an amendment in 1979 
that changed the merchandise trade report to include the insurance 
and shipping costs arguing that without these costs the monthly 
trade report did not properly reflect us obligations to 
foreigners 
the long amendment prohibited the commerce department from 
releasing any trade figures stripped of insurance and shipping 
costs until 48 hours after release of the initial trade report 
the government continued to release the lower import figures 
but they received little notice compared to the initial trade 
report with its larger deficit 
the administration has now changed that process by getting 
congress to approve an amendment removing the 48hour delay 
requirement the change which attracted little notice was part of 
the 1000page omnibus trade bill 
beginning with next wednesdays release of the july merchandise 
trade report the government will release both sets of import 
statistics beginning next year only the trade data minus shipping 
costs will be released ortner said 
he said the other figure will still be compiled and will be 
available to those who request it 
ortner said the new accounting process would put service 
payments for shipping and insurance where they belong in the 
services category of the current account the broadest measure of 
us trade 
this will give a slightly rosier tint to the numbers but from 
an economists point of view it makes sense to have exports and 
imports on the same basis i dont object to the method at all 
said michael evans head of a washington consulting firm 
but evans said political motivations almost certainly played a 
role in the action 
there were politics involved on both sides russell long 
wanted to embarrass the administration with higher trade deficits 
and this move is political as well he said if politics didnt 
enter in then they would have waited until next year to introduce 
the new system 
however ortner said that by publishing both import figures it 
would be up to the news media to decide which one to emphasize 
the merchandise trade deficit for 1987 under the old system was 
1703 billion with shipping removed the deficit would have been 
a lower 1521 billion 
but that would still be a record up 10 percent from a 1383 
billion 1986 deficit as calculated with the revised accounting 
procedure

journalists as she was introduced at the offices of the florida 
lottery department 
ms ryan said she didnt know what shed do with her winnings 
but didnt think that finding things to do with the wealth would be 
a problem ive always been middle class and the middle class 
always needs money she said 
the first of 20 annual installments of 2767361 less 20 
percent withheld for the internal revenue service is due to be 
paid to ms ryan next week she said she didnt know if shed quit 
her job 
the native new yorker a single woman with no children who said

she said her wednesday flight to tallahassee to present the 
winning ticket was her first plane ride 
ive had three firsts today she said it has been my 
first plane ride no 2 this is my first press conference no 
3 this is the first time ive ever won 55 million 
it was ms ryans third winning ticket in floridas 8monthold 
lottery the other two prizes were for 4 each

stories on the front page of the orlando sentinel last week and 
bought the winning ticket friday at a grocery store in longwood 
like winter springs a suburb of orlando the winning combo was 3

these numbers were driving me crazy she said ms ryan said 
she had been buying four tickets a week until florida offered a 23 
million jackpot in early august since then shes been buying five

before ms ryan claimed her prize several dozen other people 
claimed they had the winning ticket its not a crime to claim a 
winning lottery ticket but its a felony to present an altered 
lottery ticket for payment 
one of the claimants was charles hill an elementary school 
janitor in the tiny hamlet of bristol about 280 miles northwest of 
longwood 
hills claim was enough to get him a 23000 chevrolet van with 
no cash down but wednesday morning in tallahassee he submitted 
only a photostat copy of a ticket saying the original had been 
damaged in the laundry 
we have denied mr hills claim based on the fact he does not 
have the original of his ticket said a statement by tom bell 
general counsel for the lottery department the lotterys 
verification procedures on the copy provided by mr hill indicate 
that he does not have the winning ticket 
it was not immediately clear whether officials would pursue 
charges against hill based on his submissal of the photostat 
lottery ticket bell was in a meeting wednesday afternoon and not 
available for comment his office said 
tommy thomas owner of a panama city chevrolet dealership said 
he let hill drive away in a brand new mauve van after liberty 
county sheriff harrell w revell told his credit manager that 
hills ticket was genuine 
were sorry for him but were not too shook up about it 
thomas said wednesday afternoon upon learning that hill wasnt a 
winner he said he expects to get the van back and joked that 
maybe well raffle it off 
several dozen people called the department claiming to have the 
winning ticket according to lottery secretary rebecca paul 
the jackpots final value was put at 5516 million earlier 
estimates put the jackpot at 54 million 
it was the largest single lottery jackpot in the united states 
previously the largest single jackpot in us history was the 
46 million that went to donald r woomer sr and linda k despot 
a couple of hollidaysburg pa last october two individual 
ticketbuyers divided a 514 million california lottery jackpot in 
june 
two other large lottery drawings that were held saturday night

chester said he would quit his job as a truck driver and his wife 
connie said id like to see europe all of europe 
in illinois four ticketbuyers split a 21 million jackpot as

the senate has voted unanimously to ratify two 
international conventions that were prompted largely by the 
chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in the soviet union 
the accords approved by a 970 vote wednesday were negotiated 
under auspices of the viennabased international atomic energy 
agency 
in the wake of the april 1986 chernobyl accident moscow came 
under heavy criticism for delaying release of information on the 
reactor explosion to the outside world until large amounts of 
airborne radioactivity were detected in sweden 
representatives of more than 60 countries met in the summer of 
1986 to negotiate the two pacts the convention on early 
notification of a nuclear accident and the convention on assistance 
in the case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency 
the notification convention has been signed by 72 countries

the cabinet voted to cut the pay of 
gen manuel antonio noriega and other top officials because of a 
cash shortage caused in part by us economic sanctions 
a cabinet resolution passed tuesday mandates pay cuts of 125 
percent to 30 percent for noriega president manuel solis palma and 
heads of stateowned companies 
the government did not provide the individuals salaries but it 
said they make more than 3000 a month 
salaries will return to normal when public finances allow a 
government communique said it acknowledged a deterioration in 
state income and said the pay cuts will save the government 
230000 a month 
business sources say the size of the economy is about half what 
it was in early 1987 before the united states imposed economic 
sanctions in an attempt to drive noriega from power 
noriega commander of the defense forces and the real power 
behind the civilian government is reputed to have become 
independently wealthy during his military career he is under us 
indictment on drug trafficking charges 
noriega denies the drug trafficking charges and says the united 
states is trying to undermine the panamanian government as part of 
a plan to renege on the 1977 panama canal treaties under the 
treaties washington must cede control of the canal at the turn of 
the century 
the united states on wednesday marked the 11th anniversary of 
the treaties saying it would respect the accords but that 
relations with panama could improve only with a democratic 
government in panama 
panamanians and north americans have worked together to 
implement the treaties and to ensure the continued and efficient 
operation of the panama canal we promise that this will 
continue the us embassy said in a statement 
it said however that the us government continues believing 
that relations between our two peoples will be stronger when 
democracy is restored in panama

more than 1000 people have died since 1980 in 
land disputes in northern brazil where landowners hire gunmen to 
abuse or kill peasants indians church workers and trade 
unionists amnesty international said today 
the londonbased human rights group chastised brazilian 
authorities for not enforcing laws to stem the violence and said it 
has evidence public servants were themselves involved in some 
incidents 
land reform is a deeply divisive issue in brazil where 4 
percent of the population of 141 million own almost half the arable 
land 
amnesty said the report that although it takes no position on 
land issues it was alarmed at systematic and widespread failure 
to enforce the rule of law which has led to serious human rights 
violations in brazil 
the report accuses authorities of allowing abuses to go 
virtually unpunished and speaks of overwhelming evidence that the 
intimidation and violence of landowners and land speculators is not 
only sanctioned but frequently assisted by state authorities 
in an example of official indifference the report said a 
police chief at goianesiua police station in para state allegedly 
told one woman whose husband and son were shot dead in october 1987 
that he could not register the crime because he had no pen and 
paper 
in addition to the deaths of more than 1000 people in land 
disputes since 1980 hundreds more were tortured or illtreated and 
countless others were forced off their land the group said 
it said it sent its report to brazilian authorities in april and 
discussed its concerns with senior federal government officials in 
the capital city of brasilia in june 
the officials acknowleged state action had been inadequate but 
did not accept that this called for direct federal intervention 
amnesty said 
the group said evidence suggested most of the killings were 
carried out by gunmen hired by landowners to terrorize and evict 
those considered a threat to their interests most victims were 
peasants native indians priests nuns church workers lawyers 
and trade unionists it said 
the report quotes the brazilian bar association as saying 
killings can allegedly be contracted through a death syndicate 
with offices in imperatriz in maranhao state it says police are 
reported to have been recruited by such syndicates 
local police treat these killings so lightly that they often 
do not bother to register the crimes the report says 
even when crimes are recorded police have failed to collect 
evidence and ignored routine procedures such as visiting the scene 
of the crime and interviewing suspects it says 
convictions or punishments were imposed only in two landrelated 
killings the report says 
it says police routinely carry out arbitrary arrests of 
peasants mistreat and sometimes torture them and evict them from 
their land illegally apparently to discourage them from pursuing 
political activities 
it says hired gunmen sometimes accompany police 
in february 1987 military police are reported to have illegally 
rounded up 50 peasants including children in the vicinity of sao 
geraldo do araguaia south para and marched them at gunpoint to a 
landowners ranch house amnesty said 
they are alleged to have raped two women savagely beaten the 
peasants with rifle butts and sticks compelled some to eat 
excrement thorns and lighted cigarettes and forced bottles down 
the throats of others it said none of the peasants returned 
to their land afterward 
peasants arrested after gunmen or landowners were killed were 
held incommunicado without judicial order and mistreated or even 
tortured to obtain confessions or statements that would incriminate 
others amnesty said

the son of william butler yeats says he has the 
documentation to disprove a biographers claim that the poets 
bones are in a paupers grave in france not in yeats grave in 
ireland 
english biographer diana souhami says yeats was buried in france 
in a mass paupers grave and that when the bones were dug up for 
transfer to ireland in 1948 there was no way of telling whose 
bones they were 
michael yeats accused ms souhami of whipping up cheap 
publicity out of a great mans death the irish times said 
wednesday 
he called her claims the greatest nonsense and said it is 
absolutely certain that my father is buried in county sligo i have 
the documentation to prove it the newspaper said 
ms souhami based her claim tuesday on a mixup she said she 
found in the papers of yeats friend the painter hannah gluck she 
is working on a biography of the painter who she said tried for 
years to convince yeats friends of the mistake 
she cited correspondence between yeats friends and the keeper 
of the cemetery in roquebrun southern france saying it was 
impossible to establish that the remains were the poets 
the younger yeats was quoted as saying when his father died in 
1939 the body was not put in a paupers grave but placed in a 
temporary grave and its transfer to ireland was delayed by world 
war ii 
nine years later the poet was exhumed his bones measured and 
the remains placed in a casket for transfer to drumcliffe county 
sligo where he had asked to be buried yeats was quoted as saying 
the irish times quoted yeats as saying his mother oversaw the 
whole operation to transfer the bones and that he had documents 
from various officials who witnessed the procedure 
ms souhami said she never sought the kind of publicity to which 
yeats referred and offending people certainly wasnt my 
intention 
im sure he yeats believes that story but unfortunately the 
letters among glucks papers dont confirm his account she told 
the associated press unfortunately i have the letters from the 
priest in roquebrun and letters from the undertakers 
she said hannah gluck spent years trying to convince yeats 
friends the wrong bones went to drumcliffe and that the affair 
needed to go into the biography because it illustrated her 
obsessive character

michael milken who was charged by 
a federal lawsuit with insider trading almost singlehandedly 
built junkbond financing into the tool of choice for corporate 
raiders during the past dozen years 
milken was seen for years as a wall street whiz kid who had 
helped transform drexel burnham lambert inc from a minor player 
into a powerhouse 
even when it became known several months ago that he was under 
investigation for insider trading milken and drexel took the 
offensive 
drexel waged a publicrelations blitz stressing the role of 
junk bonds notes that are highly risky but offer high yields in 
helping small companies get off the ground and downplaying their 
role megabuck takeover battles 
the normally secretive milken 42 began accepting speaking 
engagements and granting some interviews with the condition that 
questions about the securities and exchange commission and the 
investigation of him were off limits 
his comments focused almost solely on his latest pet plan to 
alleviate the latin american debt crisis by swapping debt for 
equity or selling securities backed by those countries oil and 
silver resources 
milken reportedly makes 40 million a year as the head of 
drexels junkbond operation that is several times more than the 
firms chairman milkens personal fortune has been estimated at 
more than 500 million 
he lives with his children and wife lori his high school 
sweetheart whom he married at age 22 in a house on the former 
estate of the late actor clark gable in suburban encino an 
uppermiddleclass section of the san fernando valley two miles 
from his childhood home 
milkens fascination with finance dates to his boyhood at age 
10 a favorite pastime was poring over tax returns prepared by his 
father an accountant 
after studying business at the university of california 
berkeley and the university of pennsylvanias wharton school 
milken went to work for drexel firestone amp co in philadelphia as a 
junior bond trader 
drexel merged with burnham amp co in 1973 and lambert brussels 
witter in 1976 and milkens job was moved to new york milken 
worked hard to make a name for himself but never became acclimated 
to the east 
in 1977 he persuaded drexel to let him move the companys 
junkbond operations from wall street to beverly hills just off 
swank rodeo drive 
milken became enormously successful in california building a 
closeknit network of junkbond investors he is in charge of the 
150 people who work at drexels junkbond operation 
he still works 12 to 13 hours a day seven days a week and wont 
tolerate lack of drive among those who work for him 
associates say they need to make appointments to meet with him 
even on weekends 
he once said he had no hobbies because what i do is fun

at the advice of the nations 
bishops pope john paul ii will bypass south africa the most 
populous and dominant country in southern africa when he begins a 
visit to the region saturday 
south african catholics have written to newspapers and their 
church expressing anger and disappointment that the pope is not 
stopping in their land he will visit zimbabwe lesotho 
mozambique botswana and swaziland all of which border south 
africa 
some south africa catholics said they would withhold donations 
that would be used to finance the popes visit to the poorer 
neighboring countries others suggested the pope could have done 
some good by bringing a message of peace reconciliation and 
respect for human rights to racially divided south africa 
the dispute is part of a growing tension between the south 
african government and church leaders who actively oppose 
apartheid under which the nations black majority has no voice in 
national affairs 
no one in the church has said that the itinerary for the sept 
1019 visit is a snub of the south african government or a 
demonstration of the vaticans disapproval of apartheid 
but the zimbabwe government said john paul was protesting 
apartheid by not going to south africa it banned south 
africanbased foreign journalists from covering the pope in 
zimbabwe 
foreign minister pik bothas office issued a statement aug 4 
saying the bishops were to blame for the pope skipping south africa 
because they had not invited him although they had been told the 
government would welcome a visit 
the southern african catholic bishops conference said it invited 
the pope to come to south africa in 1982 but has been unable to 
arrange a date the conference said it would be impractical to 
squeeze a large country like south africa into a tour already 
covering five nations 
there has been a lot of misunderstanding about the whole 
thing said the archbishop of cape town stephen naidoo the 
pope never said he wouldnt come 
he called bothas aug 4 statement mischievous 
the pope said in july that he would like to visit south africa 
some day but that the bishops told him it would not be appropriate 
at this time he did not elaborate 
south african security police this week went to the home of 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu in cape town to collect a 
recording of his latest sermon they were investigating whether he 
had violated emergency regulations by calling for a boycott of 
october municipal elections 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said last week the 
government may clip the wings of activist clergymen who vowed 
to begin a civil disobedience campaign against emergency rules 
the rev smangaliso mkhatshwa secretarygeneral of the catholic 
bishops conference was released from detention last year after 
church officials filed court affidavits in which he swore he was 
being tortured he was subsequently charged with possession of a 
gun which he denies 
the schedule for the popes 10day visit includes beatification 
of a french missionary in lesotho a bishops conference in 
zimbabwe and outdoor masses in botswana swaziland and mozambique 
the pope received south african president pw botha at the 
vatican in 1984 and there are plans for him to send greetings 
during one of his two flights over the country on his way to 
lesotho and to swaziland 
lesotho is surrounded by south africa and swaziland is bordered 
on three sides by its huge neighbor hundreds of thousands of south 
africans black and white are expected to cross the border to see 
the pope many thousands are also expected in botswana and zimbabwe 
just as south africa dominates communications trade 
transportation and politics in the region its influence will be 
felt strongly during the popes trip 
south african firms are supplying transportation food water 
and health services broadcasting and emergency equipment to be 
used on many of the popes stops 
local coordinating committees are selling papal souvenirs 
through south african franchises to defray the expenses of 
building podiums for the outdoor rallies providing accommodations 
for dignitaries and pilgrims and arranging for security and 
traffic control

inflation was wiped off because of sentiment that the us economy 
is not expanding that much said manjiro ueda of nomura 
securities japans largest securities firm 
the yen has been regaining its strength and the trading is 
getting active again he added 
in foreign exchange the lower dollar widely was attributed to 
the currencys sharp 155yen decline overnight in the united 
states following an announcement from bank of japan governor 
satoshi sumita the previous day 
at a regular news conference wednesday sumita said he saw no 
immediate need for the central bank to change its current economic 
policy but was willing to take swift action if the yen declines 
further 
sumitas remarks raised speculation by traders that monetary 
authorities might act to support the yen

rivers across this flooded nation 
receded slightly today but the change brought little relief to 
people still boating and wading through murky waters to get food 
and uncontaminated water 
the death toll from the floods that started june 13 and subsided 
only to rise with new vengeance on aug 27 was 416 according to the 
government whose count is generally considered low 
the independent bengalilanguage newspaper khobar today reported 
34 new drownings and snakebite deaths bringing the unofficial 
toll to 1301 
the buriganga and sitlakhya rivers that wrap around dhaka on 
three sides fell between 1 to 4 inches in the last 24 hours but 
were still as much as 45 inches above flood level the flood 
control center reported 
about threefourths of bangladesh an impoverished lowlying 
nation of 110 million people remained under water ranging from a 
few inches in some areas to at least 10 feet in others 
in dhaka a city of 6 million streets were turned into canals 
clogged with boats ferrying people to work to food markets and 
relief centers and to spigots to get drinking water 
at least half the capital was still under water 
in the shaymoli neighborhood in northern dhaka two young 
seamstresses waded waist deep in front of the fourstory building 
that houses the small fairy fashion factory where they work 
eleven of us are living in the factory because our homes are 
flooded said 20yearold shamima who uses only one name 
there has been no electricity for two weeks so we cant work and 
we dont know if well be paid but the owner is bringing us food 
she and her friend 17yearold lily said they waded through 
the flood each day to buy about five gallons of drinking water for 
31 cents they said the water proably wasnt pure but it was all 
they could get most of us have fevers and headaches lily said 
both young women said they had heard about water purification 
tablets but werent using any no one has given us any and we 
dont have enough money to buy any lily said 
the government says it is distributing water purification 
tablets throughout the country but they are in short supply 
a diplomat from a western nation that has been trying to buy 
water tablets for relief distribution reported searching in vain 
for sufficient quantities in bangladesh and nearby countries the 
diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity 
of more than two dozen people questioned at random in shaymoli 
only one man a pharmacy shopkeeper said he was using them 
the governments health control center reported 16813 new cases 
of diarrhea wednesday bringing the total of known cases across the 
country to 119822 since aug 27 at least 83 of the afflicted 
people died and their deaths were included in the governments 
toll of flood victims 
the government says at least 25 million people have lost their 
homes in the flooding 
relief camps have been set up in an effort to help people whose 
homes were washed away or are filled with flood water but many 
other people have moved in with relatives living on rooftops or 
camping in makeshift shelters on bits of high ground 
abul hashem a 50yearold auto mechanic has been living for 
the past two weeks on the roof of a corrugated tin shed in dhaka 
he said he tried to find other shelter but relief centers where he 
went were full he and nine other men and boys pitched tents on the 
roof of sheds facing their homes 
i couldnt leave my things he said pointing to his own tin 
house where the water reached nearly to the roof there is 
nothing important there but whatever i have is mine and im afraid 
of robbers 
abul hashem and others in the neighborhood said robbers came at 
night in motorboats and looted abandoned houses and businesses 
dhaka newspapers also have reported that robbers were operating 
from boats but the government denied there had been an increase in 
breakins 
home minister abdul matin said the number of thefts had not 
increased and the only difference was that thieves were now coming 
by boat instead of land

soviet and american eskimos embraced and 
chatted excitedly in their native language as a delegation from the 
soviet far east arrived in this historic goldmining town to resume 
ties broken 40 years ago 
the soviets arrived wednesday aboard the hydrological research 
ship dmitri laptev which left the soviet coastal town of 
provideniya 24 hours earlier for a goodwill trip intended to build 
new economic and cultural contacts between the superpowers most 
remote regions 
not only do you resemble the people of provideniya you act 
like them provideniya mayor oleg kulinkin said at a luncheon 
praising nome for its hospitality 
i arrived its just like home in the first minutes there was 
the land grass the weather and most important friends he 
said 
the visit by the 11member soviet delegation and a crowd of 
soviet and foreign journalists came in response to a us 
friendship flight in june when gov steve cowper led 82 alaska 
eskimos politicians and journalists to provideniya 
immediately after the soviets debarked from tugboat here one 
soviet eskimo vasily nanok spotted distant relatives he first met 
in june 
members of the group embraced and talked excitedly in their 
native language several minutes later they were inside a store 
souvenir hunting one nome radio station broadcast an elementary 
russian language lesson 
officials of both sides said they not only hope to allow regular 
contacts among eskimos who had been cut off from relatives on 
opposite sides of the bering strait since 1948 they want to 
establish ties that will mean increased trade tourism and 
scientific cooperation 
if you have relatives you cannot help but know this will turn 
out well said nadezhda otke a member of presidium of the upreme 
soviet the countrys highest executive body this will help 
achieve peace on the entire planet 
jim stimpfle a nome businessman who began efforts to improve 
relations across the strait 2 years ago said he hoped that 
maybe some day our common border will be guarded by friendship 
alone 
the soviet delegation flew to anchorage later and were greeted 
at the airport by cowper they will be in alaskas largest city for 
a day before returning to nome and then back across the strait 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev moscow is seeking to 
form joint ventures with western companies to help modernize the 
sluggish soviet economy like alaska the soviet far east is a 
region rich in minerals but harsh and sparsely populated

dennis conners countrymile victory in the 
first americas cup race reduced the new zealand challenger yacht 
to a ship of fools says the tactician for the loser 
we go out on the track and were treated like fools because 
we go out there and we sail around the track as fast as we could in 
our boat and we have a boat ahead of us making a mockery of the 
race said peter lester new zealands tactician and alternate 
helmsman 
i must say i have lost a lot of respect for the stars amp 
stripes organization lester said at an acrimonious wednesday 
night news conference shortly after conners 60foot dualhulled 
catamaran breezed to an 18minute 15second victory over the 
kiwis monohull challenger in the opening of a bestofthree series 
the next race is scheduled for friday if new zealand were to 
win the deciding race would be sunday 
lester new zealand skipper david barnes and bruce farr 
designer of the 133foot challenger claimed conner of the san 
diego yacht club held back his arrowhulled flier by deliberately 
sailing the stars amp stripes catamaran below its potential over the 
40mile windwardleeward course 
they contended the catamaran should have beaten them by an hour 
or more had it been sailed to its potential 
asked if he dogged it conner replied im sailing a cat 
somebody else is sailing a dog

exiled soviet writer alexander solzhenitsyn has 
rejected an invitation to join an official soviet committee 
building a monument to the victims of josef stalins rule the new 
york times reported today 
the reclusive writer sent a telegram to the monuments 
organizing committee on tuesday declining to join the newspaper 
said 
solzhenitsyns masterwork the gulag archipelago traces the 
history of political repression in the soviet union and dwells at 
length on the purges and widespread repression during stalins 
29year reign 
the writer who spent eight years in labor camps under stalin 
was expelled from the soviet union after the publication of the 
gulag trilogy in the west the 1970 nobel laureate lives in 
cavendish vt 
the times said that according to the writers wife natalya the 
cable said to the memory of those who perished in 19181956 i 
have dedicated gulag archipelago for which i was rewarded with 
the accusation of treason it is not possible to pass over this 
moreover since i am located outside the country there is no 
possibility of actually participating in its civic life 
the range of time solzhenitsyn mentioned dates to the years of 
vladimir lenin who is still venerated in the soviet union 
on friday one of the projects organizers yuri samadunov said 
the invitation did not necessarily mean an easing in official 
attitudes toward solzhenitsyn but was due to the number of soviet 
citizens who think the dissident writer is among those best 
qualified to serve on the committee 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev stalin and his legacy 
have come in for increasingly severe criticism in july the ruling 
communist party politburo approved the building of a moscow 
monument to his victims 
on aug 25 a public council was formed to supervise the 
construction and maintenance of the monument as was an executive 
committee to submit a blueprint for its design 
samadunov who is on the executive committee said the members 
of the public council were chosen in street polls and from names 
submitted by readers to staterun publications 
among those selected along with solzhenitsyn were fellow 
dissident and nobel peace prize laureate andrei d sakharov poet 
yevgeny yevtushenko and boris yeltsin recently ousted as communist 
party boss in moscow

baseball coaches looking for a strategic edge 
might want to consider whether their players are lefteyed or 
righteyed a report published today suggests 
just as people prefer to use one hand over the other they tend 
to see from one eye more than the other if people are both 
righthanded and righteyed they are said to have uncrossed 
eyehand dominance but if the favored hand and eye dont match 
they have crossed dominance 
in a letter in todays new england journal of medicine drs 
jose m portal and paul e romano of the university of florida 
college of medicine described their study of eye dominance in 
baseball 
the researchers gave eye tests to ordinary people and found that 
twothirds had uncrossed eyehand dominance the rest were evenly 
split between those with crossed dominance and those who used both 
eyes equally 
however they found that members of the universitys baseball 
team were twice as likely to have crossed dominance and 50 percent 
more likely to use their eyes equally 
we think crossed dominance may aid the batter the doctors 
wrote 
they found that players with crossed dominance had batting 
averages of 310 compared with 250 for those with uncrossed 
dominance however those who saw equally from both eyes had the 
best average at 340 
since lefthanders more frequently have crossed dominance than 
righthanders they wrote crossed dominance may also help to 
explain the relative preponderance of lefthanders in professional 
baseball 
while players with uncrossed dominance are worse hitters they 
also tend to be better pitchers 
uncrossed dominance may therefore be a relative handicap to 
hitting forcing those who have it to become pitchers or it may be 
an aid to pitching they wrote 
the researchers cautioned that people should not try to change 
their dominant eye because this can cause permanent double vision 
and other eye problems and vision dominance may be inherited 
anyway 
however they said that if confirmed their findings might be 
used to guide young athletes into the sports specialties that they 
are best suited for 
more specifically they wrote since batters with crossed 
dominance seem most successful they could try a crosseddominant 
stance if righteyed bat lefthanded and if lefteyed bat 
righthanded

a former state administrator escaped 
bribery charges by pleading guilty to a misdemeanor in connection 
with a failed attempt to sell potatoes to honduras that rocked 
state politics 
it is time to put our lives back together said laurence 
mcmerty the state agriculture departments former marketing 
director it has been an awfully emotionally draining affair for 
my family 
the state agreed to drop bribery charges against mcmerty after 
he pleaded guilty wednesday to unlawful compensation for assistance 
in a government matter he faces up to one year in jail and a 
1000 fine no date for sentencing was set 
mcmerty 43 admitted taking 3200 in cash from william 
messner a miamibased middleman in the botched 1986 deal involving 
the sale of 4 million pounds of potato seed to a honduran 
cooperative mcmerty claimed the money was reimbursement for 
expenses 
the former administrator had been accused of accepting a 
caribbean cruise and up to 4000 in cash from messner and jury 
selection for a bribery trial had started in state district court 
wednesday morning before mcmerty agreed to the misdemeanor plea 
the bribery charges carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in 
prison 
i am confident and comfortable justice has been served 
deputy attorney general bruce quick said of the plea arrangement 
the bribery charges were based almost entirely on circumstantial 
evidence quick said some evidence would have indicated mcmerty 
was duped by messner at least partially he said i 
characterize this case as one of criminal bad judgment 
the case is credited with ruining the political career of 
agriculture commissioner kent jones a republican who was denied 
endorsement for a third term because of the lingering scandal 
the honduras deal collapsed after attorney general nicholas 
spaeth raised questions about its financing and the state has 
never been paid 104000 due for the only 400000pound potato 
shipment that was delivered 
jones became embroiled in the controversy when he and the former 
president of the stateowned bank of north dakota signed a 300000 
note meant to help finance the deal 
 
messner later sold the note to a miami bank for 264000 
putting 180000 of the money in his personal bank account to cover 
overdrafts the state has said 
messner pleaded guilty july 8 to bribery as part of a plea 
agreement that requires him to pay 60888 in restitution to the 
state messner who was placed on probation was in jail for six 
months prior to the plea

a vaccine is highly effective against an epidemic 
form of encephalitis that is a major health problem among children 
in parts of asia according to a report published today 
the us army study tested a vaccine used to control the 
japanese encephalitis virus although its primary victims are 
schoolage children the virus also affects travelers and military 
personnel 
encephalitis vaccine has been administered to millions of 
children in japan since the 1960s but the army study was the first 
to test the effectiveness of the most widely used versions of the 
vaccine 
at 230 per dose the vaccine is relatively expensive and 
japanese encephalitis is still a major health hazard in many parts 
of asia 
the study was conducted on 65224 children in northern thailand 
where the disease strikes 10 to 20 of every 100000 people this 
rate is similar to polio at its worst in the united states 
according to a report in the new england journal of medicine 
twothirds of youngsters received two doses of vaccine while the 
rest got dummy shots the attack rate was 5 per 100000 in those 
getting vaccine and 51 per 100000 in the comparison group 
the study directed by dr charles h hoke of the walter reed 
army institute of research in washington concludes that the vaccine 
is safe and effective 
in an accompanying editorial dr thomas p monath of the us 
centers for disease control in atlanta noted that the vaccine is 
not available to americans abroad because of its manufacturers 
concerns about liability 
however he said efforts are under way to resolve this issue 
and the us food and drug administration is reviewing applications 
to sell the vaccine in this country

babies who are vaccinated against whooping cough 
face no unusual risk of crib death as some experts had feared 
according to a major study published today 
the report was based on a review of 129834 vaccinated babies 
it found that the risk of crib death is actually lower than usual 
after the shots 
some research has suggested that babies have an increased risk 
of sudden infant death syndrome or sids immediately after 
receiving immunization for whopping cough also known as pertussis 
babies are routinely given the socalled dtp vaccine which 
protects them from diphtheria tetanus and pertussis 
the study by dr marie r griffin vanderbilt university school 
of medicine finds no support for this concern 
we conclude in this large population of children there was no 
increase in the risk of sids after immunization with the dtp 
vaccine they wrote in the new england journal of medicine 
doctors generally recommend that children receive five doses of 
the vaccine three during the first six months one after the 
first birthday and one before starting school 
crib death is considered to be the sudden unexpected death of 
an infant or young child when no specific cause of death can be 
found it is most common before the first birthday accounting for 
30 percent of all deaths in the age group 
the study was based on children born between 1974 and 1984 in 
four tennessee counties the researchers compared the risk of sids 
deaths during the first month after vaccination with the risk later 
in infancy 
they found that that during the first week after vaccination 
the risk was less than 20 percent that of later periods 
the most plausible explanation for the decreased rate of sids 
in the period immediately after immunization is that children may 
be immunized when they are in better health and that this healthier 
state is associated with a lower risk of sids they wrote

the national aeronautics and space administration has been 
informed that they are having a problem communicating with the 
spacecraft said raymond j amorose of the jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena the soviets have not asked for us 
assistance he added

mars and its moons was to have worked with nasas solar maximum 
spacecraft which has been orbiting earth for almost a decade to 
study the sun 
the two spacecraft were to view the sun at the same time from 
different angles providing the first stereoscopic images of the 
sun 
such views would allow scientist to study the narrow layer of 
hot gases on the suns surface research scientist keith strong of

a florida middleman arranging overseas 
financing for jim bakkers 172 million bid to buy back ptl has 
been convicted of fraud and has a long criminal record a 
television station reported 
the report wednesday night by wbtv in charlotte comes on the eve 
of deadlines today and friday for bakker the leading bidder for 
the embattled ministrys assets to prove he can carry through on 
his offer 
theres one complication after another sort of like a soap 
opera mc red benton ptls bankruptcy trustee said 
wednesday 
benton said he was concerned over the report that louis pihakis 
of pensacola fla was convicted of fraud and has an extensive 
criminal record pihakis has been coordinating arrangements with 
unidentified greek businessmen planning to back bakkers bid 
bakker attorney james toms said 
benton said he would meet with bakker today 
i want to find out how he feels this will affect his deal 
and hear just what his alternatives are benton said 
ryan hovis bakkers attorney in rock hill sc said pihakis 
should not become the issue in bakkers bid 
theres no scam here theres no payment to him theres 
nothing were risking on pihakis hovis said 
pihakis has never been the man with the money hovis said 
asked whether pihakis criminal record casts doubt on the 
legitimacy of the transaction toms said wednesday the only way 
to tell is to see if the money is there 
earlier this week benton extended from tuesday until today a 
deadline for bakker to present a 3 million downpayment on his 
offer and set friday as a deadline for contractual arrangements to 
be worked out 
bakker said tuesday he needed only 100000 more to reach the 3 
million but toms said wednesday night he did not know where 
bakkers total stood 
benton faces a saturday deadline to recommend a buyer for ptls 
assets to us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds the assets include 
ptls christian theme park satellite television network and 
undeveloped property near fort mill sc 
also wednesday canadian businessman peter thomas formally 
withdrew his 113 million offer for the ministrys assets but 
asked benton to reopen the bidding 
bakker resigned from ptl in march 1987 after admitting having a 
sexual encounter with church secretary jessica hahn ptl filed for 
protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code three 
months later 
wbtv said that from 1970 through 1981 pihakis who runs 
international financial consultants in pensacola was arrested or 
served time for charges including fraud mail fraud conspiracy 
forgery counterfeiting and parole violations 
the station did not say where it got its information the report 
said pihakis admitted to the station that he served eight months in 
jail during that time on charges he said were trumpedup 
pihakis home telephone number is unlisted and he could not be 
reached for comment 
toms told the associated press in a telephone invterview 
wednesday night that neither bakker nor his lawyers knew the 
identity of the greek businessmen 
he said they are relying on the word of longtime bakker friend 
and chicago businessman jerry sinclair who led bakker to pihakis 
and has acted as a middleman between them toms described pihakis 
as the us representative for the greek businessmen 
sinclair who declined to say what his business is but was 
identified by toms as a songwriter told the ap in a telephone 
interview from fort mill that he was aware that pihakis had a 
criminal record but he did not know how extensive it was 
sinclair said he has had verification which did not come 
through pihakis that the greek financing is forthcoming 
as long as adverse publicity about pihakis does not scare away a 
midwest bank that has agreed to handle the greek funds the deal 
should go through in a matter of days sinclair said

a man who became a lawabiding shop 
owner after escaping from prison 17 years ago on a manslaughter 
conviction says he can accept the states recommendation to send 
him back behind bars for six months 
the state pardon board refused wednesday to recommend immediate 
freedom for henry staggs of columbia tenn who fled louisiana 
soon after beginning a 15year sentence for the 1969 shooting death 
of a nightclub bouncer 
staggs should serve six months in prison followed by five years 
of supervised parole the board decided after a threehour hearing 
and three hours of deliberations the final decision rests with 
gov buddy roemer who is in japan on an economic development trip 
appearing before the board on his 41st birthday staggs said 
that living as a fugitive while running a business and raising a 
family inflicted more punishment on myself than the state of 
louisiana could possibly have done 
thats one of the things that has kept eating at my insides 
he said id be watching a ball game and the police would drive 
by or somebody would pull up in the driveway my stomach would tie 
up in a knot 
his life as douglas gillette an auto repair shop owner who 
enjoyed a reputation as a hardworking lawabiding family man 
ended on feb 5 when fbi agents arrested him at his business in 
columbia 
staggs attorney thomas watson of nashville had asked the 
board to recommend a pardon or a commutation of the remainder of 
the sentence 
watson told the board that petitions bearing the names of 2000 
tennessee residents asking that staggs be pardoned had been sent to 
louisiana authorities 
there was a henry staggs who killed a man 20 years ago and 
escaped watson said then theres a doug gillette its 
almost like theyre two separate people 
in 1970 staggs escaped from the louisiana correctional and 
industrial school in dequincy where he was serving time for the 
shooting death of george ballas a nightclub bouncer in port allen 
i cannot undo what happened the night of dec 3 1969 and i 
must live with that nightmare the rest of my life staggs told 
the board he said he remembered almost nothing of the killing 
blaming it on alcoholism that developed while he served in the us 
army in korea during the 1960s 
i can live with it staggs said of the boards decision 
my family can live with it not much compared to 15 years 
the decision announced by pardon board chairman yvonne g 
campbell after a threehour hearing and another three hours of 
deliberations by the panel brought sobs and tears from staggs 
wife and mother 
ive got to get home ive got to see my kids staggs told 
reporters his wife bridget has said she knew nothing of her 
husbands past before his arrest 
staggs was allowed to remain free on 3500 bond pending 
resolution of the case 
authorities in west baton rouge parish where the killing took 
place opposed the clemency application but no one appeared at the 
hearing to ask that staggs request be denied watson said no 
family members of the victim had been located

the captain of delta flight 1141 exclaimed were 
not going to make it 11 seconds before the jet crashed upon 
takeoff a partial transcript of the cockpit voice recording shows 
the pilots discovered their aircraft was in serious trouble 
about 21 seconds before the plane struck the ground the dallas 
times herald reported today 
the plane crashed at dallasfort worth international airport 
aug 31 while taking off on a flight for salt lake city the boeing 
727 exploded and broke apart upon impact killing 13 of the 108 
people on board the pilots were injured but survived 
the partial transcript obtained wednesday by the newspaper 
shows that approximately nine seconds after what appeared to be a 
normal takeoff a cockpit alarm indicated the jet was not able to 
gather enough speed to stay aloft 
a second later capt larry davis said somethings wrong 
ohhh one of the final entries on the transcript appears to be a 
scream 
national transportation safety board investigators said last 
week that the cockpit recording indicates there were two compressor 
stalls or disruptions of air flow one each in two of the engines 
the transcript however notes five possible compressor stalls 
within six seconds a set of two followed within seconds by three 
more the newspaper reported 
after the first two stalls were noted copilot carey kirkland 
said engine failure 
just after the three possible stalls were noted someone in the 
cockpit said we got an engine failure 
three seconds later davis said were not gonna make it 
at that point someone attempted to communicate something to the 
tower saying only elevenforty ones 
davis then exclaimed full power 
kirkland followed with unintelligible words just a fraction of a 
second before what is believed to be the sound of impact is heard 
on the recording 
the recording then ends with a possible scream 
ntsb investigators say they have not been able to determine 
whether any compressor stalls actually occurred the engines are to 
be tested at the pratt amp whitney manufacturing plant in hartford 
conn 
one ntsb investigator who asked not to be named told the 
newspaper it is possible for engines to experience several quick 
successive stalls 
lee dickinson jr a member of the ntsb board said i dont 
know that we can even identify that there were indeed stalls 
the significance of the stalls and more importantly what caused 
them is the key element in the investigation into the cause of the 
crash 
ntsb spokesman mike benson declined in washington to comment on 
the partial transcript obtained by the newspaper 
it will be months before investigators pinpoint the cause of the 
crash but two primary suspects have emerged they are wing flaps 
desinged to give the plane lift and engine problems during the 
flight 
however the fort worth startelegram reported that friends of 
davis said he told them the plane suffered an engine failure 
one friend mj hamilton quoted the pilot as saying i had 
an engine failure i put the throttle forward and it wouldnt fly 
the transcript reveals that flight engineer steven judd and 
copilot kirkland went through a standard preparation checklist 
kirkland told judd that the flaps were extended in the correct 
position for normal takeoff during the checklist less than a minute 
before the plane received permission for takeoff 
davis is recuperating in hospital from back and head injuries 
suffered in the crash and has not spoken with ntsb investigators 
yet he underwent surgery tuesday to repair compound fractures in 
his cheekbone and has been fitted with a back brace for a broken 
vertebra said delta spokeswoman jackie pate 
kirkland has told the ntsb he does not remember the crash judd 
has been interviewed by ntsb investigators both men were treated 
and released from hospitals for minor injuries

a couple have charged in a lawsuit that a 
florida hospital exchanged their healthy baby for a congenitally 
ill one a decade ago to facilitate an adoption 
ernest and regina i twigg said blood tests and sophisticated 
tissuetesting at a johns hopkins university immunogenetics 
laboratory in baltimore prove that the child they raised for nearly 
10 years was not theirs 
the child arlena twigg died of a congenital heart illness in 
august 
the twiggs on wednesday filed a 100 million suit against hardee 
memorial hospital in wauchula fla three physicians and a nurse 
accusing them of fraud and negligence 
the suit charges that the defendants swapped id bracelets and 
altered hospital records to exchange the babies 
dr ernest palmer a family physician from wauchula who was 
named in the suit said wednesday i certainly wouldnt switch 
babies on anyone but i guess you can be sued by anyone 
harold connelly hospital administrator said he had no 
knowledge of the suit and was surprised by the allegations 
in papers filed in us district court in tampa fla the 
couple alleges that hospital records show their daughter was born 
healthy in 1978 with opositive blood but before leaving the 
hospital mrs twiggs said the child was diagnosed as having a 
severe heart defect that proved fatal 
mrs twigg said she recalls a nurse telling her that another 
woman had given birth at the hospital the same day and intended to 
offer the child for adoption 
what else could this be except for a case involving a payment 
for delivery of a healthy child as opposed to a baby with a birth 
defect said marvin ellin the couples lawyer 
were totally devastated said mrs twigg who lives with 
her husband and seven surviving children in langhorne pa our 
lives have turned into a nightmare weve not only lost our arlena 
but also where is our own daughter were very much interested 
in tracking down our own child 
the twiggs said that when arlena was admitted to a hospital 
earlier this year preoperative tests showed that her blood type 
was bpositive which would be almost impossible if she were the 
child of the twiggs both type o 
more sophisticated tissuematching tests concluded that the 
child was unrelated to the couple said ellin 
dr wilma bias who performed the test declined comment

made in an interview in wednesdays the union leader of manchester 
as silly insulting and irresponsible 
mrs tamposi a millionaire officer in her fathers real estate 
company is married and has two daughters ages 22 months and 4 
they are cared for by a nanny 
state sen george freese said humphrey should be apologizing 
to betty tamposi for such remarks they are belowthebelt comments 
and a personal attack on bettys credibility and excellent 
reputation 
i dont retract a word of it humphrey said its 
selfevident that you cannot work 12 to 14 hours a day in congress 
and have time left over for a child 
its difficult enough being a father of a young child and a 
member of congress as i am said humphrey who has a 3yearold 
son for the mother who in our society is the primary care 
giver working 1012 hours a day makes it impossible to give the 
nurturing the child would need 
clark dumont a tamposi aide laid the blame on tamposis rival 
chuck douglas the two are the frontrunners among six candidates 
seeking the republican nomination for the seat being vacted by gop 
rep judd gregg 
i have no choice but to look that senator humphrey is 
supporting candidate douglas certainly there must be some 
relationship there i have to imagine that they are talking 
dumont said 
dumont said the comments were the lowest attack ever 
experienced in new hampshire politics 
douglas denied having anything to do with humphreys comments 
and defended tamposis candidacy 
its tougher when you have small kids he said thats 
true of me or anybody else who has small kids but that doesnt 
mean you cant do the job i have never said betty cant serve in 
congress with small kids 
however douglas said humphrey is entitled to his opinion

us businesses plan to increase capital 
spending by 116 percent this year a fivefold increase over 1987 
the government said today 
the commerce department said the increase if realized would be 
the biggest advance since 1984 when spending shot up 166 percent 
as american industry recovered from the steep 198182 recession 
the advance would push business investment to expand and 
modernize production facilities up to a record high of 4294 
billion after adjusting for the effects of inflation 
the boom in capital investment this year has been one of the 
main forces driving the economic expansion as businesses have 
stepped up investment plans in response to heavy demand 
the demand is coming in large part from a rebound in us 
exports as a decline in the dollar since 1985 has helped 
manufacturers regain lost overseas markets 
the latest estimate of business investment plans is based on an 
industry survey conducted over the last two months 
it represented only a small change from a june report which 
estimated spending would rise 119 percent this year both the june 
and september surveys however reflected a substantial increase 
from an initial industry projection for a 73 percent increase in 
investment that estimate was made at the end of last year 
in 1987 investment spending rose a modest 23 percent after 
having fallen 39 percent in 1986 
the weakness in those years was blamed on the soaring us trade 
deficit as a flood of imports reduced domestic demand for us 
goods at the same time american firms were being priced out of 
overseas markets 
for 1988 manufacturing firms expect to boost spending by 125 
percent with plants making nondurable goods projecting an increase 
of 132 percent and companies manufacturing durable goods expecting 
an 117 percent increase 
in other sectors the report predicted an increase of 124 
percent in capital investment by transportation companies 
including airlines and a 55 percent advance in the mining 
industry this sector which includes oil and gas drilling had 
seen investment plummet 32 percent in 1986 and a further 2 percent 
in 1987 as oil companies cut back on exploration in the face of 
declining oil prices 
before removing the effects of inflation business investment is 
projected to rise by 106 percent this year to 4309 billion 
following an increase of 27 percent in 1987

the shooting down of an afghan air 
force jet by pakistani fighter pilots over pakistan has fueled a 
growing dispute between the two countries 
pakistani defense officials said the afghan plane was on a 
bombing raid and that it was the third time sovietbuilt aircraft 
with afghan markings have bombed pakistani territory in the past 
week 
the kabul government has denied the accusations and accused 
pakistan of sending a reconnaissance plane over its territory 
pakistani officials said today they still did not know the fate 
or nationality of the pilot who apparently ejected when a pakistan 
air force f16 shot him down wednesday near nawagai about 12 miles 
from the afghan border 
the defense ministry said four planes believed to be mig23s 
were intercepted by a pakistani air patrol after they had bombed 
two locations across the border injuring 12 people 
afghan planes which in the past have only darted over the 
border to bomb afghan rebel and refugee camps struck more than 30 
miles into pakistani territory on sept 1 and 5 
the foreign ministry lodged strong protests telling kabul 
that if such attacks do not cease the entire responsibility for 
the serious consequences will rest on the kabul authorities 
afghanistans marxist government called the pakistani 
allegations lies 
kabuls foreign ministry countered on wednesday by claiming that 
a pakistani air force jet had intruded into afghan airspace and 
carried out a reconnaissance flight 
at least four afghan or soviet aircraft have been shot down over 
pakistani territory since moslem insurgents began battling the 
government in 1978 
on aug 4 pakistan shot down an intruding soviet su25 
fighterbomber near the border the soviet pilot was handed over to 
his embassy in islamabad on aug 17 
defense minister mahmood haroon told the senate on wednesday 
that pakistan still was seeking to acquire a sophisticated airborne 
early warning radar system to protect its rugged frontier region 
where groundbased radar is blinded by high mountain peaks 
islamabad has approached washington about two different air 
platform systems but has not filed a formal request 
us government officials reportedly have stalled pakistan for 
fear the systems might escalate tensions with afghanistan on the 
west and india to the east 
moscow and kabul accuse pakistan of violating the april 14 
soviet pullout accord by continuing to supply the rebels with 
mainly american arms but under the pact the superpowers tacitly 
agreed to continue aiding their respective sides until one of them 
stops 
the result has been an escalation of guerrilla attacks as the 
soviets turn the war increasingly over to afghanistans demoralized 
army 
septembers bold air strikes appear to be testing islamabads 
resolve following the death last month of the guerrillas sponsor 
president mohammad zia ulhaq 
meanwhile in nicosia cyprus the united nations mediator for 
afghanistan reported today that more than half the estimated 
115000 soviet troops in afghanistan have pulled out and the 
withdrawal is proceeding in a very satisfactory manner 
the envoy diego cordovez told reporters during the nonaligned 
movements foreign ministers conference that about 80 percent of 
afghan territory has no foreign troops any more 
but he added that the soviet withdrawal has not yet resulted in 
any significant return of the millions of afghan refugees who 
fled to neighboring countries during the nineyear soviet 
occupation

showered with confetti by antinuclear 
campaigners the first us cruise missiles to leave western europe 
under the superpower arms control treaty were flown out of britain 
today less than a year after they arrived 
good riddance dont come back shouted the protesters 
outside the us air base at molesworth 50 miles north of london 
as two of the 18 cruise missiles the most recent to be deployed in 
britain were driven away aboard camouflaged mobile launchers 
the vehicles headed to the nearby base at alconbury where the 
missiles were put aboard a c141 aircraft and the launchers aboard a 
galaxy c5 
the two giant transport planes took off at 2 pm 9 am edt 
for a 12hour nonstop flight with midair refueling to davis 
monthan air force base in arizona for destruction under soviet 
supervision 
the small group of antinuclear campaigners watched the missiles 
on board two 55foot transporters lumber through the gates and 
across the flat cambridgeshire countryside for the last time the 
protesters carried banners saying this is only the first step 
this is something we have been working for for nine years 
said meg beresford secretary of the campaign for nuclear 
disarmament 
at molesworth us ambassador to britain charles h price ii 
hailed the missile departure as an achievement for the unity of the 
16nation nato alliance referring to the protesters said we 
are not here because some individuals wellintentioned and 
innocent of the worlds realities kept vigils at our bases 
the credit also belongs in part to soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev who bargained in good faith to accept the wisdom of 
president reagans zerooption and acted upon it said price 
reagan and gorbachev signed the agreement in washington last 
dec 8 
british defense secretary george younger said the missiles 
treaty was a stinging rebuke to the protesters 
the russians must show that they are prepared to change in a 
very real way their offensive military posture younger said 
there is i regret to say no sign of them doing this so far 
younger did not rule out speculation that molesworth built at a 
cost of 765 million specifically to take 64 missiles may be 
equipped with runways for the us air force to deploy 
nuclearcapable f111 bombers 
younger said no new landbased weapons would be introduced 
missile deployment at molesworth began last november four years 
after the first us cruise missiles deployed in europe arrived at 
greenham common another us air base in britain 
no date has been set for the removal of 96 cruise missiles at 
greenham 
officials said all molesworths missiles would be gone in three 
months 
the intermediate nuclear forces treaty ratified by the senate 
in june set a 1991 deadline for the superpowers to eliminate their 
2700 landbased missiles from europe the missiles have a range of 
about 300 to 3000 miles 
the first us missiles to leave western europe under the 
agreement were nine pershing 2 mediumrange weapons removed sept 
1 from a base near stuttgart west germany 
the soviet union began removing its mediumrange missiles from 
czechoslovakia and east germany in february

a wellknown soviet historian says leonid i 
brezhnev suffered clinical death in 1976 and was so weakened 
for the last six years of his rule that it wa difficult for him to 
perform simple duties or understand what was going on around him 
roy medvedev in an article published in this weeks edition of 
the moscow news painted a picture of a leader in such bad health 
that his aides took over most of his functions 
brezhnev had the first serious problems with his health in 
19691970 medvedev wrote at the beginning of 1976 he had a 
clinical death doctors managed to revive him but for the next 
three months he couldnt work as his speech and abilities to think 
were impaired 
the brezhnev era has been under increasing attack lately 
the moscow news article appeared at the same time brezhnevs 
soninlaw yuri churbanov and eight codefendants went on trial 
faced with several charges involving corruption and bribery 
medvedev a frequent commentator on soviet history also said 
brezhnev possessed no outstanding characteristics and was pushed 
into the countrys top leadership job 
medvedev is the author of let history judge a celebrated 
indictment of josef stalins rule he was expelled from the 
communist party after a letter he wrote appeared in an emigre 
journal with his brother zhores who lives in london he also has 
written a piercing criticism of stalins successor nikita s 
khrushchev 
although he never challenged the authority of the communist 
party medvedev was on the outs with officials during the brezhnev 
period stateowned publications began printing his works just this 
year under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness 
in the six years before his death on nov 10 1982 medvedev 
said brezhnev was constantly attended by a group of doctors 
they were always on duty at those places where he used to 
stay there were specially equipped medical laboratories the 
historian said in the article 
medvedev said brezhnevs working day was cut to a few hours 
after his brush with death and his vacations expanded from one to 
two annually 
the state of health of our leaders is not a topic dicussed in 
the press but his brezhnevs progressing illness was evident to 
everyone who saw him on television the article said 
naturally brezhnevs illness affected his abilities to rule 
the country he often interrupted fulfillment of his duties and let 
his personal aides take over the article said 
medvedev said the public eventually lost respect for brezhnev 
because of occasional public appearances during which the leader 
had to be supported under each arm the historian blamed many 
influential and corrupted people from his close circle for the 
publics loss of confidence in their leader 
they managed to achieve the worst medvedev said namely 
that the old age and illness of a soviet leader became an object 
not of sympathy among citizens but of open ridicule and 
irritation 
brezhnev was plagued with health problems for the final 12 years 
of his rule but even as a younger healthier man he lacked 
outstanding qualities medvedev wrote 
brezhnev was not a great or even outstanding man if i were 
asked to characterize him in a few words i would say he was weak 
in almost all spheres of his personality medvedev said

south korea is improving its human rights record 
but holds about 600 political prisoners and torture still occurs 
amnesty international said today 
the international human rights group urged the seoul government 
to make further improvements it called for the release of 
political prisoners an end to torture and other illtreatment of 
detainees and changes in laws to allow peaceful expression of 
opposition to the government 
the report comes a week before the opening of the olympic games 
in seoul 
in a report called detention of prisoners of conscience and 
torture continue amnesty international noted that major 
political changes since last summer have ushered in some 
improvements in the human rights area 
the government of president roh taewoo came into power after 
roh then chairman of the ruling party pledged a package of 
democratic reforms including release of political prisoners in 
response to violent demonstrations in june 1987 
there have been releases and amnesties but we think theyve 
been too few the group said 
while the government says nearly 1300 political prisoners have 
been released since last year amnesty international claims the 
number is 400 the human rights group also said 4000 former 
political prisoners civil rights have been restored in this 
period about half the number claimed by the government 
the report said arrests on political grounds have continued 
with about 600 people imprisoned for political or trade union 
activities 
among the 600 amnesty international is calling for the release 
of 28 it has adopted as prisoners of conscience and is 
investigating the cases of another 70 
the group defines prisoners of conscience as those detained 
for belief color sex ethnic origin language or religion 
provided they havent used or advocated violence students who 
threw rocks in demonstrations could not be considered an official 
said 
while constitutional amendments have strengthened laws 
protecting the rights of prisoners in practice these rights are 
still not always respected amnesty international said 
government sensitivity to world attention during the sept 17 to 
oct 2 olympic games may help improve the situation but the games 
do not guarantee changes a representative of the group said 
the researcher said that in the longterm of course the 
attention of the whole world matters but things have changed 
very quickly in korea we just dont know what might happen after 
the games 
the researcher insisted on anonymity saying it was amnesty 
international policy

afghan refugees are to be trained to dispose of 
the thousands of land mines left by soviet and government forces 
during the war in afghanistan a un official said today 
the proposed program by the un office coordinating aid for 
afghanistan also calls for public information campaigns to warn 
women and children who return home about the danger of mines 
planted in afghan fields and roads 
the first step is to train one or two returnees per village to 
have some idea of how to defuse a mine and dispose of it said 
the official an aide to the chief of the genevabased office 
prince sadruddin aga khan the official spoke on condition he not 
be identified by name 
the number of mines littering the afghan countryside is 
estimated at hundreds of thousands to several million the aide 
said 
using posters and radio programs the campaign would try to 
inform as many as possible on the hazards so women and children 
would be able to recognize a mine and not for example pick it 
up he said 
another aspect would be first aid training since there will 
unfortunately always be people blown up by mines he added 
two basic types of mines were used in afghanistan traditional 
antitank devices placed on roads mountain passes or around 
garrisons and smaller antipersonnel mines designed to maim people 
millions of afghans fled to neighboring countries such as 
pakistan and iran to escape the decadelong fighting between the 
sovietbacked kabul government and moslem guerrillas seeking its 
overthrow 
the afghan government says 150000 refugees have returned home 
since the signing of the unsponsored afghanistan accord last

plants has been picked to head the tennessee valley authoritys 
troubled nuclear program 
kingsley 45 succeeds steven a white 59 a retired admiral

president of nuclear power at the government utility tva chairman 
marvin runyon appointed kingsley on wednesday 
kingsley vice president of nuclear operations for systems 
energy resources inc in jackson miss will join tva on oct 1 
heading a program still recovering from a 2year shutdown forced 
by safety concerns 
kingsley who helped turn around farley nuclear plant in alabama 
and grand gulf nuclear plant in mississippi said thoroughness is 
the key to fixing a nuclear plant 
youve got to meet all the regulatory commitments said 
kingsley youve got to ensure youve got the right people in the 
right jobs and they have to be trained and then you go about that 
in a very methodical way 
tvas nuclear operation has problems as do most nuclear 
operations today said kingsley also a former navy man but 
admiral white has brought us a long way toward recovery and i fully 
intend to carry on that recovery 
white who was hired to turn the troubled nuclear section 
around spent more than 1 billion to rejuvenate the program which 
was shut down in august 1985 because of safety concerns about its 
five licensed reactors

has returned to operation and unit 1 is scheduled for restart this 
month unit 2 at browns ferry nuclear plant near athens ala is 
expected to be back on line by spring

expires to be with his family in charlottesville va 
the retired admiral who once headed the navys nuclear submarine 
program has been under fire from congressional staffers critical of 
tvas nuclear program 
the us department of justice is investigating claims by the 
nuclear regulatory commission that white lied in 1986 when he told 
the nrc that tvas unlicensed watts bar nuclear plant near spring 
city tenn met certain safety standards 
white has denied the charges and gerald charnoff an attorney 
for tva said he expects the investigation to be dismissed soon 
kingsley will receive 77300 a year the maximum for federal 
employees runyon said he will be eligible for performance bonuses 
that could increase his income to more than 200000 annually 
white was hired on a consulting basis allowing his pay to 
exceed the limit 
kingsley retired from the navy in 1971 to join alabama power co 
as senior engineer in nuclear production 
he became manager at farley in 1977 and took a similar position 
at grand gulf in 1984 improving the mississippi power and light 
co plant from one of the lowestrated facilities in the south to 
one of the highest 
tva was created by the government during the depression to help 
bring electricity to the rural south

woodbury ny democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd 
bentsen told long island businessmen today that america will pay 
the price for the huge federal budget deficits of the reagan 
administration 
but the former houston insurance executive said the democratic 
ticket understands the needs of business and will fight the 
deficits with frugal management and an aggressive trade policy 
during this election youre going to hear a lot about a 
fiveyeareconomic boom he said referring to the current 
expansion but he said accomplishing that was no trick when the 
government was writing hot checks with deficits of more than 
150 billion a year 
if you listen to this administration you would think they are 
fiscal conservatives he said but they have not submitted one 
balanced budget 
were all going to pay the price for this borrowandspend 
philosophy he said 
bentsen received a polite reception from the largely republican 
long island association at the breakfast 
but he got a hearty hand when he said evacuation plans for 
nuclear plants should be made at the local level the reagan 
administration has said the federal government can make those 
plans a controversial stand on long island where the long island 
lighting companys shoreham nuclear plant has been kept from 
starting operations for five years because of dispute over whether 
long island could ever by successfully evacuated in case of an 
accident 
bentsen arrived on long island after weeks of concentrating in 
his native texas and the south to begin a threeday 
coasttocoast campaign trip today with a taste of the food and 
money available in new york 
after his long island speech he was heading to manhattan for a 
fundraiser for his senate campaign he held another senate 
campaign fundraiser tuesday night in connecticut 
texas law allows bentsen to run for both the senate and the vice 
presidency he says hes doing that because dropping out of the 
senate race would automatically hand his seat to a republican 
the carnegie delicatessan was on bentsens schedule this 
afternoon the deli featured in woddy allens movie broadway 
danny rose is famous for huge helpings of pastrami tongue and 
corned beef 
both bentsen and presidential candidate michael dukakis are 
slated to speak at a gala 5 million democratic party fundraiser 
in manhattan tonight it was expected to be the largest single 
fundraising event in the partys history 
then for bentsen its off to iowa and califorinia on friday and 
saturday before returning to washington on sunday 
bentsen has stopped in texas on every other campaign swing he 
has taken since being named to the ticket as his home state with 
its 29 electoral votes could swing the election bentsen was in 
texas earlier this week and he plans to campaign there again next 
week 
recent polls show the democrats trailing the republicans 
slightly in texas where george bush also claims residence 
the senate returned from its summer recess this week and both 
bentsen and his gop counterpart sen dan quayle of indiana were 
in washington on wednesday to attend to business there 
bentsen told reporters that it will be difficult for the 
congress to do its work given the partisan political atmosphere 
theres no question that its complicating the process he 
said 
bentsen renewed his criticism of president reagans veto of a 
defense bill recently as an attempt to help bush youre going to 
see more and more of that im afraid he said

democrat michael dukakis called for 
strengthening americas nonnuclear conventional forces today in a 
speech that won a warm reception from an american legion convention 
dukakis praised president reagan for signing the ussoviet 
treaty banning intermediaterange nuclear missiles and he lauded 
the war record and patriotism of republican presidential rival 
george bush both men had been received in friendly fashion by the 
veterans group earlier this week 
however dukakis criticized the administration in connection 
with its spending on veterans programs and he suggested the 
national debt which has risen sharply during the reagan 
administration would cramp efforts to build up the nations 
military might 
after eight years and 2 trillion we still dont have an 
antitank weapon that can stop modern soviet tanks dukakis said 
we cannot build a strong national defense on a mountain of debt 
dukakis gave no specifics on his plans to improve conventional 
forces and said at a news conference later that he would give 
details next week 
also at the news conference dukakis said he would support 
deployment of the spacebased strategic defense initiative if 
research proved it would work and if it was determined to be in the 
national interest 
however when questioned on the issue dukakis said deployment 
of sdi would be a violation of the 1972 antiballistic missile 
treaty with the soviet union and he did not want to scrap that pact 
i think it is in our best interest to observe that treaty 
dukakis said for our own sake we have to continue with 
research 
dukakis said he was not worried about a new abcwashington post 
poll showing him behind bush by 8 percentage points 
i dont think were slipping and i dont think were in 
disarray he said 
wednesday night in baltimore dukakis promised a jewish group 
that he would provide generous aid to israel while he attacked 
the republicans for selling weapons to its middle east enemies 
lloyd bentsen and i are going to say no to arab shopping 
lists that endanger the security of israel dukakis said 
in interviews with louisville television stations wednesday 
night dukakis said his call for a tough strong lean defense 
will be tempered by the need for a strong economy 
speaking wednesday to a convention of bnai brith the 
democratic presidential nominee referred repeatedly to his wife 
who is jewish and gave a new years greeting in hebrew as he tried 
to demonstrate a sensitivity to jewish culture and concerns 
the massachusetts governor drew cheers when he told the 
convention that in a dukakis administration there will be no 
trips to bitburg referring to president reagans visit to a west 
german cemetery where members of the nazi ss were buried 
as dukakis was finishing his speech in baltimore his campaign 
vice chairman john sasso was meeting in new york with jesse 
jackson whose support for the palestinians has angered american 
jews 
dukakis press secretary dayton duncan said he had no details on 
the meeting between sasso and jackson 
in his bnai brith speech which came shortly after one 
delivered by republican presidential nominee george bush dukakis 
referred only in passing to the palestinian uprising in israels 
occupied territories on the west bank and said that as president he 
would not recognize a unilateral declaration of a palestinian 
state 
he pledged continued us aid to israel which he praised as a 
special place committed to peace 
from the day of israels rebirth four decades ago we 
americans have understood that israels fate is our fate he said 
were going to continue to help israel defend itself by 
providing generous levels of military and economic aid dukakis 
said 
however he singled out dan quayle the republican vice 
presidential nominee for voting in congress against packages 
aiding israel and faulted republicans for selling aircraft and 
missiles to other nations in the middle east 
the republicans have sold awacs to saudi arabia mavericks to 
kuwait stingers to bahrain and billions of additional dollars 
worth of sophisticated arms to arab countries that refuse to make 
peace with israel dukakis said mr bush has supported those 
sales and dan quayle has voted for them 
we will not sell weapons that would threaten the security of 
israel to any nation dukakis said and we will work to 
persuade our nato allies to join us in that policy

cosmonauts just returned from a problemplagued 
space mission described cramped quarters food and water shortages 
and equipment problems but did not address questions about their 
performance a tass dispatch indicated today 
the government newspaper izvestia had suggested wednesday that 
the commander of the soyuz tm5 capsule stranded in orbit for a 
day may have worsened equipment problems by not following proper 
emergency procedures 
the capsule carrying commander vladimir lyakhov and the first 
afghan in space abdul ahad mohmand landed safely early wednesday 
in the central asian republic of kazakhstan 
at a news conference today for soviet and afghan reporters at 
the baikonur space center near the landing site the cosmonauts 
said they had only 105 cubic feet between them 
they were stuck in the capsule for 26 hours 
immobility was the biggest problem tass the official news 
agency reported 
the cosmonauts had an emergency supply of food and water but 
decided not to use it until absolutely necessary tass said 
other reports have said the capsule had no toilet virtually no 
room to move around and enough air for only two days 
the spacemen were asked about problems that forced postponement 
of their reentry after their capsule undocked tuesday from the 
orbiting space station mir 
during the first landing attempt undertaken on sept 6 
everything went as scheduled tass quoted lyakhov as saying 
but 30 seconds before the engine startup there occurred a 
disruption in the operation of the infrared vertical sensor the 
computer was unable to judge whether the spacecraft was correctly 
oriented and the engine was shut off 
the engine lyakhov referred to is supposed to brake the capsule 
so it can safely pass through the atmosphere 
the cosmonaut said a second attempt to fire the engine was made 
later but that it slowed the capsule too much and the burn was 
terminated landing was put off until wednesday 
tass did not report any comments by the crew at the news 
conference about their performance 
the newspaper said reporters asked deputy flight chief viktor 
blagov whether the commander failed to follow proper procedure 
during the second landing attempt 
izvestia quoted blagov as saying we still must painstakingly 
study the whole situation 
blagov said backup landing sites could have been used so there 
was no rush to fire the reentry engine then appearing to defend 
lyakhov he said it could be understood in a purely human way 
why the commander wanted to land at the designated time and place 
lyakhov had said in a capsuleside interview broadcast on 
television wednesday that he and mohmand had wanted to make a third 
attempt at landing on tuesday but that the craft might have touched 
down outside soviet territory he said the crew preferred to wait 
until landing could be assured in kazakhstan 
lyakhov a 47yearold veteran military pilot flew in space for 
175 days in 1979 and 150 days in 1983 
the public questioning of a cosmonauts performance was highly 
unusual in the soviet space program it reflected the more open 
discussion of problems encouraged by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev under his policy of glasnost

the skipper of the uss vincennes was warned 
that a plane approaching the ship july 3 might be a commercial 
airliner but he ordered the ships missiles fired in the mistaken 
belief it was an iranian f14 navy investigators told congress 
today 
the warning was called out by one of the officers in the 
confusion of the combat center on the vincennes the investigators 
said capt will c rogers waved his hand in acknowledgement of the 
warning 
but other factors most of them human errors by crew members 
made under stress led rogers to erroneously conclude that the 
plane approaching his ship was an iranian military jet that had 
just taken off from a militarycivilian airfield at bandar abbas 
iran air flight 655 which had flown out of the same airfield 
was shot down by two missiles from the vincennes in the strait of 
hormuz killing all 292 persons aboard 
rear adm william m fogarty head of the navy investigating 
team said his probe had turned up a number of mistakes by the 
vincennes crew 
among those mistakes were erroneously concluding that the plane 
was descending rather than climbing and that the plane was outside 
a civilian air corridor 
fogarty outlined to the senate armed services committee the 
report released by the pentagon three weeks ago 
there was no criticism of rogers among panel members 
the easiest thing any of us can do is secondguess and thats 
not what we want to do said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
the vincennes is a 1 billion aegisclass cruiser equipped with 
the navys most sophisticated air defense system 
navy investigators attributed the incident to human errors made 
under stress and during the fog of war they said navy officers 
misread data from the aegis system and gave mistaken information to 
rogers 
a public version of the report was released three weeks ago a 
classified version has also been sent to capitol hill 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said many of the questions surrounding the incident had been 
answered by the fogarty investigation 
but we want a chance to talk to him in person and ask some 
questions nunn explained i think we are going to be looking 
at how the aegis system performed how the weapons on board 
performed and other secondary questions like that 
the fogarty investigation found that the aegis system worked as 
designed 
overall i think im pretty sympathetic to the plight of the 
captain and i think theres a lot of sympathy for him here given 
the compressed time frame for making a decision and given the other 
constraints of operating a bluewater ship in a brownwater 
environment nunn said 
he was referring to using the vincennes which was designed for 
largescale openocean situations in the small crowded persian 
gulf the ship was on duty as part of the reagan administration 
policy of protecting tankers in the gulf 
nunns comments echoed statements made by top pentagon officers 
last month when the report was released 
adm william crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said that given the confusion surrounding an earlier fight between 
the vincennes and iranian gunboats capt rogers acted reasonably 
and did what his nation expected of him in the defense of his ship 
and crew 
crowe called the airliners destruction a byproduct of the 
8yearold iraniraq war the two nations are now negotiating 
through the united nations to end the conflict 
the vincennes was to leave from the persian gulf last sunday 
but its departure has been postponed until us officials have been 
assured there is no longer a need for us tanker escorts in the 
region 
the vincennes withdrawal from the carrier battle group in the 
arabian sea would reduce the american naval force in the region 
from 27 to 26 warships the first reduction since the iraniraq 
ceasefire officially went into effect aug 15 
the pentagon says the us fleet will be scaled back if the 
ceasefire holds but it has given no timetable and other ships in 
the force are still being replaced on schedule

george bush today watched the destruction of us missile stages 
as part of a ussoviet treaty and called it a moment when the 
tides of history turned michael dukakis blended economic and 
military messages telling the american legion the nation cant 
build defense on a mountain of debt 
bush the republican presidential nominee flew to texas to 
watch the missile engines destroyed today as democrat dukakis got a 
warm reception from the veterans group in louisville ky 
the night before in baltimore the presidential rivals stressed 
concern for israel while sharply criticizing each other bush said 
dukakis waffles on creation of a palestinian state and dukakis 
accused the republican ticket of supporting the sale of arms to 
israels foes 
bush at the pershing missileengine destruction said it was 
the day we began to reverse the arms race one of those unique 
moments in the career of man a moment when the tides of history 
turned that a new future dawned 
he joined other us and soviet officials at the longhorn army 
ammunition plant to see destruction of the engines which are part 
of the 859 weapons the united states has agreed to destory over the 
next three years under the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
the soviet union has already destroyed several of its 
counterpart ss20 missiles 
dukakis speaking today to the american legion one day after 
bush addressed the group said the united states must improve its 
conventional nonnuclear forces 
after eight years and 2 trillion we still dont have an 
antitank weapon that can stop modern soviet tanks dukakis said 
the democratic presidential nominee who has frequently 
criticized the reagan administration for allowing the national debt 
to soar said we cannot build a strong national defense on a 
mountain of debt 
both candidates made their cases wednesday as advocates of 
israel while addressing the convention of bnai brith the jewish 
service organization 
strength works better than weakness if you want to get both 
peace and security bush said 
he said he opposes creation of a palestinian state but believes 
palestinians must be involved at every step in the peace 
negotiations with israel 
the republican vice president charged dukakis lacks a clear 
stand on creation of a palestinian state saying anyone who has 
trouble making up his mind on this issue or who proposes to leave 
it open just doesnt understand the dangers to israel and to the 
united states just doesnt understand the very real threats that 
continue to exist 
dukakis answering that he would never recognize a unilateral 
declaration of a palestinian state or government in exile went 
on to criticize bush and running mate dan quayle for supporting 
arms sales to arab countries that are potential threats to israel 
we will not sell weapons that would threaten the security of 
israel to any nation the democratic nominee said after reading 
off a list of weapons sales to arab countries with the support of 
bush and quayle 
bush received a boost in the latest abc newswashington post 
poll which showed the republican candidate ahead of dukakis 51 
percent to 43 percent 
the survey of 1104 likely voters was conducted aug 31 to sept 
6 and had a margin of error of 35 points 
the post cautioned that the results may be unusual because many 
people were away from their homes during the labor day holiday 
dukakis spokesman dayton duncan said the candidate always believed 
it would be a tight race 
in an apparent effort to defuse democratic claims that he is 
insensitive to the concerns of working people bush told 
knightridder newspapers that he will soon propose boosting the 
minimum wage 
the administration opposes an increase and campaign sources 
said bush was expected to link his proposal with a call for a 
training wage below the regular minimum wage to cover new hires 
and teenagers 
top bush aides were linked in published and broadcast reports to 
lobbying activity for the bahamas and prime minister lynden 
pindling who has been under investigation in this country because 
of alleged drug activities 
the reports centered on a 20page contract proposal in which the 
lobbying firm of black manafort amp stone said it could create a 
backchannel relationship with the administration and counter 
criticism by the drug enforcement administration 
campaign manager lee atwater senior adviser charles black and 
scheduler paul j manafort were named in the proposal the firm 
charged 800000 for the lobbying activity from april 1985 to 
september 1986 
bush at the time was head of a drugenforcement effort that 
included investigations of pindling bush spokesman mark goodin 
characterized the contract language as salesmans hyperbole 
dukakis today received the endorsement of the 19 millionmember 
national education association 
quayle tending to senate duties wednesday was damned with 
faint praise by senate minority leader and former presidential 
candidate bob dole 
dole said he thought quayle was becoming an asset to the 
republican ticket and he put the stress on becoming 
for bush wednesday sept 7 1988 may not exactly live in 
infamy but is at least a likely entry in the political blunder hall 
of fame 
explaining how he wrongly told the american legion crowd that 
sept 7 was the anniversary of the 1941 japanese bombing of pearl 
harbor that brought america into world war ii instead of the dec 
7 date franklin roosevelt declared would live in infamy bush said 
i wanted to work pearl harbor in and just got carried away

a space mission that endangered two cosmonauts 
was hastily organized for pure propaganda reasons and the 
crewmen were lucky to escape with their lives according to an 
american expert on the soviet space program 
james oberg said soyuz tm5 with an afghan crewman aboard was 
rushed into space a year ahead of schedule to assure that it flew 
before soviet troops completed withdrawal from afghanistan 
they asked for this trouble by throwing this mission together 
for pure propaganda said oberg a space engineer and author of 
several books on the soviet space program 
the craft landed safely wednesday after a tense 24 hours in 
which malfunctions threatened to leave the cosmonauts marooned in 
orbit 
in a telephone interview oberg said he believes the cosmonauts 
were seconds away from death when a deorbit rocket engine shut 
down prematurely left the soyuz tm5 in an orbit 155 miles above 
the earth had the rocket fired for only a minute longer he said 
the craft could have fallen through the atmosphere and burned 
nicholas johnson another us space expert agreed that the 
soyuz mission was organized quickly but he doubts the rush was 
related to the malfunction 
it the mission was accelerated and there is every reason to 
believe it was politically motivated said johnson who works for 
teledyne brown engineering in colorado springs colo a major 
space contractor but that had absolutely no impact on the 
problem that occurred on the spacecraft 
soyuz tm5 commanded by veteran cosmonaut vladimir lyakhov and 
with abdul ahad mohmand of afghanistan on board undocked from the 
mir space station early tuesday on what was expected to be a 
threehour flight back to earth but the crafts braking rocket 
failed to fire on time and then seven minutes later fired 
automatically for three seconds 
two orbits later the rocket fired again but shut down after 
about 60 seconds this left the craft in a 155mile orbit 
a third attempt was successful and the soyuz landed safely and 
on target in the soviet province of kazakhstan 
at a news conference today for soviet and afghan reporters at 
the baikonur space center near the landing site the cosmonauts 
said they had only 105 cubic feet between them they were stuck in 
the capsule for 26 hours 
the cosmonauts had an emergency supply of food and water but 
decided not to use it until absolutely necessary tass the 
official news agency reported other reports have said the capsule 
had no toilet virtually no room to move around and enough air for 
only two days 
the spacemen were asked to describe what happened after their 
capsule undocked tuesday from the orbiting space station mir 
during the first landing attempt undertaken on sept 6 
everything went as scheduled tass quoted lyakhov as saying 
but 30 seconds before the engine startup there occurred a 
disruption in the operation of the infrared vertical sensor the 
computer was unable to judge whether the spacecraft was correctly 
oriented and the engine was shut off 
oberg said that based on soviet public discussions and on 
tracking data collected by the us space command in colorado 
springs he believes the problem was caused by some type of 
computer software glitch 
the lighting at the deorbit burn was not standard and had 
never been followed in the four previous tm flights said oberg 
the tm is a completely reengineered spacecraft with new 
computers new software new guidance 
he said the soyuz tm aligns itself for the braking rocket firing 
by taking readings with a guidance sensor on the earths horizon 
on the four earlier flights these readings were taken as the soyuz 
tm craft were approaching sunrise for soyuz tm5 said oberg the 
readings were taken after sunset in the darkness 
oberg said he believes the fault detection system in the 
computer was falsely rejecting the data from the sensor 
the computer disbelieved the data he said in the first 
attempt the machine failed to fire the rocket until it received 
acceptable data this came seven minutes too late and the 
cosmonauts manually turned off the rocket after three seconds two 
orbits later the computer turned the rocket on and it fired for 
about 60 seconds oberg said before it again automatically halted 
the rocket engine 
the cutoff of that burn was lucky for them he said it 
was a lifesaving accident 
johnson disagreed with obergs assessment 
i give the soviets credit enough to program the computer in 
such a manner that it would not shut down and leave the craft in 
a hazardous position johnson said 
but oberg said that all of the soviet statements are 
consistent with this scenario 
he said permitting the computer to fire the engine randomly 
was pretty sloppy flying by the cosmonaut crew 
oberg also said it was unreasonable to assume that the 
computer software would be smart enough to shut down the rocket 
engine and to automatically leave the craft in a safe orbit he 
said it would take months to develop and test a computer program 
for the lighting conditions encountered by soyuz tm5 and its 
clear they didnt have the time to do it right 
soviet spacefarers usually receive 18 months of training and 
preparation before a mission and oberg said the crew of soyuz tm5 
was together for only six months before launch

a federal judge was urged today to allow 
detroits two daily newspapers to complete a partial merger under a 
joint operating agreement approved last month by thenattorney 
general edwin meese iii 
attorney clark clifford dismissed suggestions by opponents of 
the joint operating agreement joa that meese had ignored the 
conclusions of an administrative law judge that the papers didns 
qualify for the antitrust exemption 
meese is under no compunction at any stage of the proceeding 
to accept any conclusion of the administrative law judge said 
clifford who represents knightridder inc owner of the detroit 
free press 
before leaving office last month meese found that the free 
press a morning paper that has lost 100 million in nine years 
was a failing newspaper under the 1970 newspaper preservation act 
meese approved a joint operating agreement between the free 
press and the detroit news owned by gannett co inc the partial 
merger was temporarily blocked by court order until us district 
judge george revercomb has a chance to rule on a legal challenge 
revercomb said he would issue a ruling by next week 
william schultz an attorney representing michigan citizens for 
an ndependent press charged that the two dailies engaged in a 
bitter war of price cutting to either put each other out of 
business or qualify for a lucrative joint operating agreement 
did congress intend to give large corporations like gannett 
and knightridder the opportunity to gain a joa simply by cutting 
prices thus creating a record of loss schultz said 
justice department attorney thomas millet said there 
absolutely was no evidence of collusion between the free press 
and the news which was bought by gannett in 1986 several months 
before the joint operating agreement was formally sought 
the fact that these two papers considered the option and 
discussed this over a period of time is not an argument that a joa 
shouldnt occur millet said 
those discussions were a natural consequence of the fact 
that both papers sustained losses while cutting advertising and 
circulation rates to gain dominance in the market millet said 
clifford an elder statesman of the democratic party who served 
as defense secretary under president johnson said the news had 
rejected several free press overtures to joint their production and 
commercial departments 
the news was determined to keep the free press as far down as 
they can because in the news business you try to become the 
dominant paper clifford said as soon as you find yourself in 
the second position you are probably on your way out 
while the free press was locked in bitter competition with the 
news every year except one they lost more money than they lost 
the year before 
knightridder during the eightyear period poured 176 
million into the free press in an effort to keep it afloat 
clifford said at the end of the period the free press was 
losing more money then they were at the beginning 
knightridder has threatened to close the free press if the 
joint operating agreement is not allowed to go through 
clifford said closing the free press would cost 2200 jobs while 
between 600 and 800 jobs would be eliminated if the two dailies 
combined their business operations 
schultz argued that meeses decision was arbitrary because he 
ignored the administrative law judges recommendation 
meese disregarded the administrative law judges conclusion that 
if the partial merger were not approved the news which has also 
posted significant losses would eventually raise its prices 
thereby allowing the free press to do the same schultz said 
clifford said many of the administrative law judges conclusions 
got so far beyond the question of fact that you get into the 
realm of speculation 
millet said the opponents have to prove the decision is 
irrational not that they dont like it or they think the 
administrative law judge recommended a contrary result

republican presidential nominee george 
bush today viewed the fiery destruction of a set of us 
intermediaterange missile engines and said the demolition marks 
the day we began to reverse the arms race 
the vice president who watched as the two pershing missile 
engines were fired the first to be destroyed deliberately under 
the ussoviet arms reduction treaty said this is one of those 
unique moments in the career of man a moment when the tides of 
history turned that a new future dawned 
bush joined other us and soviet officials on the reviewing 
stand at the longhorn army ammunition plant here to witness the 
demolition of the two engines which are among the 859 weapons that 
the two superpowers have agreed to destroy over the next three 
years 
peering through binoculars from a distance of about 1000 feet 
the vice president watched as the motor of a pershing ii missile 
engine was fired to burn up its fuel followed by the firing of a 
smaller pershing 1a rocket engine 
the destruction was accompanied by a thunderous blast that 
lasted about a minute and then a loud cheer from those on the 
reviewing stand 
the soviet union has already demolished several of its 
counterpart ss20 missiles under the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty signed last december 
we too are sending our inf missiles to the junkyards bush 
said the missile stages we destroy today are just a beginning 
it is a moment we will be able to tell our children and 
grandchildren about this was the day we began to reverse the arms 
race this was the day we began destroying the weapons of 
destruction 
nuclear warheads of the missiles are to be dismantled under the 
same agreement 
even though the bush campaign paid for the trip the gop nominee 
was attending the event in his official capacity as vice president 
aides said 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff told reporters he did not 
believe the vice president had unfair advantage over dukakis 
because of his ability to participate in the program 
george bush has been associated with the efforts to achieve an 
inf treaty for many years its something i think he is 
legitimately entitled to participate in fuller said 
on wednesday bush said he just got messed up when he told 
an american legion audience that it was the 47th anniversary of 
pearl harbor day three months in advance of the actual day 
bushs embarrassing gaffe which he corrected after noticing the 
perplexed expressions in his audience happened when i wanted to 
work pearl harbor in and just got carried away he told reporters 
traveling with him on air force two 
i looked up and saw incredulity on the face of one particular 
guy and i thought whoops my heavens ive done it so i was glad 
to correct it 
bush received a boost in the latest abc newswashington post 
poll which showed the republican candidate ahead of democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis 51 percent to 43 percent 
the survey of 1104 likely voters was conducted aug 31 to sept 
6 and had a margin of error of 35 points 
the post cautioned that the results may be unusual because many 
people were away from their homes during the labor day holiday 
in an apparent effort to defuse democratic claims that he is 
insensitive to the concerns of working people bush told 
knightridder newspapers that he will soon propose an increase in 
the minimum wage 
the administration opposes an increase and campaign sources 
said bush was expected to link the increase with a belowminimum 
training wage for new hires and for teenagers 
bush told the bnai brith convention wednesday in baltimore 
that the treaty to eliminate a whole class of nuclear weapons 
could not have been negotiated from a position of weakness 
strength works better than weakness if you want to get both 
peace and security bush said 
bush did not refer to dukakis directly in his speech to the 
bnai brith a national jewish service organization but in his 
earlier talk to the american legion convention in louisville ky 
he suggested his rivals defense policies would leave america 
hostage to soviet ballistic missiles 
he said soviets were now deploying two new intercontinental 
ballistic missiles so even with perestroika soviet military 
modernization has not slackened he said soviet military 
spending continues to rise 
bush also 
told the bnai brith that he opposes creation of a palestinian 
state but believes palestinians must be involved at every step 
in the peace negotiations with israel 
said antiabortion demonstrators went too far in recent 
noisy protests against democratic rival michael dukakis

e robert wallach awaiting trial on 
racketeering charges in the wedtech bribery case said today he was 
an innocent man victimized by the media and investigators out to 
drive former attorney general edwin meese iii from office 
wallach at a news conference at the national press club 
defended his longtime friend saying meese had received more 
calumny from the american media than any public official in 
memory 
i am persuaded that much of what went on was an effort to 
drive ed meese from office i proved to be a most attractive 
vehicle to help accomplish that goal said the san francisco 
trial attorney 
he said he had made some honest mistakes in washington i 
think i came into the big leagues thinking i had had adequate 
spring training when i hadnt he said 
im telling you the sytem caught an innocent man and the media 
played a role in it said wallach 
the bob wallach that was portrayed in the washington post in 
the new york times in most publications which covered me never 
existed does not exist did not exist he said 
i had on one side of me wedtech and on the other side of me 
edwin meese iii how could i not have been an attractive object for 
the media said wallach who complained that his life and the 
lives of his children had been invaded by the anonymous assassins 
of the media 
he depicted himself as a selfmade man grandson of a 
buttonhole maker who won a scholarship and worked his way through 
college to become a pillar of the san francisco bar and backer of 
liberal causes 
wallach lodged the same complaints wednesday night at an 
american university forum where he told 300 people i was 
convicted before i was indicted i was convicted by the american 
media 
wallach goes on trial jan 3 in new york on federal racketeering 
and conspiracy charges 
wallach is accused of taking payoffs from wedtech officials to 
influence meese and other public officials wedtech was a fledgling 
defense contractor and favorite of the reagan administration that 
collapsed in a bribery scandal in 1986 
joining wallach on the american university panel were lyn 
nofziger the former white house political director who is 
appealing his conviction for illegal lobbying and two reporters 
wallach said he would not back one inch away from the 
medias first amendment freedom but that does not give them 
authority to desecrate the sixth amendment right the presumption 
of innocence 
meese resigned as attorney general last month shortly before a 
special prosecutor decided not to indict him 
wallach claimed that special prosecutor james mckays only goal 
was to drive meese from the attorney generals office and i 
became an appropriate vehicle to help to accomplish that 
nofziger sentenced to 90 days in jail and a 30000 fine for 
illegally lobbying former white house colleagues said some 
reporters are careless but he received fair coverage at his trial 
you cant point a finger at the profession he said 
ruth marcus of the washington post and james polk of nbc news 
both said the press had no power to indict or convict anyone 
polk said wallachs problems stemmed from his indictment and the 
special 
but polk said he personally feels the press has fostered an 
assumption of guilt on the part of bob wallach before trial 
polk who said juries often begin with the assumption that a 
defendant is guilty also expressed the opinion that nofziger was 
unfairly convicted

the irish government refused entry to 
jewish refugees from nazi germany and was heavily influenced by its 
ambassador to berlin who said the jews were a source of 
corruption according to a new book 
ireland and europe 19191949 by historian dermot keogh of 
university college cork cites previously secret state documents 
to show that the government regarded jews as a potential irritant 
in the body politic who had disproportionate wealth and 
influence 
the book published wednesday says eamon de valera irish prime 
minister at the time was advised by his ambassador to germany 
charles bewley a former ambassador to the vatican and a roman 
catholic convert from quakerism 
he cites reports in the state archives in which bewley blamed 
jews for the appalling moral degradation of prehitler germany 
and claimed that they creates grave moral scandals and are a 
source of corruption of the populations among which they dwell 
keogh writes that de valera did not share these views and 
frequently would deviate substantially from the policy about 
150 jews from germany were admitted temporarily he says 
but he also says de valera rejected pleas from irish jewish 
leaders to give refuge to a german jew who had jumped ship in cork 
in 1939 the jew ended up in a concentration camp keogh writes 
he says there is evidence that government departments opposed 
any entry of jews even after the nazis extermination of jews 
became known the policy he says continued after the war 
keough quotes a justice department memorandum saying jews should 
be treated less liberally under the immigration law because the 
wealth and influence of the jewish community in this country 
appears to have increased considerably in recent years and there is 
some danger of exciting opposition and controversy if this tendency 
continues 
even in 1953 a justice department memorandum referred to jews 
as a people who appear to have disproportionate wealth and 
influence keogh writes 
ireland a country of 35 million has about 1900 jews

aspiring principals for the first time will 
not be required to have teaching experience under a new state 
policy 
educators said the policy makes new jersey the first state to 
open the principals office to nonteachers 
the plan approved wednesday by new jerseys board of education 
increases standards for all candidates but drops a requirement of 
three years teaching experience 
the plan will allow the new principals to get teaching 
experience as they go 
these new standards create a rigorous procedure for preparing 
all future principals and at the same time open up the system so 
that local districts can select the best potential candidates 
regardless of background education commissioner saul cooperman 
said in a statement after the board meeting in jamesburg 
principals without education backgrounds will be designated as 
being part of a pilot project it is to be reviewed by an 
independent panel in four years education department spokesman 
roger shatzkin said 
during that period the state will allow the hiring of no more 
than 50 new principals who lack teaching background he said the 
applicants will be required to have a masters degree in 
management however 
principals with less than a year of teaching experience will 
have to teach one class period a day for at least a year and 
candidates with less than a yer of teaching experience will have to 
teach for two years 
in addition they will be required to complete 135 hours of 
graduate study in education during their one to twoyear residency 
cooperman said the changes will give new jersey schools a wider 
and better field from which to choose principals 
chris pipho a spokesman in denver for the education commission 
of the states which follows school policies across the country 
said he knows of no other state that allows nonteachers to be 
principals

pope john paul iis latest trip to southern 
africa will take him to an impoverished region of refugees and 
rebels but he will pointedly avoid segregated south africa the 
regions economic powerhouse 
the pope leaves saturday on his fourth trip to africa and his 
39th abroad he will go to zimbabwe botswana lesotho swaziland 
and mozambique countries that vehemently oppose south africa but 
depend on it for economic survival 
south africa dominates communications trade transportation and 
politics in southern africa and its influence will be felt 
strongly during the popes 10day trip 
south african firms are supplying such items as transportation 
food water and health services broadcasting and emergency 
equipment and even papal souvenirs to be used on many of the popes 
stops 
john paul 68 has been critical of south african apartheid 
throughout his nearly 10yearlong pontificate 
south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
vatican spokesman joaquim navarro said the pope has not refused 
to visit south africa and he may visit in the future but neither 
all the local bishops nor the pope himself consider this an 
opportune moment he said 
navarro said any south africa stopover during this visit would 
lose the pastoral tone of the trip 
his trip will allow the vatican to explore new opportunities for 
the roman catholic church elsewhere in the region orthodox marxism 
is weakening and communist countries like mozambique have decided 
to return confiscated church properties and to tolerate religious 
education catholicism has experienced its most rapid recent growth 
in africa 
john paul plans to jump immediately into the troubled area with 
a keynote address saturday evening to the bishops of the region 
who are meeting in zimbabwes capital harare 
officials say about 6 million refugees have been displaced in 
the area by fierce fighting in the former portuguese colonies of 
angola and mozambique and regional conflicts in other southern 
african nations 
the united states has been sponsoring peace talks on southern 
africa that would bring independence to namibia a pullout of south 
african troops from that country and a gradual withdrawal of about 
50000 cuban troops from angola 
on the indian ocean coast a 13yearold civil war in mozambique 
has turned into a disaster devastating the countryside halting 
agriculture and starving millions of people it has caused a human 
tidal wave of almost 1 million refugees fleeing to camps in 
zimbabwe tanzania malawi and south africa 
the conflict pits the mozambican national resistance movement 
a group that says it is anticommunist against mozambiques 
marxist government the state department estimates 100000 
civilians have been killed in the past two years 
throughout his visit john paul will meet refugees and maimed 
victims of the regional conflicts 
he also will visit the dioceses of gaborone in botswana and 
manzini in swaziland which are directly dependent on south african 
bishops in lesotho more than 1 million south africans are 
expected to cross into the country when the pope beatifies french 
missionary joseph gerard in a step toward sainthood 
the king of lesotho moshoeshoe ii is catholic as is 40 
percent of its 18 million population the visit to lesotho one of 
the worlds poorest countries is expected to be financed by south 
african donations 
at his first stop in zimbabwe john paul will be greeted by 
president robert mugabe a jesuiteducated marxist who often has 
spoken about his own catholicism and who received church backing 
when he was fighting rhodesias white rulers in the 1970s 
the church has spoken out against alleged atrocities by mugabes 
soldiers in their conflict against dissidents once headed by joshua 
nkomo nkomos loyalists made peace last december and joined the 
government 
in diamondrich botswana early next week john paul will be 
greeted by president quett masire who is recovering from injuries 
incurred when his plane was mistakenly shot down by angolan troops 
while on his way a month ago to a conference in angola 
at midweek the pope will be in lesotho for the religious 
centerpiece of the trip the beatification of father gerard whose 
grave has become a pilgrimage site 
after an eighthour stop in swaziland on sept 16 and a meeting 
with 20yearold king mswati iii the pope flies to mozambique 
where he will visit embattled beira and nampula accompanied by the 
countrys first cardinal alexandre dos santos who has urged 
government dialogue with the guerrillas 
because of guerrilla activity access to nampula is considered 
relatively safe only by air

a 23yearold briton today broke the speed 
record for swimming the english channel from france to england 
making the crossing in just over eight hours 
richard davey a chemical engineer from folkestone swam in calm 
seas and clear weather from cap griz nez france to st margarets 
bay near dover england in eight hours and five minutes 
he cut by 10 minutes the record for a crossing from france to 
england set by philip rush of new zealand last year 
the fastest swim for a channel crossing in either direction was 
set in 1978 by penny lee dean of the united states while swimming 
from england to france in seven hours 40 minutes 
the distance from dover in a straight line to the nearest point 
in france is 21 miles but winds tides and currents usually add 10

sen dan quayle who has concentrated on 
democratbashing in recent days switched today to a detailed 
national defense speech touting the strategic defense initiative 
and calling for repeal of the war powers act 
the republican vice presidential candidate in remarks prepared 
for delivery to the city club of chicago also said that japan and 
the european allies should share more of the cost of their own 
defense 
on sdi quayle said the next president should make every 
effort to determine whether he or his successor could develop and 
deploy a second red button not just the button of retaliation but 
the button of protection 
the speech was designed to spotlight quayles experience as a 
member of the senate armed services committee he spoke in great 
detail on the justifications for sdi popularly known as star wars 
as well as other weapons systems and national security philosophy 
in general 
he called for a cautious approach to ussoviet agreements 
we must probe the soviet position on start working to conclude 
an agreement while modernizing our forces he said 
we must probe the soviet position on conventional forces while 
continuing initiatives to strengthen our conventional force 
posture and we must probe soviet willingness to restrain their 
clients and to determine whether soviet new thinking will in fact 
lead to behavior that can lower the possibilities for regional 
conflicts he said in the prepared statement 
quayles text did not mention democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis whom he has heatedly attacked as being weak on 
defense in recent days 
he attacked congressional interference in the presidents 
ability to conduct foreign policy he said the war powers act 
is unconstitutional and should be repealed or drastically 
rewritten 
the act enacted by congress in 1973 over president nixons 
veto is a vietnamera law limiting a presidents ability to commit 
us troops to dangerous situations 
the law says a president must send a report to congress within 
48 hours after us military personnel are sent to areas of 
imminent hostilities the forces would have to be withdrawn in 
60 days in some cases unless congress votes to permit them to 
stay 
all presidents since nixon have argued the law is an 
unconstitutional restriction on the executive branch 
there is widespread criticism from democrats and republicans 
alike that the law is unworkable and there is now a bipartisan 
push to rewrite the law although there is not yet agreement on 
details 
on wednesday in washington quayle got a warm welcome from his 
colleagues his first day back on the job since becoming george 
bushs running mate but the message from senate republican leader 
bob dole was mixed at best 
dole praised quayle as a rising young star in our party at a 
capitol reception but later he stopped short of calling quayle an 
asset to the republican ticket when pressed by reporters 
i think hes becoming an asset dole said did that mean the 
senator thought quayle had achieved that status yet he was asked 
becoming dole repeated 
quayle told his gop colleagues i cant wait to get back out 
there on the campaign trail there were cheers from the senators 
as quayle spoke some of them calling out hear hear 
no matter what happens in this election the people who know 
me best and the people i am closest to are the people right here in 
this room quayle said i hope you never forget believe me 
ill never forget 
quayle said he would return to washington for key senate votes 
as he was needed 
i know youve been on a roller coaster ride dole said as he 
welcomed the indiana senator back after a summer recess in which 
quayle became the partys vice presidential nominee 
since his nomination quayle has been dogged by controversies 
over his military service personal life and academic record and 
some in his own party have expressed skepticism about whether the 
41yearold senator should be on the ticket 
dole a onetime presidential hopeful who was on george bushs 
short list of vice presidential prospects has himself expressed 
reservations about quayle dole said recently that people of his 
generation might have problems with allegations that quayle used 
his wealthy familys influence to get into the national guard 
during the vietnam war 
he repeated that view after the reception wednesday telling 
reporters if he did get certain breaks that would create a 
problem in the minds of many particularly i would say in my 
generation 
at the reception dole presented quayle with a small fire 
extinguisher which he said quayle could spray on the press from 
time to time 
he also gave quayle a framed copy of the pledge of allegiance 
the republicans have criticized dukakis the democratic 
presidential nominee for vetoing a massachusetts bill that would 
have required teachers to lead students in the pledge quayle 
devoted his labor day fall campaign kickoff speech to the pledge

a judge has ordered a trial to decide who owns the 
papers of martin luther king jr his widow or boston university 
in a ruling received by lawyers today superior court judge john 
l murphy said a letter by king bequeathing the papers to bu is not 
a formal will and therefore coretta scott king has the right to a 
trial on her claim to the documents 
murphy ruled that bu was the rightful holder of the papers at 
the time of kings death in 1968 but he said mrs king also has 
the right to stake a claim 
one issue in the trial murphy said will be whether her 23year 
delay in making a claim strengthens the universitys case 
murphy rejected a counterclaim by bu to ownership of king papers 
stored in atlanta the decision was dated aug 31 
at issue is the collection of 83000 documents entrusted to bu 
by king in 1964 four years before he was assassinated in memphis 
mrs king sued in december after negotiations over her bid to 
reclaim the papers broke down 
mrs king wants to consolidate the papers with 100000 other 
king documents at the king center for nonviolent social change in 
atlanta 
central to the case is a onepage typewritten letter dated july 
16 1964 from king to the bu library 
king who received his doctorate in theology from bu in 1955 
wrote that the library would be the repository of my 
correspondence manuscripts and other papers 
in the event of my death he wrote all such materials 
deposited with the university shall become from that date the 
absolute property of boston university 
mrs king however claims her husband had privately indicated 
his wish that the archive be stored permanently in the south

shree rajneesh are expected for a weekend reunion at their former 
central oregon commune a spokesman for the indian guru said 
state police patrols are being increased in anticipation 
we are not expecting trouble we plan on being prepared for 
trouble if it occurs state police maj john collins said

in lake oswego 
the reunion by invitation only will be on private property at 
the 64000acre rancho rajneesh and will be closed to the public 
except for a news conference sunday by swami prem niren the gurus 
attorney who now carries the title of rajneeshs ambassador to the 
united states 
when the commune was its most active thousands of redclad 
disciples lived on the ranch incorporated as rajneeshpuram there 
they showered the selfproclaimed rich mans guru with 
rollsroyces and jewelry 
the sect members spent a turbulent 4 years at the commune that 
were marked by confrontations with nonbelievers 
rajneeshees took over the nearby town of antelope and later in 
an alleged bid for political control of the county bused in 
thousands of transients as potential voters sect members boycotted 
the election and deposited the transients in nearby communities 
after state officials required eligibility hearings for all new 
voter registration applicants 
rajneeshs feisty personal secretary ma anand sheela is in 
federal prison on a variety of convictions stemming from her 
conduct at the commune among other crimes she was convicted of 
poisoning salad bars in nearby the dalles causing more than 750 
people to become ill giving glasses of poisoned water to county

the 25th annual national championship air 
races next week are expected to attract record crowds despite the 
tragic crash into a german air show audience 
the possibility of a similar disaster is remote here because of 
strict federal aviation administration and air race rules 
according to thornton audrain executive director of the reno air 
racing association 
the planes are not allowed to fly toward the crowd he said 
wednesday in fact they are only allowed to fly parallel to and 
away from the crowd weve always been very safety conscious and 
have never had any spectators injured eight participants have 
been killed however 
audrain said he expects attendance this year to at least match 
the record 148000 who flocked to stead airport 10 miles north of 
reno in 1987 time trials for the various classes of airplanes 
begin monday and the races are sept 1518 
a record field of nearly 120 entrants is expected to compete at 
speeds of up to more than 450 mph for a total purse of 450000 
according to race officials entrants range from independently 
wealthy flying buffs to corporate sponsored pilots 
the air force thunderbirds also are scheduled to demonstrate 
their precision moves and stunt pilots will entertain between 
races 
people expect the stunt flying its part of the show 
audrain said 
at ramstein air force base in west germany more than 50 people 
died after three jets from an italian military precision flying 
team collided at an air show aug 28 and one hurtled into a crowd 
of spectators exploding into a fireball 
that type of maneuver would never be permitted under our 
rules audrain said it would have to be a very very unusual 
circumstance for the audience to be at risk at all i just dont 
see it happening 
we have insurance although that wouldnt prevent an 
accident he added 
the air races began in 1964 with 24 entrants competing for a 
purse of 31774 since 1966 the event has attracted many of the 
best racers and stunt fliers in the world 
the eight participant deaths during the history of the race 
included one just last year a pilot whose plane crashed after an 
apparent engine malfunction 
we have had some deaths associated with the races but all in 
all weve had a very good safety record audrain said some 
things you just cant prevent but with the strict faa rules we 
think were as safe as you can get

the 19 millionmember national education 
association endorsed presidential candidate michael dukakis on 
thursday with its chief predicting the democrat would spend more 
on schools and end eight years of teacher bashing 
nea president mary hatwood futrell said she aims to mobilize 
at least a halfmillion nea members to be volunteers in the dukakis 
campaign 
the union sent out mail ballots to the 8479 delegates who 
attended its last convention and got responses from about 6200 
dukakis was the choice of 86 percent the other 14 percent marked 
their ballots for republican nominee george bush 
four years ago 88 percent backed walter mondale in an updown 
vote on the democratic nominee the nea did not show ronald reagan 
on its ballot that year 
futrell joined by roseanne bacon president of the 
massachusetts teachers association told a news conference she 
looks forward to substantial increases in federal funding for 
public education in a dukakis administration 
she said dukakis will work side by side with the education 
community to improve american education and expressed confidence 
that he will redirect national priorities and provide substantial 
increases in federal funding for public education 
mike dukakis as president would put an end to eight years of 
teacher bashing and budget cutting she said and appoint an 
education secretary who would fight for education instead of 
trashing it 
i think that ronald reagan and george bush will go down as the 
administration with the worst educational record probably in the 
history of america said futrell 
the union has been encamped in the democrats corner in every 
presidential race since 1976 
futrell said 30 percent or nearly 600000 of her members are 
registered republicans 
but in rejecting bush she said teachers were signalling that 
they are tired of being beaten on the head tired of being told 
to do more with less 
bush belatedly replied to an nea political questionnaire two 
weeks ago a year late and long after the ballots went out

discoverys astronauts completed a 
successful practice countdown aboard the spaceship today the last 
major test before they lift off in as little as three weeks on the 
first shuttle mission in 2 years nasa said 
the space agency on wednesday plans to announce a launch date 
after assessing the countdown test and other factors officials 
have been discussing a date between sept 26 and 29 
we clearly demonstrated that were ready to pick up the count 
for real i hope that we will be able to do that by the end of the 
month kennedy space center director forrest s mccartney told 
the launch team after the test 
it certainly sets the stage for what were about ready to do 
here in just a few weeks launch director bob sieck added 
commander rick hauck and his four crewmates wearing new partial 
pressure suits switched dials tested communications monitored 
systems and followed all procedures scheduled during the final two 
hours of an actual countdown 
everything appears to have gone quite well said launch 
control commentator hugh harris as the test concluded at 1034 
am 34 minutes behind schedule because of minor communications 
problems between the craft and control center 
the countdown clock was halted at six seconds before the mock 
liftoff to simulate an engine problem and give the launch team 
practice in making the vehicle safe 
harris said that had this been an actual launch attempt the 
effort would have been delayed because winds of about 19 mph were 
too high because it was a practice launch director bob sieck gave 
the goahead to complete the count 
it all looks clean it all looks good hauck said after an 
inspection of discovery on tuesday were going to be ready to 
fly 
the other crewmen are pilot dick covey and mission specialists 
george nelson mike lounge and dave hilmers 
on most previous shuttle launches the astronauts wore flight 
coveralls the partial pressure suits to be worn on launch and 
reentry would be necessary in case of trouble during an emergency 
landing attempt and the crew had to bail out by blowing an 
explosive hatch sliding down a telescoping pole and parachuting to 
earth 
the emergency escape system has been added since the jan 28 
1986 challenger explosion that killed the sevenmember crew and 
grounded the shuttle fleet it would not help in a challengertype 
accident in which the vehicle blew apart 73 seconds after liftoff 
the practice countdown concludes three days of training here for 
the astronauts after which they return to their base at the 
johnson space center in houston to await a launch day announcement 
next week 
the national aeronautics and space administration is aiming for 
a liftoff in the last week in september but has deferred setting a 
firm date until sept 14 following a twoday flight readiness 
review here 
hauck said he and lounge would represent the crew at the review 
that is an indepth review that all elements of the program 
will have a requirement to sign on the dotted line to say that 
their part of the program is ready for us to fly he told 
reporters wednesday 
asked if he saw anything that would prevent a late september 
launch the commander replied i havent seen anything 
he said there were a few open technical issues but he did not 
consider any of them serious 
the astronauts met reporters tuesday following a threehour 
launch pad exercise in which they inspected discovery and the 
communications satellite in its cargo bay and walked through a 
rehearsal of emergency escape procedures 
hauck commanded discovery in november 1984 on one of the ships 
six earlier flights the four other crewmen also are veteran 
shuttle fliers

centuries of hate and discrimination between 
perus rich and poor have spawned a vicious leftist insurgency that 
could lead to civil war the head of a blueribbon senate panel on 
violence warned thursday 
either we make a concerted effort at a national plan for 
pacification or face the possibility of a country caught in a 
civil war sen enrique bernales said in making public the 
commissions report 
poverty racism and government corruption are other major causes 
of the eightyear insurrection of the maoist shining path guerrilla 
group said the study conducted by a panel of 11 senators 
political violence in peru is not the result of poverty alone 
but of humiliation oppression hate between classes racism 
bernales said 
bernales said the 389page report which probes the roots of 
violence and offers possible solutions is the most extensive of 
its kind ever undertaken in peru 
the commission said the white ruling class has maintained the 
subjugation of indian peasants in the andean highlands first begun 
by spanish conquerors and continued by the aristocracy 
it said the peasants who make up about 40 percent of perus 
population are the most uneducated impoverished and ignored 
sector of society and are frequent objects of scorn 
this has become an intolerable humiliation they are being 
pushed to the border and are questioning the existing order 
violence has resulted the report said 
the commission which used government and private studies in its 
findings said 11605 people have been killed and property damage 
has reached 10 billion in the maoist revolt 
the panel said that the economy also has deteriorated 
dramatically 
the country is in the same situation as it was 15 years ago 
it has lost all movement toward developing said bernales 
mounting problems have sparked an exodus of skilled workers and 
professionals the report said 125000 peruvians emigrated in the 
past four years about half to the united states 
in a nationwide survey which sampled residents of the 
terrorridden mountain states of ayacucho and huancavelica for the 
first time ever the commission found 60 percent of perus 20 
million people believe the government has been ineffective in 
dealing with terrorism 
the commission said the insurgency repressive countermeasures 
by government forces and drug trafficking have sparked political 
instability and undermined participation in perus democracy 
about 300000 peruvian families are linked to narcotics 
trafficking according to the study the peasants grow coca the 
raw material of cocaine on small jungle plots for their livelihood 
the shining path recently opened a new front in the cocagrowing 
zone the commission urged greater efforts be made toward feasible 
crop substitution programs 
it also urged government forces to reject illegal tactics in 
dealing with guerrillas 
the state and society must stay within the law in defending 
itself said bernales 
the states of emergency to counter rebels now in effect in 
seven states where more than 40 percent of the population lives 
should be phased out to strengthen respect for democracy the 
commission said 
the panel recommended a national consensus be reached quickly on 
how to resist the guerrillas and it urged radical changes in 
perus rigid class structure 
the commission also proposed that police and the military 
undergo training in respecting human rights

a federal judge was confronted thursday with 
conflicting arguments over whether to let detroits two daily 
newspapers complete a partial merger approved last month by 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
william schultz attorney for a michigan group of readers and 
advertisers opposed to the arrangement accused owners of the 
detroit free press and the detroit news of cutting prices to put 
each other out of business or eventually qualify for a lucrative 
joint operating agreement under the newspaper preservation act 
but a justice department attorney thomas millet said there was 
absolutely no evidence that the two newspapers had colluded 
the arrangement approved by meese before he left office would 
allow the morning free press owned by knightridder inc to 
merge its commercial and business operations with the news bought 
in 1986 by gannett co 
knightridder has threatened to close the free press which has 
sustained 100 million in losses in nine years if the partial 
merger is not allowed to proceed 
the deal was temporarily blocked by court order last month to 
give us district judge george revercomb a chance to consider the 
legal challenge by michigan citizens for a free press 
revercomb said he would rule next week on the groups request 
for an injunction barring the merger 
the michigan group of readers and advertisers charges that the 
two newspapers set out to try to put each other out of business by 
cutting advertising and circulation rates or to qualify for a joint 
operating agreement 
knightridders strategy was to sustain shortterm losses with 
its eye on very longterm profits under a joint operating 
agreement allowed by the laws antitrust exemption schultz said 
schultz argued that meeses decision to allow the partial merger 
was arbitrary because he ignored the administrative law judges 
conclusion that if the merger were not approved the news which 
has also posted significant losses would eventually raise its 
prices thereby allowing the free press to do the same 
millet said there was absolutely no evidence of collusion 
between the free press and the news which was not acquired by 
gannett until several months before the merger application was made 
in 1986 
the fact that these two papers considered the option and 
discused this over a period of time is not an argument that a joa 
shouldnt occur millet said 
such discussions were a natural consequence of the losses 
the two papers continued to suffer while waging the cutthroat 
newspaper war he said 
clark clifford an attorney representing knightridder said the 
news rejected several overtures from the free press about forming a 
joint operating agreement 
the news answer was always there is the door goodbye 
said clifford an elder statesmen of the democratic party and a 
knightridder director 
while the free press was locked in bitter competition with the 
news every year except one they lost more money than they lost 
the year before clifford said 
clifford said 2200 jobs would be lost if the free press closed 
its doors compared to 600 to 800 lost positions under the proposed 
merger 
in 1987 the free press had a circulation of 639720 daily and 
724342 on sundays the news circulation was 678720 daily and 
839319 on sundays according to the audit bureau of circulation

south korea has made significant improvements in 
human rights as it prepares to host the olympics but the 
government still holds 600 political prisoners and tortures some of 
them amnesty international said thursday 
the human rights group said in a report that some political 
prisoners were jailed after unfair trials but that torture has 
decreased 
government sensitivity to world attention during the sept 17 to 
oct 2 olympics may help improve the situation but the games do 
not guarantee changes a representative of the londonbased group 
said 
the limits of freedom of expression have expanded the 
atmosphere is remarkably more free than before amnesty 
international researcher francoise vandale said at a briefing on 
the report entitled detention of prisoners of conscience and 
torture continue 
the report said south korea should release more political 
prisoners end torture and illtreatment of detainees and change 
laws to allow peaceful expression of opposition to the government 
major political changes since last summer have ushered in some 
improvements in human rights the report noted 
the government of president roh taewoo came to power after roh 
then chairman of the governing party pledged democratic reforms 
including release of political prisoners in response to violent 
demonstrations in june 1987 
national assembly elections last april gave the opposition a 
majority a startling change for a country long ruled by a party 
with almost complete power 
the assembly is debating several changes in laws on national 
security and demonstrations and amnesty international called for 
amendments to exclude from their scope peaceful acts of 
opposition to the government 
the changes have given political prisoners limited hope there 
have been releases and amnesties but we think theyve been too 
few ms vandale said 
the government says nearly 1300 political prisoners have been 
released since last year but amnesty international says the number 
is only 400 
the organization also said 4000 former political prisoners 
civil rights have been restored in this period about half the 
number claimed by the government 
arrests on political grounds have continued with about 600 
people imprisoned for political or trade union activities the 
report said 
of these about onethird have been convicted as far back as 
1958 for antistate activities such as espionage and given 
sentences from five years to life 
another onethird were arrested during nationwide strikes in 
1987 and the rest are thought to be students arrested in the past 
year during antigovernment demonstrations 
among the 600 amnesty international is calling for the release 
of 28 it has adopted as prisoners of conscience and it is 
investigating the cases of another 70 
amnesty international defines prisoners of conscience as those 
detained for belief color sex ethnic origin language or 
religion provided they havent used or advocated violence 
students who threw rocks in demonstrations could not be considered 
an official said 
constitutional amendments have strenthened laws protecting 
prisoners rights but in practice these rights are still not 
always respected amnesty international said 
it said relatives and lawyers have been denied access to any 
information about detainees and prisoners have been isolated 
beaten and deprived of sleep in the first days after their arrest 
the group has not heard of water torture cases since several 
instances in the last two years in which police were arrested for 
torture or abuse of a detainee 
asked if amnesty international felt the government was making 
changes with the olympics in mind the researcher said i suppose 
the government is sensitive to its political image but i believe 
the release of political prisoners has more to do with the balance 
of political parties 
she said that in the long term of course the attention of the 
whole world matters but things have changed very quickly in 
korea we just dont know what might happen after the games

situation 
on wednesday canadian immigration minister barbara mcdougall 
announced that effective immediately panamanians could no longer 
enter the country with only a valid passport 
she said the visa requirement was necessary to preserve the 
integrity of the canadian immigration system adding that 1600 
panamanians have asked for refugee status this year 
panama has been wracked with political and economic turmoil 
since its military ruler gen manuel antonio noriega was indicted 
for drug trafficking in february the united states has declared a 
financial embargo against panama in a sofar unsuccessful effort to 
topple noriegas government 
the stranded panamanians arrived on delta air lines and air 
canada flights in the past two days with us transit visas which 
ordinarily would allow them to stay only long enough to catch 
another flight on to canada 
but they were informed that canada now demands entry visas for 
panamanians and were prohibited from boarding flights to that 
country 
he said that an additional 15 panamanians were stranded in new 
york 
so far the panamanians stranded here have expressed no desire 
to stay in the united states permanently rivkind said 
should the situation drag out the ins which usually refuses to 
change transit visas to us entry visas might make an exception 
rivkind said 
i would have to weigh the implications he said

wind gusts to 85 mph 
fanned forest fires that gutted 17 buildings near old faithful 
while two montana men reported missing after flames engulfed their 
home were found today 
trees were just popping like matchsticks said robert lee a 
firefighter from auburn ala there were winds at least 85 mph 
temperatures here dropped into the 30s and winds died down 
overnight and firefighters expected calmer weather through 
saturday forecasters said a storm could bring rain or snow over 
the weekend 
wildfires also forced the evacuations of 50 homes in the 
shoshone national forest in wyoming east of yellowstone and two 
dozen homes and a boy scout camp near boulder and golden colo 
fire crews continued to protect two montana towns near yellowstone 
from a huge fire and battled blazes in idaho california oregon 
washington and utah 
in northwest montana along the flathead river authorities had 
feared that a man and his brother were caught in the flames after 
refusing an evacuation order 
but the men were found this morning along the river corridor 
bordering glacier national park 
they have been located and they are all right said madelyn 
kempf fire information officer 
although federal officials have called this the worst fire 
season in 30 years no fatalities have been directly attributed to 
the blazes which have charred 365 million acres an area larger 
than connecticut 
last month a helicopter involved in battling a blaze in 
wyomings bighorn national forest crashed after losing power 
killing a passenger a bureau of land management technician 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo and others have criticized the park 
service for waiting too long to fight some of the fires because of 
a policy to allow fires in wilderness areas to burn for the 
benefits they bring to forests 
wallop met wednesday with interior secretary donald p hodel and 
urged william penn mott director of the national park service to 
resign 
the northwest montana blaze discovered tuesday expanded to an 
estimated 7500 acres by early today and moved into glacier 
national park where it burned a ranger station complex and 
numerous cabins 
four hikers near the parks lower quartz lake were rescued by 
helicopter wednesday afternoon after flames cut off their escape 
route and they drove their vehicle into the lake to save it 
more than 100 people who live in the area were evacuated and 
two park campgrounds were evacuated 
at yellowstone tourist ken miller of denver was one of more 
than 100 visitors who left the old faithful area in a convoy led by 
rangers wednesday night as embers from the nearby 221800acre 
north fork fire descended 
ive been coming up here a long time miller said thank 
god ive got a lot of pictures of the way the park was because 
ill never see it like that again 
the fire is one of 13 major blazes covering more than 1 million 
acres in and around the 22 millionacre park 
earlier flames destroyed two cabins in the complexs southern 
end while embers carried by the winds ignited 14 guest cabins and 
a utility shed at the main part of the complex said fire commander 
denny bungarz 
but because the fire exhausted fuel as it passed through 
officials did not expect to see similar damaging flames again 
about 200 firefighters protected other structures including the 
historic old faithful inn where a sprinkler line on the roof was 
activated firefighters also sprayed flameretardant foam on the 
roof 
overnight visitors to old faithful were asked to leave wednesday 
morning it was the firstever evacuation of the most popular 
tourist attraction at the 116yearold park in wyomings northwest 
corner 
but park officials admitted day visitors until late wednesday 
afternoon when stiff winds whipped up a blaze on the areas 
southern border and blew embers into the complex igniting roofs of 
buildings 
when that firestorm went through there we had to move our 
people out of there bungarz said when you can feel the heat 
inside your car its time to move 
east of yellowstone shoshone forest officials evacuated at 
least 50 ranches and summer homes in a sparsely populated area 
because of rapid growth of the 260000acre clover mist fire 
but the national weather service said a storm front could carry 
significant rain or even snow for wyoming this weekend providing 
relief 
along yellowstones northern border high winds drove a backfire 
along the northern edge of cooke city and nearby silver gate the 
fire singed the fringes of the montana towns but created a buffer 
of charred timber in advance of the 119000acre storm 
creekhellroaring fire 
now with the fuels burned out at least on this side of the 
valley there wont be anything left to burn said bill stalker 
a fire information officer 
however officials remained concerned that winds could shift and 
drive the main fire into dry unburned timber south of the canyon 
towns by this weekend the blaze remained about a mile from the 
towns wednesday officials said 
firefighters sprayed foam on buildings in cooke pass 2 miles 
east of cooke city and saved about 40 structures before the 
searing flames drove crews out

like mammoth roman candles rocket motors 
from two pershing nuclear missiles were burned today becoming the 
first of 867 us missiles to be destroyed under the ussoviet 
intermediaterange arms treaty 
hundreds of people including vice president george bush and a 
team of soviet inspectors watched the static firing in which the 
motors were bolted into a concrete and steel structure ignited and 
allowed to burn up their fuel 
bush used binoculars to watch the first 50second firing at the 
8500acre longhorn army ammunition plant the first pershing 2 
motor burned at 10 am followed 15 minutes later by a 40second 
burning of a lighter pershing 1a 
this is the day that the two nuclear powers began to move 
toward a safer world bush said 
col nikolai chabalin a senior soviet inspector said through 
an interpreter we think it is a great event for the soviet 
people the reduction of two types of nuclear weapons and today we 
have witnessed the fulfillment of a significant event in the 
elimination of these weapons under the treaty 
this is the first elimination of such us missiles under the 
inf treaty anywhere worldwide said susan franklin washington 
spokeswoman for the onsite inspection agency established to help 
carry out the arms treaty 
its interesting said a member of the 12person soviet 
team andire v krutskikh of moscow we have a lot to do 
though 
a small group of michael dukakis presidential supporters and 
other protesters one of whom carried a sign saying texans for a 
sane demilitarization lined the drive to the arsenals front gate 
the soviets watch the motors static firing to eliminate the 
rocket propellant in the motor said dave harris of karnack a 
civilian employee with the us armys redstone arsenal 
we must then physically disable the rocket motor so the motor 
casing could not be reloaded and reused again he said were 
going to do that in a car crusher squash them in a car crusher 
the soviets arrived here wednesday the treaty allows up to 20 
such observers 
theres a cast of thousands behind this thing including many 
ambassadors with people from new york to russia said longhorn

scheduled to be eliminated in the following week at longhorn which 
is 170 miles east of dallas

will be eliminated in west germany 
the treaty also provides for destruction of groundlaunched 
cruise missiles and their launchers at davismonthan air force base 
near tucson ariz said ms franklin 
the treaty became effective this summer and requires the 
superpowers to dismantle and destroy their intermediate and

a congressman asked a house subcommittee 
thursday to toughen a bill aimed at resuming the availability of 
federal land for municipal landfills in the west 
without amendments the bill under consideration leaves the 
government not doing its fair share to clean up rep mike 
synar dokla told the national parks and public lands 
subcommittee of the house interior committee 
federal land controlled by the bureau of land management has 
been leased and sold outright for landfills to hundreds of cities 
towns and counties at belowmarket prices since 1954 the leases 
and deeds have contained clauses requiring a return to federal 
ownership if the land is used for purposes not stated in the lease 
this could leave the federal government liable for cleanup if 
hazardous materials are found in the landfills even though those 
materials may have been placed there during municipal operation of 
the site 
robert burford director of the bureau told the subcommittee 
the liability was potentially enormous but he had no figures 
because of this potential he suspended new deals in february 1987 
bureau spokesman bob johnson said he did not know how many 
cities and counties wanted landfills but there is certainly 
interest 
the maintenance of a waste disposal site facility and cleanup 
of a hazardous waste site are more properly the responsibility of 
the local and state governments and the environmental protection 
agency respectively burford said 
without regular municipal landfills people are going to find 
a place to put their garbage illegally he said 
the environment subcommittee of the government operations 
committee chaired by synar said in a report last year that the 
bureau was ignoring epas guidelines for landfill operations that 
federal agencies are obliged to follow even such provisions as 
requiring fences 
both the delinquent operator and the blm by their failure to 
act are responsible for the mess synar said now if blm just 
passes ownership of the sites off to local jurisdictions it is not 
doing its fair share to clean up 
also he said to apportion the costs and responsibilities of 
any future cleanup blm needs to know the condition of the site 
when it leaves federal ownership 
synar urged the subcommittee to require rigorous inspection 
before any land transfers contaminated land should not be 
transferred until the federal government has taken corrective 
action to eliminate the hazards he said urging that the bill 
require new owners to agree to abide by all federal and state 
hazardous waste regulations 
there are now 336 active sites subject to the reversion 
provision the interior department has estimated that 1000 to 
3000 sites on its lands have been used for municipal waste 
disposal in the past 
there are 37 federally provided landfills in arizona 54 in 
california 16 in colorado 41 in idaho three in montana 44 in 
nevada 51 in new mexico 19 in oregon 35 in utah and 36 in 
wyoming 
the bill would not disturb any federal liability for existing 
hazardous waste even if not discovered yet however it would 
enable the interior secretary to lease or sell land in new 
transactions without reversion requirements if the land is to be 
used for municipal landfills or any purpose which may result in 
the release of hazardous wastes burford said 
blm has suspended operations at 94 sites but bernie hyde the 
bureaus hazardous waste specialist said the agency has no idea 
how many sites may contain hazardous waste 
one site in new mexico has been proposed for the priority 
cleanup list for the superfund toxic waste cleanup program run 
by the epa although federal sites may not receive superfund money 
hyde said inspections are under way at 45 sites and about a third 
of those have been determined to require no action he added

michael dukakis image as a decisive leader has 
declined in the past month while george bushs has improved 
costing dukakis support among independent voters a national poll 
released thursday said 
bush was supported by 50 percent of all likely voters in the 
business week poll to 44 percent for dukakis that was a reversal 
of their standings in a survey for the magazine done aug 49 
before the republican national convention 
the new poll of 1299 likely voters had a margin of error of 
three percentage points putting the race at a statistical dead 
heat however based on the underlying movement to bush we feel 
hes clearly ahead at this point said david krane of louis 
harris amp associates which conducts the business week polls 
the 5044 margin in the survey was similar to a 5143 bush lead 
in an abc newswashington post poll released wednesday the 
abcpost poll was done aug 31 through tuesday business weeks 
sept 1 through tuesday 
both polls were conducted in part during the labor day weekend 
when many people are not home and samples may be less 
representative the post warned that its results should be 
interpreted cautiously krane said he did not believe the 
business week poll had sampling problems 
respondents to the survey expressed some concerns with both 
candidates they split evenly on whether dukakis is too soft on 
crime and said by a 6328 percent margin he is too inexperienced 
in foreign affairs 
on the other hand they said by 5142 percent that bush 
demonstrated poor judgment in the way he picked senator dan 
quayle as his running mate and agreed by 6227 that bush is 
too willing to defend policies of the reagan administration such 
as the iran arms deal whether they worked or not 
asked who is the more decisive leader 46 percent picked bush to 
40 percent for dukakis in the august poll it was 50 percent for 
dukakis to 39 percent for bush the remainder were not sure 
bush had the support of most republicans and dukakis was favored 
by most democrats as in august but then independents were split 
49 percent for bush and 46 percent for dukakis in the new poll 
they went for bush 5439 
the august poll put the race overall at 51 percent for dukakis 
to 45 percent for bush

president reagan wants to use a un visit 
later this month to hold individual talks with allied leaders but 
is not trying to set up a new york summit white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said today 
deluged with questions about a series of stories suggesting 
reagan was trying to get world leaders together fitzwater said the 
president merely had invited the leaders of delegations to the un 
general assembly session to see him while he is in new york 
saying the president will travel to new york sept 26 and 
address the general assembly the next morning fitzwater told 
reporters that news accounts suggesting a summit was being 
attempted were incorrect state department spokesman charles redman 
called one such account wildly inaccurate 
fitzwater answering questions at the daily white house news 
briefing said reagan will hold a number of meetings with heads 
of delegations some on a bilateral basis and some in larger 
groups 
he confirmed previous reports that reagan had invited the 
foreign ministers of egypt and israel to meet with him in new york 
to discuss sagging middle east peace prospects 
in addition the president will meet with foreign ministers or 
heads of state from several other countries during the visit the 
spokesman said were not prepared to announce any specific 
meetings at this time however there are erroneous reports of 
a socalled meeting of industrialized nations and that story is 
false 
fitzwater said that undoubtedly the president will meet either 
informally or at lunch and for dinners with representatives from 
several countries but said that none of these meetings can be 
construed as summits 
whats happened is the presidents having a number of 
meetings and we have of course extended invitations to a number 
of heads of delegations for those meetings he said in some 
cases a head of state intends to be the head of the delegation 
and in many cases it will be the foreign minister 
i think whats happening is we have sent the invitations 
those countries are reporting it and then in the process it gets 
labeled slightly incorrectly fitzwater said 
in paris today the office of president francois mitterrand said 
reagan had asked him to meet sept 27 in new york and that the 
invitation was still under study 
a spokeswoman at the elysee palace speaking on condition of 
anonymity in keeping with the practice on these matters said she 
did not know which other leaders had been invited but understood 
that west germany would be represented by its foreign minister 
mitterrand already is scheduled to meet reagan at the white 
house on sept 29 
in london prime minister margaret thatchers office said there 
had been a communication on the matter to which mrs thatcher 
has not yet responded 
a spokesman for the prime minister requesting anonymity said 
she had no plans to be in the united states in september he noted 
that mrs thatcher has accepted an invitation extended by reagan in 
may to visit him in washington after the election and to meet with 
whoever wins the election

schools and libraries face growing pressure to 
censor the books children read according to a report released 
thursday by the american association of school administrators 
pressures that could result in censorship are increasing and 
that has an adverse effect on the ability of the schools to provide 
a broadbased education for children who will be our future 
leaders said judith krug director of the associations office 
for intellectual freedom 
this pressure comes from people who want to impose their views 
on the educational system by removing or restricting use of certain 
materials according to the report censorship and selection 
issues and answers for schools 
the study was published jointly by the administrators group and 
the american library association 
over the past five years the number of challenges to library 
books and school materials increased by 168 percent the groups 
said 
in many cases the study says those seeking to censor materials 
see themselves as living in a hostile world surrounded by enemies 
people whose world is filled with oughts and shoulds and 
any indication that other people are freer in their decisionmaking 
processes arouses in them severe feelings of anxiety and 
resentment 
it is essential that schools reach out to these people before 
controversy can arise the report suggests cited as a possible 
solution was one case where parents who had heard reports of 
questionable material in some school books were invited to the 
school to read and discuss the books in question 
the teachers learned things from the parents while the parents 
got to understand the books and came to trust the teachers the 
report said

three minutes before he ordered missiles fired 
at the iranian plane approaching his ship july 3 the skipper of 
the uss vincennes acknowledged with a wave of his hand an 
officers warning that it might be a commercial airliner navy 
investigators told congress on thursday 
the warning was called out by one of the officers in the 
confused combat information center of the sophisticated warship 
but other factors prompted capt will c rogers to order two 
missiles fired at the jet in the mistaken belief that it was an 
f14 fighter according to rear adm william m fogarty 
iran air flight 655 an a300 airbus was destroyed and all 290 
people aboard were killed 
fogarty told the senate armed services committee that an 
unidentified officer standing behind rogers called out possible 
comm air commercial aircraft and rogers acknowledged the 
warning with a wave of his hand 
but fogarty said rogers was swayed by factors including its 
takeoff from a militarycivilian airfield its failure to respond 
to warnings from the vincennes and the mistaken beliefs that it 
was outside a commercial air corridor and descending in altitude 
in addition fogarty noted the vincennes had just been in 
combat and was still fighting iranian gunboats in the strait of 
hormuz at the time of the attack fogarty said 
a written summary version of fogartys investigation was 
released to the public three weeks ago as with that report his 
testimony thursday painted a portrait of confusion and human error 
aboard one of the navys most advanced warships 
the vincennes is one of the navys 1 billion aegisclass 
cruisers packed with what the service praises as the worlds most 
sophisticated electronic air defense system 
the aegis system worked well fogarty said but the people 
failed 
for example iran air 655 had been continually climbing from the 
time it took off from bandar abbas and was at 13000 feet when it 
was struck by the two missiles eight miles from the vincennes 
officers in the combat center correctly identified the a300 
airbus as climbing until the plane came to within 15 miles of the 
vincennes when they inexplicably concluded that the plane was 
descending toward the cruiser fogarty said 
the misreading of the altitude was one of the most puzzling 
aspects fogarty said but the investigators were never able to 
figure out how that occurred 
the investigation was unsuccessful in satisfactorily 
reconciling the discrepancy between electronic data which showed 
the plane was still climbing and shouted verbal statements that it 
was descending he said 
the vincennes incorrectly thought the approaching plane was an 
f14 fogarty said but the afteraction report was never able to 
pin down exactly how that identification occurred 
but vincennes officers were looking for f14s he noted in 
part because an f14 had flown toward another us warship the uss 
halsey on july 2 as the halsey was in the strait 
despite the mistakes navy investigators concluded that rogers 
had acted to protect his ship and recommended no punitive actions 
there was no culpable or willful negligence said fogarty 
rogers was protecting his ship and was aware of the example of 
the uss stark 
that was the navy frigate hit by an iraqi missile on may 17 
1987 killing 37 us seamen stark officers were disciplined for 
not protecting their ship 
legislators refused to criticize rogers or the other officers 
i believe this was a tragic mistake said sen james exon 
dneb while sen john warner rva a former secretary of the 
navy said rogers acted correctly in trying to protect his ship 
the easiest thing any of us can do is secondguess and thats 
not what we want to do said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
the incident occurred the first time the vincennes had been in 
combat but the ships crew had been properly trained fogarty said 
but the stress of combat cannot be simulated in any training he 
noted unless you get shot at youre not trained in combat 
the navy is considering adding some type of stress training for 
officers said capt george n gee director of the surface combat 
systems division and a former skipper of aegisclass cruisers 
the vincennes was not protected us awacs airplanes flying 
overhead but the tracking planes wouldnt have made any 
difference fogarty said because they would have received the same 
electronic information as the vincennes 
a nearby warship the frigate sides had tracked the airbus as a 
possible iranian military plane but it concluded the plane was not 
a threat fogarty noted

the chicago amp north western railway and a union 
representing 2600 brakemen today agreed to delay any strike until 
9 am friday after the rushhour commute of 41000 suburban 
chicago riders 
both sides agree that this is a step that is in the best 
interest of commuters said david carle a spokesman for us sen 
paul simon dill 
simon is expected to try to push legislation through congress to 
settle the dispute before the evening rush hour friday 
members of the united transportation union planned to walk out 
at 1201 am friday when a 36day coolingoff period ended but 
compromised in exchange for a promise from the railroad to delay 
layoffs that were to occur on friday 
the railroad and the union are bickering over the size of train 
crews campnw wants to dump 1150 brakemen whose jobs it says are 
obsolete the union believes the jobs are necessary to maintain 
safety 
campnw spokesman james foote said that in delaying the layoffs 
the railroad preserves the commuter rush here in chicago and 
avoids the disruption that would come from a strike at midnight 
talks between the company and the union broke off late wednesday 
and were scheduled to resume today said mike bushman a spokesman 
for us rep terry bruce dill 
foote said wednesday that the company and the union were still 
quite a ways apart 
because of the positions of the two parties were putting our 
strike plans in effect foote said 
the campnw recalled about 8000 replacement workers and mobilized 
management personnel in anticipation of a strike against its 
10state midwest freight system foote said 
the utu went on strike against campnw for four hours aug 4 after 
an earlier coolingoff period imposed by president reagan congress 
ended that walkout by imposing a second coolingoff period 
while the dispute involves campnws freight operations a strike 
would shut down the railroads commuter service forcing an 
estimated 41000 people from chicagos suburbs to find some way 
else to get to work 
officials at metra a suburban commuter rail service that 
purchases service from campnw said a strike would cripple service 
and cause rushhour chaos

homicides deprive americans of more than 600000 
years of life annually the centers for disease control reported 
thursday 
the cdc reported that in 1985 its latest year for such 
statistical analysis the 18351 homicides in the united states 
resulted in 612556 years of potential life lost by the victims 
the atlantabased federal agency tabulates years of potential 
life lost before age 65 as a means of studying the most common 
causes of premature death sixtyfive is a statistical benchmark 
actual life expectancy is higher 
on average a homicide victim in the united states is 32 the 
cdc said 
since 1968 the toll of homicides in terms of potential life 
has risen 44 percent the cdc reported during that same time the 
total of lifeyears lost to early deaths from all causes went down 
25 percent 
the dramatic increase in homicideattributable premature 
death since 1968 highlights the need for public health efforts 
directed toward the prevention of interpersonal violence said 
the weekly report of the cdc 
the cdc report from its injury epidemiology and control 
division called for increased cooperation among the criminal 
justice social services health care mental health and public 
health sectors to prompt development of effective programs for 
prevention of homicides 
the major method of homicide continues to be firearms the cdc 
reported firearms and explosives accounted for 61 percent of the 
potential lifeyears lost to homicide in 1985 or 376291 years 
black males continue to have the highest homicide rate the cdc 
said in 1985 6284 black men died from homicide a rate of 49 
out of every 100000 white men died in 7467 homicides for a rate 
of 8 per 100000 
but the cdc cited studies published earlier this year showing 
that the homicide rate for young black men is dropping 
the homicide rate for black males 1524 the highestrisk group 
for homicide has fallen 13 percent since 1978 from 1934 
homicides and a rate of 70 per 100000 in 1978 to 1710 homicides 
and a rate of 62 per 100000 in 1984 
federal health officials have a goal of reducing the homicide 
rate among black males 1524 to less than 60 per 100000 by the 
next decade the statistics suggest the 1990 objective for 
this target group can be attained the cdc said 
black female homicides numbered 1550 or 11 per 100000 2630 
white females died in homicides at a rate of 3 per 100000

president reagan plans a series of meetings 
with allied officials during his visit late this month to the 
united nations but the president has not attempted to turn the 
occasion into a western summit his spokesman said thursday 
chief spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed earlier reports that 
reagan had invited the foreign ministers of egypt and israel to 
meet with him to discuss the stalled mideast peacemaking process 
he also said that reagan had invited other world figures to meet 
individually with him during reagans twoday stay sept 2627 
but fitzwater vigorously denied a report that reagan had sought 
to use the opening of the un general assembly session to hold a 
summit with the heads of government or heads of state of western 
allies 
news accounts suggesting such a move he said are incorrect 
at the state department spokesman charles redman dismissed such 
speculation as wildly inaccurate 
fielding several questions on this subject at the daily white 
house news briefing fitzwater confirmed that reagan will hold a 
number of meetings with heads of delegations some on a bilateral 
basis and some in larger groups 
in addition the president will meet with foreign ministers or 
heads of state from several other countries during the visit he 
said were not prepared to announce any specific meetings at 
this time however there are erroneous reports of a socalled 
meeting of industrialized nations and that story is false 
fitzwater said that undoubtedly the president will meet either 
informally or at lunch and for dinners with representatives from 
several countries but said that none of these meetings can be 
construed as summits 
whats happened is the presidents having a number of 
meetings and we have of course extended invitations to a number of 
heads of delegations for those meetings he said in some 
cases a head of state intends to be the head of the delegation 
and in many cases it will be the foreign minister 
i think whats happening is we have sent the invitations 
those countries are reporting it and then in the process it gets 
labeled slightly incorrectly fitzwater said 
in paris thursday the office of president francois mitterrand 
said reagan had asked mitterrand to meet with him sept 27 in new 
york and that the invitation was still under study 
mitterrand already had been scheduled to meet reagan at the 
white house on sept 29 these and other responses to the 
invitations sent by the white house evidently spurred the reports 
of attempts to arrange a summit 
fitzwater said he knew of no plan by reagan to try to see each 
of the heads of state or government of the western allies before he 
leaves office next january 
british prime minister margaret thatcher who singled reagan out 
for praise in a warm farewell speech at the conclusion of the 
sevennation economic summit last june in toronto is scheduled to 
visit here in november

a federal judge has lifted a 1971 
busing order in the citys schools ruling that segregationist 
practices have been eliminated 
us district judge john h moore ii in a decision issued 
tuesday lifted the 17yearold desegregation order that ushered in 
crosstown busing 
the school system is now free to redraw boundary lines reduce 
crosstown busing and set its own standards for an integrated school 
system said jannell byrd an attorney for the naacp legal defense 
and education fund inc 
school board chairman billy parker said today there would be no 
immediate changes but predicted at least 25 percent of the 9000 
students being bused for desegregation reasons could return to 
their neighborhood schools next fall 
some busing will continue in places where it would otherwise be 
impossible to maintain an integrated school system he said 
school superintendent herb sang predicted today that the 
students being bused with be able to attend classes in their 
neighborhoods in two years 
willye dennis the leader of the jacksonville branch of the 
naacp said the organization maintains the school system is not 
desegregated 
we need to get the message out to the community that if this 
case is not appealed we are going to be in a bind she said 
moore found that segregationist practices do not exist despite 
some imbalances in the school systems racial makeup the 
104000student school systems ratio of white students to black 
students is 65 percent to 35 percent 
the judge said the school system had done a reasonable job of 
attempting to maintain racial balance although he said practical 
problems got in the way 
moore wrote that duval countys size about twothirds the size 
of rhode island made it difficult to rectify shifts in population 
patterns through busing 
he judge ruled that the facilities and curriculum were equal at 
all county schools jacksonville and duval county have the same 
borders

jury selection in one of the biggest civil 
cases in us history began today with the judge warning 
prospective jurors that the washington public power supply system 
fraud trial could last several months 
however us district judge william browning also said he would 
do what he could to accommodate those selected as jurors including 
providing parking and lodgings in town for people from beyond the 
metropolitan area 
jury selection was expected to be completed friday 
twenty jurors will be seated to hear the lawsuit which arose 
over wppss default on 225 billion in bonds sold to finance 
construction of two nuclear plants 
the plants were scrapped after they were partially built and 
the subsequent 1983 default was the biggest in the history of the 
municipal bond market leaving 40000 people holding worthless 
bonds 
more than 24000 people who bought the bonds sued alleging 
fraud in the planning and construction 
the trial had been expected to take eight months to two years 
but settlements with many of the 100plus defendants are expected 
to cut the duration to a year at most 
the case was moved to arizona because jurors in the northwest 
might have to pay for any jury award through their electricity 
rates and might therefore be ifluenced in their verdict 
named as defendants were wppss its member utilities the 88 
utilities that contracted with wppss to build the plants bond 
underwriters and engineering and financial consulting firms 
settlements totaling 351 million have reduced the number of 
defendants to 20 washington utilities an oregon utility two 
engineering firms and a company that gave financial advice to wppss

despite rising interest rates us businesses 
plan to boost plant and equipment spending to record levels this 
year as capital investment remains one of the strongest sectors of 
the economy the government reported thursday 
the commerce department said a survey found that businesses plan 
to spend 4294 billion after adjusting for inflation topping the 
previous high of 3916 billion set in 1985 
this 116 percent increase over the 1987 spending total if 
realized would mark the biggest percentage jump since a 166 
percent rise in 1984 when american industry was still recovering 
from the steep 198182 recession 
capital spending is the main driving force in the economy at 
the present time and there are no signs that it is going to ease 
off said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
so far this year business spending on plant and equipment and a 
boom in export sales have accounted for almost threefourths of 
total economic growth 
the two developments are closely related as american 
manufacturers have rushed to expand production facilities in an 
effort to meet growing overseas demand for their goods 
sinai estimated that onethird of us industry is operating at 
full capacity providing a strong incentive to boost investment 
overall american industry is operating at 835 percent of 
capacity the highest rate in eight years 
the high operating rates have led to concerns that the economy 
is beginning to push against capacity constraints and tight labor 
markets resulting in rising inflationary pressures 
the federal reserve has been pushing up interest rates since 
late march as a way of fighting inflation by dampening demand 
economists said the rate increases so far will not likely trigger 
any cutbacks in investment plans this year although they expect a 
slowdown in 1989 
it takes time to make capital investment decisions so higher 
interest rates wont slow this spending over the next several 
months said jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national 
association of manufacturers 
companies are making major increases in capital spending to 
expand capacity and reduce costs through greater use of 
informationprocessing equipment he said noting that half of 
the equipment spending in 1987 went to purchase computers and 
related equipment 
the new estimate of business investment plans released thursday 
was based on company surveys completed over the past two months 
it represented only a small change from a june report that 
estimated spending would rise 119 percent this year both surveys 
represented substantial gains from estimates made at the beginning 
of the year that investment would only climb by 73 percent this 
year 
in 1987 investment spending edged up a modest 23 percent after 
having fallen 39 percent in 1986 analysts said some of the 
rebound this year reflected pentup demand after two sluggish 
spending years 
this is a very typical pattern where there is a rush to spend 
on plant and equipment after a period of hesistation as companies 
waited to be sure of the business environment sinai said 
the weakness in 1986 and 1987 was blamed on the soaring us 
trade deficit which sent the manufacturing sector into a slump as 
a flood of imports reduced domestic demand for us goods at the 
same time american companies were being priced out of overseas 
markets 
this year manufacturers expect to boost spending by 125 
percent with all durablegoods industries except automobiles 
planning to boost investment over the 1987 level 
the largest increase in production of nondurable goods those 
expected to last less than three years is forecast in the paper 
industry plants there are operating at 928 percent of capacity 
the highest level of any industry 
in nonmanufacturing industries the report predicted an 
increase of 124 percent in capital investment by transportation 
companies including airlines it saw only a 13 percent rise in 
investment spending by public utilities which have faced problems 
of slumping electric power demand and delays in licensing nuclear 
plants throughout most of the decade 
the mining industry which includes oil and gas exploration 
projected a 55 percent increase in spending in 1988 representing 
only a modest rebound after big declines in the past two years 
because of falling world energy prices 
before removing the effects of inflation business investment is 
projected to rise by 106 percent this year to 4309 billion 
following an increase of 27 percent in 1987

leonid brezhnevs soninlaw pleaded guilty 
thursday to abusing his office when he was deputy interior minister 
but told a military court he did not take bribes a crime 
punishable by death 
on the fourth day of a trial so far devoted almost entirely to 
reading of 1500 pages of corruption charges against yuri churbanov 
and eight codefendants judge mikhail marov asked churbanov if he 
understood the charges 
yes they were understood churbanov replied standing 
before the court i admit my guilt in abuse of office but dont 
admit my guilt in receiving bribes 
churbanov was accused of accepting cash wines cognac exotic 
fruits and other gifts worth more than 1 million while he was 
first deputy interior minister under brezhnev the soviet leader 
from 1964 until his death in 1982 
prosecutors contend the web of corruption stretched all the way 
to churbanovs boss the late nikolai a shchelokov who was a 
close friend of brezhnev 
court records confirmed earlier reports that shchelokov 
committed suicide after investigators began examining his conduct 
as interior minister 
under soviet leader mikhail gorbachev brezhnevs years in power 
are now condemned officially as years of stagnation in which 
the economy slumped mistakes were made in foreign policy and 
corruption and cronynism prevailed 
almost daily criticism of him appears in the soviet press 
streets and towns have been stripped of his name a palace built 
for him has been turned over to the public and libraries have been 
told not to carry literature produced during his rule 
judge marov an army major general said churbanov would be 
required to clarify his plea in the course of the trial 
churbanovs lawyer andrei m makarov told a reporter 
punishment for abuse of office is 10 years in jail if convicted of 
taking bribes the 51yearold former official could face a firing 
squad 
makarov told a reporter he would not clarify the plea now but 
the explanation would come out during the trial it is expected to 
last about two months but thursday was the last day foreign 
reporters were permitted to attend 
khaidar yakhyaev former interior minister of the central asian 
republic of uzbekistan pleaded guilty thursday to all charges 
against him on wednesday he claimed officials pressured him in 
prison to confess 
the other defendants all former officials of uzbekistan 
pleaded guilty to taking bribes but not always to the extent 
prosecutors alleged 
in summarizing the charges the prosecution said the 
demoralization reached unheardof levels especially in the party 
organs of the republic of uzbekistan 
mrs churbanov the former galina brezhnev has not attended 
trial sessions her husbands lawyer said she was ill and would 
testify for her husband later 
the lesser defendants according to the indictment accepted 
money and gifts from underlings in exchange for jobs promotions 
and special perquisites of many descriptions the indictment says

discoverys astronauts donned orange 
pressure suits and threw switches in a successful practice 
countdown thursday and nasa officials said they hope to launch the 
first space shuttle since the challenger tragedy this month 
the national aeronautics and space administration plans to 
announce a launch date wednesday following a twoday flight 
readiness review here officials have been discussing a date from 
sept 26 to 29 
we clearly demonstrated that were ready to pick up the count 
for real i hope that we will be able to do that by the end of the 
month kennedy space center director forrest s mccartney told 
the launch team after the test 
it certainly sets the stage for what were about ready to do 
here in just a few weeks launch director bob sieck added 
you have a feeling this train is about to leave the station 
and were about to get on board said astronaut mike lounge 
the enthusiasm around here is obvious mccartney said it 
seems to me like weve finally got it put back together 
he referred to the long recovery with its many setbacks and 
milestones from the challenger explosion that killed seven 
astronauts on jan 28 1986 
thursdays practice countdown was the last of those major 
milestones and it was completed with only a few minor 
communications glitches 
it began wednesday and the fiveman discovery crew boarded the 
shuttle thursday to participate in the final two hours throwing 
switches testing communications and monitoring systems just as 
they will on launch day 
the commander is navy capt rick hauck the pilot is air force 
lt col dick covey and the mission specialists are george nelson 
lounge and marine maj david hilmers all have flown on shuttle 
missions 
for the test they wore bright orange pressure suits the first 
time a crew has not worn comfortable flight coveralls since the 
fifth shuttle mission in 1982 
the pressure garments which all shuttle crews will wear on 
launch and reentry would be needed in case of trouble during an 
emergency landing attempt and the astronauts had to bail out by 
blowing an explosive hatch sliding down a telescoping pole to 
avoid hitting the wing and parachuting to earth 
this emergency escape system has been added since the challenger 
explosion it would not help in a challengertype accident in 
which the shuttle blew up 73 seconds after liftoff 
the communications problems in ground equipment delayed some 
practice countdown activities and the test ended 34 minutes late a 
computer stopped the count at six seconds before a mock liftoff 
just as it would if there were an engine problem on an actual 
launch giving the launch team experience in handling such a 
situation 
the test concluded three days of training here for discoverys 
crew afterward they returned to their base at the johnson space 
center in houston 
hauck and lounge will be back here next week to represent the 
crew at the flight readiness review which will determine a launch 
date 
hauck said the meeting on tuesday and wednesday is an 
indepth review that all elements of the program will have a 
requirement to sign on the dotted line to say that their part of 
the program is ready for us to fly

the energy department urged congress on 
thursday to give speedy approval to legislation allowing the 
government to open in new mexico the nations first permanent dump 
for radioactive garbage resulting from nuclear weapons production 
but rep bill richardson dnm said he will insist that the 
waste isolation pilot plant or wipp meet standards still being 
developed by the environmental protection agency before any nuclear 
trash is stored at the 10000acre site east of carlsbad 
troy e wade ii acting assistant energy secretary for defense 
programs countered that limited storage of nuclear wastes is 
necessary for an experimental fiveyear period to help scientists 
determine compliance with epa regulations 
richard j guimond director of the epas office of radiation 
programs agreed saying experimental storage would better 
information to make that determination 
richardson said there is no way the wipp facility can begin 
receiving the first of 210000 tons of radioactive trash by next 
months target date because the steel containers for transporting 
the wastes have proved unsatisfactory in performance tests 
wade said tests of a redesigned container are nearing 
completion and certification is expected before the end of the 
year 
richardson presided over a house energy and commerce 
subcommittee hearing on a compromise bill that would withdraw 
federal lands from other uses at the carlsbad site with permanent 
jurisdiction going to the energy department for operation of the 
wipp facility 
wipp is designed to provide permanent disposal of 63 million 
cubic feet of radioactive garbage from nuclear weapons factories 
such as plutoniumcontaminated gloves bottles pipes and valves 
in rock salt beds 2150 feet below ground 
the trash would be transported to new mexico by truck from 
nuclear weapons plants around the country the bulk of it from the 
idaho national engineering laboratory and the rocky flats plant 
outside denver

leonid brezhnev was revived from clinical death in 
1976 but was left so senile and weakened he had difficulty 
performing simple tasks the last six years of his rule a soviet 
historian says 
the historian roy medvedev wrote in an article entitled 
advantages of mediocrity that the late president and communist 
party general secretary was weakwilled untalented and the object 
of ridicule among many soviets 
medvedev said brezhnev ceased to understand what was going on 
around him and his public appearances during which he had to be 
held by each arm drew public ire 
the soviet leaders senility infirmity and sickness became a 
subject not so much of compassion and pity on the part of soviet 
citizens but rather of irritation and mockery expressed ever more 
openly medvedev wrote 
the article in the latest edition of the weekly moscow news 
was published while brezhnevs soninlaw yuri churbanov and eight 
codefendants were being tried in moscow on corruption and bribery 
charges 
churbanov the husband of brezhnevs daughter galina was deputy 
interior minister under his fatherinlaw he pleaded guilty 
thursday to abuse of office but denied taking bribes prosecutors 
alleged he accepted 1 million in bribes 
the trial and appearance of medvedevs article are part of the 
increasingly harsh assessment of brezhnevs rule taking place under 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev brezhnevs rule from 1964 until 
his death in 1982 are now condemned officially as years of 
stagnation in which the economy slumped mistakes were made in 
foreign policy and corruption and cronynism prevailed 
a campaign has been launched to rid the country of brezhnevs 
legacy almost daily criticism of him appears in the soviet press 
streets and towns have been stripped of his name a palace built 
for him has been turned over to the public and libraries cannot 
carry literature produced during his rule 
medvedev said brezhnevs health worsened in 1969 or 1970 until 
at one point in early 1976 he was clinically dead and after 
being revived had to wait for three months for his thinking and 
speech to normalize he did not say what brezhnev nearly died of 
the leaders working day was cut to a few hours and it became 
increasingly difficult for him to perform even the simplest 
protocol duties medvedev wrote 
medvedev described brezhnev who died at age 75 as a vain man 
whose jacket was heavy with military decorations even though he 
took no part in the decisive battles of the patriotic war world 
war ii 
throughout most of his life brezhnev advanced by being 
unoffensive to political cronies medvedev suggested 
he wasnt a climber who elbowed his way to the top or betrayed 
his friends he was calm loyal to colleagues and higherups he 
didnt so much move ahead himself as he was moved ahead by 
others medvedev said 
a notoriously poor speaker brezhnev made speeches almost weekly 
in which he often mispronounced words long words being the 
hardest for him his speechwriters were strictly instructed not to 
include long words in prepared texts medvedev wrote 
brezhnev got his start in the ukrainian city of 
dneprodzerzhinsk he became party chief in moldavia and later was 
sent by nikita khrushchev to kazakhstan to direct land reclamation 
he returned to moscow two years later and managed to transfer 
some of the people he had worked with in moldavia and the ukraine 
to moscow the historian wrote 
medvedev said brezhnev moved into the power seat because his 
donothing approach was exactly what officials wanted after 
khrushchev who was constantly pushing reform 
after khrushchevs removal the top partystate apparatus 
didnt want an overly strong leader they wanted a quieter life and 
quieter work brezhnevs victory was thus based on weakness and the 
absence of obvious ambition and craving for power the article 
said 
medvedev said brezhnevs legacy is of mismanagement 
irresponsibility the corruption eroding society became more 
abashed and insolent the abuses of power and the embezzling on 
large and small scales became the norm 
medvedev was expelled from the communist party under brezhnev 
and his brother zhores was declared insane soviet publications 
began printing some of roy medvedevs controversial works only this 
year under gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness 
he is the author of let history judge a celebrated 
indictment of the stalinist period that has yet to be published in 
the soviet union along with zhores he also has written a piercing 
criticism of khrushchev

university of delaware was a political unknown four years ago when 
he bucked the democratic party leadership defeated two legislators 
in a primary and won election to his mainly ceremonial post by 479 
votes 
instead of seeking reelection woo now is hoping to go after 
roth who is running for a fourth term 
but first he must defeat samuel s beard a 49yearold former 
staffer to the late sen robert f kennedy who later launched a 
nonprofit company which helps obtain grants and designs plans to 
attract economic development 
a poll conducted late last month for the wilmington news journal 
showed woo supported by 45 percent of likely voters beard by 31 
percent and 24 percent undecided 
but beard has heavy support from unions and unofficial backing 
from democratic leaders and some observers think the outcome could 
depend on voter turnout 
if its a light vote sam beard can win because most of the 
party people are going to vote for him said state party chairman 
samu 70 percent of 
his milliondollarplus campaign warchest from chineseamericans 
across the nation 
people are very proud that a chineseamerican is running for a 
high office said charles siegel woos spokesman 
going into the primary woo had 407998 on hand compared to 
beards 65008 roth who has no primary opponent had 734933 
woos ethnic background became an issue in the campaign when 
edward pete peterson president of the state aflcio wrote an 
open letter backing beard in which he said it is up to you and i 
to save this country not only from the asian influences the lt 
gov refers to but all foreign influence 
earlier this week peterson wrote another letter apologizing to 
anyone offended by that statement he said he was referring to 
woos claims that he has many contacts with business leaders in 
asia

e robert wallach awaiting trial on 
racketeering charges in the wedtech bribery case came to the 
national press club thursday and asked reporters to help him repair 
his reputation 
the san francisco lawyer said he may have made honest 
mistakes in his dealings in washington after the reagan 
administration and his longtime friend edwin meese iii came to 
power 
but wallach 54 said he bore no resemblance to the venal 
influencepeddler depicted in news accounts that bob wallach he 
said never existed does not exist did not exist 
wallach portrayed himself as the victim of a vendetta by the 
media and investigators to drive meese from office meese the 
former white house counselor resigned last month after 3 
embattled years as attorney general 
wallach goes on trial in new york jan 3 on federal racketeering 
and conspiracy charges he allegedly tried to influence meese and 
other public officials on behalf of wedtech corp the bronx ny 
defense contractor that collapsed in a bribery scandal 
independent counsel james mckay reported in july that meese 
helped wallach in his efforts in 1981 and 1982 to secure a 32 
million enginebuilding contract for wedtech from the army and 
also aided his friend in 1985 in connection with a 1 billion iraqi 
oil pipeline project wallach was paid 150000 by a partner in the 
pipeline project 
the 150000 was pooled with meeses money and that of other 
investors by financial manager w franklyn chinn who turned a 
40000 profit for meese on a 50000 investment in 18 months 
mckay said wallach steered meese to chin arranged two loans for 
meese and helped line up a 40000 job for meeses wife ursula 
but mckay decided not to seek any indictment of meese and said 
there was no direct evidence that mr meese accepted anything of 
value from mr wallach with the requisite state of mind for a 
gratuities violation 
wallach who was paid from 13 million to 14 million by 
wedtech said wedtechs officers have conned everybody and 
falsely accused him of soliciting money to quash the investigation 
im telling you i am an innocent man im telling you the 
system caught an innocent man and the media played a role in it 
wallach said 
i am persuaded that much of what went on was an effort to 
drive ed meese from office i proved to be a most attractive 
vehicle to help accomplish that goal he said 
wallach said a great senior figure of the washington 
community had commiserated with him telling him i should have 
explained to you where the paths were in the jungle 
is that what its about if a person comes here and makes an 
honest mistake and i think i made some mistakes does that mean 
you fall into the pit with stakes and its all over with youre 
finished and thats the end is there no forgiveness for honest 
mistakes must it always be read in the light of malevolence and 
evildoing and wrongdoing is the only access to success in your 
career to destroy someone he asked the reporters 
he depicted himself as a selfmade man a grandson of jewish 
immigrants who won a scholarship and worked his way through college 
to become a pillar of the san francisco bar and backer of liberal 
causes 
i want you to know that i am not one of the great moneymakers 
of the california legal profession i frankly never really was 
that i always made a very good living but only practiced about 
halftime because i was doing a lot of other things including a 
lot of pro bono activities and teaching he said my practice 
died because of the media coverage 
but he said his friendship with meese has never been breached 
the friendship is intact 
wallach lodged the same complaints wednesday night at an 
american university forum on the press where he was joined by 
former white house political director lyn nofziger who is 
appealing a conviction on illegal lobbying charges

president reagan ordered a cabinetlevel team 
thursday to visit the forest fire zones in the west to see what 
more the federal government can do to help but the white house 
said nobody knows when or whether the fires can be put out 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater also said that no 
federal officials are expected to resign or be discharged because 
the blazes were allowed to spread 
there has been criticism of the national park service for 
following during the early stages of this summers disastrous 
fires its usual practice of allowing them to burn to encourage 
reforestation 
some critics including lawmakers have called for the 
resignation of william penn mott the director of the park service 
fitzwater said reagan directed agriculture secretary richard 
lyng interior secretary donald hodel and deputy defense secretary 
william h taft iv to go to the western states this weekend to 
confer with governors assess the situation and report to the 
president next week 
he said one likely outcome is that more army troops will be sent 
to supplement the 2500 now on the firelines 
the spokesman said hodel brought up the subject of the calls for 
penns resignation but there was no discussion of it 
there are no plans to fire anybody fitzwater said that 
call represents an understandable frustration by people who have 
been living with a great natural disaster but that hasnt really 
been a significant issue we dont expect any departures 
as to the outlook for the future fitzwater said the feeling 
from the two secretaries is that we can be effective up to a point 
but no one is willing to speculate on whether or not the fire can 
be totally extinguished or in how long a period of time 
the agriculture department is the parent of the forest service 
and the interior department includes the park service together 
the two agencies control much of the 15 million acres of 
timberland on which fires are raging 
of the park services policy of allowing the fires to burn 
which has since been abandoned with regard to the current 
conflagrations fitzwater said everyone accepts that that was 
the right course in the sense that good forest practice for the 
past several years has been to allow a certain amount of burning 
for purposes of resforestation 
i think there is a general expectation that we can hold the 
line but we have got to stay with it and probably will need some 
resources he said 
he said the fire season in the pacific coast states is now 
beginning so while we may be able to see some control occur in 
the montanawyomingyellowstone area it may be starting up in the 
west and that is going to demand more resources 
we could well be moving a lot more military resources into 
this the spokesman said i would expect that out of this trip 
will come some recommendations along this line 
fitzwater said reagan called the meeting after sen alan 
simpson rwyo told the president during a meeting with 
republican congressional leaders on wednesday that he wanted to 
express the anguish of his constituents and others in the region 
who have lost homes and jobs because of the fires 
the spokesman said reagan received a status report at thursdays 
meeting saying that 2600 firefighters from 39 states were fighting 
34 major blazes covering 15 million acres

president reagan today dispatched a 
cabinetlevel team to the west to see what additional federal help 
is needed in fighting forest fires and the white house said the 
number of troops on the fire line is likely to be increased 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan met with agriculture 
secretary richard lyng interior secretary donald hodel and deputy 
defense secretary william h taft iv 
the three official are expected to leave for the west tomorrow 
fitzwater said they would visit yellowstone national park and other 
areas suffering from fires that have now covered 15 million acres 
in six states 
fitzwater said 2500 military personnel are now fighting the 
fires and this number may very well be increased 
i would expect that out of this trip will come some 
recommendation along this line the spokesman said 
fitzwater said reagan called todays meeting after sen alan 
simpson rwyo expressed concern about the fire situation at a 
meeting of republican congressional leaders with the president on 
wednesday 
although some critics of the park services policy of allowing 
many fires that begin naturally to burn have called for the 
resignation of the director of the park service fitzwater said 
we have no plans to fire anybody 
he said hodel whose department encompasses the park service 
brought the subject of these calls for resignation up briefly 
during the meeting but there was no discussion of it 
our feeling is that the agriculture department and the 
interior department have responded very effectively and were 
right to let the fires burn fitzwater said 
the policy was abandoned july 22 he said because of the 
unparalleled intensity of the blazes 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo met wednesday with hodel and 
suggested that william penn mott the park service director ought 
to resign 
hodel and mott have clashed in the past but today hodel 
rejected wallops suggestion saying in a statement 
i dont know anyone with greater love and concern for the 
national parks than bill mott he and the national park service 
professionals advising him assure me they are doing everything in 
their power what they need at this time is our understanding 
of the difficulties they face and our support 
in a news conference wednesday mott and forest service 
officials admitted that in hindsight they should have fought every 
fire from the beginning 
of the 13 fires now burning in yellowstone five started before 
july 22 and initially were allowed to burn the other eight were 
fought from the beginning the officials said

british commandoes who shot to death three 
irish republican army guerrillas fired into the head of one irish 
nationalist as he lay bleeding on the ground a pathologist 
testified thursday 
glasgow university professor alan watson said at least four of 
the bullets fired into the head of sean savage 24 were fired 
downward by a soldier as he stood over the ira members body 
a second pathologist called as a witness by the attorney for 
the family supported watsons view 
watson who conducted autopsies on the men testified on the 
third day of an inquest by coroner feliz pizzarello and an 11man 
jury into the march 6 shooting deaths in this british colony of ira 
members savage 24 mairead farrell 31 and daniel mccann 30 
the ira has acknowledged the trio were on active service 
when they were killed by british soldiers the ira regularly 
employs the phrase to refer to members on missions to attack 
british military targets 
the inquest is being held to determine whether the shooting 
deaths were lawful but it has no power of prosecution still 
gibraltars attorney general is expected to return criminal 
indictments if the jury finds that the killings were unlawful 
a senior british intelligence official who testified wednesday 
said the british soldiers shot the three unarmed ira members 
because they wrongly believed they were armed and on the verge of 
detonating a car bomb in the british fortress colony 
the official only identified as o for security reasons 
testified to the court behind a curtain 
at the start of his testimony watson spent 10 minutes detailing 
the wounds to the three ira members 
he said savage was shot 18 times five times in the back five 
times in the head and eight times in various parts of the body 
farrell received five shots to the head and neck and three shots 
in the back watson said while mccann received two bullets in the 
head and two more in the back 
watsons statements were based on the postmortem examination he 
conducted the day after the shootings 
michael hucker the attorney for the seven soldiers involved in 
the shootings and believed to be members of the elite british 
antiterrorist regiment special air services sas sought to show 
that the soldiers believed the three men may have still been 
dangerous despite having fallen to the ground 
watson said it would have been possible for the injured men to 
push a button a reference to the car bomb british intelligence had 
thought the group was preparing to set off in the center of the 
colony at spains southernmost tip 
a second pathologist derek pounder professor of forensic 
medicine at dundee university in dundee scotland told the inquest 
he also had concluded that savage was shot in the head while lying 
faceup on the ground 
it is clear from the scrapes around the margins of the wound 
on the left side of savages neck that the bullet was coming from 
the feet of mr savage pounder said 
the intelligence official o told the inquest wednesday that 
british commandoes had been informed prior to the shooting that the 
ira members were dangerous terrorists who almost certainly would 
be armed and if confronted by security service personnel would be 
likely to use their weapons 
critics of british prime minister margaret thatchers government 
say the killings were part of an unofficial shoottokill 
policy against ira members british authorities said the three men 
were planning a car bomb attack at the site where the royal anglian 
regiment band accompanies a weekly changing of the guard ceremony 
the inquest which is to hear about 70 witnesses including the 
seven soldiers involved in the shootings is expected to continue 
through the next four weeks

a scaleddown version of a senateapproved 
bill authorizing a monument to american women who served in the 
vietnam war was approved thursday by a house subcommittee 
the senate bill approved 961 in midjune specifies that a 
bronze statue of an army nurse be erected on the 22acre grounds 
of the vietnam veterans memorial near the lincoln memorial 
but the measure approved thursday by the house administration 
subcommittee on libraries and memorials written as a substitute 
for the senate version says only that a monument to the 10000 
american women who served in vietnam can be built somewhere on 
federal land in the washington metropolitan area 
this will force separate votes by congress on a specific site 
and design for the monument as well as review by three federal 
agencies 
critics including sen daniel j evans rwash who cast the 
dissenting senate vote say a womens statue would violate the 
artistic integrity of the vietnam veterans memorial and create a 
sculpture garden for specialinterest groups 
the names of more than 58000 us military personnel killed or 
missing in the southeast asian conflict which are inscribed on the 
black granite wall of the vietnam memorial include those of eight 
female nurses 
some critics have suggested that a tribute to women who served 
in vietnam might be included in a monument to all women of the us 
armed forces which is to be built at the entrance to arlington 
national cemetery 
the proposal to erect a womens statue at the vietnam memorial 
the most popular tourist attraction of all national monuments in 
washington has been endorsed by the interior department but 
opposed by the commission on fine arts and the national capital 
planning commission 
the approval of all three federal agencies is required for the 
site design and construction of any federal monument 
if the full house administration committee approves the 
subcommittees version as expected a house vote is tentatively 
scheduled for sept 19 followed by senate action 
any such monument would be built with private funds and 
maintained by the national park service

a multimilliondollar kidnapping ransom could be 
bankrolling efforts by the japanese red army to disrupt the 
olympics japanese news reports said friday 
the reports quoted police sources as saying that the red army 
masterminded a 1986 kidnapping in the philippines that netted the 
terrorist group up to 3 million in ransom 
japan warned foreign countries thursday that the red armys 
possible windfall from the hefty ransom would increase dramatically 
the chances that the terrorist group is planning to disrupt the 
games which begin a week from saturday in seoul south korea 
red army members who are under arrest or being sought by 
international security authorities used filipino operatives to 
cover their tracks police sources were quoted in the reports as 
saying 
nobuyuki wakaoji then 53 and head of the philippine branch of 
the japanese trading giant mitsui and co was kidnapped in 
november 1986 by a gunwielding band of filipinos as he was 
returning home from a golf game 
he was released four and a half months later after mitsui 
reportedly paid a ransom of up to 3 million police wakaoji and 
mitsui officials have denied knowledge of any ransom 
the case strained relations between manila and tokyo and 
resulted in a drop in japanese tourism to the philippines and 
worries over japanese investment in the southeast asian country 
red army members osamu maruoka 37 arrested in tokyo last 
november for traveling on a forged passport and norio sasaki 40 
who is wanted for traveling on a bogus passport were behind the 
kidnapping the reports said 
night duty officers at the national police agency and foreign 
ministry said they could not confirm the reports 
when maruoka was arrested he had a oneway plane ticket to 
seoul leading police to suspect he was planning to set up or make 
contact with a radical network to interfere with the olympics 
the reports did not say how police concluded that wakaoji was 
kidnapped by the red army it did say that the kidnappers skillful 
manipulation of the japanese media and similarities with a bungled 
red army kidnapping case in west germany in 1974 led police to 
suspect a connection with the japanese terror group 
i never thought it might have been the red army wakaoji 
told kyodo news service in a telephone interview early friday 
when i was taken there was no sign of any japanese and the 
filipinos spoke among themselves in tagalog they never spoke the 
names of maruoka or sasaki said wakaoji who now heads mitsuis 
sapporo branch in northern japan 
the red army formed in the late 1960s was behind a machine gun 
and grenade attack on lod airport in israel in 1972 that left 26 
people dead 
suspected groups of red army members hijacked a japan air lines 
jet to north korea in 1970 and another jal plane to saudi arabia in 
1977 
italian police are looking for two red army members believed to 
be behind a bomb blast outside a us military club in naples in 
april the same month another suspected member was arrested in the 
united states in possession of a large amount of explosives 
the group called for simultaneous world revolution and had 
an estimated 300 members in its heyday it had been dormant for a 
decade until the spate of arrests and incidents in the last year

burundi shaken by a wave of ethnic killings 
last month has assured the world bank that all its citizens share 
equally in the benefits of the banks multimilliondollar aid 
programs for the central african country a world bank official 
said thursday 
we were terribly shocked and dismayed by the tragic events in 
burundi edward vk jaycox world bank vice president for 
africa told reporters at least 5000 people were reported slain 
in battles during august between burundis ruling tutsi tribe and 
the majority hutus 
bank officials were especially distressed by the violence 
because the government that took power in a 1987 coup had pushed 
forward vigorously a policy of equality jaycox said the hutus 
make up 85 percent of the 5 million population but hold relatively 
few government or military posts 
the reforms included elimination of burundis internal pass 
laws which were oppressive to the majority hutus and 
restricted the labor market jaycox continued

the house today amended a 2 billion antidrug 
bill to permit death sentences against those convicted of murder 
during drugrelated felonies the vote was 299111 
rep george gekas rpa author of the provision said it would 
be a swift and certain deterrent to drug killers 
the death penalty debate was the first major controversy as the 
house considered some three dozen amendments to the antidrug 
legislation 
the provision went one step further than a 4101 vote earlier 
for a mandatory life sentence for drug killers the capital 
punishment provision would give federal judges an additional option 
when killings occur during drug crimes 
the life sentence vote was proposed by rep charles b rangel 
dny a death penalty opponent who offered his amendment as an 
alternative only rep george w crockett jr dmich opposed the 
rangel amendment 
a similar amendment by gekas was added to an antidrug bill two 
years ago by a 296112 vote but the provision was later dropped 
after the senate refused to go along 
prospects appear brighter for the death penalty this time 
because the senate voted 6529 last june to allow capital 
punishment for drug dealers and kingpins the senate has not 
yet begun consideration of its own drug bill 
other controversial house amendments would deny student loans 
and other federal benefits to convicted drug users admit illegally 
seized evidence in court if police acted in good faith during a 
search and withhold federal highway money from states that refuse 
to revoke or suspend drivers licenses of convicted drug users 
as the house conducted a generally mildmannered debate on the 
375page bill wednesday policementurnedlobbyists roamed through 
lawmakers offices to present their views on a sevenday waiting 
period for handgun purchasers 
they were not all on the same side in debating this provision of 
the drug bill which includes an optional background check on the 
purchaser during the weeklong delay 
rankandfile officers supporting the waiting period are part of 
a coalition of law enforcement organizations and gun control 
groups the coalition has set up shop in a house judiciary 
committee basement hearing room in the rayburn office building 
across the street from the capitol 
other policemen are lobbying for the national rifle association 
which opposes the waiting period and virtually any form of gun 
control that affects the general population 
rep bill mccollum rfla will try to eliminate the waiting 
period his amendment would substitute an identification system 
that would allow gun dealers to check by telephone or other means 
to determine whether a purchaser is a convicted felon 
the gekas proposal on the death penalty would permit but not 
require a judge to impose the death sentence on anyone convicted 
of intentionally killing someone during a drug felony 
if the death penalty was not imposed the amendment would 
require a sentence of 20 years to life 
the senate legislation that passed last june would permit the 
death penalty for narcotics dealers convicted of murder in drug 
crimes and for drug kingpins defined under law as those who 
supervise five or more people commit at least three federal drug 
felonies and derive substantial income from a continuing criminal 
enterprise 
the only brief moment of emotion during the opening debate 
wednesday came when rep charles b rangel dny urged the house 
not to stoop as low as those killers in the street by approving 
the death penalty he said it would be beneath the dignity of 
this house to approve the gekas language 
but mccollum rose to gekas defense calling the death penalty 
the missing deterrence in the fight against illegal drugs 
most federal death penalty provisions are not enforceable 
because unlike some state laws they were never brought into 
compliance with supreme court guidelines on capital punishment 
the overall antidrug bill provides for money and programs that 
would attack drug use from every conceivable direction 
the legislation would increase spending for federal and state 
law enforcement agencies to intercept illegal drugs on land in the 
air and on the seas 
banking laws would be changed to try to stop the laundering of 
drug money at legitimate financial institutions education programs 
would be expanded for youth including disadvantaged youngsters and 
the most hardened gang members capacity would be increased and 
waiting periods lessened for entry into drug rehabilitation 
programs 
the bill encourages latin american countries to form a regional 
antinarcotics force and pledges financial support if one is 
started 
federal contractors would be required to maintain a drugfree 
workplace tight controls would be placed on the usmade 
chemicals that are used to manufacture heroin cocaine and other 
drugs 
states also would be given money to develop programs to stop the 
spread of aids by intravenous drug abusers

antinuclear protesters shouted good 
riddance thursday as the first american cruise missiles to leave 
europe under ussoviet arms treaty were flown home for 
destruction 
two of the 18 cruise missiles deployed at nearby molesworth us 
air base were loaded on a c141 and their 55foot mobile launchers 
aboard a c5 galaxy for the 12hour flight to davismonthan air 
force base near tucson ariz they are to be broken up at the base 
under the eye of soviet inspectors 
the missiles arrived unannounced less than a year ago but their 
departure was public 
they were encased in canisters atop camouflagepainted launchers 
that lumbered from molesworth under police escort past the base 
insignia of us and british flags crossed over the slogan peace 
through partnership then along seven miles of rural lanes to 
alconbury 
as the two mobile launchers and a launch training vehicle moved 
out of molesworth about 40 antinuclear protesters rushed forward 
and showered the convoy with their peace symbol multicolored paper 
petals they shouted go home and good riddance dont come 
back 
several hare krishna followers in white and gold robes joined 
the protesters softly beating drums and tambourines 
police grabbed one protester who tried to run toward the lead 
vehicle shouting what about the warheads 
destruction of the warheads is not required under the superpower 
intermediate nuclear forces treaty they were not in the convoy and 
american officials said they would be returned to the united states 
in due course 
the agreement to eliminate the approximately 2700 soviet and 
us landbased nuclear missiles from europe by 1991 was signed by 
president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev last december and 
ratified by the senate in may 
some soviet ss20s aimed at western europe were removed in 
february and nine pershing 2 missiles were taken from a west german 
base sept 1 
cruise missiles first arrived in europe in november 1983 and 
were deployed at the greenham common base west of london it now 
has 96 missiles 
missiles deployed at molesworth were the last to arrive in 
november 1987 and defense secretary george younger said they will 
be gone within three months 
younger declared at a news conference in a molesworth hangar 
that despite gorbachevs policies of reform the soviet union 
remains on the military offensive 
us ambassador charles h price ii said the world was now 
marginally safer and added we are are witnessing the removal 
of the cruise missiles because we the nato allies have been 
strong and united 
we are not here because some individuals wellintentioned and 
innocent of the worlds realities kept vigils at our bases he 
said referring to protesters who have camped outside greenham and 
molesworth 
younger said the treaty and missile removal was a stinging 
rebuke to those who had sought unilateral western disarmament 
outside the gates of molesworth members of the antinuclear 
movement saw it differently 
were delighted that the missiles are going weve kept up the 
pressure on this government and we claim part of the credit 
said meg beresford secretary of the campaign for nuclear 
disarmament but we are very concerned about the possibility of 
new weapons being brought in which certainly break the spirit of 
the treaty 
she expressed fear that prime minister margaret thatchers 
government will accept us f111 bombers carrying airlaunched 
cruise missiles which are not banned by the treaty 
younger did not deny britain may deploy new us air or 
sealaunched nuclear missiles as well as maintaining its own 
nuclear arsenal he said britain will keep nuclear weapons to 
deter in such numbers and at such locations as are necessary

president reagan reminded congress on thursday 
that some 10 million more women than men will be voting this fall 
and criticized legislators for not acting on some 40 female 
appointees hes named 
the hand that pulls the voting lever rules the nation 
reagan quipped at a rose garden ceremony honoring a group of female 
administration executives 
the republican party is said to suffer from the socalled gender 
gap in which the party has a lower level of support from women 
than the democrats 
but reagan argued against that idea saying he believed that 
neither men nor women vote as a bloc 
they look at the record and vote on the issues and those are 
the people who on election day will decide the outcome reagan 
said 
the president took the opportunity to lambast congress faulting 
the fact that some 40 females hes nominated to senior executive 
advisory and judicial posts have not been approved 
the liberal ledership in the senate can talk about their 
interest in women taking senior positions in government but 
theyre not delivering reagan charged 
they say they applaud the idea of putting more women on the 
bench well if so let them expeditiously move to confirm the five 
excellent judicial nominees they have before them reagan said 
in his remarks reagan boasted that out of the 10 women who have 
served in cabinet posts four have served during his term 
he also noted that he had been the first to appoint a woman 
sandra day oconnor to the supreme court 
you do represent the leading edge as i say of the great 
progress for american women and because of what all of you and so 
many other women have done even greater opportunities for women 
lie ahead reagan said 
the progress that were witnessing is just the beginning and 
it can only move in one direction it can only move forward he

americans took out 26 billion more in 
consumer credit than they paid off in july a sharp slowdown from 
the pace of growth during the first half of the year the 
government reported thursday 
the federal reserve board said consumer credit expanded at an 
annual rate of just 48 percent last month down from an annual 
rate of 102 percent from january through june 
the report said the slowdown reflected a drop in auto sales in 
july and lackluster sales of other consumer goods 
consumer credit had shot up 81 billion in june even faster 
than originally believed a month ago the fed had estimated the 
june advance at a smaller 54 billion 
mike evans head of his own washington economic consulting firm 
said that the july slowdown showed that consumers are remaining 
fairly cautious about the future in spite of the fact that wage 
gains picked up in july 
consumers dont seem to be buying bigticket items as they had 
in the past and that probably reflects the increases in interest 
rates he said 
the federal reserve has been tightening credit since late march 
in an effort to dampen demand as a way of cooling inflationary 
pressures 
the smaller july increase was led by a 2 billion rise in the 
category which includes credit card debt this followed a 37 
billion june increase 
auto loans increased by 555 million in july down sharply from 
a 28 billion june advance 
the category which includes bank and credit union loans not 
secured by real estate declined by 62 million after a 14 billion 
june increase 
the various changes left total consumer debt at 6469 billion 
up 9 percent from a year ago

at least 27 black activists 
including leaders of two banned organizations have been detained 
in an apparent crackdown on opposition to oct 26 elections 
newspapers reported thursday 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu one of several clergymen to 
defy emergency regulations by urging an election boycott repeated 
his call thursday 
addressing about 2000 people at the predominantly mixedrace 
university of the western cape tutu said of next months local 
elections 
please consider prayerfully what god wants you to do we want 
to urge black people do not take part in a process which will 
perpetuate your oppression 
the archbishop called on whites to join the boycott because 
the time of white politics is past 
police headquarters declined to comment on the reported 
detentions it also has declined to give details of an 
investigation on whether tutu should be prosecuted for urging an 
election boycott 
the antiapartheid weekly new nation said the detentions in the 
past two weeks are believed to be part of a government attempt to 
stifle opposition to the elections which will mark the first time 
voters of all races go to the polls on the same day 
many blacks oppose taking part in segregated local elections as 
long as the black majority cannot vote in national elections 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
business day a johannesburg newspaper said the activists 
detained this week included nkosi molala president of the azanian 
peoples organization 
molalas organization was one of 17 antiapartheid groups banned 
in february from conducting any activities it espouses the 
philosophy of black consciousness or black selfreliance 
developed by steve biko before his death in detention in 1977 
new nation said 14 members of the south african youth congress 
another of the banned groups have been detained since last week 
it said all top leaders of the youth congress now are in detention 
new nation whose editor zwelakhe sisulu has been detained 
without charge for nearly two years said 12 other activists from 
the pretoria area were detained wednesday 
two of them worked for the community research and information 
service a social service group which has expressed fears about the 
life of another black staff member stanza bopape 
police say bopape escaped three days after being detained june 
9 his family and associates have not heard from him since and 
fear he may have been killed 
security police have seized two tape recordings of a sermon 
given by tutu on sunday in which he advocated an election boycott 
such calls are punishable by up to 10 years in jail 
in his speech thursday tutu explained his defiance 
it is not because tutu is trying to look smart he said i 
have a commitment and a passion for south africa we have the 
potential of being one of the greatest countries my passion makes 
me able whatever the penalties to do what i believe god is asking 
me to do

a professor who said researchers have 
concluded the shroud of turin is a fake was only guessing says the 
head of an oxford university team researching the relic believed to 
be christs burial cloth 
the oxford mail on thursday quoted prof edward hall director 
of the archaeology research laboratory at oxford as saying results 
of the research were still secret 
but dr richard luckett of cambridge university the professor 
who last month quoted researchers as saying the shroud was a 
medieval forgery said he stood by his word 
hall condemned as mere guesswork a statement by luckett that 
tests at oxford showed the shroud was made in 1350 the newspaper 
said 
the person who has been doing the dating told me that dr 
luckett got the date completely wrong hall was quoted as saying 
the shroud is kept in turin cathedral in italy cardinal 
anastasio ballestrero of turin sent tiny samples to university 
research laboratories in arizona zurich and oxford for tests to 
try to determine its age 
hall told the oxford mail that the results probably would not be 
announced until after the end of this month after statisticians in 
turin ballestreros scientific advisers and pope john paul ii were 
informed 
luckett wrote in londons evening standard newspaper aug 26 
i think that as far as seems possible the scientific argument is 
now settled and the shroud is a fake 
hall said he was on vacation when lucketts statement was 
published it provoked an outcry from italian experts on the shroud 
who accused the british of leaking the results 
i cannot say what the true date is but it is certainly not 
the one he gave i am sure dr luckett has not had any information 
whatever his evidence he has no business to make uninformed 
comment hall was quoted as saying 
on wednesday luckett said his information came from researchers 
its ridiculous of these people to pretend there werent any 
leaks i had an absolutely marvelous leak from one of the 
laboratories and it wasnt oxford luckett said in a telephone 
interview from magdalene college cambridge 
it would be surprising if one laboratory contradicted 
another he added 
luckett a fellow of magdalene college librarian and a 
historian of the 17th century who has been interested in the shroud 
for many years said nobody has ever bridged the gaps in the 
historical evidence for the shroud 
im now fairly clear that the shroud is more than 100 years 
older than i once thought but i always assumed it was medieval 
he said 
i think the tests should have been done entirely in secret and 
then announced as for having no business to comment i wasnt 
asked last month for a news report but to comment on an assumption 
about the shrouds age luckett said 
references to such a shroud go back as early as the 5th or 6th 
centuries but then there are gaps between reports of witnesses in 
the 12th and early 13th centuries and its turning up in france in 
1354 
in 1389 the shroud was denounced as a forgery by bishop pierre 
darcis of troyes in france who said in a letter that his 
predecessor knew who painted it the painters name does not appear 
in any known document

to license 238 hunters said burkett neely manager of the arthur 
r marshall loxahatchee national wildlife refuge 
each licensed hunter is permitted to take up to 15 gators in 
designated areas this month as part of the states first hunt in a 
quartercentury but no one is permitted to hunt alligators or 
disturb any animal or plant in the refuge

some court documents said 
later the officers found a dead tailless alligator with 
multiple gunshot wounds neely said 
although estimates place the alligator population in florida at 
1 million federal law considers the alligator to be threatened 
by similarity neely said

with almost four months remaining in 1988 the 
nations capital has matched the number of homicides 227 that 
occurred in all of last year 
the shooting death of the latest victim a 17yearold boy was 
drug related as were three out of every five of the homicides 
this year police said 
homicides and shootings go hand in hand with drugs said 
metropolitan police chief maurice turner 
in addition the number of assaults involving guns have climbed 
to more than 940 so far this year an increase of at least 54 
percent turner said 
the numbers are astounding he added 
until the demand for drugs decreases turner predicted the city 
will see more homicides and more shootings 
police spokesman capt william white iii estimated that if 
homicides continue at the current pace 335 persons will be killed 
in washington this year far exceeding the alltime record of 287 
set in 1969 
so far 95 homicides this year including the latest remain 
unsolved 
during august there were 41 washington homicides a record for 
one month the old standard of 37 was set in january 
police blame the upsurge on the growing popularity of crack a 
highlypotent cocaine derivative 
many of the killings have come in turf battles as drug dealers 
have fought for selling rights for the drug in the citys 88 
openair drug markets according to police 
of the 227 homicides so far this year 156 have involved 
firearms white said last year guns were used in 129 homicides

doctors in a california hospital will 
search for a donor heart to be transplanted into a child at birth 
an operation performed only once before officials said thursday 
cynthia petersen of murray utah who is 33 weeks pregnant was 
to fly to loma linda university medical center on thursday night to 
await a suitable donor heart for her fetus 
baby paul from canada is the only other baby with the heart 
defect known as hypoplastic left ventricle to have had a transplant 
right after birth doctors said the baby who was operated on at 
loma linda 11 months ago is growing normally authorities said 
mrs petersens obstetrician found an abnormal fetal heart beat 
during a prenatal examination and referred her to dr greggory 
devore director of the intermountain fetal diagnostic and 
treatment center at salt lakes lds hospital 
devore said the left chamber of the heart does not develop with 
the fetus condition and most babies who have it die within three 
to four weeks of birth 
doctors at loma linda will monitor the fetus while they look for 
a donor if a donor is found devore said doctors will perform 
surgery immediately following the birth 
when the baby is born the immune system of the infant is not 
yet keyed in to reject a donor organ devore said 
we know there is only a 50 percent chance they will even 
locate a donor but we are optimistic said mrs petersens 
husband daymon 
the more people know about this the better mrs petersen 
said 
the fetus was named whitney ray petersen in advance by his 
parents the petersens have two other children a 5yearold girl 
and a 2yearold boy petersen is a maintenance worker for the utah 
national guard and mrs petersen is a nurse 
the petersens insurance company will not cover the 
100000plus pricetag of the surgery the couple said they dont 
know how they are going to pay it 
devore said mrs petersen and the baby will be required to stay 
near the hospital for about a year following the operation 
petersen said he would return to utah after his wife is settled at 
loma linda and will try to visit her whenever finances permit

irans foreign minister said thursday his 
delegation will stay in geneva as long as needed but the stalled 
unmediated peace talks with iraq may adjourn soon and move to 
new york 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati accused iraq of 
trying to derail the discussions by introducing such 
extraneous elements as freedom of navigation in the persian 
gulf and conflicting claims to the shattalarab waterway which 
forms the southern frontier 
velayati told reporters iran is eager to continue these talks 
at any level deemed appropriate by the secretarygeneral 
negotiations began aug 25 five days after a ceasefire halted the 
8yearold war with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
as mediator 
velayati said iran agreed in principle with small 
reservations to a compromise formula proposed by jan eliasson 
the swedish diplomat who has temporarily replaced perez de cuellar 
as mediator but iraq rejected it he gave no details 
asked in an interview with irans official news agency whether 
he foresees early adjournment and a shift of venue to new york the 
site of un headquarters velayati replied 
yes i think it will start in maybe two or three weeks from 
now but the ending of this round of talks depends on the decision 
of the secretarygeneral 
velayati said his delegation is prepared to stay here as long 
as necessary and has no objection to resuming direct talks with 
the iraqis which have not been held since aug 26 
he thanked the un for tireless and sincere efforts toward 
peace 
in israel a military analyst said the united states caused iran 
to accept a ceasefire by increasing its naval strength in the 
persian gulf 
aharon levran said the war stalemated when washington sent more 
ships in july 1987 to protect shipping and iran realized that if 
it couldnt win the war while confronting iraq alone it certainly 
could not do so after a superpower like the united states came to 
the gulf 
levran an analyst with tel aviv universitys jaffee center for 
strategic studies was elaborating on the centers annual middle 
east military balance report published last month he is a reserve 
brigadier general and edited the study 
iran accepted the un security councils ceasefire resolution 
a year after it was adopted unanimously in july 1987

soviet scientists have lost contact with 
an unmanned spacecraft hurtling toward mars one of two probes 
designed to orbit the red planet and study its moon phobos a nasa 
official said thursday 
a soviet message to nasa headquarters in washington didnt say 
whether the problem endangered phobos 1s mission to mars said 
raymond j amorose deep space network operations manager at the 
space agencys jet propulsion laboratory 
they said they had lost communications with phobos 1 but 
phobos 2 is in fine shape he said they have not asked for our 
help we have offered and they said they do not need our help 
yet 
soviet media was silent on the matter thursday 
the problem is jeopardizing a joint ussoviet study of the sun 
planned for this month the los angeles times reported thursday 
phobos 1 was to have worked with nasas solar maximum 
spacecraft which has been orbiting earth for almost a decade to 
view the sun from different angles providing the first 
stereoscopic images of the sun 
phobos 1 was launched july 7 and phobos 2 on july 12 during the 
480 million mission the two probes were scheduled to go into 
orbit around mars and just behind phobos in january so they could 
study the martian surface atmosphere and magnetic field 
plans called for phobos 1 to drop a lander onto the moon phobos 
on april 7 and for phobos 2 to deploy its lander nicknamed the 
hopper because it literally would hop around the moons surface 
on may 25 amorose said 
starting oct 10 nasa was to help track both probes with its 
deep space network which consists of 230foot dishshaped radio 
antennas in goldstone calif canberra australia and madrid 
spain amorose said 
the purpose is to help the soviets navigate the spacecraft to 
their aim points at mars and also help receive data transmitted 
to earth by the two probes he added 
solar max and phobos 1 were to perform their solar studies later 
this month and again after phobos 1 deploys its lander 
the images from the spacecraft would allow scientist to study 
the narrow layer of hot gases on the suns surface said research 
scientist keith strong of lockheed missiles and space co in palo

a federal judge has lifted a 1971 
court order which required the desegregation of duval county 
schools by crosstown busing 
us district judge john h moore ii on tuesday declared the 
school system is integrated and lifted the 17yearold order 
effectively removing the federal role in the districts 
desegregation efforts 
moore said he examined the status of students faculty 
transportation extracurricular activites and facilities and 
determined that segregative practices do not exist 
he rejected a 1985 lawsuit by the naacp alleging that the 
original 1971 order was not being followed and also then lifted 
the order itself 
i live here work here and go shopping here the judge 
wrote and the feeling i get is that the leadership of the naacp 
is promoting this lawsuit contrary to the rank and file of the 
black people of this community 
despite the ruling willye dennis the leader of the 
jacksonville branch of the naacp said the civil rights 
organization stands by its claim that the school system is not 
desegregated 
we need to get the message out to the community that if this 
case is not appealed we are going to be in a bind she said 
adding that a decision has not been reached on whether to appeal 
as a result of the ruling the school system will be free to 
redraw boundary lines reduce crosstown busing and set its own 
standards for an integrated school system said jannell byrd an 
attorney for the naacp legal defense and education fund in new york 
city 
school board chairman billy parker said thursday that there 
would be no immediate changes but he predicted that at least 25 
percent of the students now being bused could be returned to 
neighborhood schools next fall 
parker said some busing for racial desegregation will continue 
in places where it is impossible to return to local schools and 
still keep an integrated school system 
theres no question that every place where youngsters can 
return to neighborhood schools a move will be made to do so he 
said 
the school system has 104000 students 35 percent of them 
black about 30 percent of the teachers and 25 percent of the 
faculty are black the court order said 
duval county buses 20000 students each day officials have said 
that 45 percent of the busing is for integration many students 
riding buses from 25 minutes to an hour each way during the school 
year 
in his ruling moore said the school system had done a 
reasonable job of attempting to maintain racial balance at the 
schools but he said practical problems got in the way 
moore wrote that duval county is so large about twothirds the 
size of rhode island that it is difficult to rectify racial 
imbalance brought about by shifts in population patterns by busing

mumps the oncecommon childhood disease is 
declining again after two years on the rise federal health 
officials reported thursday 
the centers for disease control reported that mumps was down by 
twothirds through the first 30 weeks of this year with 3166 
cases reported in that time 
the cdc also reported details of a mumps outbreak last year in 
three chicago financial markets which illustrated the potential 
seriousness of the usually mild disease the costs from the 116 
cases averaged nearly 1500 per patient 
mumps reached a record low in the united states in 1985 when 
2982 cases were reported down 98 percent from the 152000 
reported in 1968 the first year for the licensed mumps vaccine 
mumps reporting then rose over the next two years to 7790 cases 
in 1986 and 12299 in preliminary reports from 1987 
the cases reported in the first 30 weeks of 1988 mark a 67 
percent drop from the same period in 1987 the cdc said 
the report made no speculation on this years decrease 
recent outbreaks have occurred in high schools and on college 
campuses the cdc noted that those outbreaks would include some 
people who may not have been vaccinated because they were children 
between 1967 when the vaccine was first licensed and 1977 when 
it was added to the list of vaccines recommended for all children 
over 1 year 
one major outbreak last year occurred among an older group 
employees at three futures exchanges in chicago between aug 18 
and dec 25 76 cases occurred at one exchange 39 cases occurred 
at a second exchange and one more case occurred at a third exchange 
the patients at the three exchanges which were not identified 
could not be positively linked the atlantabased agency said 
but researchers believe there may have been contacts between the 
three locations which could not be documented said dr karen 
kaplan a cdc epidemiologist 
the cdc was able to get vaccination information for 82 patients 
more than onethird believed they had been immunized against mumps 
but only three could prove it with records 
the vaccine is how this could have been averted ms kaplan 
said we suggest that adults have a complete immunization record 
with all recommended shots but nobody thinks about adult 
immunization 
the costs associated with the 116patient outbreak including 
doctors visits hospitalization for nine patients medications and 
missed work came to 120738 or 1473 a case the cdc said 
that the cdc said contrasted dramatically with the cost of 
mumps vaccine less than 5 a dose at public clinics about 9 
at a doctors office 
mumps which causes painful swelling in the neck is usually 
mild but can cause serious problems in other parts of the body 
particularly in adolescents and young adults serious complications 
can include deafness orchitis in the testicles and meningitis or 
encephalitis in the nervous system

the fire that cut telephone service for 42000 
customers for as long as 26 days was not arson but the cause is 
still unknown according to a report thursday 
a preliminary report on the fire that destroyed an illinois bell 
co switching station in hinsdale offers few conclusions but said 
no evidence has been found that the blaze was deliberate 
the report was prepared by forensic technologies international 
corp of annapolis md and adopted as the official preliminary 
summary by the staff of the illinois commerce commission 
clearly there is international interest in what is going on 
with this investigation said icc spokesman david farrell 
other telecommunications companies throughout the world want to 
prevent what happened in may in hinsdale 
this appears to be one of the largest telecommunications 
disasters that has ever occurred he said 
forensic technologies is expected to release its final report in 
november farrell said the company was hired by the icc but 
illinois bell is paying the bill 290000 so far he said 
at first the mothers day fire was expected to be only a minor 
inconvenience for residents in du page county but as illinois bell 
crews examined the damaged hardware it was clear that what became 
known as the great phone outage would last more than a few days 
it wasnt until june 4 that full telephone service was restored 
the fire in the switching station started in the ceiling in 
metal trays that hold cable above the telecommunication equipment 
the report said 
the fire departments use of water produced an immediate 
reduction of flame and heat the report says however because 
the building power supply was designed to be very reliable the 
source of electric power was continuous and the fire rekindled 
illinois bell is conducting its own investigation and expects to 
release its report in november spokeswoman pat montgomery said

george bushs son defended his fathers error 
on the date of pearl harbor day but in the process got it wrong 
himself during a radio talk show thursday 
bush the republican presidential candidate said during a 
speech to the american legion wednesday that the japanese attack on 
pearl harbor occurred on sept 7 1941 not on dec 7 one of the 
bestknown dates in us history 
george bush jr during a discussion about the campaign with 
michael jackson the syndicated talk show host lamented on 
thursday that the problem is that so much of what we see in 
presidential politics is the 15second sound bite on tv 
last night for example the 15second sound bite on my dad on 
the national networks was the fact that he slipped for 45 seconds 
on whether pearl harbor was on sept 9 or dec 9 
and they made a big deal of that on tv i didnt quite get the 
point because he you know corrected himself 
jackson did not note the younger bushs mistake during the 
interview 
vice president bush said wednesday i wonder how many 
americans remember today is pearl harbor day fortyseven years 
ago to this very day we were hit and hit hard at pearl harbor we 
were not ready 
in a bush administration that lesson would not be forgotten 
within a minute or so after prompting from the audience and 
from others on the speakers platform bush corrected himself

with a deafening roar and towering clouds 
of white smoke two nuclearmissile rocket motors were destroyed 
thursday the first us weapons eliminated under the arms 
reduction treaty with the soviet union 
vice president george bush and a 12member soviet inspection 
team were among hundreds of observers who watched the burnings at 
the longhorn army ammunition plant in northeast texas about 145 
miles east of dallas 
afterward the soviet team said it was satisified with the 
burnings 
last week american observers went to the soviet union to 
witness the destruction of missiles there under terms of the 
ussoviet intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
this is the day we begin to reverse the arms race this was 
the day we began to destroy the weapons of destruction bush said 
after the missles were destroyed this was the day that two great 
nuclear powers began to move together toward a safer more peaceful 
world 
under the treaty signed in washington last december by 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev the united 
states and soviet union are required to destroy all nuclear 
missiles with a range of 300 to 3400 miles within three years 
at the white house reagan said he had asked bush to attend the 
event in his place and he added i think this step for peace is 
something we all can be very proud of 
at longhorn army crews ignited the motor of a pershing 2 missle 
and it burned its solid fuel rocket propellant for more than 50 
seconds next the motor of a lesspowerful pershing 1a missile 
was burned in about 40 seconds 
the motors were bolted onto a concrete and steel structure 
after the firings the pershing 1a casing was placed into a 
large hydraulic crusher and flattened as the soviets and bush 
using binoculars looked on the larger pershing 2 motor was to be 
destroyed later after it cooled down 
we too are sending our inf missiles to the junk yard bush 
said the missile stages we destroyed today are just the 
beginning and over the next three years the united states will 
destroy over 800 more the soviets will destroy over 1800 capable 
of delivering roughly four times as many warheads as ours 
and at the end the levels will be equal zero on each 
side he said we will have destroyed an entire class of 
nuclear missiles and we will have relegated the inf missiles to the 
history books were witnessing today one of those unique moments 
in the career of man a moment when the tides of history turn and a 
new future dawns 
col nikolai chabalin a senior soviet inspector said through 
an interpreter we think it is a great event for the soviet 
people the reduction of two types of nuclear weapons and today we 
have witnessed the fulfillment of a significant event in the 
elimination of american missiles under the treaty 
the soviet team will remain in texas as longhorn officials plan 
eliminations of nine more rocket motors next week said don mcclow 
of the army materiel command in alexandria va 
brig gen roland lajoie director of the onsite inspection 
agency which was formed to implement the treaty said three other 
facilities will join longhorn as inf elimination sites 
officials also will destroy pershings and their launchers at 
pueblo depot activity near pueblo colo pending approval of a 
state permit application and pershing launchers will be eliminated 
in west germany groundlaunched cruise missiles and their 
launchers will be destroyed at davismonthan air force base near 
tucson ariz 
a small group of supporters of democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis and other protesters lined the drive to the plants 
front gate before bush arrived 
dave harris a civilian employee with the us armys redstone 
arsenal said texas officials had reviewed the army facilitys 
plans before allowing the burnings which he said were 
environmentally safe 
the soviet union began destroying some of its missiles july 22 
and as of sept 6 had eliminated 92 rockets

air pollutants must be attacked in 
combination not one by one because thats the way they are 
helping to kill trees and stunt crops across the country an 
environmental research group said thursday 
policymakers risk worsening other pollution if they attack a 
single pollutant said james mackenzie and mohammed elashry the 
authors of a report for the world resources institute 
for example current strategies to reduce urban ozone could be 
increasing ozone in rural areas said mackenzie 
the environmental protection agency disagreed with that 
conclusion 
the world resources institute study said crop losses could be as 
large as 5 billion a year from ozone but they were unable to 
estimate monetary damages to forests 
dying trees in the east primarily some pines in the southeast 
and red spruce in the appalachian mountains probably are being 
killed by the interaction of ozone and the sulfuric and nitric 
acids in acid rain they said 
ozone in rural areas throughout the country appears to be 
roughly twice the normal background level the study said at high 
altitudes in the east it sometimes reaches concentrations the epa 
has defined as unhealthy in cities 
the american paper institute said it was awaiting a response 
from its experts before commenting on the report in the past the 
institute has said it has seen no evidence that trees its member 
companies rely on are being harmed by air pollution 
like several other environmental groups the world resources 
institute argued for a 10million ton reduction in annual emissions 
of the raw material for sulfuric acid sulfur dioxide from power 
plant and industrial boilers and a 5million ton reduction in 
nitrogen dioxide emissions the raw material for nitric acid from 
boilers and motor vehicles the two acids are the major components 
of acid rain 
we should avoid taking action that corrects one problem at the 
expense of others said elashry 
for example he said utilities should not be forced to install 
expensive scrubbers to remove sulfur dioxide from smokestacks 
as the current clean air act requires for new plants 
that actually works against the carbon dioxide problem and the 
greenhouse effect warming of the earth he said the 
requirement works to lock in coal to the boilers in question 
rather than allowing fuel switching which would use fuels that 
emit less carbon dioxide in burning and thus cause less warming of 
the earth 
another example is epas focus on reducing emissions of one 
urban precursor of ozone reactive hydrocarbons like unburned 
gasoline and ignoring the other precursor nitrogen oxides 
mackenzie said 
those nitrogen oxides will generate ozone in the countryside 
and that still comes down as nitric acid he said in arguing that 
both should be reduced together 
the way the chemistry is believed to work a reduction of urban 
nitrogen oxides or a simultaneous reduction of both nitrogen oxides 
and hydrocarbons might increase ozone in some urban areas said 
jennifer logan an atmospheric chemist at harvard university 
informed of her view mackenzie said such an effect is possible 
in some areas and you have to be careful to make reductions 
in such ways to avoid it 
the report cited recent research showing that as little as 1 
part per billion of nitrogen oxides in forests can form large 
amounts of ozone from the hydrocarbons emitted by trees isoprene 
and the terpene family of compounds 
ms logan said 35 percent of nitrogen oxides are believed to 
originate in small cities or rural areas 
without new control measures nitrogen oxides are projected to 
increase in coming decades and this means more ozone damage to 
the forests mackenzie said 
gerald emisson head of epas office of air quality planning and 
standards at research triangle park nc said that with computer 
models when we have looked at the northeastern united states on 
a very crude scale we dont see big ozone contrations taking place 
if you dont control nitrogen oxides very tentative results do 
not lead us to say theres a big problem in the forests

chairman for three years 
choice of a host country is a major issue at this weeks 
conference of foreign ministers of the 101member group

represented at the fourday meeting 
he said that left the field open for three compromise candidates 
cyprus malta and yugoslavia whose late president tito helped 
found the movement 
there are very intensive and extensive consultations taking 
place to find a consensus candidate said agathocleous a senior 
official of the cyprus foreign ministry 
some members oppose yugoslavia because it was the summit host in 
1961 and the tradition is for a nation not to repeat as chairman

on the eve of pope john paul iis fourth 
african visit bishops from nine nations on thursday urged the 
marxist mozambique government to talk peace with rightwing rebels 
 
archbishop jaime goncalves president of the ninenation 
interregional meeting of bishops of southern africa said ongoing 
negotiations to end the 13year conflict in angola set the stage 
for peaceful dialogue in mozambique 
considering the situation in this region where people are 
trying to solve conflict through dialogue mozambique should also 
take part in calling people together to talk about ending the 
war goncalves said mozambique should take the opportunity 
now 
goncalves addressing a news conference in the capital of 
harare said the mozambique government refused to meet with leaders 
of the mozambique national resistance also known by the portuguese 
acronym renamo 
some 70 bishops from angola botswana lesotho mozambique 
namibia sao tome and principe south africa swaziland and 
zimbabwe are gathered in harare for the meeting 
the pope will close the 10day meeting saturday at the beginning 
of his first tour of five blackgoverned nations neighboring 
whiteruled south africa 
goncalves denied the catholic church in mozambique was in direct 
confrontation with the government in maputo 
at first the government said they did not agree with the 
catholic church now they say they understand the position of the 
church goncalves said 
mozambique won independence from portugal in 1975 after 
centuries of colonial rule and a decade of guerrilla war waged by 
marxist rebels of frelimo the mozambique liberation front the 
front is now the ruling party 
frelimo at independence accused the catholic church of siding 
with the portuguese in that conflict but relations between church 
and state have since warmed 
goncalves said the bishops discussed the problem of peace in 
southern africa in line with the theme of the popes visit the 
papal tour will emphasize human rights in a region split by war 
and injustice goncalves said 
the church must consider what we can do for peace justice and 
welfare in this region said goncalves who heads the catholic 
diocese of beira that port city is in northern mozambique where 
renamo rebels have been blamed for the slaying of thousands of 
civilians 
the pontiff is scheduled to visit mozambique before returning to 
rome on sept 19 
mozambique has accused south africa of backing renamo a charge 
denied by pretoria 
zimbabwe has about 12000 troops fighting alongside government 
forces in mozambique and has repeatedly opposed dialogue with the 
rebels 
both the harare and maputo governments argue the guerrillas have 
no specific ideological aims and are simply terrorists supported by 
south africa

an army airlift is carrying relief 
supplies to a refugee camp 500 miles southwest of khartoum where 40 
people a day have been dying of starvation a newspaper reported 
thursday 
alayam said the airlift had supplied the elmeiram camp with 
canned goods and 1000 sacks of sorghum so far 
relief official eltayeb tahir told reporters a trainload of 
relief material arrived at elmeiram last monday and the transport 
ministry had been asked to allocate one train a week for the south 
thousands of southern sudanese displaced by civil war drought 
and recent floods have been moving north and many die of starvation 
or disease on the way 
on thursday a month after the floods the government said it 
estimates the damage to crops at about 365 million unofficial 
estimates put the cost much higher 
the rev aengus finucane director of the irish aid agency 
concern said last month 40 people were dying every day at 
elmeiram and starvation threatened about 2 million sudanese in the 
south 
according to alayams report the army stepped in when 
international relief groups said they could not move goods to the 
south because of the heavy rains and floods 
it did not mention the proximity of rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army forces besieging wau 160 miles from the elmeiram 
camp 
rebel gunners shot down two civilian planes in 1986 and 1987 and 
the insurgent army led by former col john garang has threatened 
to fire on relief planes the rebels claim the government uses 
civilian aircraft to move ammunition and troops 
garangs rebels began fighting the moslemdominated khartoum 
government in 1983 they seek autonomy for the south most of whose 
people are christians or animists and claim to control more than 
90 percent of the countryside 
tahir said without elaboration that contacts were under way on 
arrangements for international agencies to fly aid to the south 
but a western official said privately the rebels were reluctant to 
approve such an airlift

the countrys two largest purchasers of home 
mortgages announced thursday that they have reached agreement on 
ways to streamline and simplify the often timeconsuming process of 
obtaining a home mortgage 
the agreement was reached between the federal home loan mortgage 
corp known as freddie mac and the federal national mortgage 
association known as fannie mae both corporations buy mortgages 
from primary lenders and resell them as mortgagebacked securities 
thus increasing the pool of money available to make home loans 
the two companies along with the federal housing administration 
the veterans administration and the government national mortage 
association have been participating for the past year in a task 
force seeking to standardize and simplify the mortgage application 
process 
john teutsch president of the mortgage bankers association an 
organization of local lenders said the agreement between freddie 
mac and fannie mae was an important first step and should set the 
stage for more progress in the future 
the mortgage group estimated that further progress could 
eventually cut in half the time it takes to get a mortgage 
approved at present this waiting period ranges from 45 to 60 days 
during the past 50 years the mortgage origination process had 
become unnecessarily complicated for both consumers and lenders 
alike it was time to turn back the tide of paperwork teutsch 
said 
teutsch said at a news conference that fannie mae and freddie 
mac had both agreed to revise their mortgage eligibility 
requirements and underwriting guidelines to make them more uniform 
this is critical because local lenders follow these guidelines 
closely in making home loans since loans that do not conform are 
not eligible to be purchased by the agencies for resale to 
investors about twothirds of all residential mortgages end up 
being resold into the secondary market 
david james croft freddie macs executive vice president for 
operations said that the task force had been useful in resolving 
several differences in underwriting guidelines between the two 
corporations 
with freddie mac and fannie mae having the same basic 
policies lenders will not have to separate loans during 
origination based on which agency they plan to sell the mortgages 
to that will streamline operations for mortgage lenders resulting 
in better rates for borrowers croft said 
under the guidelines the two agencies reached agreement on 20 
different underwriting differences including loantovalue ratios 
multiple mortgages to the same borrower seller contributions age 
of credit documents and how to classify investment properties

secretary of state george p shultz accused 
iraq on thursday of unjustifiable and abhorrent use of chemical 
weapons against its minority kurdish population 
in a 50minute meeting with a senior iraqi diplomat sadoon 
hamadi shultz threatened to reverse the recent improvement in us 
relations with the middle eastern country if human rights abuses 
continuesd 
the secretary asked that the iraqi government weight this 
factor fully in its decisionmaking said state department 
spokesman charles e redman 
on capitol hill meantime sen claiborne pell chairman of the 
senate foreign relations committee introduced a bill to slap 
economic sanctions on iraq 
redman in a statement issued after the meeting said shultz 
conveyed to iraqi minister of state hamadi our view that iraqs 
use of chemical weapons in its military campaign against iraqi 
kurds is unjustifiable and abhorrent 
a us official said shultz also used the word horrifyingto 
describe the situation 
with chants of prokurdish demonstrators ringing in his ears 
hamadi denied the charges in a brief news conference outside the 
department building 
this is absolutely baseless and this has not taken place at 
all he said 
hamadi denounced the democratic party union a kurdish group 
headed by jalal talabani as terrorists who collaborated with iran 
in the eightyear persian gulf war he said kurdish refugees who 
have taken sanctuary in turkey were free to return home 
shultzs session with hamadi initially was scheduled to survey 
efforts to end the iraniraq war a us official said shultz 
listened without comment to a report by hamadi on sputtering 
negotiations being held under united nations auspices 
the official who demanded anonymity said there was no 
indication the us dispute was iraq over chemical weapons was 
having a spillover effect on the negotiations 
shultz told hamadi that the united states would explore with 
friendly governments ways to influence iraq to cease chemical 
warfare practices which are unacceptable to the civilized world 
state department officials declined to say what those measures 
might be 
the bill introduced by pell dri would cut off economic 
credits to iraq require the united states to vote against loans to 
iraq in international financial institutions and prohibit 
importation of iraqi oil 
pell in a statement said the sanctions would remaion in place 
as long as iraq uses poisonous gas in violation of the 1925 
geneva protocols and as long as iraqs campaign of genocide against 
the kurdish people continues 
spokesman redman refused to say how the united states obtained 
its incriminating evidence against iraq however he said a us 
embassy official in turkey had traveled through areas in which 
kurdish refugees gained sanctuary 
earlier this week the state department said it had no evidence 
to substantiate widespread reports that iraq employed cyanide and 
other chemical weapons against entire kurdish villages 
thousands of kurds fled to turkey which in the past has had 
strains with its own kurdish population but redman said turkey had 
been very hospitable to the refugees creating new villages to 
house them 
the united states is convinced that iraq has used chemical 
weapons in its military campaign against kurdish guerrillas he 
said we dont know the extent to which chemical weapons have 
been used but any use in this context is abhorrent and 
unjustifiable 
the spokesman added we have expressed our strong concern to 
the iraqi government which is well aware of our position that use 
of chemical weapons is totally unjustifiable and unacceptable the 
secretary will be raising this issue with the iraqi minister of 
state 
in the past the state department also accused iraq of using 
chemical weapons against iranian troops in the eightyear persian 
gulf war 
iraq has consistently denied the charges 
the session with hamadi was scheduled before reports circulated 
last weekend that iraqi troops had slain hundreds of kurdish 
survivors of gas attacks 
on tuesday the ruling revolutionary command council in baghdad 
announced a general and comprehensive amnesty for kurdish 
rebels in an apparent effort to counter the poison gas allegations 
a spokesman for the iraqi embassy here denied the reports which 
he said were being spread by kurdish leaders in euorpe far from 
the claimed disaster scene 
he said the iraqi army was taking up positions that had been 
occupied by people who collaborated with the enemy in the past 
the spokesman abul rahman jamal said some of them may have 
been kurds or arabs they collaborated with the iranians and 
facilitated their movement into the country he said 
jamal also said western newspapers had blown up reports 
circulated by a handful of kurdish leaders who were touring europe 
trying to air accusations against iraq 
the kurds a nonarab people are a stateless minority in iraq 
iran turkey and other countries in the area 
on wednesday referring to the kurds quest for autonomy redman 
appeared to rule out us support for statehood 
our policy is that the kurds should satisfy their aspirations 
peacefully within the framework of the existing states of the area 
and that it is a matter that has to be worked out between the kurds 
and the respective governments he said

two house members on thursday introduced a 
farreaching civil rights proposal to protect elderly and infirm 
americans from widespread abuse and neglect recently uncovered in 
the nations guardianship system 
rep claude pepper dfla a chief sponsor of the national 
guardianship rights act called the current system a national 
disgrace 
unfortunately many state and local guardianship systems have 
become sleeping watchdogs of personal liberty pepper said in a 
statement even a convicted felon is guaranteed more rights in 
many areas than innocent elderly and disabled americans who are 
subjects of guardianship proceedings 
the bill introduced on peppers 88th birthday would safeguard 
the more than 500000 americans under guardianship and those facing 
the prospect the elderly would have more rights and recourse under 
the bill while guardians would have to meet new training and 
reporting requirements 
sen john heinz rpa ranking republican on the senate special 
committee on aging plans to introduce a similar guardianship 
safeguards bill early next week a committee spokeswoman said 
people become wards of guardians if they are deemed incompetent 
to handle their own affairs the guardian assumes their legal 
rights possessions and decisionmaking authority the ward 
typically is not permitted to vote own property marry or make 
medical decisions 
pepper said strong national safeguards against unnecessary and 
unduly restrictive guardianships are necessary because the system 
is so onerous rep don bonker dwash peppers chief cosponsor 
said the bill aims to restore guardianship to a system which does 
indeed serve to protect our nations most vulnerable citizens 
specifically the bill would require that anyone facing 
imposition of a guardianship receive adequate notice of impending 
proceedings be represented by trained attorneys be afforded an 
examination by an independent professional team have the right to 
a jury trial and have the right to prompt appeal of the decision 
or the choice of guardian 
in addition the meaure would require that all guardians be of 
competent character receive thorough training provide at least 
annual reports on the financial and physical wellbeing of the 
incapacitated person and be subject to annual review and automatic 
removal by the courts 
the attorney general would enforce the legislation and could 
withhold federal money from states not in compliance with the act 
the pepperbonker bill was spurred in part by an associated 
press series that documented widespread abuses under the system 
ranging from theft and fraud to neglect and simple incompetence 
the ap series and its study of more than 2000 cases were 
repeatedly cited in an explanatory document released by the health 
subcommittee chaired by pepper 
among the ap findings 
97 percent of guardianship petitions are approved indicating 
the deck is stacked against the accused 
nearly half the files on guardians were missing at least one 
annual accounting of money only 16 percent of the files reviewed 
contained reports on the elderly wards wellbeing 
44 states require guardians to file regular accountings of a 
wards money but they were missing or incomplete in 48 percent of 
guardianship files examined the opening of guardianship was the 
last entry in 13 percent of the cases examined

legislation imposing sanctions against iraq 
for its purported use of poison gas against kurdish inhabitants was 
introduced on thursday by sen claiborne pell dri who told the 
senate a crime of unthinkable proportions is emerging 
for the second time in this century a brutal dictatorship is 
using deadly gas to exterminate a distinct ethnic minority said 
pell the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
there can be no doubt but that the iraqi regime of saddam 
hussein intends this campaign to be a final solution to the kurdish 
problem pell said while a people are gassed the world is 
largely silent 
the iraqi embassy in washington has denied that poison gas was 
used against the kurds asserting that such charges have been 
spread by kurdish leaders living in europe 
the pell resolution declares that the iraqi actions against the 
kurds appears to constitute an act of genocide a crime abhorred 
by civilized people everywhere and banned under international law 
the resolution would ban all us aid to iraq ban sales of us 
military equipment and ban the provision of credit or credit 
guarantees it would prohibit the transfer of sensitive technology 
to iraq and bar the import of iraqi petroleum products into the 
united states 
it also would instruct the us representative to the united 
nations to vote against all loans to iraq 
pell noted that the iraqi army moved against the kurds after the 
aug 20 ceasefire in iraqs war with iran with the objective of 
ending kurdish control over a large section of northeast iraq 
the offensive was accompanied by the dynamiting of kurdish 
villages throughout the region pell said poisonous gas was 
used on the people 
it is said we do not have much influence over iraq pell 
said this may be true but i believe we must use whatever means 
at our disposal to get their attention 
the iraqi regime is a vicious dictatorship toughened by years 
of conflict he said hand wringing alone will not change their 
course immediate action is essential

negotiate a timetable for withdrawing cuban troops from angola 
south african officials said cuban officials assured them they 
were not reinforcing their garrisons in angola 
foreign minister roelof botha speaking in south africa said 
his delegation quoted the cubans as saying recent cuban troop 
arrivals in angola were replacements for troops about to be sent 
home botha said he asked for greater clarification on this issue 
neil van heerden south african directorgeneral for foreign 
affairs told reporters in brazzaville the talks will continue 
until friday 
the us state department estimates 50000 cuban troops are in 
angola supporting the marxist government against antimarxist 
guerrillas and south african military incursions 
guerrilla leader jonas savimbi and us sources have claimed 
cuba was sending an additional 10000 troops to angola south 
africa said this violate a monthold ceasefire between south 
africa and angolancuban forces 
a timetable for cuban withdrawal has been the main obstacle to 
an agreement which would also facilitiate independence for the 
south africanruled territory of southwest africa or namibia 
south africa has linked namibian independence to cuban troop 
withdrawal from namibias northern neighbor angola 
a senior angolan diplomat meanwhile was quoted as saying

independence of angola plans to move its headquarters from jamba 
in southeastern angola to northern quimbele near angolas border

america to supply unita rebels with arms by way of a disused air 
base in zaire 
in a separate report thursday angop said the first of 11 
planned frontier control posts manned by angolan and south african 
forces to monitor a ceasefire agreement was officially opened 
tuesday

a vaccine for dangerous childhood diseases that 
include a form of meningitis has had mixed results according to 
three studies in a prominent medical journal 
but an accompanying editorial in fridays journal of the 
american medical association says the results should not stop 
doctors from giving patients a new version of the vaccine 
like it or not we must often make decisions in the absence of 
incontrovertible evidence dr edward a mortimer jr of case 
western reserve university school of medicine in cleveland wrote 
in the editorial 
the original vaccine for fighting a bacterium called 
haemophilus influenzae type b was first licensed for use in the 
united states in april 1985 largely because a clinical trial in 
finland had found it was 90 percent effective in preventing disease 
in children 18 to 71 months old and older 
an updated version of the vaccine approved in december by the 
food and drug administration is designed to improve protection for 
younger children 
a committee of the centers for disease control has recommended 
its use for all children at 18 months officials said 
the studies published in fridays journal reviewed use of the 
original vaccine which could be considered obsolete except for its 
cheaper cost said dr eugene shapiro of the yale university school 
of medicine leader of one of the studies 
shapiro said the first vaccine hasnt been shown to cause harm 
so could still be used 
the bacterium infects about 20000 us children each year and 
in about 12000 of those cases takes the form of bacterial 
meningitis which can cause retardation said dr lee h harrison 
who led one of the cdc studies 
among other problems caused by the bacterium are infections of 
the blood or of the epiglottis which can cause suffocation he 
said 
the bacterium is believed to be transmitted by persontoperson 
contact officials said 
about 5 percent of cases of disease caused by the bacterium are 
fatal said harrison 
he said he knew of no states which require the vaccine but that 
it is administered to about 30 percent of the nations children 
when the original vaccine was approved for use in the united 
states information on its effectiveness was limited doubts were 
raised by some doctors who questioned its ability to provide 
protection 
according to separate reports in the chicagobased medical 
journal a study in all or part of six states found a 45 percent 
effective rate of protection from immunization in 18 to 
59montholds and another conducted in parts of three states 
found it 88 percent effective in 2 to 6yearolds 
a third study of children beginning at age 2 in minnesota 
found that the vaccine may even increase risk of the disease by 55 
percent 
but authors of the minnesota study noted they dealt with just 88 
cases and that chance alone could explain the instances of 
bacteriumrelated disease 
i have trouble puting a lot of weight on the minnesota 
study said harrison 
mortimer said the newer vaccine has been shown to create more 
antibodies in younger children so the probable benefits outweigh 
the costs and risks if any and i recommend use of this new 
vaccine for children beginning at 18 months of age pending further 
information

president corazon aquino said 
thursday that law and order has collapsed in the philippines and 
restoring it is her governments first priority 
in a speech for the 22nd anniversary of the national police 
commission a watchdog body that monitors police abuses she 
declared 
the demands i get are increasingly less for the good life for 
social justice and other important aspirations as for the basic 
requirement that the state do to every man its basic duty keep him 
and his family secure from physical harm his property rights 
respected and his community a safe and decent place to live and 
work in 
the tragedy in this country is that this very function is so 
divided and confused that the state quite frequently fails to 
perform it 
the president asked people to support a bill now in congress 
that would merge the philippine constabulary and local police into 
one national police force the constabulary is part of the military 
mrs aquino did not cite crime statistics or examples but 
killings and armed robberies are frequent and many crimes go 
unsolved firearms are everywhere and newspapers often report 
killings during petty arguments or drunken brawls 
last month mrs aquino denounced the involvement of soldiers 
and police in such crimes such as murder car thefts prostitution 
gambling and extortion of money from businesses and motorists 
the first duty of the state is law and order she said 
thursday this priority ranks higher than social amelioration 
human development cultural attainment and whatever else one can 
think of this may sound unduly harsh but only the ignorant will 
deny it 
she said law and order are so basic that hardly anyone thinks 
of them until they are lost or gravely threatened 
the only time the state remembers its minimal function the 
protection of life and property is when their violation reaches 
such proportions that the public puts on the pressure the pressure 
is on us

half of the 1000 people forced from 
their homes by waistdeep water headed home thursday as floodwaters 
subsided leaving roads passable and letting businesses and schools 
reopen 
scattered showers continued thursday but manatee county was 
spared the torrential downpours of the previous three days that 
turned streets into rivers all but one school reopened thursday 
damage in the rainsoaked bradentonpalmetto area of tampa bay 
was estimated at more than 1 million the area has been drenched 
by more than 14 inches of rain this week 
gov bob martinez planned to view the area by helicopter on 
friday 
the heavy rains and flooding have caused a severe dispruption 
in the lives of manatee county residents and i want to see 
firsthand whether condiions might require additional assistance 
from the state he said 
the flooding was blamed on a nearstationary cold front hovering 
across the central florida peninsula the national weather service 
said the front thursday was drifting north to the tampast 
petersburg area where the red cross opened two shelters for 
possible evacuees from lowlying areas 
the steady rains were expected to fade to occasional showers and

floodwaters in some areas had not receded significantly by 
thursday and emergency crews said some riverside homes had several 
feet of water inside said tom strickland of the countys emergency

belongings said marilyn sapharas shelter coordinator at christ 
episcopal church where nearly 200 people were staying 
at the church shelter thursday morning children passed the time 
watching television adults sat around tables in the parish hall

my furniture will be in and what kind of mess ill find said 
anne williams a single parent with five children ages 8 to 17 
well have to start all over again 
although disappointed shelter residents were glad to be in 
dryer quarters 
its nice here no complaints said larry hunter 31 who 
spent all day wednesday helping neighbors evacuate through 
kneedeep water when they let us go home i hope i dont find a

40th anniversary that he would welcome a delegation from archrival 
south korea to discuss reunification

about 3500 students from a dozen colleges the south korean news 
agency yonhap said 
the most violent protests were reported in the southern city of 
kwangju where 600 students throwing rocks and firebombs fought 
riot police after an antiolympic rally at chonam university 
yonhap said

the olympics would diminish if dissidents remained in prison 
the protesters including about 50 people describing themselves 
as elderly democrats dispersed voluntarily after a brief 
sitdown in front of the schools main gate police stayed away and

kim said koreans wanted the olympics to be a major success and 
that he was confident there would be no attempt to disrupt the 
games 
north korea has said it will stay away from the seoul olympics 
because its demand to cohost the games was not accepted the 
international olympic committee rejected the norths cohosting 
demand saying the olympics are awarded to a single city and cannot 
be shared 
we deplore a half olympics yonhap quoted protesters as 
chanting 
the students argued that the olympics would only help perpetuate

reported in the onehour clash 
chun who stepped down at the end of his sevenyear term in 
february has come under public fire for alleged involvement in 
financial and other scandals 
radical students and dissidents charge that the government is 
blocking legal proceedings to bring chun to justice 
in his speech broadcast by north koreas staterun radio 
pyongyang kim il sung said developing ties with friendly 
capitalist countries is important in bringing his nations economy 
more in line with those of advanced countries 
we should develop good neighborly and friendly relations with 
capitalist countries which esteem our nations right of 
independence he said in the broadcast monitored in tokyo 
north koreas sluggish economy is plagued with mismanagement 
heavy international debt and an enormous portion of the countrys 
gross national product some 20 percent spent on the military 
the broadcast quoted kim 76 as saying during an 80minute 
speech at a rally that a northsouth summit should discuss creation 
of a unified confederate government reuniting the peninsula which 
was divided at the end of the threeyear korean war in 1953

said on israel television thursday that washingtons invitation to 
israeli foreign minister shimon peres to attend a highlevel 
mideast meeting came too late 
dukakis said in an interview that encouraging peace efforts 
has to be something the administration begins early in its tenure 
and works hard to achieve that didnt happen with this 
administration and i think this is going to be a new administration 
that is going to do that 
prime minister yitzhak shamir criticized the reagan 
administration for scheduling the meeting for for sept 26 five 
weeks before israels nov 1 election 
leaders of shamirs rightwing likud bloc accused peres head of 
the leftofcenter labor party of engineering the invitation to

said both he and shamir were told last month us diplomats were 
trying to work out such a meeting 
thursdays general strike was called by proplo uprising leaders 
to mark the nine months of the intefadeh or uprising begun

the moslem fundamentalist hamas group which called a rival 
strike for friday 
the general strike was observed throughout the occupied lands 
but in gaza city graffiti scrawled on walls in red called on

when the bean sprout washing machine was shipped 
from hong kong police were waiting when they opened its hollow 
steel rollers they found 183 pounds of nearly pure heroin worth up 
to 260 million on the street 
on thursday after six men were arrested in the case state and 
federal law enforcement officials said the heroin seizure was one 
of the largest in us history 
this is a very rare event to see this much heroin concentrated 
in one location said john j coleman special agent in charge of 
the us drug enforcement administration in new england 
he said the heroin was probably enough to supply all the addicts 
in new england for more than a year 
state police and us customs officers acting on confidential 
information were watching for the machine when it arrived by truck 
at a boston warehouse aug 30 according to court documents they 
replaced most of the heroin with sand and waited for someone to 
claim the device 
the heroin was hidden in the airtight stainless steel rollers 
of the machine said coleman 
four men were arrested tuesday after they allegedly picked up 
the machine in a rental truck distributed parts of it to two 
locations in boston and then took the remainder to a scrap metal 
dealer 
undercover dea agents later delivered some of the heroin to new 
york city where they arrested two more men wednesday night 
all six suspects have been charged with possession of heroin and 
conspiracy to distribute the drug said frank l mcnamara jr us 
attorney for massachusetts 
mcnamara said authorities believe the men are important figures 
in the drug trade not merely mules or carriers of drugs and 
may have ties to chinese organized crime groups 
police in hong kong have conducted several raids in recent days 
in connection with the case but no arrests have been made there 
he said 
five cardboard cartons of heroin were displayed at the news 
conference along with the disassembled parts of the bean sprout 
machine a contraption of prongs and rollers used by oriental 
restaurants and produce merchants 
the concealment effort was outstanding said williams s 
simmons acting special agent in charge of the us customs service 
for the northeast region 
regional customs director philip w spayd said the amount of 
heroin seized was one of the largest in the country and the largest 
ever in new england approximately 200 pounds was discovered in a 
shipment of ice buckets in seattle in 1985 and 378 pounds was 
found in miami in 1971 
once diluted the street value of the seized heroin would have 
been between 200 million and 260 million he said 
police said the four men arrested in boston were of vietnamese 
origin and gave their names as hung ta 24 dang phu 23 hieu ly 
24 and tuong luu 45 they were in the custody pending arraignment 
friday 
the two men arrested in new york were identified as wai kwok 
wong 40 and siksze yan 36 mcnamara said they are of chinese 
origin they appeared thursday before a federal magistrate in us 
district court but did not enter pleas and were held without bail 
pending a detention hearing sept 14

representatives from the post office and the 
communication workers union met thursday in an attempt to end 
britains weekold mail strike 
international mail service remained at a standstill but about 
half of britains 1500 local post offices opened with nonstriking 
and temporary staff who made sporadic deliveries said post office 
spokeswoman caroline francke 
the walkout began aug 31 as a 24hour strike called in a 
dispute over bonuses paid to new recruits in london and southeast 
england where the cost of living is high and the post office has 
trouble attracting workers because of low unemployment 
the strike now has no time limit with the union demanding that 
the bonuses be paid nationally or not at all 
until there is a concrete framework agreed on over the central 
recruitment issue and a formula over getting postmen back to work 
quickly these exploratory talks will go on said ms francke 
union president alan tuffin said thursday we are no nearer 
reaching an agreement 
a spokesman would not confirm whether tuffin joined the talks 
about 100000 of the unions 140000 members stayed off the job 
thursday said ms francke and only one of britains 82 main 
postal sorting centers in belfast northern ireland opened for 
business 
more than 100 million pieces of mail have piled up since the 
strike began said ms francke mail boxes around the country have 
been sealed 
liverpool police said strikers in that city 200 miles northwest 
of london behaved peacefully thursday but picket line violence 
during the week led to the arrest of five strikers for disorderly 
conduct 
the strike has disrupted business and the work of government 
agencies 
a watchdog body the mail users association said wednesday the 
dispute is costing british industry 43 million a day

a 63yearold jewish refusenik dying of 
cancer has again been denied permission to leave the soviet union 
for urgently needed medical treatment a soviet jewry group said 
thursday 
the union of councils for soviet jews said it had learned that 
soviet authorities have refused to grant an exit visa for georgi 
samoilovich a moscow mathematician suffering from a deadly throat 
lymphoma 
last month samoilovich was removed from a waiting list to enter 
the blokhin cancer institute in moscow for treatment 
samoilovich has been seeking permission to emigrate to israel 
for 11 years his wife a physician also is a refusenik 
americans who have been urging the soviet government to let 
samoilovich emigrate include dr richard rosenbluth chief 
oncologist at hackensack medical center in hackensack nj 
we will be starting a last desperate allout campaign to 
save his life and i hope the world will be with us rosenbluth 
said 
soviet authorities have been denying samoilovich permission to 
emigrate on grounds that he once did classified research work but 
rosenbluth noted that samoilovich has not worked in his 
profession in over 10 years 
the injustice of this case is overwhelming especially in 
light of the new humanitarian facade the soviets are putting on 
rosenbluth said

deposits flowed out of the nations savings 
institutions for the third consecutive month in july the 
government said thursday 
the federal home loan bank board said net withdrawals from the 
3088 savings institutions were 123 million in july after hitting 
a revised 33 billion in june up from a previous estimate of 29 
billion 
in may sampl customers withdrew 11 billion but before that 
deposits grew for seven consecutive months as investors battered by 
the october stock market crash sought a safe haven for their money 
in governmentinsured accounts 
bank board economist james barth said in a statement that a 
slowdown in withdrawals is normal for july consumers typically 
take money from their accounts at the start of summer to pay for 
vacations and other seasonal expenses 
mortgage lending by thrift institutions in july declined to 
211 billion 14 percent below the same month last year when many 
people were refinancing their mortgages the bank board said 
barth said the drop in mortgage lending reflects the climb in 
interest rates this summer 
the bank board also reported that the institutions capital 
declined by 573 million in july after falling by 30 billion in 
june for the first seven months of the year its off 64 billion 
declines in capital which is the difference between an 
institutions loans and other assets and what it owes to depositors 
and other creditors often reflect losses

spending by political action committees to 
influence the 1988 elections is on the increase but the rise is 
far smaller than in previous years the federal election commission 
said thursday 
several political scientists said the money figures compiled by 
the fec indicate that the pac movement may be leveling off and 
reaching its saturation point 
the fec said that for the 18 months ending june 30 pacs 
representing business labor ideological and other interest groups 
spent 2154 million a 48 percent increase over the same period 
in the 19856 election cycle 
the increase however was well below the 38 percent rise in pac 
spending that occurred in the corresponding 18 months of the 19856 
cycle when compared to the 19834 cycle which itself was up 44 
percent over 19812 
receipts by pacs showed a similar slowing in growth the 2666 
million collected during the first 18 months of the current cycle 
was 47 percent above 19856 which saw 18month receipts running 
30 percent above 19834 which was 42 percent over 19812 
as of june 30 pacs had given 949 million to candidates for 
federal office 3 million to presidential races 327 million to 
senate candidates and 592 million to house candidates 
this represented a 21 percent increase over the same 18 months 
in 19856 this rate however was below the 38 percent rise from 
19834 to 19856 and the 49 percent growth from 19812 to 19834 
incumbent senators and representatives got got nearly 90 percent 
of the money contributed by pacs to congressional races in the 
first 18 months of this election cycle democrats led republicans 
609 million to 339 million 
norman ornstein a congressional analyst with the american 
enterprise institute a washington think tank said the 
doubledigit percentage increases in pac receipts and spending 
couldnt continue indefinitely 
we may have reached a saturation point he said thats 
good news for all of us except campaign vendors 
ornstein said that its hard to say whether weve got a 
longterm trend 
he said the reduced rates of increase could be partly 
attributable to to so few competitive races in the house there 
isnt the demand from incumbents to put the screws to pacs 
janet grenzke a political science professor at holy cross 
college in worcester mass said the figures could indicate the 
saturation point is nearing for pacs 
those people who were going to form pacs and who were going to 
participate in the political process through them have pretty much 
done so grenzke said 
she said some political money that previously might have been 
channeled through pacs now could be ending up as soft money 
the lesscontrolled and littlereported cash flow increasingly 
finding its way to places like political party committees 
herb alexander a political science professor at the university 
of southern california said the number of pacs has leveled off as 
has the number of pacs that are really active 
a couple of hundred pacs do half the business he said 
theres an ingrown limitation on how much they can raise 
while its not at a standstill the growth rate isnt as explosive 
 
the pac phenomenom is reaching a point of natural limits 
said alexander 
randy huwa of common cause the selfdescribed citizens lobby 
that has been urging congress to outlaw pacs said he was not 
heartened by the latest fec figures 
the first thing i look at is contributions to candidates and 
thats continuing to grow he said

a federal trade commission aide has been 
dismissed after sending a letter to newspaper editorial boards 
criticizing democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
carter clews associate director for media relations was 
dismissed on wednesday said ftc general counsel robert paul who 
said his office has been assigned to investigate the case 
the letter was sent aug 4 by clews to newspapers offering to 
rebut criticism of the agency by dukakis and questioning statements 
made by dukakis in a controversy over advertising by optometrists 
paul said he was not prepared to say whether clews action 
violated the hatch act which prohibits political acitvity by 
federal workers he said the investigation is continuing 
meanwhile ftc commissioners mary l azcuenaga and andrew j 
strenio issued a statement dissociating themselves from a second 
latter sent by clews to broadcast talk show hosts offering 
appearances by commission members 
that letter contains a postscript saying that dukakis has been 
critical of the commission and adds that commission members are 
willing to discuss the records of the ftc and of the massachusetts 
governor 
azcuenaga an independent and strenio a democrat said they 
are happy to make appearances to discuss consumer affairs and other 
commission activities but will not discuss candidates for public 
office 
clews said later friday i dont believe i violated the hatch 
act and the general counsel himself has not said i violated the 
hatch act and if i had violated the hatch act there are certain 
procedures that by law they have to go through to give me a fair 
hearing none of that was done 
i think this whole thing is political and i was targeted 
because commissioner strenio and commissioner azcuenaga want to 
prevent mr dukakis from being criticized for his own attacks upon 
the commission all i did was try to set straight the record of the 
federal trade commission he said

telephone booth near the police station at the time of the 
explosion they did not have her age but said she was in her early 
teens 
one of the five injured policemen and the girl were taken to a 
hospital at nearby magherafelt the other four injured policemen

the presidential campaigns of george bush and 
michael dukakis have tentatively agreed on sept 25 for the first 
debate between the two candidates a dukakis aide said thursday 
both debates will be general in subject matter in contrast to 
four years ago when the first was on domestic policy and the second 
covered defense and foreign policy said mark goodin bushs 
campaign spokesman 
paul brountas chairman of the dukakis campaign said the two 
contenders will face each other in a televised debate at wake 
forest university in winstonsalem nc 
brountas said their second debate would be either oct 13 or 14 
depending on the length of the american league baseball playoff 
series which will be televised in prime time 
the debate between vice presidential candidates dan quayle and 
lloyd bentsen is expected to take place during the week of oct 3 
the two campaigns have not reached agreement on the location for 
the second presidential debate and the vice presidential encounter 
he said 
we are still discussing format staging and the length of the 
debates and we will continue to carry on those discussions 
brountas said after meeting with bushs campaign chairman james a 
baker iii we believe we made good progress this will be an 
opportunity for the american people to see presidential candidates 
debating facetoface and mantoman 
the dukakis campaign wanted at least one more debate with the 
first to be on foreign policy and national security issues but 
that was rejected by the bush campaign 
brountas and baker emphasized that nothing is finally settled 
until they have agreed on all aspects of the debates 
but bush said thursday night it sounds very good got the 
right number 
additionally a statement released on air force two said i 
congratulate our negotiators on working out a formula for the 
number and timing of debates which certainly has my support 
on tuesday after weeks of negotiations the dukakis campaign 
said it was willing to accept the bush campaigns offer of two 
presidential debates as well as one encounter between quayle and 
bentsen 
the first debate will be sponsored by the national commission on 
presidential debates a group headed by the chairmen of the 
republican and democratic parties the commission also was likely 
to end up as sponsor of the vice presidential debate 
the league of women voters will sponsor the second presidential 
debate league president nancy neuman said the league is pleased 
that its now official that the american public will see at least 
one nonpartisan debate this fall 
she urged the campaigns to include the league in discussions on 
format last spring the league suggested 90minute debates with a 
single moderator rather than a panel of reporters such as used in 
past presidential debates 
goodin said the site of the second presidential debate would 
likely be on the west coast 
meanwhile nbc news president michael gartner issued a statement 
saying the network would not be able to televise the first debate 
live because it would conflict with its commitment to cover the 
olympic games 
nbc news will run a taped replay of the first presidential 
debate between george bush and michael dukakis that now has been 
scheduled for sunday sept 25 gartner said nbc has long been 
committed to broadcasting the olympics whose dates were known by 
both political parties

vice president george bush drawing on the 
advantages of office to promote his presidential campaign watched 
the fiery destruction of two us nuclearmissile rocket motors 
thursday and charged later that democratic rival michael dukakis 
wants to restrain us not the soviet union in arms control 
bush the republican nominee for president was the senior 
government representative and featured speaker at longhorn army 
ammunition plant in northeast texas for a ceremony marking the 
destruction of the first us weapons under the ussoviet 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
the event provided a highly telegenic campaign showcase and 
dovetailed into bushs themes of peace and prosperity 
in a state where 29 electoral votes are up for grabs in a close 
race bush also campaigned in tyler and criticized dukakis for 
supporting a nuclear freeze as the inf missiles were being deployed 
in western europe in response to a soviet builduip 
he wanted to restrain us not the soviet union bush told an 
enthusiastic tyler crowd therein lies a big difference between 
george bush and the governor of massachusetts 
in a setting designed for television cameras bush was joined on 
stage by the apache belles an allfemale drill team from tyler 
junior college dressed in cowgirl hats and swimming suitstyle 
outfits decorated with fringe 
i want to see us build on this record of peace through 
strength and it cant be done if we have a naive view of the soviet 
union bush said attacking dukakis anew for opposing the mx and 
midgetmen missiles the strategic defense initiative the b1 
bomber and two aircraft carrier task forces 
he asks for nothing in return bush said we must not 
and if i am elected i will not make unilateral concessions to mr 
gorbachev or the soviet union 
sheila tate press secretary to bush said the cost of bushs 
travel to the rocketdestruction in karnack and related expenses 
were being paid out of campaign funds although bush aides said it 
was not a campaign event 
in another development she said the vice president in a 
reversal of policy supports an increase in the minimum wage 
which has been fixed for seven years at 335 an hour she did not 
say how large a hike he favors 
bush in an interview in tyler acknowledged that he goes out of 
his way not to mention dukakis running mate fellow texan lloyd 
bentsen 
i keep crossing it out from proposed speeches when people 
send it in there bush said im running against the governor 
of massachusetts very liberal 
in karnack the ground trembled in vibration for 58 seconds as 
the motor of a pershing ii missile was ignited and burned its solid 
fuel rocket propellant bolted in concrete and steel the motor 
remained stationary as it shot back a fiery tail and thick blossoms 
of white smoke 
the motor of a lesspowerful pershing 1a missile was destroyed 
the same way it burned off in 37 seconds after the firing the 
pershing 1a motor was hauled by forklift to a crushing machine and 
destroyed the larger pershing ii motor was to be destroyed later 
after it cooled down 
bush standing on a speakers platform 1300 feet away watched 
the firing through binoculars 
when the smoke cleared bush declared this has been a 
spectacular day god bless you this has been a great day 
the kremlin began destroying some of its missiles july 22 and as 
of sept 6 had eliminated 92 rockets 
after viewing the rocketengine crushing and pronouncing it 
well done the vice president was presented with two metal 
fragments he said he would give one to president reagan and keep 
the other for himself 
soviet officials at the event also gave him fragments of their 
destroyed rockets 
i hope the direction were going in in terms of destruction 
and verifiable reductions continues bush said that was the 
message i got there today and i think the soviets felt the same 
way the ones i talked to there 
under the treaty signed in washington last december by reagan 
and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev the united states and soviet 
union are required to destroy all nuclear missiles with a range of 
300 to 3400 miles within three years 
officials of the soviet embassy in washington and a team of 
soviet inspectors from moscow were flown here to witness the 
destruction of the us weapons we have become the eyewitnesses 
of significant events said nikolai shabolin the chief soviet 
inspector 
bush in brief remarks said we are witnessing today one of 
those unique moments in the career of man this was the day we 
began to reverse the arms race this was the day we began 
destroying the weapons of destruction 
bush then flew to rockford ill where he planned to address 
the illinois federation of republican women bush told a crowd of 
about 200 wellwishers at the airport that illinois is going to 
be a battleground 
this is one of the critical four or five states in the entire 
country he said

a new jersey man was stripped of his us 
citizenship thursday after his attorney did not rebut government 
claims that he served as a guard at a nazi death camp during world 
war ii federal prosecutors said 
us district judge clarkson s fisher ordered 62yearold 
stefan reger denaturalized after a telephone conference during 
which regers attorney did not contest government motions for 
summary judgment 
prosecutors alleged in court papers that reger concealed his 
wartime activities as a member of the ss deaths head battalion and 
guard at the birkenau section of the auschwitz concentration camp 
in nazioccupied poland 
the government said reger was a native of filipovo yugoslavia 
in court papers filed in february reger acknowledged being a 
member of hitlers ss but denied guarding prisoners at birkenau 
us attorney samuel a alito jr said in a statement 
alito said reger is believed to be in germany alito was not 
available for further comment and it was not immediately known 
what further action the government might take against reger 
reger of the trenton suburb of yardville has an unlisted 
telephone number and could not be reached for comment his son 
michael a contractor was not at home thursday and a woman who 
said she was his wife declined to discuss the matter 
regers attorney john barry did not return a telephone message 
left on his answering machine thursday afternoon 
summary judgment occurs when attorneys ask that a judge rule in 
their favor based on documents and testimony presented before the 
case goes to trial 
the justice departments office of special investigations filed 
a complaint in december 1987 seeking regers denaturalization osi 
director neal m sher said reger entered the united states in 1952 
and became an us citizen in 1957 
according to the complaint reger beginning in 1943 guarded 
prisoners as they performed forced labor and were being transported 
between camps 
the complaint accused him of no specific acts 
in his application to enter the united states reger said he 
served in the 91st grenadier regiment of the german army between 
1943 and march 5 1945 and as a waffenss private until april 29 
that year 
sher contended reger should not have been allowed to become a 
us citizen because his activities during the war helped in the 
persecution of civilians because of their race religion or 
national origin 
the governments complaint said reger joined the waffenss in 
1943 and served at birkenau until january 1945 when he left to 
guard a prisoner transport to another concentration camp 
all documents related to the camps were destroyed by hitlers 
ss making it difficult to determine how many people died at 
auschwitz but the figure is put at 4 million

the house approved amendments to an antidrug 
bill thursday that would permit federal death sentences for 
murderers in drug felonies and deny many federal benefits to anyone 
convicted of two narcotics offenses 
sponsors of the amendments rolled over opponents with arguments 
that these criminal and administrative penalties would deter those 
who use and profit from drugs 
the death penalty amendment authored by rep george gekas 
rpa passed 299111 and the benefit denials sponsored by rep 
bill mccollum rfla was approved 33567 the provisions were 
attached to a bill that would add some 2 billion to the nations 
existing 39 billion attack on illegal drugs 
the house was unable to finish the bill thursday night and is 
not expected to resume debate until next wednesday before ending 
debate the lawmakers voted 259134 for an amendment that would 
permit introduction of illegally seized evidence in federal court 
if police acted in good faith 
opponents of the benefit denials offered an amendment to water 
down the potential loss of student loans public housing veterans 
benefits and other federal assistance 
but they couldnt sway their colleagues even by pointing out 
the amendment would prevent burial of medal of honor winners in 
arlington national cemetery 
battered death penalty opponents had argued that capital 
punishment wouldnt stop hardened drug killers from murdering 
someone 
the death penalty provision would give federal judges the option 
of handing down a death sentence to anyone convicted of 
intentionally killing someone during a drug felony 
the house also approved 4101 a measure providing for a 
mandatory life term for such killers that language opposed by 
rep george w crockett jr dmich was proposed by death 
penalty foes as an alternative but those backing capital 
punishment refused to stop there 
mccollums amendment would deny benefits for five years for 
anyone convicted of two or more drugrelated offenses within a 
10year period and denial for 10 years for persons convicted of 
drug distribution 
heads of federal agencies could restore benefits for those who 
completed a drug rehabilitation program or were otherwise been 
rehabilitated 
veterans benefits would be denied only to those convicted of 
drug distribution retirement welfare health and disability 
benefits would be exempted from the penalty 
mccollum argued that education and rehabilitation are not 
enough to stop demand and added if we dont have a deterrent 
we wont win the war on the demand side and if we dont win on the 
demand side we wont win the war period 
rep dan lungren rcalif asked if the house wanted to let a 
drug trafficker send the message that i got involved in drugs in 
vietnam and therefore im excused 
rep charles b rangel dny whose watered down version of 
the benefit denials failed 278124 told the house that entire 
families in public housing could be thrown into the street if the 
head of household had two drug convictions 
and he asked does it make any sense on the eve of 
graduation that we would cut off benefits to college students 
gekas said the death penalty amendment would provide a swift 
and certain deterrent against drug killings 
a democratic supporter rep james a traficant jr of ohio 
said drug dealers dont have to read anyone their rights the 
drug dealers who kill have no conscience 
rangel dny said the sentiment for capital punishment was 
linked to the upcoming election 
were now reaching the point because its on the eve of an 
election that we may find ourselves thrown into a position where 
we have to explain to voters just who was the toughest on crime 
who was the toughest on drug traffickers rangel argued 
sometimes its those who say lets kill the rascals who 
prevail 
rangel said 36 states already have the death penalty and if 
the other 14 states want it they can get it 
while the senate has yet to consider its own antidrug bill it 
already has expressed sentiment on capital punishment this year a 
separate bill approving the death penalty against drug dealers and 
kingpins passed in june by a 6529 margin 
in 1986 the senates refusal to support the death penalty in 
drugrelated murders resulted in congress eliminating the measure 
from an antidrug bill that year the house had inserted capital 
punishment in the 1986 bill by a vote of 296112 
off the house floor members were pressured by guncontrol 
advocates and opponents over a provision for a sevenday waiting 
period for handgun purchases the language also includes an 
optional background check of the purchaser by law enforcement 
authorities 
the national rifle association is lobbying to remove the waiting 
period and proregulation groups are trying to save it both sides 
have brought police officers to the capitol to help in the lobbying 
effort 
gekas death penalty provision would permit but not require 
a judge to impose the death sentence on anyone convicted of 
intentionally killing someone during a drug felony 
if the death penalty was not imposed the amendment would 
require a sentence of 20 years to life 
the senate legislation approved last june would permit the death 
penalty for narcotics dealers convicted of murder in drug crimes 
and for drug kingpins defined under law as those who supervise 
five or more people commit at least three federal drug felonies 
and derive substantial income from a continuing criminal enterprise 
most federal death penalty provisions are not enforceable 
because unlike some state laws they were never brought into 
compliance with supreme court guidelines on capital punishment

a vietnamese diplomat who allegedly waved a gun at 
protesters will surrender his immunity so british government 
officials can question him the foreign office said thursday 
vietnamese ambassador tran van hung handed over a toy gun 
which he said was the weapon the official had brandished in front 
of vietnamese refugees demonstrating outside the vietnamese embassy 
on sunday a ministry spokesman said 
during a meeting thursday afternoon with junior minister timothy 
eggar the ambassador agreed the diplomat third secretary khang 
than nhan will surrender his immunity and visit the foreign office 
for questioning said the spokesman 
it has not yet been decided whether police will attend the 
interview he said speaking on condition he not be identified 
the foreign office on wednesday warned the ambassador he could 
expect the gravest consequences if he refused to allow the 
diplomat to be questioned it also insisted the embassy surrender 
any other weapons 
vietnamese protesters sent two photographs of the diplomat 
holding a gun which were published wednesday in the daily express 
newspaper 
the pictures showed a man with a pistol standing on the steps of 
the embassy the paper said the demonstrators were vietnamese 
refugees opposed to the current communist regime 
under the terms of the 1961 vienna convention on diplomatic 
practice embassies are treated as foreign territory 
although diplomats and other embassy staff are required to obey 
local laws they cannot be prosecuted unless the country concerned 
agrees to waive their diplomatic immunity

former leader ne win appears to be retaining 
some control over the burmese government and one suggestion in the 
south asian countrys deepening crisis is for him to go into exile 
in west germany or austria a congressman just back from rangoon 
said wednesday 
rep stephen j solarz dny told reporters that hundreds of 
thousands of burmese have already demonstrated they are ready to 
lay down their lives for freedom and the population will not 
retreat from demands for swift change from dictatorship to 
multiparty democracy 
also on wednesday the house approved by unanimous consent a 
resolution introduced by solarz urging democratic change in burma 
the resolution called for the establishment of a transitional 
body consisting of burmese citizens who are unquestionably 
committed to democracy and who have the confidence of the burmese 
people to organize the holding of multiparty elections and 
otherwise facilitate the establishment of a genuinely democratic 
government 
solarz chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on 
asian and pacific affairs met numerous prominent burmese during a 
24hour stopover in rangoon last weekend en route home from moscow 
and beijing they included president maung maung prime minister 
tun tin and several student and opposition leaders he said 
a solution mentioned in the developing showdown is for ne win to 
leave burma perhaps for west germany where he has spent time in 
the past solarz said 
as for west germany the potential role they have to play is 
in terms of willingness if ne win expressed interest in leaving 
the country to facilitate resolution of the crisis in permitting 
him to go there the new york democrat said 
if ne win decided to leave west germany is one of the places 
he might choose to go to the other leading contender is austria 
solarz said recalling his conversations with burmese 
although ne win resigned july 23 as head of burmas ruling 
socialist program party solarz said his talks in rangoon gave him 
the impression that ne win continues to call the shots 
virtually everybody i spoke to said he was not managing day to 
day affairs but there was the sense that no decision may be made 
without his consent there was also some evidence that key people 
in government are beating a steady path to his door he said 
solarz said the proposal of ne wins successors for a party 
congress next week followed by a referendum on multiparty 
democracy came too late and is utterly unacceptable to the 
people this is because the government has lost all credibility 
and the proposal is regarded as a maneuver to cling to power he 
said

river levels were stable or receding 
thursday and the dhaka airport reopened so relief supplies can be 
flown in but distribution of aid to flood victims was slow and the 
death toll continued climbing 
the government said 609 people have died in floods that began 
with the annual monsoon season in june tapered off then resumed 
in devastating fashion aug 27 daily tallies by dhaka newspapers 
total more than 1300 which is considered more accurate 
information minister mahbubur rahman said thursday 510 people 
drowned died of snake bites or were killed when their houses 
collapsed the government health center reported 99 deaths from 
diarrhea caused by drinking polluted water that flooded 
threequarters of the countrys 55000 square miles 
health center officials reported 135537 known cases of diarrhea 
nationwide an increase of 15715 in the previous 24 hours but 
that includes only areas in communication with the capital 
officials say about onequarter of bangladeshs 110 million 
people are homeless 
many still are stranded on rooftops in boats and on the rare 
patches of high ground in bangladesh most of which is a vast river 
delta water levels in flood areas range from a few inches to more 
than 10 feet 
rahman insisted there was no shortage of water purification 
tablets but his assertion seemed questionable 
more than two dozen people interviewed at random thursday in 
relief camps flooded buildings and on rooftops in dhaka said they 
had no purification tablets and were drinking water that could be 
dangerous 
most of us have fevers and headaches said lily a 
17yearold seamstress camping out at the fair fashion company 
factory with 10 coworkers she said they paid 31 cents a day for 
about five gallons of tap water 
lily and a coworker 20yearold shamima said they had heard 
of water purification tablets but lily said no one has given us 
any and we dont have enough money to buy any 
a diplomat from a western nation that has tried to buy water 
purification tablets for relief distribution reported searching in 
vain for sufficient quantities in bangladesh and nearby countries 
representatives of other aid donors made similar reports all on 
condition of anonymity 
pledges of disaster aid reached a total of at least 60 million 
thursday according to figures for individual nations reported by 
rahman the information minister 
included are 169 million in goods and cash from japan 36 
million from the united states and 65 million each from france 
and the international league of red cross and red crescent 
societies much of the aid will take the form of food blankets and 
medicine 
britain said it will send 119 million in new aid the foreign 
office said in london on thursday that the aid supplements 800000 
already pledged 
prospects for getting it to bangladesh brightened with the 
opening of dhakas airport to all aircraft more than half the 
10000foot runway was flooded this week and only helicopters and 
smaller commercial aircraft were landing 
the world food program issued a statement in rome saying the 
greatest problem is moving the aid to where it is needed 
relief distribution is being carried out by boats barges and 
tugs and a very limited number of helicopters the un agency 
said the government of bangladesh has appealed for more 
logistical assistance 
rahman told reporters neighboring countries agreed to study the 
flood problem in an effort to control the annual deluges carried by 
rivers that originate in india and nepal 
he said the problem was put on the agenda of the december 
meeting of the south asia association for regional cooperation 
the three mightiest rivers that run through the country to the 
bay of bengal are the ganges brahmaputra and meghna 
floods are a problem every monsoon season but the inundation 
this year is the worst for many years in bangladesh whose rivers 
cover 10 percent of its territory even in normal times 
rapid deforestation in india and nepal has contributed to the 
problem because bare soil cannot retain as much water according to 
geographers government officials and un specialists 
a report from the bangladesh flood warning and forecast center 
said the ganges and meghna continued receding slightly thursday and 
the brahmaputra held its level with all three still above flood 
stage

michael dukakis told war veterans 
thursday he does not question george bushs patriotism but i 
question his priorities and said the massive federal debt 
threatens the nations military strength 
military might cannot be sustained without economic might 
said the democratic presidential nominee we cannot build a 
strong national defense on a mountain of debt 
dukakis received a polite sometimes warm reception in an 
address to the annual convention of the american legion the 
nations largest organization of veterans of wartime military 
service 
he later flew to buffalo ny to tour a general motors engine 
plant then attended a gala fundraiser in new york city that the 
campaign said would raise 5 million for the fall effort 
he shook hands with jesse jackson who told reporters im 
available to campaignupon request of the ticket 
dukakis steered clear of mentioning in his speech the strategic 
weapons systems proposed by the reagan administration that he 
opposes such as the mx and midgetman nuclear missiles and the 
star wars nuclear defense system 
in a news conference later dukakis said he supports continued 
star wars research at the reduced level of 1 billion a year but 
believes testing and deployment of such a nuclearshield system 
would violate the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty which he 
supports as in the nations best interest 
if i made the judgment and if congress made the judgment it 
was essential to our national security then obviously we would 
proceed with it but we dont know that at this point dukakis 
said 
dukakis has belittled the program known as the strategic 
defense initiative in his campaign speeches he has called it a 
fantasy and said the country needs star schools not star 
wars while at the same time supporting continued research at 
1982 levels 
he faced repeated questioning about what appeared to be a change 
in tone if not position he said he favored research as a way to 
keep our options open 
 
im for continued research but to commit billions that we 
dont have to a system that is untested untried and unproven 
and which mr bush himself apparently changed positions on a week 
ago in my judgment doesnt serve the national interest dukakis 
said he referred to bushs recent remarks that suggested he was 
softening support for sdi deployment 
dukakis followed by a day an appearance before the same group by 
bush the vice president and republican presidential nominee who 
has attacked dukakis as soft on defense for opposing new weapons 
systems 
 
dukakis an army veteran wore a legion convention medal on his 
lapel and a pin commemorating soldiers missing in action but did 
not wear a legionnaires cap during a speech that was interrupted 
repeatedly by applause 
he critized the reagan administration for misspending some 
defense money on weapons system that dont work and attacked the 
administration and bush for supporting cuts in veterans benefits 
including cuts in the veterans administration hospital system 
 
my opponent in this election is a patriotic man who served his 
country well in time of war dukakis said i do not question 
his love for this country but there are days and this is one of 
them when i question his priorities 
 
bush used similar words before the legion saying he did not 
question dukakis patriotism but his support for a strong defense 
 
dukakis said bush supports a capital gains tax break that would 
benefit the wealthy and compared that position with what he said 
was bushs vote to break a senate tie to cut va health care 
benefits by 2 billion and to eliminate cost of living increases 
for disabled veterans 
 
what kind of priorities are those a tax cut for those who 
have it made a cut in income for those who lost a leg at normandy 
or were blinded at inchon or had an arm torn off at khe sanh he 
said 
 
dukakis praised the ussoviet treaty reducing 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles and said i salute president 
reagan for it but he said the country should strengthen 
conventional forces while working to build on that treaty 
we cannot rest here because today after eight years and 2 
trillion we still dont have an antitank weapon that can stop 
modern soviet tanks we have serious shortages in ammunition and 
spare parts and maintenance we see billions being spent on weapons 
that dont do what they are designed to do and we see too many 
defense dollars slipping into the pockets of wheeler dealers and 
consultants he said 
at his news conference dukakis made light of bushs 
misstatement before the legion group that sept 7 was the 
anniversary of the japanese attack on pearl harbor the attack was 
on dec 7 1941 
i didnt know there were only 16 shopping days to christmas 
until yesterday dukakis said 
he shrugged off a question about the latest poll showing him 
eight points down and the suggestion his campaign is in disarray 
i dont think were slipping and i dont think were in 
disarray he said

firefighters on thursday 
for the first time closed all but a small piece of the oldest 
national park devastated by fires that surrounded old faithful and 
charred more than 1 million acres 
ive done this for 20 years and ive never seen anything as 
awesome as this said fred roach operations chief on the 
221800acre north fork fire which destroyed 17 buildings in the 
park wednesday 
winds died down and temperatures cooled thursday and a weekend 
weather forecast called for rain or snow but also for winds up to 
60 mph 
it looks as if the burn that went through yesterday pretty 
much fireproofed the old faithful area north fork commander 
denny bungarz said the priorities have switched now that the 
fire has gone around here 
some firefighters and equipment that had been deployed around 
old faithful were moved elsewhere thursday because of the reduced 
threat to the geyser development officials said 
firefighters in wyomings bridgerteton national forest used a 
helicopter and tracking dogs to search for a crewman missing from 
fire lines since wednesday night but reported that he returned to 
camp under his own power 
about 150 residents evacuated sunday from silver gate and cooke 
city small montana towns on the edge of the park were allowed to 
go home but a spot fire closed the highway firefighters used 
backfires tuesday to save the towns 
fire officials warned that a wind shift could send the 
119000acre storm creekhellroaring fire back at the canyon towns 
and force another evacuation 
fires also burned in alaska idaho california oregon 
washington and utah where four cabins were destroyed by flames 
although federal officials have called this the worst fire 
season in 30 years no fatalities have been directly attributed to 
the blazes which have charred 365 million acres an area larger 
than connecticut 
however one man was killed aug 19 when a private helicopter 
crashed in the bighorn national forest in wyoming on aug 19 the 
helicopter was on its way to a wilderness area to replace batteries 
in fire communications equipment 
president reagan is sending a cabinetlevel team to the west to 
see what additional federal help is needed in fighting fires and 
the white house said the number of troops on the fire line is 
likely to be increased so far about 2500 military personnel are 
fighting fires 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan met with agriculture 
secretary richard lyng interior secretary donald hodel and deputy 
defense secretary william h taft iv the three plan to leave for 
yellowstone on friday 
at yellowstone officials opened only an eightmile section of 
road from the north entrance at gardiner mont to the swan lake 
flats and a 14mile stretch from the west entrance to madison 
junction park spokesmen said 
most of the 22 millionacre park which includes about 250 
miles of roadway was closed to ensure an open path for fire trucks 
and to protect tourists from the roaring flames park officials 
said it is the first time such a large area in yellowstone has been 
closed 
the only tourist attraction open was mammoth hot springs which 
includes a hotel and campground a restaurant visitors center 
employees dormitory and a small grocery store 
wind gusts up to 85 mph wednesday briefly trapped some crews and 
tourists and destroyed 17 buildings the strong wind knocked down 
trees in the complex including a 50foot pine next to the main 
entrance of historic old faithful inn the building was not 
damaged and tourists had evacuated earlier 
trees were just popping like matchsticks said robert lee a 
firefighter from auburn ala 
firefighters on thursday hosed down the stillsmoldering rubble 
of nearby cabins many with only metal fixtures and bed springs 
identifiable crews also cleared fuel in the complex around the 
parks most famous attraction 
heavy smoke blanketed the area and small licks of fire could be 
seen in many spots on either side of the road flames continued to 
threaten the structures remaining said roach the fire operations 
chief 
in bridgerteton national forest where missing crewman pete 
alire 36 of el rito nm returned unharmed to camp around noon 
authorities said they planned to investigate his disappearance from 
the fire lines wednesday 
in montanas glacier national park firefighters struggled to 
flank the 14000acre red bench forest fire that has burned more 
than a dozen homes but officials were reluctant to assign crews to 
the leading edge of the fire 
in a situation like this when youve got 20 mph winds and a 
large very dry area of lodgepole pine the only things that will 
slow it down are rain humidity and natural barriers information 
officer jim payne said 
about 1400 firefighters were on the lines of montanas 
238400acre canyon creek fire near the idaho border which was 
mostly stalled by cool temperatures thursday 
fires have burned about 200000 acres in the rugged canyons of 
central idaho including seven wilderness fires in the nez perce 
national forest that continue to burn out of control 
the entiat fire in the swakane canyon area of central washington 
is the states biggest forest fire and has consumed 36170acres 
of wildlife habitat five other blazes mostly contained have 
burned about 70000 acres

a woman whose car was seized at the border 
because agents found two 50cent pipes from mexico says the agency 
carried zero tolerance too far 
a us customs service spokesman in houston confirmed that no 
drugs were found but said teresa millers car was seized sunday 
because of paraphernalia 
custom officials said thursday the car would be returned 
ms miller who lives in suburban houston said wednesday that 
her friend valerie cantrell bought the pipes in mexico where the 
two had gone shopping 
its appalling said ms miller 27 a clerical worker at a 
pasadena law office im an american citizen and i should have 
rights first off they the pipes were not even mine 
ms cantrell 23 who also does clerical work at the law office 
said the onyx pipes were among several knickknacks she bought and 
were a gift for a friend ms cantrell said neither she or ms 
miller use drugs 
the seizure at the us port of entry at progreso stems from 
the administrations zero tolerance policy designed to curtail the 
demand for drugs customs spokesman charles conroy said 
customs officials announced thursday afternoon that they would 
release the car back to ms miller if she or someone else returns 
to progreso and claims it and conroy said it had been decided that 
no charges would be filed 
that seizure has been canceled by the us customs service 
conroy said we considered all the facts involved and the 
circumstances in the case and came to the conclusion that the 
seizure did not fit the spirit and intent of the zero tolerance 
program 
conroy said he was not aware of any decision to reimburse ms 
miller for her additional travel expenses houston is about 350 
miles from progreso 
the women said they had been told that the car on which ms 
miller still owes 5800 would be put up for auction if the appeal 
was rejected 
chris peacock a spokesman for us sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
had said the matter was being looked into he added that five 
complaints had been received in the last month about seizures along 
the texas border 
conroy said that from march 21 when zero tolerance took effect 
through june 474 vehicles have been seized in the customs 
services southwest region texas oklahoma arizona and new 
mexico

a transcript of cockpit conversation on delta 
flight 1141 reveals the crew knew their jetliner was in serious 
trouble about 21 seconds before it crashed aug 31 at dallasfort 
worth international airport a newspaper reported thursday 
the transcript of a tape shows that about nine seconds after an 
apparently normal takeoff a cockpit alarm showed the boeing 727 
was not able to gather enough speed to stay aloft the dallas times 
herald reported 
the salt lake citybound plane exploded and exploded and broke 
apart on impact killing 13 of the 108 people on board 
eleven secords before impact capt larry lon davis exclaimed 
were not gunna make it one of the final entries on the 
transcript appears to be a scream 
the unauthorized release of the transcript drew sharp criticism 
from john mazor spokesman for the air line pilots association in 
washington dc who warned there will probably be some 
repercussions 
it will be months before investigators pinpoint the cause of the 
crash but two primary suspects have emerged they are wing flaps 
designed to give the plane lift and engine problems during the 
flight 
the transcript reveals that flight engineer steven judd and 
copilot carey kirkland went through a standard preparation 
checklist 
in the transcript kirkland told judd that the flaps were 
extended in the correct position for normal takeoff during the 
checklist less than a minute before the plane received permission 
for takeoff 
national transportation safety board investigators said last 
week that the cockpit recording indicates there were two compressor 
stalls which are disruptions of air flow one each in two of the 
engines 
the transcript however notes five possible compressor stalls 
within six seconds a set of two followed within seconds by three 
more the newspaper reported 
investigators have not been able to determine whether any 
compressor stalls actually occurred safety board officials said 
the engines are to be tested at the pratt amp whitney manufacturing 
plant in east hartford conn 
mazor said he believes the transcript which he said appears to 
be a very relevant portion of the cockpit tape may have been 
released to point the finger of blame away from whoever was 
doing the leaking but said he would not speculate on who that 
may have been 
the release of one piece of evidence in an investigation that 
make take nearly a year is folly and may lead people to draw 
wrong and unfair conclusions mazor said 
this has happened many times in the past and weve complained 
many times in the past mazor said 
he said the pilots union may consider filing a complaint with 
the national transportation safety board which is investigating 
the crash about the transcripts early release 
we got it from an investigator said ray herndon an 
assistant managing editor of the times herald but the newspaper 
would not disclose what agency the investigator worked for 
a spokesman for the transportation safety board in washington 
dc said the board also is upset that a major portion of the 
transcript was leaked to the newspaper 
were upset because that transcript is an unauthorized 
preliminary and incomplete version said the ntsb spokesman 
michael benson by law that transcript is not to be released for 
60 days we make every effort to ensure the transcript is 
confidential 
benson said there is no way to determine who gave the transcript 
to the times herald a number of parties have access to that 
transcript including the pilots union he said 
benson said ntsb officials are reviewing security procedures to 
see if they must be changed to prevent such documents from being 
leaked to the press in the future

375 miles south of new orleans the storm center was near latitude 
245 north and longitude 892 west 
forecaster jim gross said air currents high above florence were 
blowing the top off its thunderstorms keeping winds from 
intensifying to the 74 mph level that would classify the system as 
a hurricane 
right now its maintaining the status quo gross said he 
added that because of weak steering currents it was impossible to 
predict where the storm was headed 
were still looking at a threat but we dont know what 
direction it is going to take gross said 
he said it was not unusual for a storm to stall in the gulf for 
several days before moving toward land

the justice department sued los angeles 
county and its top officials thursday alleging that the countys 
1981 redistricting plan has denied hispanics equal voting rights 
the lawsuit filed in us district court seeks to invalidate 
the electoral boundaries set for the countys five elected 
supervisors and to devise a new plan that complies with federal 
law 
county board of supervisors chairman deane dana said the lawsuit 
was expected and added it is unfortunate that the justice 
department has elected to take its action so near to the 1990 
census 
supervisor mike antonovich agreed saying it makes more sense 
to wait 16 months for the next census than to use antiquated 
statistics from 1980 as the basis for reapportionment 
antonovich also denied that there has been any pattern of racial 
discrimination by the board of supervisors however leaders of 
local hispanic and civil rights groups welcomed the suit as long 
overdue 
i think it makes it utterly uncontestable that there can be a 
continuation of the white enclave that has governed los angeles 
county said mark rosenbaum an attorney with the american civil 
liberties union 
the 1981 districts were gerrymandered to dilute the power of 
latino communities to elect a leader of their own choosing said 
alan clayton a california representative for the league of united 
latin american citizens 
a discrimination case also was filed against the county last 
month by the aclu and the mexican american legal defense education 
fund which called the board of supervisors the most exclusive 
most powerful whitesonly club in the nation 
the justice departments suit most likely be consolidated with 
the suit filed by the aclu and maldef rosenbaum said 
the county which has an annual operating budget of about 89 
billion comprises an estimated 85 million residents with each 
supervisor representing between 16 million and 17 million people 
clayton said 
a similar justice department discrimination suit was filed 
aginst the city of los angeles in 1985 leading to a settlement 
that radically revised city council districts in the san fernando 
valley and in east los angeles 
the federal lawsuit charges that the countys electoral plan 
fragments the countys geographically cohesive hispanic community 
thus denying hispanics an equal opportunity to participate in the 
political process and to elect candidates of their choice to the 
county governing body 
named as defendants in addition to the county were the board 
of supervisors dana antonovich and supervisors peter f 
schabarum kenneth hahn edmund d edelman and registarrecorder 
charles weissburd 
schabarum did not immediately respond to a telephone call 
seeking comment and edelman declined to comment 
hahn said in a prepared statement i believe this could have 
been avoided if this past june 21st the board of supervisors had 
approved my motion to place a measure on the november ballot to 
expand the board to seven members 
the justice department suit alleges that in 1970 hispanics 
numbered 1289311 or 183 percent of the total population in 
1980 the suit says the countys hispanic population rose to 
2066103 or 276 percent of the total population of 7477503 
blacks comprised 124 percent or 926361 and asians and 
pacific islanders 58 percent 434850 of the 1980 population 
the suit says the hispanic population stretched from the city of 
los angeles on the west to the san gabriel valley on the east 
comprising about 73 percent of the more than 12 million people 
residing in the 230 contiguous census tracts and constituting what 
is called a community of interest 
the 1981 reapportionment plan adopted by the board of 
supervisors divided the concentration of hispanic voters into three 
districts with the result that hispanics did not constitute a 
votingage majority or plurality in any of the five singlemember 
districts 
clayton charged that the county also has systemically 
discriminated against hispanics in its employment policies he 
cited a recent study that found that hispanics make up about 183 
percent of the governments work force while county hiring goals 
call for a 276 percent representation 
the justice department complaint says that nonpartisan 
elections in los angeles county including those for the board of 
supervisors are characterized by patterns of racial and ethnic 
bloc voting

with a deafening roar and towering clouds 
of white smoke two nuclearmissile rocket motors were destroyed 
thursday the first us weapons eliminated under the arms 
reduction treaty with the soviet union 
vice president george bush and a 12member soviet inspection 
team were among hundreds of observers who watched the burnings at 
the longhorn army ammunition plant in northeast texas about 145 
miles east of dallas 
afterward the soviet team said it was satisified with the 
burnings 
this is the day we begin to reverse the arms race this was

the house voted 299111 thursday to amend an 
antidrug bill to permit federal death sentences for those 
convicted of murder committed during narcoticsrelated felonies 
the vote was a major defeat for death penalty foes who sought a 
mandatory life sentence for drug killers as an alternative 
the life sentence provision also passed 4101 but the 
prodeath penalty forces wouldnt stop there they rammed through 
the capital punishment amendment to give federal judges an 
additional option 
the capital punishment issue was the first major controversy 
addressed as the house considered legislation that would add some 
2 billion to the 39 billion the nation is now spending to combat 
illegal drugs

young men who go out at night with romance in 
their hearts and condoms in their wallets should find another 
storage place medical researchers say 
ozone a major component of smog and a product of lightning 
storms damages the latex in condoms and any practice threatening 
to tear condoms packaging and expose them to air should be 
avoided the researchers said 
its not something you should subject to putting in your back 
pocket or sitting on or in any way damaging said russell p 
sherwin a researcher at the university of southern california 
school of medicine in los angeles 
ozone is a lung irritant produced when industrial pollutants and 
nitrogen oxide react in the presence of sunlight it reaches high 
levels in us cities inhabited by a total of 75 million people

ara dinkjian leader of the group night ark 
talks about his music by first explaining what its not pop jazz 
folk or classical 
yet the lyrical and often haunting compositions of the band meld 
them all into a curiously attractive eclectic fusion of eastern 
and western styles 
you hear a very strong middle eastern armenian flavor with 
all of the other elements creeping in and out of the music of 
night ark says dinkjian 
most americans have a further history in europe or in asia 
thats a part of them what im doing is opening my eyes and my 
heart to everything that i am and have been he said 
dinkjian who lives in nutley nj has a diverse musical 
background at age 5 he performed at the new york worlds fair as 
part of an armenian ensemble and grew up listening to the beatles 
and jazz he studied western classical music in college 
in night ark dinkjian plays a variety of exotic middle eastern 
stringed instruments oud cumbus canoon saz and writes and 
arranges most of the fourpiece bands music 
keyboardist armen donelian and percussionist arto tuncboyaci 
share dinkjians armenian heritage while bassist ed schuller finds 
in night ark an opportunity to explore new sounds and technique 
while the band members decline to call their music jazz they 
perform mostly in jazz clubs and night arks two albums on the rca 
novus label are targeted primarily at jazz audiences those 
audiences dinkjian says are generally receptive to night arks 
often unconventional rhythms and melodies 
at its best night ark plays a distinctive and frequently 
compelling music reminiscent of the turkishinspired jazz played a 
number of years ago by flutist herbie mann 
but at its worst the band drifts into lazy renditions of 
timeworn pop standards producing a music that ends up sounding 
like some uninspired new age elevator music 
the major disappointment is in the squandering of talent and 
ideas on a lame version of carole kings youve got a friend 
says william kinnally reviewing night arks second album 
moments in jazziz magazine 
but performing recently at the jazz club fat tuesdays night 
ark relied on its original compositions to charm receptive 
listeners 
night ark the name is a reference to biblical noahs ark 
which legend has it came to rest on armenias mount ararat 
retains several middle eastern musical fundamentals to produce its 
sound 
between two adjacent notes on a piano theres an infinite 
amount of notes that are inaccessible to western instruments but 
can be played by eastern musicians dinkjian said 
sometimes when people hear an arabic song it sounds out of 
tune he said the reason why my music doesnt sound strange is 
that i have slipped in all of those funny notes but carefully added 
the harmony behind it weve kind of buffered it 
night ark also employs rhythms unusual in western music 
this is not a jazz fusion gimmick this is the beat i was 
brought up with dinkjian said 
the insistent percussion is not alienating the western 
audience but tries to bring them in and say welcome youre going 
to like this

yes after a while it does get to be tedious 
praising all these bill moyers programs on pbs informing the 
deprived tv populace that they are missing some of the best stuff 
on television by not switching that selector away from nbc or fox 
or hbo 
moyers constitution series was fascinating the joseph campbell 
interviews were inspired couldnt moyers just once produce some 
kind of lame drivel that could be lambasted for a change 
apparently not at least for now moyers embarks monday on a new 
series of interviews bill moyers world of ideas with an 
eclectic group of guests though judging from the first few shows 
they seem to have a common theme about ethics and societal 
responsibilities 
the series of nightly halfhour interviews continues for 10 
weeks if that seems like a lot figure its worth it to check in 
once in a while when youre likely to drop in on a conversation 
with anybody from sportswriter robert angell to pulitzer 
prizewinning playwright august wilson most of the interview 
subjects are authors some scientists and others philosophers 
in the first week moyers talks to british film producer david 
puttnam environmental scientist jessica tuchman mathews ethicist 
michael josephson and historian henry steele commager part 2 of 
the puttnam interview rounds out the week 
in mondays premiere puttnam producer of chariots of fire 
the killing fields and the mission discusses what he sees 
as the moral decay of the movie industry a degeneration of message 
to money puttnam knows whereof he speaks since he won an oscar and 
later became head of columbia pictures only to be bounced out for 
going against the system 
puttnam grew up in england moyers in texas both recall images 
from the silver screen that strongly affected their sense of the 
world it is this often profound effect on the formation of ideals 
puttnam argues for which the filmmaker must take responsibility 
instead he argues many moviemakers sneer at audiences while 
picking their pockets 
weve all got to look past this thing and say well where are 
we going to be in the year 2000 he says are we literally 
going to live in tiny enclaves with individual armed guards 
pouring rubbish over the fence in the form of television material 
films or even journalism at an undereducated and increasingly 
irresponsible society on the outside 
but i go to the movies to be entertained moyers counters 
not to be lectured do i really want david puttnam sitting there 
saying what kind of moral instruction can i give bill moyers when 
pays me seven dollars 
no you dont says puttnam you have every right not to 
want that but again i think theres an underlying poverty of 
ambition if you like ive never accepted that theres any 
dichotomy at all between entertaining you bill moyers and also 
dealing in an issue addressing you with an issue i dont think 
theres any dichotomy at all and i think its the job of the 
responsible filmmaker or of the good filmmaker forget 
responsible to deal in both 
puttnam admits he tripped in the moral mine field when he made 
midnight express to prove he wasnt just a maker of art 
films and could produce a commercial hit the movie was about a 
young american billy hays imprisoned in a hellish turkish jail 
for drug smuggling in the climactic scene hays bites off the 
tongue of one of his tormentors 
puttnam meant the scene as a horrific portrayal of how demented 
hays had become in the brutal prison world but puttnam was 
appalled when he sat in a movie house and heard the audience cheer 
the scene 
thats when i said to myself never again i dont ever want 
to sit and look at a film that ive had any responsibility at all 
for and be stunned and shattered by the reaction its getting from 
the audience he said 
in the second half of the interview puttnam expresses regret 
for turning down moonstruck when he was at columbia though he 
says the script he saw wasnt as good as the movie turned out to 
be he also says he didnt think chariots of fire deserved the 
oscar as best picture when it won in 1981 between it and the later 
runnerup in that category the killing fields puttnam says 
they did add up to one academy award 
moyers other guests in the next few weeks will include among 
many others american authors tom wolfe and el doctorow nigerian 
novelist chinua achebe author and scientist isaac asimov author 
and historian barbara tuchman mexican author carlos fuentes 
british historian paul johnson and philosopher john searle

the workers at goodyear tire amp 
rubber co plant have found out they can get along just fine 
without bosses 
for the past two years the plant has been run by 
selfdirected work groups made up of the 150 or so employees 
who make industrial and automotive rubber hoses 
it has been a successful experiment says plant manager robert 
becker one that is being used at other goodyear plants 
there was just dissatisfaction with the way things were 
done becker said this plant used to have traditional 
supervisors 
basically it was a parentchild relationship he said you 
know the old im the boss and you do what i say 
becker said that approach was not popular with employees 
several of whom were attending nearby iowa wesleyan college 
i think what really happened was as the education level and 
expectations of our employees grew the work place wasnt keeping 
up with their ability to function in that work place he said 
in 1984 the company decided to launch a supervisorless team 
made up of people that all had that cando a little bit of 
rebels the people that were really the free spirits said becker 
the experiment which stresses more employee involvement in the 
running of plant operations was considered so successful that 
three more work teams were formed over the next two years 
instead of having middlelevel management positions such as 
production managers and floor supervisors each work team chooses a 
coordinator who brings to becker the groups ideas and 
complaints 
the challenge we make to every person is dont ever put that 
coordinator in the position of being an old supervisor he said 
youre not fulfulling your responsibility as an employee if you 
put that guy in a supervisory mode 
the selfdirected work teams may appear to mirror the way some 
japanese companies run their operations but becker and officials 
at company headquarters in akron ohio said the idea is not the 
result of japanese philosophy 
as far as were concerned its an evolution of what needed 
to be done in an american factory becker said it had nothing 
to do with the japanese way of doing things 
becker who has been plant manager for about a year since moving 
from lincoln neb said production has increased more than 40 
percent since 1985 absenteeism and accidents also have declined 
during that time he said 
in goodyears headquarters bill fair director of public 
relations for the company and mike burns director of organization 
development said many of the companys 48 plants in north america 
are embracing the system in varying degrees 
we think we have a very successful system at mount pleasant 
its on the leading edge of all the systems said burns the 
mount pleasant plant overall is considered a good plant 
fair said employees at mount pleasant and at other midwest 
plants such as in hannibal mo have adopted an entrepreneurial 
attitude as a result of the work teams they view themselves as 
managing their own jobs he said 
becker said it goes beyond that however 
we operate on the principal of trust and mutual respect we 
trust that our employees will do what is expected of them what is 
right what is fair he said 
fairness is the principal said becker if you violate 
that trust we dont give second chances 
the system has made employees more than clock punchers working 
three shifts a day nearly seven days a week he said 
they really have a fierce sense of ownership of this plant 
he said they have a fierce sense of loyalty here in mount 
pleasant

time zones often wander out of assigned air space land on wrong 
runways and even fall asleep at the controls of planes carrying 
hundreds of passengers 
a review of sleep research and interviews with researchers and 
pilots by the associated press found the significance of fatigue 
long a problem in air travel has grown along with the deregulated 
airline industry 
government documents obtained by the ap describe some 600 
incidents over the last five years an average of two a week in 
which air crews blamed fatigue for potentially dangerous mistakes 
in navigation communications and piloting 
while never officially listed as a cause in any us commercial 
aviation accident fatigue has been linked to several incidents a 
still unreleased report by the canadian aviation safety board cites 
fatigue as a factor in the dec 12 1985 crash in gander 
newfoundland of a charter plane carrying 248 us servicemen and a 
crew of eight home for christmas from the middle east 
many people interviewed blame airline deregulation for the 
mounting reports of fatigue deregulation brought a competitive 
explosion in air travel and pilots contend their airlines try to 
lower costs by working them harder sometimes with schedules that 
keep them flying all night and into the next day 
these work hours say the pilots affect their concentration 
when youre fatigued you get distracted easily youll miss a 
radio call or enter the wrong data or read it wrong said dave 
linsley a united airlines captain and a pilots union spokesman 
from new jersey then you get into physical problems hitting the 
wrong switch overcontrolling the aircraft sometimes turning the 
wrong way or busting an altitude 
it comes down to both of you sitting at the controls and 
shaking your heads to stay on top of things 
linsley was among two dozen pilots interviewed by the ap many 
talked of falling asleep in the cockpit 
ive flown trips that werent safe because we were all so 
exhausted said a northwest airlines captain who asked not to be 
identified ive flown trips that leave at midnight with three 
legs takeoffs and landings and you arrive at noon feeling like a 
piece of dog meat 
pilots arent alone in their concern researchers such as nasa 
psychologist r curtis graeber believe pilots often fly beyond 
their endurance 
i am convinced that serious errors occur that are facilitated 
by fatigue sleep loss jet lag whatever you want to call it 
said graeber lead scientist at the aviation systems research 
branch of the nasaames research center at moffett field south of 
san francisco 
while us airlines have the worlds best safety record graeber 
and others worry that pilots schedules dont consider the 
grinding numbing effects that 15hour days abrupt shift changes 
or multiple time zone travel can have 
the pilots agree 
sometimes if youve flown several legs and had a rough day 
with bad weather you realize youre not seeing things youre 
supposed to see said an eastern captain who asked not to be 
identified ive flown at 2 in the morning when i realize ive 
fallen into a hypnotic state ive been on airplanes where i dont 
remember the last three legs from the night before 
fatigue contributed to at least two recent air accidents 
the newfoundland crash of the arrow air dc8 taking off for 
fort campbell ky the preliminary report as yet unreleased and 
subject to modification blames icing and crew fatigue noting the 
crew flew an exhausting schedule in the previous 12 days including 
short layovers multiple time zones and excessive flight hours 
the report cites a high potential for the development of 
chronic fatigue among the crew and says us flighttime 
limitations do not reflect recent advances in the understanding 
of the deleterious effects of fatigue 
the feb 19 1985 inflight upset of a china airlines 747 
flying from taipei to los angeles national transportation safety 
board investigators said that after a simple engine flameout the 
crew relied too long on autopilot to adjust the planes bearing 
when the captain finally took over the 220ton aircraft rolled 
over into a sixmile nosedive that approached the speed of sound 
before control was regained 9500 feet above the pacific the plane 
was extensively damaged and two people were seriously injured 
the ntsb noted that five days before the accident the captain 
had flown through five time zones on a return from saudi arabia and 
then had flown several flights between taiwan and japan while the 
report stopped short of blaming fatigue board member john lauber 
a sleep scientist believes it was a factor 
you go through that whole sequence and its strongly 
suggestive of a crew that werent plugged in and who probably 
werent plugged in because of sleepiness he said 
fatigue may have been involved in other accidents as well 
including the sept 25 1978 collision between a pacific southwest 
727 and a private plane and the oct 31 1979 crash of a western 
airlines dc10 in mexico city 
on the night before the psa accident which killed 146 people 
the crew had barely seven hours off duty and likely slept no more 
than 5 hours the next day the pilot was heard saying on the 
cockpit tape im draggin it was a short night 
the western crash occurred at 530 am when the dc10 having 
flown about three hours from los angeles landed on the wrong 
runway and hit a truck seventythree people died

both accidents were blamed on pilot error experts say hard 
evidence rarely exists to show pilots erred because they were tired 
the problem with fatigue is its not a bent piece of metal 
its not a liquid that can be analyzed in the laboratory said 
dr stanley mohler a former faa official who heads aerospace 
medicine at wright state university 
government and airline officials acknowledge theyve heard tales 
of pilots napping in flight and of mistakes attributed to 
sleepiness but they play down such reports 
there isnt evidence that there is a fatigue problem said 
walt coleman spokesman for the air transport association a trade 
group representing the major airlines 
t allan mcartor administrator of the federal aviation 
administration says more research is needed into the effects of 
long flights on the circadian system or biological clock but he 
denies a safety problem 
theres no evidence that shows it makes flying any more 
hazardous mcartor said 
some 600 accounts of missed approaches near misses and near 
tragedies blamed on fatigue show up in voluntary pilot reports 
filed with the air safety reporting system an office run by nasa 
for pilots who want to confess to mistakes and report risky 
conditions without fear of retribution 
enough reports were filed by crews for commuter airlines and air 
taxis that the asrs sent a memo to the faa in may identifying 
recurring pilot deviations directly attributable to fatigue and 
cockpit workload 
the big chunk that we have perceived out of this information 
is that fatigue is a real issue that needs to be addressed said 
bill reynard who runs the reporting system 
even though the reports are protected by anonymity and are not 
investigated by the asrs reynard believes they are truthful 
it is absolutely positively valid that these numbers are 
real he said our analysts have been in aviation for 20 to 30 
years they are very good at spotting a ringer 
the reports provide a litany of horror stories 
in february 1987 the copilot of a crosscountry jumbo jet 
already descending into boston looks up from his coffee cup to see 
the captain asleep at the controls 
i think we need to look at the world of the pilot and see what 
more hours and labor unrest is doing he writes 
the next month a large airliner from los angeles to baltimore 
sinks 4000 feet below its assigned altitude coming close enough 
to another plane to set off alarms at the air traffic control 
center 
i do not believe it would have occurred to a rested crew 
writes a crewmember noting he flew all night to cleveland then 
continued to baltimore into the morning sun duty regulations 
do not in any way address the debilitating effects of flying all 
night and especially of continuing to work into the morning hours 
last november the copilot of another large jet begins a 
takeoff roll from fort lauderdale without setting the flaps an 
error then already suspected in the northwest dc9 crash in detroit 
that had killed 154 people three months earlier 
cockpit warning horns sound and takeoff is aborted in the 
detroit crash the horns failed to sound 
it is quite sobering to consider that the combination of 
fatigue and distractions could so easily cause a breakdown in my 
own cockpit discipline writes the copilot who had flown for 
three days with little sleep 
complacency was not a factor he writes simple fatigue 
was the culprit 
that incident affords a good look at the shadowy effects of 
fatigue planes dont crash because pilots are tired say the 
experts fatigue becomes a killer only when something else 
equipment or the weather goes wrong as well 
if for example the fort lauderdale flights warning horns had 
failed as they did in detroit the tired pilots oversight could 
have been fatal in the detroit crash there was no evidence 
fatigue played a role 
on paper faa flight rules seem favorable to pilots domestic 
pilots are limited to eight hours flight time a day overseas 
pilots fly no more than 12 all pilots must get at least eight 
hours of rest between flight sequences 
however the regulations count only scheduled flight time not 
the hours spent on the ground between flights so scheduled 
turnarounds and unscheduled delays can push a crews day up to 16 
hours 
scheduling agreements between airlines and pilots once kept 
flight hours well below federal standards but concessions to 
management have become commonplace amid the fierce competition 
brought on by deregulation 
john mazor spokesman for the airline pilots association said 
that 10 years ago at the start of deregulation the typical 
contract limited flight time to a maximum of 75 to 80 hours per 
month today he says its 8085 hours 
continental pilots who lost their contract when the company 
reorganized in 1983 now fly 20 percent more hours a month the 
company says its flight hours are still well under the industry 
average 
our work rules remove the antiproductivity aspects to 
allow reasonable productivity said spokesman bruce hicks 
northwest pilots complain their company has interpreted 
regulations to allow international crews flying home to take on 
additional domestic flights adding up to four flight hours to 
their day northwest citing ongoing negotiations with the pilots 
declined to comment 
when united airlines acquired pan americans pacific routes in 
1986 its pilots faced extended flight hours and reduced crew size 
on the longer routes a separate contract added a day of work each 
month 
the pan am guys had a cushy job but the company fell on hard 
times said john ferg uniteds director of flight operations 
were trying to strike a balance between whats fair and 
equitable for the pilots and whats economical 
many pilots interviewed complain the scales are tipped too far 
toward economics at the expense of safety 
ive got 400 people in that airplane and i take it very 
seriously said a united 747 pilot its a responsibility and 
you know this isnt good for the passengers

concern shimmered in the words of the pilot who was writing 
after spending 30 of the last 48 hours on duty flying his commuter 
plane in and out of detroit 
i found myself continuously asking the first officer if i had 
performed certain duties or functions because i just couldnt 
remember he wrote you have an accident waiting to happen 
the pilots warning was among hundreds of reports detailing 
pilot fatigue received by a littleknown organization that monitors 
safety in the nations sky 
the air safety research system established by the federal 
aviation administration and run by nasa has collected 95000 
written reports over 12 years ranging from admissions of missed 
paperwork to confessions of near misses 
the montage of mistakes gripes and pointers has become an 
essential tipsters sheet to problems in the air traffic system 
the information comes voluntarily from pilots who are guaranteed 
anonymity and limited immunity for the mistakes they describe 
our basic function is to provide a place to which people in 
the aviation system can report in confidence without fear of 
reprisal said bill reynard the head of the program 
the faa began the system in 1975 but got little response because 
it offered only limited confidentiality 
since nasa assumed administration of the system the next year 
pilots who report errors have been promised limited immunity 
although that has been extended in less than 2 percent of the cases 
the system goes to great lengths to protect pilots anonymity 
the compiled reports mention no names or airlines even the time of 
day is blocked out the place month and year where the incident 
took place are listed along with the weight class of the aircraft 
involved 
yet the message comes through 
the pilot of a jumbo jet bound for tokyo from los angeles 
confesses to flying 1500 feet above his assigned altitude we 
were lucky there were no other aircraft in our area he wrote 
noting his crew had flown 23 hours in three days i have to 
attribute it to fatigue andor jet lag 
the pilot of a small jetliner reports he incorrectly decided to 
continue a botched approach to los angeles landing too fast nearly 
halfway down the runway my poor judgment was caused in major 
part by fatigue he wrote 
reynard believes the credibility of such reports its very 
very rare that somebody would make up something and then confess to 
it he said 
the reports go to the asrs office at mountain view calif for 
review by analysts with aviation backgrounds they often call the 
pilots for additional information 
if something needs immediate attention faa officials are 
informed special study groups look into chronic problems such as 
multiple reports of planes landing or taxiing on the wrong runways 
the database is also tapped by investigators at the national 
transportation safety board last year for example after a 
northwest airlines dc9 crashed at detroit metropolitan airport 
the ntsb requested a computer search for any reports mentioning 
that airport 
the safety system provided the associated press with all files 
detailing instances of pilot fatigue collected since 1983 about 2 
percent of all reports collected since then involve some mention of 
crew fatigue 
reynard said analysts watch for the possiblity of false reports 
filed in the often hostile environment of airline unionmanagement 
conflicts 
we know when were being campaigned by someone trying to make 
a point said reynard even if they tried our analysts are too 
experienced to let something fictitious get through

the crash of an jetliner in newfoundland three years ago that 
killed 256 us soldiers and crew members resulted in part from the 
exhaustion of the flight crew who ignored ice on the planes 
wings according to a preliminary canadian report 
a stillunreleased draft report by the canadian aviation safety 
board noted the crew had flown a grueling schedule in the two weeks 
before the accident had they finished the trip the captain would 
have been awake 24 hours 
i think these people were tired dr stanley mohler said in 
an interview with the associated press they had been on a series 
of flights prior to that which were fatiguing i just think they 
needed a good night of sleep 
mohler head of aerospace medicine at wright state university 
advised the canadian board on fatigue factors in the crash 
the plane an arrow air charter crashed dec 12 1985 while 
taking off from a refueling stop at gander international airport 
killing everyone aboard the plane was ferrying us troops from 
peacekeeping duties in the sinai peninsula to fort campbell in 
kentucky 
the preliminary report lists ice on the wings of the plane as 
the principal cause of the crash but it says that a tooslow 
takeoff speed and flightcrew fatigue were contributing factors 
spokesman james harris said the board hopes to release a final 
version of the report in early december 
it may bear no similarity to the draft report he said in 
fact it wont it will be quite different 
he said he did not know whether fatigue would still be listed as 
a contributing cause 
the draft report said that twice in the two weeks before the 
crash the crew had flown longer than allowed by us regulations 
according to federal rules no crew member may be on duty aloft for 
more than 12 hours in any 24hour period 
if the flight had made it to oakland calif its final planned 
stop the crew would have flown about 15 hours and been on duty for 
20 however because the plane would have carried no passengers on 
its final leg this trip would not have violated federal limits 
the board could not determine with certainty whether the pilot 
copilot or flight engineer were truly fatigued however it cited 
mohlers testimony that in the 12 days leading up to the 
accident the flight crew had been consistently exposed to work 
patterns and fatigueproducing factors which were highly conducive 
to the development of chronic fatigue 
these included short layovers night departures multiple 
timezone crossings and almost 57 hours in the air in the previous 
10 days 
in one 48hour period that month the crew flew for more than 22 
hours then were back in the cockpit seven hours later 
the report said that at gander the crew failed to notice ice on 
the wings which prevented the plane from gaining altitude after it 
lifted off and they set the wrong takeoff speed 
each of those would be consistent with tired pilots mohler 
said tired pilots do things like that they omit things they 
make mistakes

backstage at the worcester centrum a 
few hundred yards from the hastily constructed ring where in a few 
hours the moscow circus was to begin its first american tour in a 
decade slava zolkin leaned near a cage and kissed one of his 12 
dancing brown bears between the eyes 
immediately the other bears emitted jealous growls of protest 
until zolkin came by and stroked each one 
i love them a lot and they love me said zolkin 39 a 
former tightrope artist who began teaching bears to perform after 
he fell off the wire and broke his back in four places 
zolkin who wears a bear keychain around his waist and hands out 
bear pins to visitors said through an interpreter that he never 
uses force to train his bears to dance and juggle with their feet 
he chooses his bears as cubs and they live with him his wife and 
daughter in their threeroom apartment in the soviet union until 
they grow too big 
zolkins dedication to his bears is typical of the members of 
the moscow circus considered on a par with the finest theater 
opera and ballet in the soviet union 
its not your typical american circus its an art form 
said steven e leber the us producer of the moscow circus 
these people have dedicated their entire lives to it 
leber traveled to the soviet union to choose 11 of the best 
circus acts from the hundreds of performers associated with the 
staterun circus a revered institution in the country 
the first professional circus school was established in the late 
1920s students are trained for four years in different fields and 
also create their own acts once their act has been approved by the 
circus board students graduate to professional careers and are 
guaranteed 20 years employment plus a full pension upon retirement 
the moscow circus last performed in the united states in 1978 
and just began a 15city tour that will wind up at the cow palace 
in san francisco jan 1 
these are the superstars of the circus in the soviet union 
the real headliners said leber 
included in the circus are the bears sumatran tigers clowns 
jugglers aerialists trapeze artists and horsemen 
one of the most spectacular acts is called the flying 
cranes which consists of 10 aerial artists who combine a 
quadruple somersault and other daring acts with the choreography of 
a ballet as their movements tell their story of the soldiers who 
died in world war ii their souls becoming like those of cranes 
when i appear in the arena i immediately forget about 
everything else said lena golovko 24 who with her husband 
vilen is a star of the flying cranes 
our life is in the circus where we work but one cannot say 
that it is that it is just work it is our way of life because 
all of our thoughts are with our work 
the cranes had its premiere in 1985 and creator petro 
maestrenka said it will be performed until we are absolutely sure 
there will be peace 
another notable performer and trainer is tamerlan nugzarov who 
oversees the 12 horses and horsemen who perform breathtaking 
stunts nugzarov a short powerfullybuilt man with a fierce 
demeanor is from a circus family he comes from the caucasus 
mountain range in the soviet union where both men and the horses 
they ride are known to be fearless 
nugzarov and the other cossack riders need courage at times 
all 12 horses gallop at full speed in the ring sometimes the 
riders are on the top of the horses at other times they are 
beneath them sometimes they are beside them with their arms and 
torsos dragged on the ground both men and horses jumping through 
hoops surrounded by knives 
a lot of the tricks have a method to it said nugzarov 
speaking through an interpreter a few hours before the show 
there is this myth and legend to everything we do 
the act is dangerous but nugzarov said there have been few 
injuries 
they have not been major he said after all the hardest 
injuries are those to the soul 
equally daunting to watch is nikolai pavlenko as he steps into 
the cage with his 17 wild sumatran tigers and coaxes them into 
performing without ever using a whip 
my attitude about my work is dictated by my attitude toward 
them he said animals should be allowed to show their 
character they should not be oppressed nor made to think like we 
think

this summers searing heat and drought marked 
in cruel fashion the 125th anniversary of the agriculture 
departments first crop report on july 10 1863 
at the time the civil war was in full swing with only a few 
days elapsed since the north and south bled each other on the 
fields of gettysburg and the usda itself was a fledgling 
department created by president abraham lincoln just the year 
before 
duane l jewell secretary of the departments agricultural 
statistics board the latest successor to the longago bureaucracy 
that issued the first report said the war put a damper on the 
collection of crop and livestock information 
even so he said in an interview the first report was nine 
pages and included a lengthy explanation of the need for such 
material and the meaning of the tables 
we had the report reprinted this year and as far as i can 
tell its in the same format that was used then jewell said 
some of the information may be a little hard to understand by 
todays standards 
for example the original report did not include production 
figures for any crop the boards report issued on aug 11 1988 
showed the corn crop at 448 billion bushels down 37 percent from 
the 1987 harvest soybeans which were not reported in 1863 were 
estimated at 147 billion bushels down 23 percent from last year 
under the 1863 plan monthly circulars were sent to about 
2000 farmer correspondents who voluntarily supplied usda with the 
requested information it was decided that the government should 
pay for the return postage 
in the subjoined tables it will be seen that the questions 
relate to but two matters the amount sown in 1863 compared with 
that in 1862 and the appearance of the crop in may and june the 
report said 
replies from some of the states were not as numerous as desired 
the report said but the answers from the great grainproducing 
states of ohio indiana illinois michigan wisconsin and iowa 
were full and satisfactory 
the report added it is due too that the promptness of the 
new and distant states of minnesota and kansas should be kindly 
acknowledged and their example commended to states much nearer to 
the capital 
among the specific items the 1863 report noted that the winter 
wheat crop in nebraska territory was destroyed by the winter and 
in new hampshire much injured from the same cause otherwise the 
winter wheat crop looked pretty good in the 20 states plus 
nebraska that were surveyed 
in 1863 there was also a familiar ring for todays corn farmers 
this our national crop is reported as generally small in 
size on account of the drought of the latter part of may and the 
first half of june in some states and nearly the whole of it in 
others 
although the civil war caused little note in the 1863 crop 
report except by the absence of information from the confederacy 
a portion devoted to wool took the secession into account 
the us sheep flock by the census of 1860 totaled more than 
248 million head compared with 108 million head on jan 1 1988 
and wool production more than 605 million pounds 
the rebel states produced 5717587 sheep of the whole 
number which must be deducted from it as they are not now 
represented in the wool market the report said kentucky and 
missouri raised in 1862 2039601 sheep and the ravages of war 
have destroyed largely these 
after some refiguring and allowing for projected annual 
increases the report concluded that the north may have had a sheep 
flock of more than 26 million head and a wool clip of 794 million 
pounds in 1863 
today the whole realm of crop and livestock statistics is 
handled by the departments national agricultural statistics 
service or nass headed by administrator charles e caudill 
the agency issues more than 300 national reports and 9000 state 
reports each year covering more than 150 crop and livestock items 
and in times of emergency as with this years drought extra 
efforts are made 
normally reponses from about 30000 farmers provide much of the 
information for the monthly crop reports field surveys and other 
information are collected by the agencys 44 field offices the 
information is sent to washington for review by specialists who 
then release final estimates through the agricultural statistics 
board under strict security conditions 
in preparation for the vital aug 10 report caudill said a 
special additional survey was conducted among 16000 farmers in 28 
states to help assess the drought damage 
also he said about 1000 corn and soybean fields are inspected 
to help determine acreage and yield estimates this year the 
sample was doubled 
but agency officials say one thing hasnt changed from 1863 to 
protect farmers and consumers from speculators 
as the 125yearold report put it ignorance of the state of 
our crops invariably leads to speculation in which oftentimes the 
farmer does not obtain just prices and by which the consumer is 
not benefited

it doesnt seem quite right to use the word huge 
when talking about a minivan but thats the impression the 1988 
plymouth voyager le conveys 
it also is comfortable easy to drive and versatile 
want to take that antique table with two leaves and four 
chairs off aunt ruths hands pull out the two back seats of the 
van and tuck the dining set inside for the trip home no problem 
and the furniture wont get wet or dirty as it would in the 
back of a pickup during inclement weather have five young 
ballplayers to take to the park put the rear seats back in and 
theres room for equipment and another adult and no one is 
cramped 
its no wonder chrysler corp has sold more than 1 million of 
these littlebig gems since the automaker pioneered the minivan 
concept in the 1984 model year 
today bigger automakers such as toyota ford and general motors 
have joined the market but chrysler retains the sales lead 
toyotas van is sold in smaller quantities and has a higher base 
price for the cheapest passenger model about 13200 vs about 
11000 for a chrysler 
the ford and gm downsized vans are reardrive and a bit larger 
than chryslers one auto analyst has called the minivan the 
product success of this decade and some analysts predict annual 
industry sales of 1 million in the next decade 
chryslers idea for the minivan was to provide a fuelthrifty 
way to cart around passengers and cargo comfortably in a roomy 
vehicle that would drive like a car and fit in a garage like a car 
chrysler has stayed true to that concept as the test plymouth 
voyager le bore out it was easy to drive and felt like a car even 
during difficult parallel parking maneuvers 
driving in some other especially fullsize vans can give a 
distinct buslike feel as you turn the steering wheel and maneuver 
getting in and out of the voyager was uncomplicated compared with 
some other vans where you have to climb up to enter and take a 
flying leap to exit 
but like other vans and unlike a car the voyager 644 inches 
tall offered a good view of the road ahead i appreciated being 
able to spot potential slowdowns in traffic and parking spots in 
shopping center aisles 
chrysler spokesman tom jakobowski noted company research shows 
the low step height and low loading height are among the main 
reasons for the minivans popularity 
women like that he said adding that 37 percent of buyers are 
female buyers median age is 39 with median annual income of 
45000 he said fiftysix percent are college graduates and as 
many as 45 percent have professionaltechnicalmanagerial jobs 
the voyager test vehicle had superb fit and finish inside and 
out the side door slid open easily for passenger exit 
the rear seats were arranged so two people could sit comfortably 
in the middle seat and three adults could fit in the seat behind 
them both seats could be removed with a bit of effort after 
detaching locks that held the seats to hooks in the floor 
be sure to check that the locks hold when replacing the seats 
or whoa you might flip backwards bucket seats were in the front 
with space between them so a person could climb into the back 
without going outside 
but the vans roofline is low so adults do have to hunch over 
when moving about inside there was some room behind the rear seat 
for cargo storage enough to stand up several grocery bags 
if more room is needed theres a lever to pull so the the rear 
seat advances on a track the seat back also can be folded down in 
the 1987 model year chrysler also introduced a longer minivan the 
grand voyager which is 14 inches longer than the regular voyager 
and offers more cargo space behind the rear seat 
both the regular and elongated vans have a lifting rear door so 
you dont have to hoist items up and over the vehicle body i also 
appreciated the rear window being all one piece in some other 
vans such as the chevrolet astro there is a pillar in the center 
which reduces rear viewing 
also changed from the earliest chrysler minivan models are the 
engine options the base engine for a voyager has gone from a 
22liter fourcylinder powerplant to a 25liter fourcylinder 
also offered is an optional 3liter v6 which boosts 
performance but decreases fuel economy the test model had the v6 
paired with a threespeed automatic transmission the v6 certainly 
is an improvement over the standard fourcylinder but i had to put 
in 153 gallons of gasoline after 263 combined cityhighway miles 
that worked out to around 1718 miles per gallon 
there were nice touches throughout because the engine and 
components take up much of the small hood and underthedash space 
chrysler tucked the drawerike locking glovebox under the 
passengerside bucket seat 
there was a center console on the ceiling that included map 
lights for driver and frontseat passenger sunglasses storage and 
a spot for garage door transmitter in the rear there were two 
compartments for storing small items and spots to rest two cups 
outdoor enthusiasts who tow boats campers etc will note that

on one side of the chain link fence children play 
kickball on the broken pavement flanked by the yellow brick 
buildings that have been called the worst public housing project in 
the nation 
on the other side protected by armed security guards rises a 
social experiment with roots both utopian and capitalist where 
poor residents and affluent young professionals will live in luxury 
apartments and share a swimming pool tennis courts a health club 
and a daycare center 
the scene is the columbia point housing project on bostons 
dorchester bay a 51acre site that marks the first attempt to 
convert a federal housing complex into private forprofit housing 
the transformation is not occurring without pain or upheaval 
however 
tenants of columbia point charge the private developer with 
harassment unfair evictions and reduction in some services the 
developer says the opportunity for decent housing depends on 
enforcing rules 
to some housing experts the rebirth of the complex as a 
landscaped development called harbor point is viewed as a test 
case that if successful could be applied to a generation of 
failed projects 
there are thousands upon thousands of units in partially 
occupied public housing across the country that something has to be 
done with said michael a stegman chairman of the department of 
city and regional planning at the university of north carolina 
the conversion at columbia point will result in far fewer 
lowincome apartments than in the original project but the payoff 
he said is restoring a community to livability 
columbia point rose out of an isolated city dump in 1953 in 
time violence and drug dealing scarred the complex squatters 
occupied many vacant apartments and terrorized longtime residents 
it was in a complete shambles said robert b whittlesey 
courtappointed overseer at columbia point in the 1970s he and 
stegman said that by that time the project was notorious across 
the country 
by 1984 the original population of 1504 families was down to 
350 
that year the boston housing authority leased the property to 
the development firm corcoran jennison co for 99 years for 1 for 
those 99 years 400 of the 1283 apartments at harbor point must be 
reserved for lowincome tenants who will pay no more than 30 
percent of their gross household income in rent the difference 
between that and market rent will be subsidized by the federal 
government 
corcoran produced a plan to create a complex of 20 multifamily 
buildings 10 rehabilitated columbia point structures 10 new ones 
and 214 new townhouses seventeen columbia point buildings were 
demolished 
there are 1283 units 400 subsidized and 883 marketrate most 
of the apartments reserved for lowincome residents will go to 
columbia point tenants who are mainly black or hispanic 
harbor point enjoyed the backing of political leaders ranging 
from gov michael dukakis to president reagan and received hefty 
state construction loans and federal tax breaks corcoran hopes to 
net 77 million per year in profit 
to succeed the firm says it has to play hardball with drug 
dealers squatters teenagers who get into fights and anyone else 
at columbia point who might make life difficult at harbor point 
but many of the 320 families from the project who will make the 
move to harbor point say corcoran is playing too hard they have 
staged protests and even gone to court over what they call 
heavyhanded tactics and aggressive security guards 
tenants accuse corcoran of trying to push out poor black 
families to replace them with poor whites and increase the 
marketability of the apartments an evicted tenant is subject to 
arrest if he or she returns even for a visit 
this place was not geared for the black people in columbia 
point said rose jolly occupant of a tiny apartment in the 
complex for 16 years its not going to work the way they say 
its going to work 
jollys daughter was among several tenants evicted from columbia 
point under the new management security guards falsely accused her 
of dealing drugs mrs jolly said acknowledging only that her 
daughter was a drug user 
my own daughter she cant even come and visit her children 
theyll pick her up for trespassing mrs jolly said 
she is among several tenants who say they have been offered 
1000 to 4000 by harbor point management to relocate and give up 
their guaranteed harbor point housing the money is from a federal 
relocation fund 
nadine wiley corcorans marketing manager denied anyone is 
being pressured or bribed into leaving columbia point and she 
insisted the developer wants a racially and economically mixed 
complex 
this summer the first marketrate tenants began moving into 
harbor point drawn by advertisements emphasizing its views of 
downtown boston and touting its luxury amenities marketrate rents 
are 675 and 1200 per month 
will harbor point succeed in mingling bostons poorest minority 
residents with welloff mostly white tenants 
where this thing will rise and fall is on the human side 
said stegman 
he is optimistic because of the developments choice location 
and because corcoran really cares about the true nature of the 
partnership between columbia point residents and marketrate 
tenants 
its not just a case of throwing them all in and hoping it 
works said joseph corcoran sr chief executive officer of 
corcoran jennison co who noted a tenants task force helps make 
decisions 
task force executive director roger taylor who lived in 
columbia point for 20 years acknowledged that some security guards 
use their authority forcefully 
but the guards work in a place where for years there have been 
no rules he said in answer to charges that the guards most of 
whom are white have uttered racial slurs at tenants taylor who 
is black said teenagers in the project routinely harass the 
guards 
the stated goal of harbor point is to mix its varied tenants 
together but the developer acknowledged some isolation will occur 
thats because families with children are not allowed for safety 
reasons to live in the five to sevenstory midrise buildings 
that will have 903 apartments 
in the midrises corcoran said marketrate tenants will 
outnumber lowincome tenants about 4to1 because most of the 
lowincome tenants are families with children 
besides the midrises most of which are new and the 214 
townhouses there will be 166 garden flats in lowrise 
rehabilitated columbia point buildings 
despite the problems ms wiley said of harbor point people 
are looking at us as a model were under a microscope we feel 
confident that we have the experience 
but mary ann martorana of the massachusetts tenants organization 
said the columbia point tenants were merely used to get the land 
to get the loans and that corcoran is not interested in public 
housing but profit 
if anyone else around the country wants to use this as a 
model martorana said they should have their head examined

a key figure in what federal prosecutors call 
wall streets secondbiggest insider trading scandal ever has 
pleaded guilty to criminal charges amid indications that others may 
be charged 
stephen suikuan wang jr a 24yearold former junior analyst 
with the venerable firm morgan stanley amp co pleaded guilty 
wednesday in us district court in manhattan to the first criminal 
charges leveled in the case 
wang who was free on a 250000 personal recognizance bond 
also agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge in connection with 
a separate previously undisclosed insider trading scheme he 
allegedly undertook when he first began working for morgan stanley 
in june 1986 
us attorney rudolph w giuliani who outlined the charges at a 
news conference said wang was cooperating with the government and 
that the investigation was continuing an indication that others 
may be charged 
us district judge kevin duffy set sentencing for oct 19 wang 
faces a maximum punishment of 15 years in prison and 750000 in 
fines for the three fraud counts against him 
the charges were the first criminal counts made in the scandal 
first dicslosed in late june in a civil complaint by the securities 
and exchange commission 
prosecutors charged wang with using his position at morgan 
stanley to steal marketsensitive information about pending 
takeovers and other confidential matters in which the firm played a 
role 
the government alleged wang peddled the information starting in 
june 1987 to a taiwanese businessman fred c lee who allegedly 
used it to make at least 19 million in profitable stock trades in 
more than 14 companies and shared about 200000 with wang 
lee was named as an unindicted coconspirator but giuliani 
declined to explain why lee was not charged federal officials said 
lee also known by his chinese name chwan hong lee was in taiwan 
the sec has frozen the usbased assets of both men and 
requested return of the 19 million plus triple penalties for a 
total of 76 million 
that amount makes the case the secondbiggest insider trading 
scheme next to the record 100 million in illicit profits and 
penalties surrendered by nowimprisoned wall street speculator ivan 
boesky nearly two years ago 
the wang case is considered significant not only because of the 
amount of money involved but because the alleged abuses came at 
the height of a public uproar over wall street greed and corruption 
highlighted by the boesky scandal it suggested that insider 
trading remains a deeprooted problem 
giuliani said morgan stanley cooperated in the governments 
investigation and faces no criminal liability but also indicated 
the firm should have done more to detect wangs activities which 
the former analyst allegedly undertook during much of his 
internship 
morgan stanley spokesman peter roche did not return telephone 
calls for comment on wednesday the firm fired wang after the 
scandal first was disclosed and has stated it believed adequate 
precautions were taken 
lees lawyer james morton at the pittsburgh firm buchanan 
ingersoll pc said in a telephone interview that the criminal 
charges against wang were news to him he declined to comment on 
any aspect of the case or his client 
giuliani said the separate previously undisclosed insider 
trading scheme involving wang included an unidentified person 
living in the chicago area where wang grew up giuliani said the 
person was not a wang relative or engaged in the financial 
business but declined to elaborate 
in that scheme giuliani said wang fed marketsensitive tips 
about developments in at least five companies to the other 
individual who used the information to make profitable trades and 
rewarded wang with about 4000 
wang who attended the university of illinois at 
champaignurbana won a coveted internship at morgan stanley before 
he graduated and was only days short of completing it when the sec 
brought its civil complaint

the principal defendants in the federal 
governments longawaited massive insider trading suit against 
drexel burnham lambert inc and the head of its pioneering junk 
bond business say they welcome the fight as a chance for 
vindication 
ending months of speculation on wall street the securities and 
exchange commission filed a 184page civil complaint wednesday in 
us district court accusing drexel and michael milken of engaging 
in a secret arrangement with convicted speculator ivan boesky that 
included illegal insider trading stock manipulation and fraud 
drexels chief executive officer frederick h joseph 
reiterated the firms longstanding claims that it would be absolved 
of the charges milken also again denied any wrongdoing 
wednesdays lawsuit capped months of guessing about whether the 
government had built an extensive case against drexel on evidence 
turned up by the nearly twoyearold boesky insider trading scandal 
sec charges against drexel with whom boesky worked extensively 
widely had been expected since his illegal dealings were revealed 
in november 1986 
for the past 22 months i have been the subject of a shadow 
trial of systematic leaks and innuendo based upon false 
accusations milken said in a prepared statement no one 
likes to be sued but i welcome the opportunity to have at long 
last a full and open hearing of the allegations in an unbiased 
forum 
joseph who in july told drexel employees to expect charges 
against the firm issued a statement saying we disagree with the 
charges filed by the sec and in due course we expect to be 
vindicated 
the sec said it would seek to have the defendants three 
companies and six individuals surrender profits made from illegal 
stock trades the lawsuit also sought from drexel milken and cary 
j maultasch another drexel employee civil penalties of three 
times those profits 
the agency offered no specific amount but sen william 
proxmire chairman of the senate banking committee said the sec 
was seeking 100 million 
boesky who is serving a threeyear federal prison term on an 
insidertrading related charge was forced to surrender a record 
100 million in penalties and illegal trading profits 
drexel and milken allegedly had an arrangement with boesky 
involving at least 16 series of illegal securities transactions 
under that agreement the sec claimed boeskycontrolled 
companies secretly bought sold or held securities for drexel or 
individual defendants while drexel sometimes reciprocated with 
secret transactions for boesky 
the sec also alleged that drexel and boesky employees kept 
secret offthebooks records as part of the arrangement 
and the sec claimed drexel and milken traded in securities using 
confidential information misappropriated from drexels own clients 
in 1985 drexel allegedly made 123 million in profits using 
inside information on a pending merger between lorimar and 
telepictures and allegedly avoided 178 million in losses the 
following year after learning privileged information from viacom

others with access to confidential corporate information from using 
it to trade in securities 
us attorney rudolph giuliani whose office prosecuted boesky

the securities and exchange commissions mammoth 
civil suit against drexel burnham lambert inc marks a major 
turning point in a federal crusade against wall street corruption 
and could devastate the scrappy investment firm that pioneered 
junkbond takeover financing 
but the secs move against drexel also presents great risks to 
the governments case by providing the firm with its first big 
opportunity to acquit itself of wrongdoing after months of damaging 
press leaks and innuendo criminal lawyers say 
the move also may reflect tension between the manhattan us 
attorneys office and sec investigators who have been assembling a 
dossier on drexel for months and were eager to proceed with it 
they reportedly had been deferring action until federal 
prosecutors completed a parallel probe of drexel a precursor to 
possible felony charges but there have been signs that the 
criminal investigation is facing delays 
lawyers familiar with the procedure in such cases said it was 
highly unusual that the sec took action before the us attorneys 
office because drexel now has the opportunity to seek wideranging 
access to the governments evidence and crossexamine witnesses 
under civil pretrial discovery rules 
had drexel faced criminal charges first its access to the 
governments evidence and prospective witnesses would be sharply 
restricted and could cripple an effective defense 
if i were one of the defendants in this civil case id 
scramble like mad to start taking discovery said michael 
feldberg a new york defense attorney and former federal 
prosecutor if youre a defendant in a criminal case the thing 
you have the least of is information 
the secs 184page civil complaint filed wednesday against 
drexel and other defendants notably michael milken head of its 
controversial highyield bond business alleges a variety of 
systematic fraudulent activity conducted largely in concert with 
nowimprisoned speculator ivan f boesky the accusations range 
from insider trading to falsifying record books 
the sec didnt quantify drexels allegedly illicit profits but 
the deals mentioned in its complaint involve some of the biggest 
corporate takeovers of the 1980s in which drexel played a 
prominent financing role through its innovative use of highrisk 
highyield securities commonly called junk bonds 
if the sec can prove drexel made tens of millions of dollars in 
illegal profits on those and other transactions then the firms 
potential exposure is enormous the sec is seeking return of that 
money plus triple the amount in damages 
moreover the sec can seek court orders kicking drexel milken 
or other defendants out of the securities business a potentially 
ruinous prospect for one of wall streets most successful firms 
one of the sec complaints most intriguing elements is that it 
describes a relationship in which boesky once thought to be a 
masterful independent wall street financier is little more than a 
corrupt agent for drexel 
if true this suggests the governments crackdown on securities 
fraud is focusing more on outwardly legitimate investment banking 
activities by big wall street firms and less on errant individuals 
this is the final phase of what many people have been talking 
about for the last couple of years democratic rep edward 
markey author of a proposed law to tighten penalties for insider 
trading and other securities fraud said after the sec action was 
announced boesky looked like the middleman 
nevertheless the government faces a daunting task in proving 
the accusations against drexel which persistently has said it 
would fight to vindicate itself in court and has undertaken a 
massive public relations campaign in anticipation of a crisis 
the biggest potential weakness in the governments case is 
boesky who judging from the sec complaint would be a star witness 
as a convicted felon boeskys credibility could be shattered by 
drexels lawyers 
the question is whether the trail of transactions is 
sufficient for the government to believe it has enough to 
corroborate boesky said gerald walpin a former federal 
prosecutor now at the new york firm of rosenman amp colin im 
certain both sides have attempted that analysis

michael milken who faces insider 
trading charges is seen as the wall street whiz kid who made 
junkbond financing into the tool of choice for corporate 
raiders 
in so doing milken 42 transformed drexel burnham lambert inc 
from a minor player on wall street into a powerhouse and in the 
process made himself feared respected and enormously wealthy 
the 184page civil complaint filed in us district court in new 
york against milken drexel and others on wednesday followed months 
of speculation about drexels involvement in the ivan boesky 
insider trading scandal 
although the move by the securities and exchange commission had 
been anticipated milken and others who have made fortunes in junk 
bonds continued to hold their annual beverly hills spring gathering 
known as the predators ball the message was clear never mind the 
burgeoning government investigation of insider trading it was 
business as usual at drexel and milken was still king of the junk 
bonds highrisk highyield notes used to finance corporate 
takeovers 
milken had refused to comment publicly on the scandal up until 
wednesday when he issued a written statement asserting that for 
the past 22 months i have been the subject of a shadow trial of 
systematic leaks and innuendo based on false accusations 
in anticipation of a crisis drexel undertook a publicrelations 
campaign starting last year to polish its image stressing the role 
of junk bonds in helping small companies and downplaying their role 
in large takeover battles 
the normally secretive and unreachable milken himself played a 
major role in that blitz accepting speaking engagements he 
granted selective media interviews on condition there would be no 
questions about the securities and exchange commission and the 
investigation 
the speeches and interviews focused almost solely on milkens 
latest pet plan to alleviate the latin american debt crisis by 
swapping debt for equity or selling securities backed by those 
countries oil and silver resources 
in the years before the insider trading scandal the financial 
media wrote glowingly of milken 
a oneman revolution forbes magazine headlined one typical 
article 
a worldclass financial wizard on a plane with the likes of 
bernard baruch and jay gould mozart of the money markets 
wrote california business magazine 
it had been a relatively short road for milken from head 
cheerleader at birmingham high school in the san fernando valley in 
1964 actress sally field and superagent michael ovitz were among 
his classmates to the top of the nations financial industry 
milken reportedly pulls down 40 million a year as the head of 
drexels junkbond operation and his personal fortune has been 
estimated at more than 500 million 
he lives with his children and wife lori his high school 
sweetheart whom he married at age 22 in a house on the former 
estate of the late actor clark gable in suburban encino an 
uppermiddleclass section of the san fernando valley two miles 
from his childhood home 
milkens fascination with finance stetches back to his boyhood 
at age 10 while other boys were giggling over comic books 
michael robert milken was enamored of money a favorite pastime was 
hovering over tax returns being prepared by his father an 
accountant 
after studying business at the university of california 
berkeley and the university of pennsylvanias wharton school 
milken went to work for drexel firestone amp co in philadelphia as a 
junior bond trader 
drexel merged with burnham amp co in 1973 and lambert brussels 
witter in 1976 to become todays drexel burnham lambert and 
milkens job was moved to new york 
milken worked hard to make a name for himself but never got used 
to the east as the story goes he wearied of the cold eastern 
winters that froze his water pipes and kept his two children from 
playing outside he also tired of the long commutes from his home 
in suburban philadelphia to wall street 
in 1977 he pulled off a coup by convincing drexel to let him 
move the companys junkbond operations from wall street to beverly 
hills just off swank rodeo drive 
his reasoning was simple he didnt have to be sitting in a tiny 
office in manhattan to make deals he just had to know the players 
and have their confidence 
milken was enormously successful in that regard almost 
singlehandedly building a closeknit network of junkbond 
investors milken no longer has to go on the road to make deals 
the corporate players come to him 
milken still works hard 12 to 13 hours a day seven days a 
week he once said he had no hobbies because what i do is fun 
milkens appearance generally is described as ordinary he buys 
his suits off the rack and it was only a couple years ago that he 
traded in his unstylish american car for a mercedes

the proposed 25 billion merger of lucky 
stores inc and american stores co has been blocked temporarily by 
a federal judge as californias attorney general fought the plan he 
said would bring higher food prices to the state 
us district judge david kenyon who issued a temporary 
restraining order wednesday said he believed the acquisition of 
lucky supermarkets by american stores parent of the alpha betas 
supermarket chain threatens serious irreversible harm to 
californians 
kenyon scheduled a hearing sept 16 on whether to grant a 
preliminary injunction sought by california attorney general john 
van de kamp 
van de kamp who sued to prevent the merger says that 
transaction coupled with the recent acquisition of oaklandbased 
safeway stores by el montebased vons spells higher prices for 
consumers 
he said a survey he commissioned indicated the two mergers would 
increase food prices by 400 million a year in california 
american has said the merger of lucky with alpha beta would 
lower consumer food prices by 50 million annuallyu 
john lillie chairman of lucky stores inc in a statement said 
judge kenyons ruling was simply designed to maintain the status 
quo until a hearing on the merits of the case can be heard we are 
confident that the court will not want to delay the combination of 
alpha beta and lucky stores once we have the chance to lay out the 
facts before him 
the federal trade commission has tentatively approved the 
luckyalpha beta merger although it would require american to sell 
37 markets to competing chains to maintain competition 
nevertheless van de kamp wants a trial to decide whether the 
marriage of two supermarket giants is anticompetitive 
the proposed acquisition threatens serious irreversible harm 
to the public interest within california which outweighs any harm 
to defendants if the mergers are temporarily restrained kenyon 
said in imposing the temporary restraining order 
the judge forbade american stores from launching a joint 
operation with lucky stores until the matter is resolved in court 
the combination would give the alpha betalucky chain 550 stores 
van de kamp who has threatened similar court action in the 
vonssafeway merger said talks are progressing on reaching an 
outofcourt settlement of that dispute he praised kenyons 
decision on the luckyalpha beta proposal 
american stores did not immediately react to the developments a 
lucky spokeswoman referred calls to american 
in his ruling kenyon ordered american to refrain from selling 
transferring or closing any retail grocery stores in the areas 
where both american and lucky presently compete the judge said 
american must continue the operations of alpha beta independently 
of lucky stores and must refrain from supplying either with the 
assets of the other or exchanging confidential business information 
the restraining order barred american and lucky from entering 
into contracts which might hinder any future divestiture of the 
lucky assets 
kenyon also prohibited any change in the management team of 
lucky or of the american stores california operation 
americans attorney frank rothman had told the judge that the 
lucky management team was poised to take control of the joint 
operation 
in the earlier completed merger vons acquired 172 safeway 
stores which are in the process of being converted to vons 
operations vons will have 350 stores 
american which recently moved its headquarters from salt lake 
city to irvine calif is one of the nations largest supermarket 
companies its holdings include acme markets on the east coast 
skaggs alpha beta and alpha beta and buttery in the west and the 
27state osco drug chain

biotechnology companies product sales rose 25 
percent last year but threequarters of the companies lost money 
according to a survey by arthur young amp co 
fiftyeight percent of the companies had lower profits this year 
than last year apparently because they were spending heavily for 
the future while 74 percent lost money according to the survey 
released wednesday by the accounting and consulting firm 
the companies research and development spending rose 32 
percent outpacing revenue growth the survey said 
biotechnology companies are having a hard time raising money 
through stock offerings especially since the stock market crash 
and therefore are spending the cash accumulated through past 
financings in hopes of getting products to market and earning the 
respect of investors the firm stated 
they expect and need to impress wall street again the 
firm said the strategy is obviously risky 
arthur young concluded that the biotechnology industry is 
beginning to fulfill its promise although the road remains rough 
in some sectors 
the general public was thinking in terms of writing the 
obituary to this industry said g steven burrill chairman of 
arthur youngs high technology group 
a survey that drew responses from executives at 291 companies 
found that on average they expected 32 percent of the companies to 
be acquired within five years and 46 percent to be acquired within 
10 years 
the executives estimate may be too high burrill said he said 
the biotech companies close linkages with larger companies would 
limit their attractiveness to other big companies that might want 
to acquire them

if he cant teach them capitalism at least 
hell give them heartburn 
the man who brought american pizza to the soviets via a roving 
concession truck in moscow now says he is working to establish the 
soviet unions first fullfledged pizza parlor 
louis piancone sr president of roma food enterprises inc of 
piscataway said wednesday he plans to meet next week with soviet 
officials in moscow and inspect several potential sites for a pizza 
restaurant in the capital and two other cities 
we are going to be looking at several locations in moscow 
riga and tula said piancone 
piancone and his partner ukranianborn entrepreneur shelley m 
zeiger of moorestown entered a joint venture with soviet officials 
last year to bring the companys astro pizza mobile concession 
truck to moscow the truck began selling slices of the american 
fast food to tourists and soviet customers in april 
our sales so far have been extremely lucrative he said 
this is just the next logical step 
to date the truck has been using ingredients purchased in europe 
and the united states because soviet tomatoes cheese and other 
products were not readily available 
piancone said his trip will include a meeting with soviet 
agriculture ministry officials to discuss the feasibility of using 
products grown locally 
the mobile pizza parlor made a splash in moscow when it began 
operating on a snowy day in april selling more than 1200 slices 
of the cheeseandtomato pie in just three hours 
since opening piancone said the truck has operated three days a 
week for tourists accepting only western currency and three days 
a week for local customers selling slices for 125 rubles roughly 
just more than 2 a slice the truck does not make rounds on the 
seventh day 
piancone said it was always his intention and the intention of 
his soviet partners who by law own 51 percent of the enterprise 
to open permanent restaurants around the country 
he said the company is concerned that competitors may take the 
initiative away if astro pizza ltd doesnt move quickly 
pepsico inc and pizza hut restaurants earlier this year 
announced their intention to open two restaurants in moscow 
piancone said neither has opened yet 
but he said a baskin robbins ice cream parlor opened in the 
lobby of a moscow hotel the ice cream parlor does not accept 
soviet currency which is not readily convertible on currency 
markets 
i think the people in moscow kind of resent that approach 
piancone said

members of the house banking committee today 
criticized regulators use of promissory notes to rescue insolvent 
savings institutions as a shell game designed to push the 
problem into the next administration 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates the nations 
3000 savings institutions has pledged more than 12 billion over 
the last three weeks to rescue or close 48 savings institutions 
including 21 in texas and 14 in oklahoma states hard hit by the 
depression in the oil industry 
however much of the assistance has been in the form of 
interestbearing notes which will obligate the federal savings and 
loan insurance corp to billions of dollars in payments a year for 
the next decade 
the plan seems to be nothing more than a massive shell game in 
which insolvent institutions are reshuffled the names changed and 
little if any real capital injected resulting in thinly 
capitalized weak institutions said rep charles e schumer 
dny 
many of these institutions will ultimately have to be bailed 
out again at even greater cost to the taxpayer he said 
schumer said the bank boards strategy would postpone the day 
on which the bill for this crisis becomes due until long after the 
members of the current administration have left washington and are 
sitting on a beach somewhere 
however bank board chairman m danny wall who is asking 
congress to put the full faith and credit of the us government 
behind the notes said the notes because they are tax free and 
carry a low interest rate are the most effective way to close down 
insolvent thrift institutions that are draining the industrys 
health 
wall said his agency had 101 billion in the notes outstanding 
at the end of august and said by the end of this month it will have 
spent billions more to resolve the cases of 65 more ailing thrifts 
rep fernand j st germain dri chairman of the committee 
was particularly critical of the 2 billion rescue earlier this 
week of american savings and loan association in stockton calif 
the robert m bass group the investment arm of a fort worth 
texas billionaire is spending 550 million and getting 2 billion 
in assistance from fslic to acquire american it is the 
largestever rescue of a single savings institution 
part of the deal allows bass to use 15 billion of americans 
funds for merchant banking activities such as acquisitions of 
commercial companies 
frankly i am concerned when notes are utilized to promote 
risky ventures such as merchant bank subsidiaries st germain 
said warning thatr the industry as a whole can be expected to 
take this as a green light to again reach for the riskier 
operations 
the bass group has been an active player in corporate takeover 
battles in recent years it is currently pushing a 175 billion 
offer for macmillan inc a publishing company previously it has 
participated in buyouts of taft broadcasting co and bell amp howell 
inc 
wall in a letter earlier this week to sen donald w riegle 
dmich who also had questioned the merchant banking activities 
said they are being permitted to allow the bass group to capture 
substantial tax benefits of taking over the ailing sampl 
he noted that 75 percent of the benefits will be funneled back 
to the government fund insuring sampl deposits 
moreover wall said the agreement with bass will impose 
substantial restrictions more stringent than those imposed by 
california state law 
some members of congress fear that the slew of fslic notes 
issued in recent weeks setting up the insurance fund for a bailout 
by taxpayers with some private analysts pegging the cost of 
restoring the industrys health as high as 80 billion 
however the bank board says it expects to receive 42 billion 
in income over the next decade and to spend only 31 billion 
the bank board is also being criticized for agreeing to 
negotiate exclusively with bass since april 21 before that first 
nationwide bank the san franciscobased sampl subsidiary of ford 
motor co had pursued the acquisition of american for 10 months 
its executives were upset about being shut out from making another 
offer for most of this year

cumming made his offer to upampl about two weeks ago according to 
sources close to cumming the utah governors office and upampl the 
newspaper said today upampl has not responded to the offer 
upampl declined to comment on the report 
consistent with utah power and light policy we do not comment 
on rumors said company spokesman dave mead 
cumming reportedly told frank davis upampl president and chief 
executive officer and verl topham senior vice president that his 
offer would keep corporate control within utah and would satisfy 
federal regulators concerns about potential antitrust problems 
an administrative law judge for the federal energy regulatory 
commission in june recommended that the commission reject upampls 
merger with pacificorp on antitrust grounds the commission is 
expected to review the recommendation and issue a final decision 
this month 
seven state regulatory commissions including the utah public 
service commission have approved the merger 
cumming who lives in salt lake city is chairman and a major 
shareholder in leucadia national corp a new yorkbased holding 
company with sales of 320 million in 1986 a woman who answered 
his home telephone identifying herself only as the cleaning lady 
said cumming would be out of town until monday she would not say 
where he could be reached 
a secretary at cummings leucadia national office in new york 
said he would not be in today 
pacificorp is the parent of pacific power amp light co upampl and 
pacificorp have promised to lower rates by 5 percent to 10 percent 
within five years if the merger is approved 
cummings bid which would be subject to approval by state 
regulators is his second offer for upampl 
about a year and a half ago mr cumming hired drexel burnham 
lambert inc to do a price check on what upampl stock was worth 
the tribune quoted one source as saying mr cumming increased 
the price and made the offer to upampl but the offer was rejected 
how cumming would finance his 117 billion bid is unknown the 
newspaper said but in the past he has used leucadia as a vehicle 
for acquisitions 
leucadia has a minority interest in eight publicly owned 
companies including a 236 percent interest in prudential 
financial services corp a salt lake citybased financial 
institution 
leucadia also owns 39 percent of phlcorp inc formerly baldwin 
united corp and 49 percent of brae corp cumming is chairman of 
both companies 
in addition he is chairman of bolivian power co the company 
which is 498percent owned by phlcorp owns the power company that 
supplies bolivias capital la paz

republican members of the senate foreign 
relations committee made clear today that it will be difficult if 
not impossible to build bipartisan support for legislation 
imposing new and stern economic sanctions against whitedominated 
south africa 
and state department officials suggested that any action on the 
measure to institute an almosttotal trade embargo on south africa 
and to pull out most us investment might disrupt delicate ongoing 
negotiations involving independence for namibia and the withdrawal 
of cuban troops from angola 
the committee set a vote for wednesday on the measure as 
statements from individual republican members indicated the 
legislation will not enjoy the wide bipartisan support given the 
milder sanctions bill that became law over president reagans veto 
two years ago 
sen richard lugar rind a key supporter of sanctions 
legislation in 1986 called the present bill untimely and told 
the committee there are occasions when legislation is not always 
helpful 
at this moment to go into a total disruption of our business 
in south africa does not benefit anyone lugar said adding that 
the measure would remove any leverage the united states has to 
bring pressure on south africa to end its apartheid system of 
forced racial separation 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan agreed saying she does not 
believe that comprehensive sanctions will end apartheid 
we simply create havoc she said to strike out alone with 
a package that requires complete disinvestment and a total trade 
embargo does not behoove us at this time 
speaking for the bill sen alan cranston dcalif said it is 
designed to increase the costs of maintaining apartheid 
if we fail to focus on south africa we will in essence allow 
the south african regime to declare victory cranston said 
we have a moral obligation to continue to press for freedom for 
all south africans 
sen jesse helms rnc is reportedly ready to submit up to 40 
amendments designed to dilute the impact of the legislation during 
its examination by the foreign relations panel 
president reagan is considered highly likely to veto new 
sanctions legislation if the senate follows the lead of the house 
and approves a bill blocking most trade with south africa and 
requiring practically a complete withdrawal of us business 
investment 
cranston and sen paul simon dill another backer of the 
harsh sanctions measure said on wednesday they believed the 
measure could be brought to the senate floor for a vote in the 
waning days of this years session despite a tight legislative 
schedule 
but both said it would be difficult to pass the bill in the 
absence of significant republican support they said opponents 
could make it difficult even to get it past the foreign relations 
committee 
even if both of those hurdles were cleared there would not be 
enough support to override a veto they said 
but any action even passage by the committee would send a 
signal to the government of south africa that pressure is rising 
against apartheid simon said 
i know of no other way to send that signal other than 
sanctions he said 
simon said his recent fiveday trip to south africa convinced 
him that it is time for the united states to adopt the most 
punishing economic sanctions to date as a signal to pretoria that 
its apartheid policies of racial repression must be abandoned 
blacks are living in despair and hopelessness and whites are 
living in fear simon told a news conference and the greater 
the fear the more there is repression 
south africa is drifting toward massive violence and the 
community of nations has to signal to south africa that peaceful 
change has got to come about he said 
the house bill passed on aug 11 by a vote of 244132 has 
become a focal point of electionyear politics many democrats 
would like to force the issue in order to portray republicans who 
oppose it as weak on civil and human rights 
opponents contend stronger sanctions would impose further 
economic hardship on black south africans and strengthen the 
governments resolve to resist pressure for change from outside 
a more limited sanctions measure was enacted two years ago over 
reagans veto an action made possible only with significant gop 
support in both chambers

attorneys for billionaire ross perot and the 
us postal service have told a federal appeals court that congress 
never intended postal contracts to be subject to government 
competitive bidding rules 
but perots former company which is challenging the attempt by 
perot and the postal service to do business together disputed the 
claim in arguments wednesday before a threejudge federal panel 
reviewing the case 
electronic data systems corp which perot sold to general 
motors corp in 1986 is challenging a contract between the postal 
service and perot and his new company perot systems corp 
perot systems corp won the contract without competitive bids or 
notice to other companies that such a venture was envisioned 
the contract involves perot studying the postal service and 
recommending efficiency steps and then sharing the savings realized 
from his ideas it is perots first attempt to compete directly 
with his former company 
this is an area where congress has spoken often about the need 
for competition eds attorney richard schecter told the judges 
eds initially lodged a protest with the federal board of 
contract appeals and contended that the potentially lucrative 
contract awarded to perot conflicted with bidding rules the 
appeals board voided the contract in august 
the federal appeals court could reinstate the contract 
two federal statutes were at the center of the arguments 
wednesday one requires most government agencies to solicit 
competitive bids on purchases involving computers and data 
processing and another created the postal service in 1970 as a 
quasiprivate agency 
in creating the postal service congress freed it from federal 
rules and regulations unless specified by law 
postal service attorney helene goldberg said the board of 
contract appeals does not have jurisdiction over the postal service 
and therefore lacks the authority to invalidate the perot contract 
clifton elgarten representing perot systems said congress 
intent in creating the service was to free the postal service 
from the constraints binding its predecessor

the european economic communitys 
external trade commissioner warned japan thursday to help reduce 
trade imbalances as the eec becomes a more important market for 
japan 
willie de clercq in a speech delivered to a journalists 
conference in berlin and distributed in brussels said the unified 
european market may have to adopt rules to protect some industries 
from excessive imports 
however de clercq brushed aside fears that the eec would become 
more protectionist as it moves to set up a single internal market 
by 1992 as totally unjustified 
the trade commissioner predicted that japans surplus with the 
eec will increase in the second half of 1988 even though it 
slipped during the first half of the year 
de clercq who makes such warnings to japan on a regular basis 
repeated calls for japan to increase imports and to give the eec 
greater access to its markets 
he said the issue was becoming more important as the eec becomes 
a more important trading partner for japan 
the eec is now the big profitable open market for japan 
he said 
he noted that the creation of a single market will create 
unified eec rules on trade and this will benefit foreign companies 
resident in the eec 
he warned at the same time that restrictions at the eec level 
may be set up in certain sensitive sectors to replace various 
national restrictions which currently exist to protect some 
industries 
such community measures would of course be discussed with 
our trading partners and would have to conform fully with our 
international obligations he said 
japans trade surplus with the 12nation trade bloc rose in july 
to 258 billion yen up 14 percent from the yearearlier period 
according to figures distributed thursday by the eec commission 
calculated in dollars the surplus rose in july by 285 percent 
to 19 billion but fell 32 percent in the first seven months of 
1988 compared with the yearearlier period 
the statistics showed japanese imports from the eec rose 162 
percent in yen terms and by 307 percent in dollar terms in the 
month of july nonferrous metals aircraft and textiles showed the 
sharpest growth 
meanwhile japanese exports to the eec rose 151 percent in yen 
terms and 296 percent in dollar terms due primarily to increases 
in exports of automobiles office machinery and audiovisual 
equipment

a theme underlying the governments 
unprecedented civil enforcement action against drexel burnham 
lambert inc is that the investment firm used convicted insider 
trader ivan f boesky as a stooge for cheating and illegal 
profiteering 
but some securities lawyers find that idea flawed 
more likely they say is that boesky and drexel had a mutually 
beneficial relationship assuming the accusations leveled by the 
securities and exchange commission are accurate 
frankly im very skeptical that drexel was the manipulator 
behind the scenes of ivan boesky said sam scott miller a 
partner in the new york law firm of orrick herrington amp sutcliffe 
and a member of the securities industry associations trading 
practices committee 
its true in the securities market generally that people work 
together in all kinds of ways transactions are seldom isolated to 
one participant he said so its possible that boesky could be 
an agent technically for some purpose in dealing with drexel but 
id say the converse is equally likely that fact doesnt lead me 
to conclude drexel was a puppeteer in this role 
the secs mammoth enforcement action undertaken wednesday after 
an investigation that lasted ne other controversial house amendments would 
deny student loans 
and other federal benefits to convicted drug users admit illegally 
seized evidence in court if police acted in good faith during a 
search and withhold federal highway money from states that refuse 
to revoke or suspend drivers licenses of convicted drug users 
as the house conducted a generally mildmannered debate on the 
375page bill wednesday policementurnedlobbyists roamed through 
lawmakers offices to present their views on a sevenday waiting 
period for handgun purchasers 
they were not all on the same side in debating this provision of 
the drug bill which includes an optional background check on the 
purchaser during the weeklong delay 
rankandfile officers supporting the waiting period are part of 
a coalition of law enforcement organizations and gun control 
groups the coalition has set up shop in a house judiciary 
committee basement hearing room in the rayburn office building 
across the street from the capitol 
other policemen are lobbying for the national rifle association 
which opposes the waiting period and virtually any form of gun 
control that affects the general population 
rep bill mccollum rfla will try to eliminate the waiting 
period his amendment would substitute an identification system 
that would allow gun dealers to check by telephone or other means 
to determine whether a purchaser is a convicted felon 
the gekas proposal on the death penalty would permit but not 
require a judge to impose the death sentence on anyone convicted 
of intentionally killing someone during a drug felony 
if the death penalty was not imposed the amendment would 
require a sentence of 20 years to life 
the senate legislation that passed last june would permit the 
death penalty for narcotics dealers convicted of murder in drug 
crimes and for drug kingpins defined under law as those who 
supervise five or more people commit at least three federal drug 
felonies and derive substantial income from a continuing criminal 
enterprise 
the only brief moment of emotion during the opening debate 
wednesday came when rep charles b rangel dny urged the house 
not to stoop as low as those killers in the street by approving 
the death penalty he said it would be beneath the dignity of 
this house to approve the gekas language 
but mccollum rose to gekas defense calling the death penalty 
the missing deterrence in the fight against illegal drugs 
most federal death penalty provisions are not enforceable 
because unlike some state laws they were never brought into 
compliance with supreme court guidelines on capital punishment 
the overall antidrug bill provides for money and programs that 
would attack drug use from every conceivable direction 
the legislation would increase spending for federal and state 
law enforcement agencies to intercept illegal drugs on land in the 
air and on the seas 
banking laws would be changed to try to stop the laundering of 
drug money at legitimate financial institutions education programs 
would be expanded for youth including disadvantaged youngsters and 
the most hardened gang members capacity would be increased and 
waiting periods lessened for entry into drug rehabilitation 
programs 
the bill encourages latin american countries to form a regional 
antinarcotics force and pledges financial support if one is 
started 
federal contractors would be required to maintain a drugfree 
workplace tight controls would be placed on the usmade 
chemicals that are used to manufacture heroin cocaine and other 
drugs 
states also would be given money to develop programs to stop the 
spread of aids by intravenous drug abusers

in addition westinghouse has agreed to work for an 
improvement in the quality of life in the surrounding communities 
and to use the university structure in the state to assist in 
research and development at the savannah river plant thurmond 
said 
rep butler derrick dsc whose district includes the giant 
plant near aiken sc and the georgia border said he was 
tremendously impressed with westinghouse officials during 
meetings prior to the awarding of the contract 
there is no doubt in my mind about their commitment to the 
safe operation of srp and their ability to ensure that local 
citizens and the environment are not harmed by srp operations 
derrick said 
energy secretary john herrington last month recommended the 
savannah river plant as the site for construction of a new 
stateoftheart nuclear reactor to produce all the tritium 
needed for the nations nuclear weapons program he also 
recommended constructon of a smaller nuclear reactor to produce 
weapons materials in idaho 
the new reactors eventually would replace three aging reactors 
at srp and one at the hanford nuclear reservation in washington 
state the three srp reactors all currently are shut down for 
maintenance or safety reasons and the hanford reactor was placed 
on cold standby earlier this year 
westinghouse has submitted a proposal to doe to design and build 
the new production reactor at srp but ms sankey the doe 
spokeswoman said the award of a contract for that project probably 
wont occur before next spring at the earliest

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended aug 29 the 
federal reserve board reported thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 fell to a seasonally 
adjusted 30336 billion in the week ended aug 29 from 30341 
billion the previous week 
an even broader measure m3 increased to a seasonally adjusted 
38491 billion from 38462 billion

seasonally adjusted 7826 billion from a revised 7835 billion

and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for 
annual growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent 
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 55 percent to 85 
percent the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 since

about 6000 jobs in two years from its network operations group and 
expects to reduce employment elsewhere in the company as well a 
spokesman said thursday 
the cuts in the network operations group which runs the 
longdistance network will amount to about 8 percent of the units 
74000 employees spokesman burke stinson said 
he said the total cuts could exceed 6000 the company will try 
to achieve as many of the cuts as possible through voluntary 
retirements resignations and reassignments to other parts of the 
company but will not rule out layoffs stinson said 
virtually every organization in atampt has the marching orders 
to reduce the number of nonsalesrelated jobs this is the most 
specific and is the earliest he said 
atampts total employment has risen by about 12000 this year to 
about 315000 after having dropped steadily since the 1984 
divestiture of the local operating companies the increase has 
alarmed chairman robert e allen who announced in july the first 
companywide hiring freeze since the bell system breakup 
some of the people being cut from network operations will be 
among the 3000 people whom atampt is reassigning from staff jobs in 
various parts of the company to jobs in sales marketing and 
customer support stinson said 
network operations does not include operators most of the jobs 
are for supervisors and managers of the longdistance network and

thousands of chicago commuters were spared a 
morning rushhour nightmare when the chicago amp north western 
railway and one of its unions agreed thurssday to delay a likely 
strike 
both sides agree that this is a step that is in the best 
interest of commuters 41000 of whom use campnw commuter trains 
serving the chicago area said david carle a spokesman for us 
sen paul simon dill 
the 2600 members of the united transportation union at the 
railroad had planned to walk off their jobs at 1201 am cdt 
friday when a 36day coolingoff period ends and the chicago amp 
north western transportation co had planned to lay off 1150 of 
the 2300 union brakemen in its 10state freight operation 
the senate late thursday gave unanimous approval to simons bill 
implementing recommendations of a presidential emergency board 
which in july called for trimming 689 brakemen 
president reagan appointed the panel in april to study the labor 
dispute and seek a solution 
simon predicted the measure would sail through the house on 
friday and win quick approval from reagan he said the bill could 
be passed by late morning and signed an hour or so later by the 
president 
under the railway labor act congress and the president have 
specific authority to settle railroad disputes that threaten 
national commerce 
the railroad and the union have been battling for more than a 
year over the size of train crews on campnw freight trains 
the company contends the brakemens jobs are obsolete and that 
trains can be run with a two or threeman crew an engineer a 
conductor and in some cases a fireman 
the union contends the brakemen two on each trains crew are 
necessary to maintain railroad safety 
the two sides have failed to reach a compromise and earlier this 
week had implemented strike plans 
don markgraf utu general chairman said he opposes federal 
intervention but that the union would honor the settlement if it 
is approved by congress 
the railroad expects congress to push through the legislation 
said campnw spokesman james foote but he noted that management 
personnel had been deployed throughout the freight system and about 
8000 replacement workers had been recalled 
campnw commuters also were bracing for a walkout the third 
threatened this year 
the utu struck campnw for about four hours aug 4 after an 
earlier coolingoff period imposed by president reagan during that 
period the special presidential board proposed a compromise to end 
the impasse 
both sides then rejected the proposal the one now going before 
congress setting the stage for the august strike 
congress however ended that strike quickly by imposing a 
second coolingoff period

utah financier ian cumming has made a 12 
billion cash bid for a majority interest in utah power amp light co 
an offer that is about 600 million less than one made a year ago 
by oregonbased pacificorp and accepted by upampl 
upampl spokesman dave mead said the privately held utility which 
is in the process of trying to gain regulatory approval for a 
merger with pacificorp has not responded to cummings offer he 
said the company had no further comment 
cumming who lives in salt lake and is chairman of leucadia 
national corp a new yorkbased holding company with sales of 320 
million in 1986 could not be reached for comment thursday a woman 
who answered the phone at cummings home said he was not expected 
home until monday 
his new york office referred calls to a salt lake attorney 
stephen d swindle 
swindle said cumming made the offer through a letter to upampl 
directors in june the lawyer confirmed the bid is a cash offer of 
30 per share for at least 67 percent of upampl stock totaling 12 
billion swindle said it would be premature to discuss how the 
acquisition would be financed 
upampl stock closed at 3012 a share in new york stock exchange 
trading thursday up 25 cents 
cumming and leucadia have expressed concern that a merger with 
pacificorp would not be in the best interest of the state or 
upampls customers and shareholders swindle said 
upampl has historically played an important role in the state 
and should remain a freestanding company based in salt lake city 
and not part of a regional power company swindle said 
under terms of the pacificorp merger upampl would become a 
division of pacificorp and be part of an 8 billion system serving 
seven western states 
utility commissions in all those states including utah have 
approved the merger but it has since been stalled at the federal 
energy regulatory commission in washington dc a ferc 
administrative law judge has recommended the commission deny the 
merger because of possible anticompetitive impact 
the ferc is expected to make its final ruling later this month 
in portland ore pacificorp spokeswoman dolores chenoweth said 
the report of the cumming offer caught her by surprise but that it 
should have no effect on the merger 
we have an agreement with upampl and that merger agreement is 
in force said chenoweth we fully expect to receive approval 
from the federal energy regulatory commission to go ahead with 
the merger 
chenoweth pointed out that the pacificcorpupampl merger has 
already been voted on and agreed to by shareholders of both 
companies and approved by regulatory agencies in seven states 
so theres no reaction for us to make were just going 
ahead she said 
despite the delay at ferc state regulators and industry 
analysts expressed skepticism about leucadias offer 
the consideration is that the leucadia offer is lower than 
what pacificorp will offer said utilities analyst greg enholm 
with salomon brothers inc in new york pacificorps minimum offer 
under its stock swap agreement is for 3250 per share 
the major consideration is that upampl is not in good financial 
shape and the merger could solve those problems he said 
leucadia is a holding company with banking real estate and life 
insurance subsidiaries local holdings include leucadia financial 
corp formerly terracor american investment bank american 
investment thrift american investment financial and minority 
ownership in prudential financial services corp
